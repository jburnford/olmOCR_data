These accounts were paid by the school with money advanced by the Reverend Oblate Fathers and not by the Department so that the school might be able, in time, to reimburse them, but as it was impossible to do so, Reverend Father Lavigne has asked me to place the matter before you once more for further attention by the Department.\n\nIt is not my intention in this letter to go over the history of the increase in size of this school, as I do not see that any good purpose would be served by it.\n\nMay I say in the first place that we were asked by the Department to use the new wing for dormitory purposes only. You might in this regard consult your letter of September 11th, 1941, file 129-1-5.\n\nSecondly, the Kenora School is the property of the Indian Affairs Branch and not of the Oblate Fathers. It is used for the education of Indian children who are the wards of the Government and whose education is a duty which the Oblate Fathers are performing in the name of the Indian Affairs Branch and not as a personal obligation.\nSt. Mary's Indian Residential School\nKenora Ont.

Turcotte applied his brakes which cause\nhis truck to skid on icy road surface and swerve into Taillieu's\ntruck, damaging left door, running board, gas spout and left\nrear fender to the approx... extent of $100.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nChief Constable,\nJ. PILE.\n\nJl 13/47\nFeb. 11th, 1947.\n\nThe Minister of Mines & Natural Resources,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn the morning of January 8, 1947 at about 10:30 a.m., an automobile owned by St. Mary's Indian School and operated by Henry Turcotte collided with an International Truck operated by Mr. Taillieu, doing considerable damage to the latter.\n\nOn investigation of the accident, it was determined that the collision was caused by a failure to observe the proper rules for proceeding in the opposite direction on the road. Mr. Turcotte appeared to have assumed he had control of his vehicle and struck the left hand side of the truck causing damage to the extent of approximately $500.00.\n\nI obtained a report from Chief Constable J. Ride, Toronto, and I am attaching hereto a copy for your information. From the report that was furnished by the Chief of Police it could be seen that the entire blame for responsibility for the accident rests with Mr. Turcotte.\n\nI have had some little correspondence with Rev. P. Lacelle of St. Mary's Indian School pertaining to the accident and it was not until his letter of February 10th arrived, indicating that the school was a Dominion Government Institution, that I realized that it would be necessary for us to get in touch with you regarding this matter.\nMin. of Mines\n\n2-11-47\n\nan opportunity to complete your investigation, we would be very pleased to hear from you regarding the matter.\n\nAs previously indicated, it appears that the entire onus of responsibility rests with the driver of the truck belonging to the School and we therefore make our demand for damages in the amount of $105.30. We will be very pleased to arrange with Mr. Taillieu to furnish you with a Release contingent on payment of this amount.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.M.

Perreault\nPrincipal\nKenora, Ontario,\nApril 15th, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept' of Mines & Resources\n\nRe: Fire Protection at the Residential Schools Kenora Indian Agency.\n\nAttached hereto, please find a report covering the above noted subject.\n\nThe report embodies several recommendations for the replacement and remodelling of the fire equipment at the Kenora R.C.I.R. School and Cecilia Jeffrey I.R. School.\n\nIn connection with the recommendation that all exit doors leading to the fire escapes in these two schools be fitted with Push Type Doors with Hazard Hardware, this is of sufficient importance, that I would respectfully suggest, that you request Mr. Williams calling in to thoroughly check over both schools, so that expert advice may be given, as to the necessity and also as to the method to be adopted, in installing this type of exit door.\n\nThe replacement of these several doors, will cost including material, labour and installation, in the neighborhood of $75.00 or $80.00, which could be installed by any local contractor.\n\nThe installation of a more efficient alarm system at the schools, could also be checked over by an engineer, as I believe this of some importance.\n\nThe several changes to the fire hose couplings and connections, the installing of another Valve and hose connection on the stand pipe in the main hallway and the reed filling of Fire Extinguishers is now being done, as this is of immediate importance. A local pipe fitter is at present on the job, and I trust this action will meet with your approval.\n\nAlso attached hereto, are requisitions covering much needed new hose and equipment, especially at the Kenora R.C. School.\n\nYour comments and advice would be much appreciated.\n\nNorman Soliver,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT\n\non Fire Protection at the Residential Schools in the Kenora Indian Agency.\n\nSeveral visits have been made to the Residential Schools, in the Kenora Agency, fire drills held and inspections made of all fire equipment, exits, and escapes.\n\nOn these visits I was accompanied by Chief Reg. Davies of the Kenora Fire Department, who kindly gave of his time, in the interest of safety and the furtherance of efficient fire protection in and around the community.\n\nAfter checking over the equipment, exits and fire escapes, certain recommendations were made, for the repair and remodelling of the present equipment. These recommendations are submitted for your information and action and are as follows:\n\nKenora R.C.I.R. School.\n\nThat all exits to the fire escapes be altered and remodelled. Present exits are through hinged windows which either open in or out. These are fastened with hooks and eyes or by hasps. This does not allow of a safe or quick exit. There are THREE such exit doors and it is recommended that these be replaced with new doors of the push type, fitted with hazard hardware.\n\nAt several escapes, it is necessary to climb through the window or exit to get to the landing on the escape. It is recommended that steps be installed at the foot of these windows.\n\nThe exit from the 2nd floor, to North escape, is through a hallway leading to a room which is occupied by one of the staff, then through a window, to the escape. This is not a good set-up and does not allow for a quick exit from the school. It is recommended that this room be vacated and free access given to the fire escape.\n\nThe present balanced fire escape at the north end of school should be made permanent, with a step or platform built at the bottom of escape.\n\nA fire door should be installed in the doorway, leading from the school laundry to hallway on main floor.\n\nFire Alarms and warning or directional lights should be placed at most efficient position in building. At present a small triangle gong is used for an alarm. It is recommended that an electrician install either one large electric alarm or Boomer, or several smaller alarms, one in each hallway, also small alarms in the dormitories and laundry.\n\nGuide or warning lights should be placed near entrance to each fire escape.\n\nFire hose & Fittings etc. The old 1\u00bd\" linen fire hose should be replaced. Male hose couplings to be welded to nipples from the valves on stand pipes. The present flat hose racks to be attached to the stand pipes with clamps, instead of being on wall brackets. It is also recommended that two lengths of 1\u00bd\" hose be placed in the racks, as only one length is in position at present. This will allow of a 100 foot run in the building.\n\nA new hose connection should be installed on stand pipe in main hallway. This will require a new valve and nipple.\n\nFire extinguishers to be refilled and checked at regular intervals by the school engineer and placed in permanent positions in building.\nCecilia Jeffrey I.R. School.\n\nIt is recommended that all exits to fire escapes be remodelled. The exits at present are through hinged windows, opening outside and fitted with hooks and eyes or hasps. This arrangement does not allow for a quick exit and therefore should be replaced with new exit doors, push type, fitted with hazard hardware.\n\nThere are no direct exits from the dormitories in this school, and it is recommended that at some future time, provision will be made for the installation of a spiral or slide type of escape, to provide for the safe and orderly exit of the pupils and staff at the school.\n\nThe electric alarm system is fair, but could be made more efficient by having larger electric alarms placed on each floor, also placing smaller alarms in the residence, all the dormitories, furnace room, and hallway to laundry.\n\nGuide or warning lights should be placed near entrance to all fire escapes.\n\nAn extra 50 foot length of 1\u00bd\" standard linen fire hose should be placed in all hose racks.\n\nFire extinguishers to be refilled and checked at regular intervals by the school engineer and placed in permanent positions in building.\n\nKenora Indian Agency\nApril 15th, 1947.\n\nIndian Agent:\nOttawa, May 13th, 1947.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 15th ultimo with reference to additional fire protection at the Kenora Residential School.\n\nWith reference to the fire hose, we are prepared to order this but our Purchasing Branch requires one of the couplings so that they may be certain to secure the same size of hose as is used at present.\n\nThe Surveys and Engineering Branch is extremely busy this year and as a consequence it is doubtful that we could arrange to have one of their officials visit this school.\n\nHowever, it is suggested that you arrange for the installation of the push type doors on the exit doors leading to the fire escapes. It is noted that these can be installed by one of the local contractors.\n\nBernard J. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Furniture for Kenora R.C. School\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI am enclosing an invoice from Moyer School Supplies Limited for furniture already authorized.

He would like, among other things, a manure carrier, individual drinking cups and repairs to the sewage system. He has not sent an estimate of cost of these various items but your agent could easily be contacted for that purpose. These improvements are all the more necessary as the barn is being fully disinfected.\n\nThanking you in anticipation I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, July 2nd, 1947.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nWe are in receipt of a letter requesting the Department to supply the following in order to modernize the barn at the Kenora Residential School:\n\n(a) Manure Carrier\n(b) Individual drinking trough\n(c) Repairs to sewage system.\n\nPlease consult the principal and obtain more definite information regarding what he considers necessary in the above regard. At the same time we would like to have an estimate of the cost.\n\nYou should point out to the principal that an amount of $1,500 was provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at this school during the current fiscal year; we have already issued a purchase order for $256.60 for new mattresses and another purchase order for $268.08 for fire hose.\n\nIn addition, we have under consideration your letter of June 13th recommending an expenditure of $675 for repairs to the floor, walls and foundation of the laundry. The items mentioned amount to slightly over $1,200.\n\nIn official letter of June 12th, you were authorized to purchase ten milking cows.\nfor this school. As yet we do not know what these will cost.\n\nYou will note from the above that the amount specifically provided in the current year's appropriation would be considerably exceeded when payment has been made for the items mentioned. It is, therefore, very doubtful that we can find funds this year for the equipment required to modernize the barn. However, as stated above, we would like to have definite information and an estimate of the cost. When this is received the matter will have further consideration.\n\nBernard J.

School.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nReverend Fr. Perreault, principal of the above school would very much appreciate an electric frigidaire for his school. There is at the present time a one-compartment frigidaire which could be used for meat and butter but which cannot be used for kitchen left-overs, fruit, desserts and other cooking necessities.\n\nYour agent might be written to about this frigidaire and along with the principal, he might be able to advise as to its size. Personally I believe that the largest unit in home frigidaires might solve the problem and I think the sooner it is supplied to the school the better it will be.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Indian Residential School.\n\nA copy of a letter from Rev. Father A. Lacelle, O.M.I., Assistant Principal of the school was attached to Voucher 94, which explained the necessity for immediate replacement of old smoke stack with a new one.\n\nWhen this letter was received from Father Lacelle, I proceeded to the school to inquire why this work had been done without discussing the matter with the Agent. I also inspected the new smoke stack. I had intended asking Father Lacelle to send the invoice direct to the Department but relented and forwarded the same through this office with a copy of the Reverend Father's explanatory letter. I regret that a more detailed explanation from the writer was not submitted. The schools do not seem to realize the necessity of contacting the Agent on all matters pertaining to expenditures and it would be much appreciated if you would bring this to their attention.\n\nNorman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency\nHonora Residential School,\nHonora Ont.\n\nFebruary 12\n\nMr. Honora Intercom,\nIndian Agent,\nHonora Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing triplicate copies of bill covering installation of new smoke pipe on boiler. We have been obliged to change the whole as they were far more deteriorated than had first been anticipated during the yearly inspection of the boiler, it is so wet.\n\nWe have been obliged to replace same in a hurry on account of the hazardous results it created when obliged to cope with severe weather.\n\nAs this replacement was included in the list of application for this year's amendments we trust it will meet with your recommendation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nHonora Intercom,\nHonora Ont.,\nAssistant\nOttawa, March 13, 1945.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Kenora, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 8th instant, file 103-12 (129) with reference to voucher #94. It is noted that the following statement is made in the assistant principal's letter:\n\n\"As this replacement was included in the list of application for this year's expenditures, we trust it will meet with your recommendation.\"\n\nPlease point out to the management of the Kenora Residential School that the mere inclusion of an item in their annual estimates does not mean that the Department was able to secure the funds necessary. Consequently, no school principal has the authority to incur expenditure for which the Department is expected to pay without first receiving our authority.\n\nWe also desire that requests for expenditure of money at a residential school should be forwarded through your office so that we can have your recommendation in the matter.\n\nWhat is said in this letter regarding the Kenora Residential School applies also to the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School.\n\nBernard F.

This firm was unable to purchase the required hardware at that time and it has only lately been able to do so. They have proceeded to make the new doors in their shop and expect to receive the push type hardware in April.\n\nAlterations to the landing on one firescape must also be made and the contractor expects to complete this early in April.\n\nAs this work will not be completed in the present fiscal year, may authority be granted for the expenditure involved during the Estimate year of 1948-49.\n\nNorman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency\nOttawa, March 20, 1948.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Kenora, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 16th instant,\nfile 108-12 (129), in which you advise that certain\nalterations authorized in official letter of May\n13th, 1947, cannot be carried out until after\nApril 1st, 1948.\n\nThe expenditure authorized in our letter of\nMay 13th, 1947 is approved for the next fiscal year.\n\nBernard F.

Perreault, Principal of the school has asked for quotations from Williams Hardware Co. covering a new motor, materials and installation. During the interval of time between getting quotations and providing other needed parts, a motor became available and Williams Hardware installed it on the wash room unit.\n\nOn March 3rd, Williams submitted an invoice covering this entire job, along with quotations to the Reverend Principal.

The Shop, warehouse, boat house and porches being already white will be given two coats only.\n\nAudels carpenter and builder's Guide state an average of 55 sq. ft. per hour for three coats (Page 794 Vol 2) on new wood work.\n\nTaking an average for all buildings at three coats this would come to approximately $200.00 and would take an average painter about one month. Locally I am told that the barn alone should costs $150.00 but this was not very accurate I am afraid.\n\nTrusting that these information will prove satisfactory.\n\nI remain,\n\n(sgd) C.

Provision for turning the hopper in any one of several positions, adds to the flexibility of these units.\n\n(Line Drawing of the Machine on Reverse Side)\nMODEL 6015 PEELER\n\nSpecifications\n\nMOTOR\u2014Hobart-built, 1/4 H.P., ball and sleeve bearing, drip-proof, ventilated. Single phase motors are of the repulsion-start, induction type. Tumbler switch in drip proof enclosure furnished as standard equipment.\n\nDISC DRIVE\u2014The abrasive disc is driven by a steel worm, bronze gear reduction, and enclosed in a grease filled case.\n\nABRASIVE DISC\u2014The abrasive disc is 13\" in diameter, with the abrasive cast directly into the iron. Disc can be quickly removed for cleaning or replacing by raising Hopper Cover and lifting out.\n\nHOPPER\u2014The hopper is of one cast iron piece and is removable. The inside of the hopper is ribbed vertically to insure uniform peeling of all sizes.\n\nCAPACITY\u201415 lbs. of Potatoes in from one to three minutes peeling time.\n\nFINISH\u2014This machine is finished in Hobart Gray, attractively striped.\n\nPEEL TRAP\u2014(Extra) The Peel Trap is so designed that in addition to functioning as a strainer to remove the peelings from the discharge water, it also allows the sand and dirt to settle to the bottom of the container. Where standard peel trap does not lend itself to installation conditions, a commercial colander or sink strainer may be substituted.\n\nSMALL BUT MIGHTY\n\nWith the installation of a Hobart Peeler, definite savings are assured. Work requiring hours by hand methods, can be done in a matter of minutes, with a Hobart Peeler\u2014resulting in a substantial saving in labor.\n\nThe saving in potatoes naturally varies with the grade. Under average conditions a Hobart will reduce the peeling loss by 12 to 14% or more. With this equipment it is possible to economically use smaller potatoes which usually cost less than the larger sizes.\n\nHobart Peelers are designed to peel potatoes and other root vegetables with minimum peel loss, and are ruggedly constructed to insure continuous and satisfactory performance under the most severe use.\n\nThe Model 6015 is built to the same exacting standards established for the entire line of Hobart Peelers. It includes a specially built motor, worm gear drive with sealed in lubrication for all of the driven bearings.\n\nThis Bench Type Peeler can be placed on a bench or drain board... is portable and can be pushed back out of the way, when not in use. The Floor Pedestal type is Model 6015-P.

The Peel Trap is so designed that in addition to functioning as a strainer to remove the peelings from the discharged water it also allows the sand and dirt to settle to the bottom of the container. The trap bears such a relationship to the Peeler that six hoppers full of potatoes can be peeled before it is necessary to empty strainer bucket.\n\nHIGH POINTS\n\n1.

No. 6 washer, with a cylinder 36 inches in diameter and 54 inches long, is a single compartment washer with a maximum capacity of 150 pounds, dry weight. No. 7 washer has a two compartment cylinder, 36 inches by 72 inches, and a dry weight capacity of 200 pounds. The average washing cycle, including two hot suds and several rinses, requires one hour.\n\nMONEL OR BRASS CYLINDER\n\nNo. 6 washers can be supplied with inside cylinder of Monel or brass. The Monel washer has a cylinder of 18 gauge Monel, with an outer casing, or shell, of 14 gauge Monel. The brass cylinder machine has a cylinder of 14 gauge hard brass, nickel plated and highly polished, and an outer casing of 12 gauge galvanized iron. No. 7 washers are available with casing and cylinder of Monel only.\nREVERSING MOTOR SIMPLIFIES OPERATION\n\nAlternating revolutions of the cylinder are controlled by a ball bearing, high reactance reversing motor, which, eliminating the header and header belts, simplifies operation and reduces service. The motor driven timer insures uniform cylinder revolutions, six in one direction, then reversing for six revolutions. Controller and timer are enclosed in a steel cabinet mounted beside the motor.\n\nDOUBLE END DRIVE INCREASES POWER AND REDUCES STRAIN\n\nA counter shaft runs the length of the machine at the rear. At either end three V-belts connect countershaft and main cylinder drive pulleys, equalizing the drive power on either end of the cylinder, and reducing the strain on cylinder, trunions and end bearings. All belts and pulleys are completely enclosed for safety.\n\nThe push button station for inching the cylinder and controlling the machine is located conveniently on the end casting, and provides for the following controls: \"Start\", \"Stop\", \"Inch Up\", \"Inch Down\", and \"Safety\". The motor is mounted on an adjustable plate, and three V-belts connect motor and countershaft. The adjustable motor mounting simplifies correction of belt tension, if necessary.\nTHE CYLINDERS are sturdily constructed and smoothly engineered for complete satisfaction and to minimize wear on linens. The cylinder heads are of cast iron, treated with corrosion resisting coating, and lined with Monel or nickelled brass. Heads are accurately machined to accept the cylinder sheets.\n\nCYLINDER SHEETS of Monel or nickelled brass are perforated, with 11/32 inch perforations, embossed on the outside and perfectly smooth on the inside. On the No. 7 washer the two compartments are separated by a sturdy spider double-faced with Monel.\n\nSIX LIFTING RIBS running the full length of the cylinder assure positive water action and high cleansing qualities. There are three high ribs and three low ribs, the high ribs being of six inch depth. They are die formed and rivetted to the cylinder sheets.\n\nCYLINDER TRUNIONS are of cast steel, 21/2 inches in diameter, of detachable type, and accurately machined to run true with the cylinder.\n\nCLEARANCE between cylinder and casing is 1 1/4 inches. A hinged bridging apron spans the space between cylinder and casing.\n\nTHE CYLINDER DOOR is hinged, and reinforced, with a reinforced round rib enclosing external door latches, which are wedge-type and spring actuated. No part of the latch is exposed inside the cylinder.\n\nTHE SHELL DOOR slides in a slotted groove, and carries a conveniently located soap box.\n\nSHELL HEADS are of cast iron, coated with a rust resistant to prevent corrosion and staining of the linens.\n\nEND CASTINGS and legs of solid cast iron assure rigidity and sturdiness.\nCYLINDER MOUNTING\n\nThis drawing illustrates the construction of the cylinder mounting used on both ends of the cylinder. It shows the steel shaft and large ball bearings that carry the load and reduce the power required to operate the machine. It also illustrates the packing that protects the bearings from water and also prevents water from leaking out of the machine, or oil getting into the water from the bearings.\n\nWATER AND STEAM CONNECTIONS\n\nA 3\u00bd-inch water inlet is located at the back of the machine, and a steam inlet at the base of the shell. A six inch dump valve, foot actuated, empties the machine quickly and thoroughly. A thermometer and water gauge are conveniently located at the left end.\n\nMODEL SPECIFICATIONS\n\n| Model | Cylinder (inches) | Maximum* Capacity (dry wt.) | Outside Shell | Cylinder | Motor Countershaft H.P. | Floor Space (inches) | Shipping Weight (approx.) |\n|-------|------------------|-----------------------------|---------------|----------|------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|\n| 6 B   | 36 x 54          | 150 lbs.                    | galv. iron    | nickeled brass | \u2014 | 18\" | 128 | 45 x 92 | 2500 lbs. |\n| 6 BE  | 36 x 54          | 150 \"                        | \"             | \"         | \u2014 | 18\" | 128 | 45 x 92 | 2500 \" |\n| 6 M   | 36 x 54          | 150 \"                        | Monel         | Monel     | \u2014 | 18\" | 128 | 45 x 92 | 2500 \" |\n| 6 ME  | 36 x 54          | 150 \"                        | \"             | \"         | \u2014 | 18\" | 128 | 45 x 92 | 2500 \" |\n| 7 M   | 36 x 72          | 200 \"                        | \"             | \"         | \u2014 | 18\" | 128 | 45 x 110 | 2925 \" |\n| 7 ME  | 36 x 72          | 200 \"                        | \"             | \"         | \u2014 | 18\" | 128 | 45 x 110 | 3025 \" |\n\n* For best results washers should not be loaded to more than 80% of maximum dry weight capacity.\nJ.

Definite steps should be taken to install a dishwashing set-up since there are no sinks here.\n\nYour dietician also remarked that vegetables were not served as often as they should for balanced meals. As you may know, this comes from the fact that they have no farm and hardly sufficient ground for the cultivation of a regular garden.\n\nThe increase in the per capita for Fort Frances, Kenora and MacIntosh is in my estimation much smaller than it should be. For instance, such schools as Sturgeon Lake, Fort Vermillion, Wabasca, Grouard, Beauval and Cross Lake received an increase which in some cases amounts to $35.00 per child more than this small Ontario group of Schools. Still all have good farms where sufficient fodder, grain and vegetables are produced to enable the Principals to feed their herds and supply all the children of the schools with vegetables of various kinds in large quantities.\n\nI hope, therefore, that you will be able to place Kenora, MacIntosh and Fort Frances in a category which may enable them to supply the varied foods asked by your dietician. You will admit that it is not very pleasant to be reproved for not giving our Indian Children meals that are considered inadequate for their health and welfare.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Indian Residential School, Kenora, Ontario, there is a recommendation that a proper dish washing set-up be installed.\n\nWe would appreciate it if you would let us have the plan suggested by your Division so that we can arrange for its installation. Could you give us any idea of the probable cost of this installation?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nOctober 27, 1948.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nLaurier Avenue East,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant regarding the Nutrition Division report on the Kenora Residential School, we are obtaining the plan of the new dishwashing setup recommendation by the Nutrition Division. When we receive this, we will give the matter further attention.\n\nA purchase order for a new potato peeler has been forwarded to the Hobart Manufacturing Company and they promise delivery within four to six weeks.\n\nWe are writing the Agency Superintendent regarding paragraphs 3 and 4 of your letter. The items 5, 6, 7 and 8 will have to remain in abeyance for the present. The contents of the last three paragraphs of your letter have been noted.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard T. Healy\nSuperintendent of Education.\nEQUIPMENT AND METHOD FOR HAND DISHWASHING\n\nNutrition Division,\nDepartment of National Health and Welfare, Ottawa.\n\nEQUIPMENT:\n\nProper dishwashing equipment and methods of operation are essential to any food service operation.\n\nThe efficiency and sanitation of the dishwashing is gauged by the number of bacterial organisms per utensil surface at the end of a given process and is expressed in terms of \"swab count.\" The average count for ten utensils usually falls within the figure of 15-25. Ideally, the swab count be kept well below 100 and this can be done by proper utilization of the sinks, soap, hot water and disinfectant compound; while properly operated dishwashing machines may keep the count as low as 17.\n\nDishes may be washed by hand or by machine. Hand dishwashing may be done in dish pans or sinks. In either case, there must be a soapy water solution and at least one hot, clean, clear rinse water (170\u00b0F). A disinfectant compound is optional if the rinse water is sufficiently hot so as to kill any remaining bacteria on the dishes after they have been washed. Dish pans will serve the purpose for small numbers of people, two or three-compartment sinks recommended for numbers exceeding 50. They may be used for numbers up to 300 if the operation is efficient. However, for numbers of 150 and over, a dishwashing machine is certainly desirable as a cleaner, more sanitary product is assured because of higher controlled water temperature. The time allotment is also a factor to be considered when doing dishes for 150 or more people.\n\nSPACE:\n\nThe dishwashing room or area should be clean, bright (light coloured walls add much to the appearance of this area) and well ventilated. Proper lighting is essential to better working conditions and eliminates the association of 'drudgery' in dishwashing. All cracks and square corners as far as possible should be eliminated in the walls, floor and equipment. Walls should be of a hard-finish material which is easily cleaned. The floor covering should be of a non-skid, non-porous, easily cleaned material properly laid.\n\nSufficient space is essential to eliminate overcrowding of equipment and workers. Adequate table space should be allowed for scraping and stacking of dirty dishes and draining and stacking of clean dishes.\n\nDISH PAN WASHING: (for numbers not over 50)\n\n1. Dish scraper - one or more.\n2. Dish pans for washing, rinsing and sterilization. (The rinsing and sterilization pans should be deep enough to allow for complete immersion of dishes).\n3. Clean dish rack.\n\nSINK WASHING:\n\nA three-compartment sink with adequate drain boards, is strongly advocated for washing of dishes up to 150. For durability and to facilitate cleaning, stainless steel or Monel Metal sinks and drain boards are recommended. Stainless steel sinks if well cared for, will wear for 35 years whereas galvanized metal sinks and drain boards have a guaranteed lifetime of 8 years.\nEQUIPMENT AND METHOD FOR HAND DISHWASHING\n\nNutrition Division,\nDepartment of National Health and Welfare, Ottawa.\n\nEQUIPMENT:\n\nProper dishwashing equipment and methods of operation are essential to any food service operation.\n\nThe efficiency and sanitation of the dishwashing is gauged by the number of bacterial organisms per utensil surface at the end of a given process and is expressed in terms of \"swab\" counts.

Clean dish rack.\n\nSINK WASHING:\n\nA three-compartment sink with adequate drain boards, is strongly advocated for washing of dishes up to 150. For durability and to facilitate cleaning, stainless steel or Monel Metal sinks and drain boards are recommended. Stainless steel sinks if well cared for, will wear for 35 years whereas galvanized metal sinks and drain boards have a guaranteed lifetime of 5 years.\nSinks and drainboards should be installed at least 3\" from the wall so that the space behind the sink may be easily cleaned. The height of the working area should be from 32\" to 34\". The sinks must be at least 24\" x 24\" x 12\" deep. Double sinks will more readily accommodate the various pots and pans. Such sinks are about twice as wide for a short person's reach. Taps should be high enough above the sink so as not to interfere with the placing of utensils in the sink (10\" above the working surface). A two-compartment sink is less expensive to install and requires less space than a three-compartment sink. If a two-compartment sink is used, a gas or electric heater may be necessary under this second compartment to maintain the temperature of 170\u00b0F. in the rinse water. This is an extra expense. If the temperature is not controlled there is a danger of the workers burning themselves. With the rinse water at 170\u00b0F., it should not be necessary to towel the dishes (Drawing No. 1).\n\nA three-compartment sink allows for one compartment for washing, one clear rinse and one rinse with disinfectant compound. When this method is used, the utilization of 170\u00b0F. water is not essential. However, with rinse water at less than 170\u00b0F., dishes may have to be towelled. (Drawing No. 2).\n\nDRAIN BOARDS:\n\nAdequate soiled and clean dish drain boards are necessary at the ends of the sinks. Drain boards of 3' and preferable 3' x 24\" or 3' (depending on the size of the sink) are essential for both soiled and clean dish shelves for units of 100 person dish capacity. Tables of same dimensions can be used instead of the drain boards but are not recommended. The clean drain board should be installed with a pitch of 1/8\" per foot sloping to the rinse sink. The scrap drain board might have a drain installed 20\" from wash sink or be installed similarly to the rinse sink.\n\nBetween the washing and rinsing sinks, there should be a drain board table top of 20\" x 24\" with a pitch of 1/8\" to the dishwashing sink to accommodate wire baskets in which the dishes are placed after washing for rinsing and chlorinating.\n\nWIRE BASKETS:\n\nFour wire baskets of suitable size, 12\" x 20\", 13\" x 16\" or 19\" are recommended for submerging the dishes in the rinse and sterilizing sinks. These baskets should have proper handles to facilitate lifting in and out of the sinks. The baskets for cups, mugs and bowls may be used for cutlery but the best container for cutlery is a wire basket 4\" x 5\" in diameter and 5\" deep with handles.\n\nOTHER EQUIPMENT AND MATERIAL REQUIRED FOR DISHWASHING UNIT:\n\n(a) Trays - sufficient for workers removing food and dishes from tables.\n\n(b) Table-washing cloths - 6 or more.\n\n(c) Dish scrapers - 3 or more.\n\n(d) Recommended soap or disinfectant for water available for dishwashing.\n\n(e) Wire whip - one to dissolve soap or detergent in wash water and disinfectant in sterilization water.\n\n(f) Measures or ladles - 2 - for measuring soap or detergent.\n\n(g) Dish cloths or mops - 4 or more.\n(h) Tea towels - if absolutely necessary to towel dishes sufficient towels should be provided for proper drying of the dishes and to allow for using clean towels for each meal.\n\n(i) Scrub brushes - 2 or more.\n\n(j) Containers, closed - one for storage of soap or detergent, one for storage of disinfectant.\n\n(k) Garbage cans with lid - one for wet garbage, one for dry garbage.\n\n(l) Floor mop - one.\n\n(m) Cupboard - one for proper storage of dishwashing materials.\n\nMETHOD:\n\nAn effective system of dishwashing is an important aspect of any food service. The proper sanitation of all utensils and equipment used for food during storage, preparation, cookery and service is important. The standard of dishwashing should be on an equal level with other operations.\n\nSatisfactory dish sanitation is as complete mechanical removal of bacteria and soil as possible. The essentials of dishwashing, regardless of method, are as follows:\n\n1. Clearing Tables, Scraping and Stacking of Dishes:\n\nAn organized system of clearing, scraping and stacking dirty dishes on the dirty dish drainboard or table is an important step before washing. Breakage can be curtailed to a great extent by careful scraping and stacking of dishes.\n\n(1) Remove any left-over food from tables and store.\n\n(2) Remove all tableware to dishwashing unit for scraping and stacking on the dirty dish drainboard or unit in the following order:\n\n(a) Cutlery\n(b) Cups or mugs\n(c) Plates, bowls, etc.\n\n(3) Clean tables in dining-room.\n\n(4) Sweep dining-room floor.\n\n2. Washing:\n\nA good soap or detergent is 'cheaper' than a poor and ineffective soap or detergent. Soap is not an item on which it pays to economize. Too much will mar the dishes but sufficient must be used. The concentration of soap varies with local water hardness and the type used. The individual manufacturers will advise on the appropriate concentration.\n\nWash dishes in the following order:\n\n1. Cutlery\n2. Cups or mugs\n3. Plates, bowls, etc.\n\nThe wash water should be changed at least once during washing dishes for 100\u00b0. The most logical time is after the washing of the cutlery and mugs and any other time the water is lukewarm, dirty or greasy.\nDishes should be washed as soon as possible after use. Dishes should be washed until clean with a cloth or mop and a good soap or detergent thoroughly dissolved in sufficiently hot water (110\u00b0F. to 120\u00b0F.) to facilitate the removal of fats. Lukewarm water is unsatisfactory for a good job of dishwashing.\n\n3. Rinsing:\n\nFor safe tableware, dishes must be rinsed in real hot water. Wherever it is impossible to provide for an adequate supply of hot water, a burner arrangement under a special constructed sink to keep the rinse water hot is advocated.\n\n(a) Rinsing when two-sink unit used:\n\n(1) Water in rinse sink must be kept at 170\u00b0F. Changes water whenever soapy, dirty or below given temperature.\n\n(2) Submerge dishes, arranged in wire rack, in rinse water for at least one minute.\n\n(3) Remove rack of dishes to clean dish drainboards.\n\n(4) Allow dishes to drain and dry.\n\n(5) Stack and store clean dry dishes.\n\n(b) Rinsing when three-sink unit used:\n\nRinsing will accomplish a great percentage of the cleaning, but some type of 'sterilization' is good protection. A chlorine compound is most generally employed. An effective rinsing after washing and before immersion in compound solution is essential as is a clean sink, since the presence of either organic matter or detergent rapidly depletes chlorine strength.\n\n(1) Water in rinse and sterilization sinks must be hot but not necessarily 170\u00b0F., but dishes rinsed in water below this temperature may have to be towelled.\n\n(2) Dissolve disinfectant in sterilization water by use of a wire whip.\n\n(3) Submerge dishes, arranged in wire rack, in rinse water for at least one minute.\n\n(4) Submerge dishes, arranged in wire rack, in sterilization water for at least one minute.\n\n(5) Remove rack of dishes to clean dish drainboard.\n\n(6) Allow dishes to drain and dry.\n\n(7) Stack and store clean dry dishes.\n\n4. Cleaning of Dishwashing Equipment and Materials:\n\n(a) Drain all sinks.\n\n(b) Clear the dirty dish drainboard of all food particles.\n\n(c) Scrub unit, including dishracks, with hot soapy water. Rinse.\n\n(d) If tea towels are used and it is necessary to use them again at next mealtime, wash in hot soapy water.\n(e) Wash table washing cloths and dish cloths or mops after each meal, in hot soapy water.\n\n(f) Rinse tea towels in clear hot water.\n\n(g) Rinse table washing cloths and dish cloths or mops in clear hot water.\n\n(h) Hang tea towels, dish cloths or mops and table washing cloths to dry.\n\n(i) Rinse sinks after washing tea towels, etc.\n\n(j) Polish all surfaces with a clean dry cloth.\n\n(k) Mop up any water which may have been spilt on floor.\nDEPARTMENT OF\nNATIONAL HEALTH AND WELFARE\n\"Nutrition Division\"\n\nOttawa, November 9, 1948.\n\nCol. B.F. Neary,\nSupt., Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nAs requested in your letter of October 27th, we are enclosing recommendations for a proper dishwashing set-up in the Indian Residential School, Kenora. We advocate the use of a three-compartment sink with drainboard made to fit the available space but of a size at least the length indicated in Illustration No.2. We do this because of the new Ontario regulations under the Public Health Act \"Eating Establishments\". We also advise installing of stainless steel equipment because of its durability and ease of keeping it clean.\n\nWe obtained prices of installing both the stainless steel and galvanized dishwashing units:\n\n\"I only three compartment sink with three drainboards of 14 gauge stainless steel, all welded, ground and polished. Commencing from the left will be one drainboard 6'0\" long; the next section will be sink 24\" x 24\" x 12\"; the next section - a drainboard 20\" x 24\" then a two compartment sink, each compartment 24\" x 24\" x 20\" deep and one drainboard at the right hand side to be 8'0\" fitted with an 8\" or 10\" splashback and 2\" return and a slatted shelf under the left hand side drainboard, set on pipe legs with adjustable aluminum ball feet .......................................................... $840.00\n\n-OR-\n\nI only sink as above but in 14 gauge galvanized iron ........$350.00\n\nThe above prices are f.o.b. delivered and exempt from the 8% Federal Sales Tax.

Residential School, Kenora.\n\nWhen at Kenora recently the matter of the roof of the above school was drawn to my attention, apparently there had been some discussion and correspondence about this in the past, but nothing had been included in the estimates for next year to cover the cost.\n\nIt had been thought possible to patch up the old roof, but on looking it over I am of the opinion that to patch it is just a waste of money; in another year or so more will need to be patched, and I would recommend that a new roof of metal be put on the whole building; an estimated cost from the local contractor is enclosed, this is only an estimate for the purpose of including in your 1949-50 estimates if not too late.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMatters Regional Supervisor.\nNovember 19, 1948.\n\nDear Doctor Pett:\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of November 9th forwarding recommendations for a proper dishwashing set-up in the Kenora Indian Residential School.\n\nWe would appreciate it if you would let us know the name and address of the firm from whom you secured the quotation so that we can supply this information to our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Several other items recommended to be changed by the Dieticians had not been mentioned.

Indian Residential School,\nKenora, Ontario,\nJuly 28, 1949.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Supt.,\nIndian Agency,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLast week I called upon Mr. Harry Lecain, electrician for the Williams Hardware Co. to check the electric motor operating our laundry equipment. Lately, this 5 H.P single-phase motor had not been giving satisfaction.\n\nMr. Lecain's inspection showed that this motor would need considerable repair, and even after such repairs he is not sure that the motor will run with good results. For better and guaranteed operation Mr. Lecain suggested the replacement of this motor by a new one of same capacity, \u2014 the motor, though, should be \"3 phase\" instead of \"1 phase\".\n\nUnder these circumstances I have asked Williams Hardware for their quotation on a new motor in replacement of the old one; I am enclosing their letter with mine. This latter gives, I think, all the particulars in the present situation.\n\nYou fully understand that a school-year cannot begin without our being sure of good operating conditions in the laundry equipment.\n\nI hope and trust that this will explain satisfactorily the immediate need of a motor for our laundry.\n\nI remain, Yours truly,\n\nRev.

School.\n\nThe jacket heater and hot water tank at the above school are out of order, and we are advised that the cost of repairs would almost equal a new installation.\n\nWe have obtained a quotation from the Lakeside Plumbing and Heating Company of Kenora for the supplying and installation of equipment of sufficient capacity to heat water for the staff and pupils in residence at this school. An attempt was made to obtain competitive quotations with no success, therefore due to the very great need of speedy installation we are forwarding the quotation from Lakeside Plumbing and Heating in the amount of $864.00.\n\nWe would recommend that the purchase of the equipment as listed on the attached quotation be authorized.\n\n[Signature]\n\nNorman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency.\n\nC.C. to Mr. Fellatters,\nNorth Bay.\nMr. Norman Paterson Supt.,\nIndian Office,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Paterson,\n\nI am presenting you a quotation of the Lakeside Plumbing and Heating Co. on a new Jacket Heater and Hot water tank. This new unit would be to replace the one actually in use, and which at the present is out of order.\n\nBy unforeseen causes sections of the present Jacket Heater are cracked and leak very badly. They would have to be replaced entirely. The cost price of new sections and installation would nearly amount to the price of a new jacket heater.\n\nAlso may I point out that the present installation is old and too small for the number of pupilage and staff in the School.

We advised you to take effect on the same date.\n\nUnder date of April 26th, Mr. Gow replied stating that he had visited the school a short time earlier, and had been told by Indian Superintendent Patterson, that the whole roof needed to be replaced.\n\nIt was Mr. Gow's opinion however, that replacement of sheet metal covering on portions of the main roof with repairs to metal shingles and flashings on the mansard roof on the original building, would suffice. Neither in Indian Affairs records or at the school however, were there any building plans, and in his letter of April 26th, Mr. Gow advised that it was his intention to prepare at least a roof plan, and that he would furnish this Division with copies on which would be indicated the location and amount of work to be considered should be necessary. If approved, these were to have been the basis for inviting competitive tenders.\n\nThis plan has never been received, and the item was overlooked in this office by the officer assigned to handle it.\n\nWe are writing Mr. Gow today however, requesting him to furnish us with this data immediately for comment and transmission to Indian Affairs.\n\nC.

Your File 129/6-1/65\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 1st instant regarding the jacket heater and hot water tank for the above school, we have submitted your request to the Departmental Purchasing Agent, requesting him to give it immediate attention.\n\nRegarding repairs to the roof of this school, I enclose for your information a copy of a memorandum which has just been received from the Lands & Development Services Branch.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nNovember 8, 1949.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Repairs to Roof,\nSt. Mary's Residential School,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nWe have received a letter dated October 31st from Mr. Gow together with a sketch plan of the roof of above school and a report prepared by Mr. Wallace of Mr. Gow's staff. A copy of Mr. Gow's comments, Mr. Wallace's report and sketch plan are attached.\n\nAfter studying this correspondence and plan, we can understand Mr. Gow's dilemma, as to what work should be done, as the repairs necessary would seem to be almost indeterminate. It is felt by the Division that if repairs to the roof are undertaken, it is possible that further defects than those already noted, might be revealed in the material and construction to such an extent that the amount of work involved would approach that of replacing the roof and walls of the upper storey.\n\nAny estimate of the cost of such repairs could be very wide of the mark at the present stage of the investigation and to even approach the actual cost would necessitate the removal of considerable portions of the ceiling to enable our engineers to examine more fully the construction and condition of material comprising the roof.\n\nThere is presented at this time, an opportunity to improve classroom accommodation and provide adequate exits, by removing the existing roof and dormers, and re-constructing this storey.\n\nMay the Division be advised of the desires of the Indian Affairs Branch with respect to the two alternate proposals described above.\n\nUpon receipt of this advice, we shall be able to either proceed with the preparation of plans and estimate for a re-constructed storey or arrange for Mr. Gow to call for lump sum tenders for repairs only.\n\nChief, Engineering and Construction Division.\n\nR.A.

Wallace of this office. The plan and memorandum were prepared in May last following an investigation made of the roof by Mr. Wallace and an assistant. The plan and memorandum were not forwarded to you at that time, inasmuch as no conclusions had been reached as to what work should be done in connection with the roof.\n\nThe upper floor of this school originally was used as dormitories but with the completion of the addition to the school, about ten years ago, it has been used for class-rooms. The low ceiling, inadequate walls, and narrow windows do not permit of satisfactory conditions in these class-rooms and this situation, aggravated by damage to plaster through leakage, necessitates consideration being given to the rebuilding of the upper storey of the old structure. The writer has examined the structure at least twice with contractor's representatives and agree with them that there is impossible to definitely localize the origin of the leakage. The metal roofing appears to be in good condition but it is quite possible that the roof rafters, sheeting, ceiling joists and the 2\" x 2\" ribbing have deteriorated, permitting the metal roofing to become detached in places, to sag in certain areas and permit loosening of the eaves-trim. As a result of our visit Mr. Wallace in paragraph four of his memorandum, the most likely source of the leakage is at the juncture of the metal roofing with the shingled mansard roofing. This was originally faulty construction as the metal roofing did not sufficiently overlap the edge of the roof to prevent driving rain from penetrating above the shingles and under the metal roofing. Due consideration has been given to the idea of raising an extension to the outer edge of the metal roofing but this work, together with the reshingling of the mansard roof, the replacement of the metal flashing around the former windows and considerable auxiliary work, would be so expensive as to necessitate consideration being given to the replacement of the upper storey of the structure, particularly in view of the present unsatisfactory class-room accommodation.\n\nUpon receipt of the plan and memorandum as prepared by Mr. Wallace and also upon receipt of this letter, we would appreciate an expression of opinion from your office as to what further line or action should be followed. We believe that it is desirable that members of the Indian Affairs Branch were to make an investigation of the condition of the class-rooms in this building in order that they may state definitely whether or not they are considered satisfactory.\n\nD.B. Gow,\nDistrict Engineer.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nMr. C. Victor F. Weir,\nChief, Engineering and Construction Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada. (Engineering & Construction Division, November 2/49)\nMemorandum\n\nMr. D.B. Gow\nRes St. Mary's (R.C.) Indian Residential School near Kenora, Ontario.\n\nI visited the above school on the 3rd and 4th of May to inspect the condition of the roof and obtain necessary information for preparation of a plan.\n\nThe main roof, exclusive of the felt and gravel roof over the new addition at the south end, is of a mansard type with dormer windows. The slope of the top part of the roof from centre to front and rear of building is possibly 1 in 40, and may be considered relatively flat over the length or 122 feet and varying widths of 22 to 28 feet.\n\nThe top part is metal covered (galv. Iron No. 26 gauge), with 2\" x 2\" ribs at approx. 27\u00b0 c.g. across the width of the roof; and the sloping sides of the roof are shingled. Although there is evidence of leakage at many points on the ceiling and on the upper part of the sloping walls in the class room below, and especially at that part of the ceiling and wall under the site of the water tank that was once on the roof, it could not be definitely ascertained whether leakage would occur if the roof over our time water tank was in position on the roof at the front side where tank was removed and the roof structure repaired and patched at the site. At the time of the inspection, this patched area, which is slightly depressed from the general slope, had water over it; and it is possible there was some leakage at this point. However, the general condition of the metal appeared to be sound. In effect, the metal does not lie flat and tight to the wooden sheeting below and the small slope from the centre to front and rear is not uniform as many slight depressions were noticed. The soldering at joints appeared to be good. The shingles on sloping part of roof are old; some slightly warped and a few missing and many are loose.\n\nMost leakage probably occurs at the edge of the metal roof and its junction with the shingled part, by water draining off the metal top and getting in behind the shingles.\n\nAn attempt to ascertain the condition of the roof rafters, sheeting and ceiling joists was limited to a very small area, through a trap door in the ceiling of the class room. At this point, which is near centre of roof, with maximum height of 16' between ceiling and roof, the rafters, sheeting and joists appeared to be in good condition. There was no possible way to see the condition of the wood support for the roof rafters at a width sufficiently at the points where leakage may occur. However, from information given by the Fathers at the School, the condition of the ends of rafters would appear to be poor as difficulty has been experienced when trying to find secure nail hold in fastening eaves troughing.

Wallace.\nRes: Repairs to Roof,\nSt. Mary's Residential School,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nWe have received a letter dated October 31st from Mr. Gow together with a sketch plan of the roof of above school and a report prepared by Mr. Wallace of Mr. Gow's staff. A copy of Mr. Gow's comments, Mr. Wallace's report and sketch plan are attached.\n\nAfter studying this correspondence and plan, we can understand Mr. Gow's dilemma, as to what work should be done, as the repairs necessary would seem to be almost indeterminate. It is felt by the Division that if repairs to the roof are undertaken, it is possible that further defects than those already noted, might be revealed in the material and construction to such an extent that the amount of work involved would approach that of replacing the roof and walls of the upper storey.\n\nAny estimate of the cost of such repairs could be very wide of the mark at the present stage of the investigation and to even approach the actual cost would necessitate the removal of considerable portions of the ceiling to enable our engineers to examine more fully the construction and condition of material comprising the roof.\n\nThere is presented at this time, an opportunity to improve classroom accommodation and provide adequate exits, by removing the existing roof and dormers, and re-constructing this storey.\n\nMay the Division be advised of the desires of the Indian Affairs Branch with respect to the two alternate proposals described above.\n\nUpon receipt of this advice, we shall be able to either proceed with the preparation of plans and estimate for a re-constructed storey, or arrange for Mr. Gow to call for lump sum tenders for repairs only.\n\nChief, Engineering and Construction Division.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEncs.\nRes: Repairs to Roof - St. Mary's Indian Residential School, Kenora, Ontario.\n\nWe are enclosing, in duplicate, plan of roof of St. Mary's Indian Residential School, Kenora, Ontario, Scale 8 ft. to one inch, and also a memorandum to the writer, both prepared by Mr. W.H. Wallace of this office. The plan and memorandum were prepared in May last following an investigation made of the roof by Mr. Wallace and an assistant. The plan and memorandum were not forwarded to you at that time inasmuch as no conclusions had been reached as to what work should be done in connection with the roof.\n\nThe upper floor of this school originally was used as dormitories but with the completion of the addition to the school, about ten years ago, it has been used for class-rooms. The low ceiling, sloping walls and dormer windows do not permit of satisfactory conditions in these class-rooms and this situation, aggravated by damage to plaster through leakage, necessitates consideration being given to the rebuilding of the upper storey of the old structure. The writer has examined the structure at least twice with contractor's representatives and agrees with Mr. Wallace that it is impossible to definitely localize the origin of the leakage. The metal roofing appears to be in good condition but it is quite possible that the roof rafters, sheeting, ceiling joists and the 2\" x 2\" ribbing have deteriorated, permitting the metal roofing to become detached in places, to sag in certain areas and permit loosening of the eavestroughing. As pointed out by Mr. Wallace in paragraph four of his memorandum, the most likely source of the leakage is at the junction of the metal roofing with the shingled mansard roofing. This was originally faulty construction as the metal roofing did not sufficiently overlap the edge of the roof to prevent driving rain from penetrating above the shingles and under the metal overlap. Serious consideration has been given here to soldering an extension to the outer edge of the metal roofing but this work, together with the reshingling of the mansard roof, the replacement of the metal flashing around the dormer windows and considerable auxiliary work, would be so expensive as to necessitate consideration being given to the replacement of the upper storey of the structure, particularly in view of the present unsatisfactory class-room accommodation.\n\nUpon receipt of the plan and memorandum as prepared by Mr. Wallace and also upon receipt of this letter, we would appreciate an expression of opinion from your office as to what further line of action should be followed. We believe that it would be advisable if the Indian Affairs Branch were to make an investigation of the condition of the class-rooms in this building in order that they may state definitely whether or not they are considered satisfactory.\n\nD.B.

Weir,\nChief, Engineering and Construction Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada,\n\n(Engineering & Construction Division, November 2/49)\nMemorandum\n\nMr. D.B. Gow\n\nRe: St. Mary's (R.C.) Indian Residential School near Kenora, Ontario.\n\nI visited the above school on the 3rd and 4th of May to inspect the condition of the roof and obtain necessary information for preparation of a plan.\n\nThe main roof, exclusive of the felt and gravel roof over the new addition at the south end, is of a mansard type with dormer windows. The slope of the top part of the roof from centre to front and rear of building is possibly 1 in 40, and may be considered relatively flat over the length of 122 feet and varying widths of 22 to 28 feet.\n\nThe top part is metal covered (Galv. Iron No. 26 gauge), with 2\" x 2\" ribs at approx. 27\" c.c. across the width of the roof; and the sloping sides of the roof are shingled. Although there is evidence of leakage at many points on the ceiling and on the upper part of the sloping walls in the class room below and apparently at the point where the wall and the site of the water tank that used to be on the roof, it could not be definitely ascertained where leakage occurred through the roof. At one time a water tank was in position on the roof at the east side; this tank was removed and the roof structure repaired and patched at the site. At the time of the inspection, this patched area, which is slightly depressed from the general slope of the roof, is still wet and there is some leakage at this point. However, the general condition of the metal roof appeared to be sound but in places the metal does not lie flat and tight to the wooden sheathing below and the small slope from the centre to front and rear is not uniform as many slight depressions were noticed. The soldering at joints appeared to be good. The shingles on sloping part of roof are old; some slightly warped and a few missing and many are loose.\n\nMost leakage probably occurs at the edge of the metal roof and its junction with the shingled part, by water draining off the metal top and getting in behind the shingles.\n\nAn attempt to ascertain the condition of the roof rafters, sheeting and ceiling joists was limited to a very small area, through a trap door in the ceiling of the class room. At this point, which is near centre of roof, with maximum height or 18\" between ceiling and roof, the rafters, sheeting and joists appeared to be in good condition. There was no possible way to see the condition of the wooden part of the roof structure as a whole, especially at the points where leakage may occur. However, from information given by the Fathers and the School, the condition of the ends of rafters would appear to be poor as difficulty has been experienced when trying to find secure nail hold in fastening eavestroughing. The wooden sheathing may be in similar poor condition in places.\n\nMr. D.B. Gow,\n532 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba.\nNovember 29th, 1949.\n\nMr. N.

The fenestration is poor, the ceilings are low, noise comes up the open stairway, and the front wall space does not permit of a decent size blackboard.\n\nIn fact, this school is on our list of deferrable projects and we had intended to erect a four classroom block when more urgent school requirements had been met elsewhere.\n\nThis four classroom block would of course be a frame structure and would be located near the present dormitory building. It is felt that in the long run that would be more economical and more suitable than the lifting of the roof, installation of extra windows, etc., as suggested.\n\nThis is based on the presumption that the rebuilding of the upper storey, as recommended by Mr. Gow, would be a rather\nNorth Bay, Ontario,\nDecember 9th, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nATTENTION: Col.

There are no better means to teach them than by intelligent manual farming.\n\nThis is part of the plan for this school, and I believe (175 acres) will be sufficient for us to get a garden of about an acre or two, very nice that can be used and the crops distributed in 6 patches so we cannot lack...\nfarming to advantage so they to propose that the Department would acquire for me a piece of the reserve land that is next to the school land in which we could get enough water land plowing to turn the crop several growing and this would also make us to teach the girls driving. The amount of land that would be required for this purpose would be large and so there are lots of people in the area. I must state that the land is not going to be but would be cleared out and it will be more useful to the people as they will have to clear land if they are going to carry on the farming.\n\nThe thing that most need of an approval is your signature.\nDecember 2nd, 1914.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nThe Principal of the Kenora Boarding School has applied to the Department for a portion of Reserve No. B adjoining the school which they wish to use for agricultural purposes.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to consider the sale of any portion of this Reserve to the school authorities, but could have no objection to giving them the right of occupancy for the purpose above mentioned over the area asked for, about one square mile. It is presumed that the Indians would offer no objection as it could be very much in the interest of the children at this school that they should be given practical instruction in farming. I would, therefore, ask you to obtain from the Indians a resolution giving right of occupancy to the school authorities during the pleasure of the Department.\n\nR. S. McKenzie, B.E.,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nKenora, Ont.\nI note in the Annual Report that the Reserves of the Rat Portage Bands are designated as SS A and SS B on Matheson and Clearwater Bays; this should be SS A and SS B. Kindly note this for future guidance.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nIndian Affairs Office, Kenora Ont.\n\nNo. 108-12\n\nDecember 22nd, 1914\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 2nd instant, reference to the request of the Principal of the Kenora Boarding School, to be given a portion of Reserve No. 36 B. for agricultural purposes.\n\nI beg leave to say that I had quite a job to get the band together, and get their views on the matter. There reply is, that there is no land for agricultural purposes until it is cleared off and that they think it is for the wood, more than for farming that the school wants it. They further state that the school has already had fully 2000 cords of wood almost free from their reserve, and they refuse to give their consent to let the school have the mile square asked for, and in any case they would not give up the shore in the Devils Gap, as that is the only place they have to camp when they come into the town during the summer. I could not get the Indians to say what they would take to let the school have the land required, out side of the gap, but I think they would be willing to let it go if they got anything reasonable, for it.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.\nIndian Agent.\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOf Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nJanuary 26th, 1915.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to our previous correspondence in connection with the request of the Principal of the Kenora boarding school to obtain a portion of reserve No. 385 for agricultural purposes, I note the objection of the Indians on the ground that they consider it is more for the sake of the wood than for the land that the request has been made. In this connection I would ask you to consult with the Principal of the school and ascertain whether he would be willing to pay the usual dues for wood cut from land which they might want to clear for farming purposes. There should be no difficulty in selecting land to the location of which there would be no reasonable objection on the part of the Indians, and the advantages that would accrue to their children should be emphasized.\n\nP. S. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nIt should also be made clear to them that the school will not be allowed to clear more than the land that they intend to actually cultivate.\n\nI hope that you will be able to make some mutually satisfactory arrangements whereby some arable land will be made available for the school authorities.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter No.129,992-1 of the 26th January 1915, I have consulted the Rev. Principal of the Kenora Boarding School, and he states that they would be quite willing to pay the Crown dues for any wood that was cut, on reserve No.39.B., to clear up some land for agricultural purposes, but I find it hard to get the Indians to understand just what is wanted.\n\nI have done my best with the Indians who I could meet and explained to them that they would not lose the land, they however decline to give any decision in the matter, and said it would be better to wait until treaty time when the whole band would be there, and then they would give me an answer, but not before that time.\n\nI therefore think it will be well to let the matter rest until we are paying Treaty, as it is impossible to get the Indians together any other time, and more I will require a good Interpreter to explain the matter properly to them.\n\nI trust this will be found satisfactory, as it is the very best I could do in the matter.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDuncan C Scott, Esq.-\nIndian Agent.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.-\nOf Indian Affairs.-\nOttawa, Ont.-\nApril 6th, 1915.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant in further reference to the application of the Principal of the Kenora Boarding School for land to be used for agricultural purposes in connection with the school. I approve of your suggestion to let the matter rest until Treaty time when I hope you will be successful in persuading the Indians to grant the request of the Principal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nR.

Father Cahill, I beg to write to you in reference to a piece of land which we think it would be very advantageous to secure, if possible, for our Indian Boarding School at Kenora.\n\nAs you are aware of it, we actually have only a small piece of land (about 50 acres) in connection with said School; and this land is nearly all rock and altogether unfit for cultivation. This is very unsatisfactory for the purpose of an Indian Boarding School.\n\nNow, last fall, we have examined very carefully one portion of the Indian Reserve 36 B., which is adjoining to said School property and we think it would be possible to find on it about 120 acres of land that could be brought under cultivation or used for pasture. Of course it would require a considerable amount of work to prepare this land for cultivation, as it is hilly and nearly all covered with timber. But it could be done little by little and in the end it would become very useful to the School. The attached sketch will show you its exact location. It shows the situation of the School and of the adjoining lands, and the proposed addition to said school property is marked in red color.\n\nIf the Department would approve of it and if the Indians are willing to surrender this piece of land at a reasonable price I think we would be prepared to purchase it and use it in connection with the Boarding School. We would be thankful if you would kindly consider this matter and let us know at your earliest convenience if the Department would authorise the Indians to sell us this piece of land, say 33 chains by 36 chains 118.8 acres. If you wish we could take this matter up with the Indian Agent at Kenora or with any other Official whom you may designate to attend to this affair.\n\nI have the honor to be your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C.

Payment of $300.00 was to have been made by deduction from last December quarter grant and the balance, viz:- $294.00 was to be deducted from the March quarter grants. I find, however, that the full amount, viz:- $594.00, was deducted from the December quarter grant. This amount should have been transferred to the Rat Portage Band's account, in order that the terms of the surrender might be carried out and half of this amount paid to the Indians. I am now having this transfer made and payment can be made forthwith by sending a cheque to the Indian Agent for $297.00.\n\nI may say that this matter has not previously been before me.\n\nOttawa, February 10, 1917.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAccountant.\nOttawa, February 26, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that a cheque for $257.48 is being sent you for distribution to the Rat Portage Band of Indians, being 50% of the purchase price of land sold to the Kenora Boarding Schools.

I have done all I could with the Chief to get them back but he does not appear to have any control over them.\n\nI would be pleased to have your advice on this matter as well as treaty payments, whether they should be paid or not.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary:\nDept of Indian Affairs:\nOttawa Ont.\nINDIAN OFFICE, KENDRA ONT.\nMarch 8th, 1917\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 26th of February, 1917, No. 129992/1, and mine of the 2nd Instant, No. 108-13, reference to cheque No. 5896 for $297.00, to be paid to the Rat Portage Band.\n\nMay I ask if this is to be divided up equally with the Rat Portage and Dalles band, as they are to all intents one & the same band, and all trust funds are to their combined benefit, as Trust amount No. 102, Reserve No. 38 A., or should this money be paid only to the Rat Portage Band. The Chief thinks as this money comes from Reserve No. 38 B., that they should get all this money. There is also another question they bring up, that is No. 80, Annie Chaboyer, Mary Louise Cappier No. 81, who will never return here, and from whom I could not get a receipt, and if the Dalles band is to share in this money there is No. 78, John Land and ex-pupil of Fort Frances School, and No. 81 Eliza McLoud a nun at St Boniface who will never return here, and they do not think they should share in the distribution of this money.\n\nI will be pleased to have your advice on this matter, as I wish to do everything in the right way, so that there will be no trouble later on.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary:\nDept of Indian Affairs:\nOttawa Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 13th March, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, in further reference to $897.00 sent you for distribution, being 50% of the purchase price of land sold to the Kenora Boarding School; and in reply I beg to say that as the Rat Portage and Dalle Bands have a common account the members thereof should share equally in the moneys received from the sale of the said land. You should therefore make distribution at an even per capita rate to the members of the said bands of the amount above mentioned. The shares of absentee members of either band should be returned to the Department, and their money will be available when application for the same is made.\n\nThe Department will require you to submit with the pay-list or distribution a statement of the amount of money received, the amount distributed and the amount, if any, refunded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.S.

The names of all heads of families (including absentees) entitled to participate in a distribution should be entered on the pay-list each year.\n\n2. The Band Number of a family should on no account be changed.\n\nShould a family become extinct, its number should be dropped and not used again.\n\n3. When a member of a family is to be paid separately, as all adults should be, his or her name must be added at the end of the pay-list, under a new number; and the reason for paying separately should be given in the column for remarks.\n\n4. All increases and decreases that affect the number in a family must be entered in the increase or decrease columns; those entered in the column headed \"Other Causes,\" must be carefully explained in the column for \"Remarks.\"\n\n5. No money should be paid to Merchants or other persons who are not Indians, except by special permission of the Department.\n\n6. No money should be paid to any Indian other than the one entitled, unless upon presentation of a written order, which should be attached to the pay-list.\n\n7. Wherever possible the share of an absentee is to be remitted to him, by express order or post office order, at his expense, and the stub or number of the order is to be attached to or stated in the list. When money is sent by registered letter, a receipt for the letter from the postmaster should be attached to the list.\n\n8. All money columns and the columns showing the number of Indians should be correctly added and balanced. The difference between the number on the list paid at this and the previous payment must equal the difference between the total increases or decreases noted in the increase and decrease columns.\n\n9. The Statutory Declarations should be taken before a Justice of the Peace, or a Commissioner for taking affidavits, according to regulations.\n\n10. The pay-list should be returned to the Department promptly after the distribution with a covering letter and statement. Only under very exceptional circumstances should it be retained longer than one month.\n\n11. No additions are to be made to the pay-list unless title to be paid is made clear. The best attainable evidence of birth is to be got. In organized districts the paymaster should demand production of a copy of certificate of birth.\n\nIn the case of women from other districts entering the Band by marriage the paymaster must assure himself that they are not paid elsewhere by communicating with the Agent of the district from which they come. No one but newly born children and women entering the Band by marriage should be added to the list without the sanction of the Department.\n| Name                  | Number in Family | Amount Paid | Remarks |\n|-----------------------|------------------|-------------|---------|\n| Asheroy Quineau      | 1                | $3.90       |         |\n| Billy Way Way Pines  | 1                | $1.95       |         |\n| Isaac Quineau        | 1                | $1.94       |         |\n| Naka Wawa Ca Bone    | 1                | $1.95       |         |\n| Pa Pa Nash           | 1                | $1.95       |         |\n| Ka Tch Way           | 1                | $2.47       |         |\n| Jamesway Big Chief   | 1                | $4.76       |         |\n| Naka Awepi Neese     | 1                | $2.90       |         |\n| Man Quineau          | 1                | $2.76       |         |\n| Seppawinikan         | 1                | $1.95       |         |\n| Naka Min Dit         | 1                | $2.76       |         |\n| Pe Lava Wa Quabe     | 1                | $3.64       |         |\n| Tin Bin Au Oo Bevis  | 1                | $2.88       |         |\n| Tap Fee              | 1                | $2.88       |         |\n| Nick Wawa Oka Prow   | 1                | $3.58       |         |\n| Way Wawa Lie Groves  | 1                | $2.64       |         |\n| Uk Lay               | 1                | $3.64       |         |\n| Annie Gladboy or Bone|                  | $1.95       |         |\n| Mary Louise Gaffney  |                  | $1.95       |         |\n| Jamesway             | 1                | $5.90       |         |\n| Walter Mow River Lee | 1                | $3.58       |         |\n| Nee Way Be Ting      | 1                | $1.94       |         |\n| Nee Way Be Ting      | 1                | $1.95       |         |\n| Nee Way Be Ting      | 1                | $1.95       |         |\n| Michael Kiel         |                  | $1.95       |         |\n| Peter Kiel           |                  | $1.95       |         |\n\nTotal: $16.14 $23.16 $6.69 $13.96 $9.75\n| Name                  | Number in Family | Amount Paid | Amount Absent | Signature of Recipient |\n|-----------------------|------------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------------|\n| Edward Taylor         |                  |             |               |                       |\n| Betty Cowley          |                  |             |               |                       |\n| Adolphus Clark        |                  |             |               |                       |\n| William Macdonald     |                  |             |               |                       |\n| The Ballet Band       |                  |             |               |                       |\n| David Lindsay         |                  |             |               |                       |\n| John Smith            |                  |             |               |                       |\n| Alexander Thomas      |                  |             |               |                       |\n| Richard Wilson        |                  |             |               |                       |\n| John Henry            |                  |             |               |                       |\n| Alfred Lindberg       |                  |             |               |                       |\n| Albert Henry          |                  |             |               |                       |\n| Alice May             |                  |             |               |                       |\n| Moses Murray          |                  |             |               |                       |\n| James Smith           |                  |             |               |                       |\n| William Macdonald     |                  |             |               |                       |\n| William Macdonald     |                  |             |               |                       |\n| William Macdonald     |                  |             |               |                       |\n\nTotal: $135.60\n\nDate: January 8th, 1917\n| Serial No. | Name                  | Number in Family | Amount Paid | Remarks |\n|-----------|-----------------------|------------------|-------------|---------|\n|           |                       |                  |             |         |\n|           |                       |                  |             |         |\n|           |                       |                  |             |         |\n\nCertified Correct\n\nR.S.M.C.

The amount received to be used by the School. As this amount would be very small I would recommend his request be granted.\n\nThe Principal allows the older pupils to cut cordwood for the School and pays them $1.00 a cord for the cutting, the boys use this money for various purposes such as purchasing hockey shoes, skates &c, and is a very good training as many of them will have to work in the woods to make a living when they leave school. The wood cut is of course used by the School.\n\nI have told the Principal, he can cut down any dangerous trees and await authority to dispose of same.\n\nThe saw &c at the school was purchased by the School authorities and the proceeds from the sale of the few logs could be applied towards paying for this.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent,\nOttawa, Feb.15th, 1924.\n\nSir;-\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th inst.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Doctor Scott:\n\nRev. Fr J.E. Baillargeon O.M.I., Principal of Kenora Indian Residential School, is calling my attention to a rather sad situation existing in his neighbourhood and at the same time giving a suggestion that may bring relief. He desires me to write you in the matter.\n\nThe Indians of the Lake of the Woods through the failure of the blueberry crop have been unable to earn money and consequently are in need of even the necessities of life. The Reverend Principal would like to give them a little work that would help them specially in view of the coming Winter. He has for the use of his school only a few acres of cleared land which have given him this year just two tons of hay for about 15 head of cattle. There is certainly a necessity of clearing more land. It is quite a proposition as the rocky condition of the soil is a great handicap. The Reverend Principal requests the authority to proceed with said clearing and enough money for the same purpose, said money to be paid to the Indians in food or otherwise.\n\nA little work on a road which leads to a small hayfield, three quarters of a mile from the school is also urgent. Same authority as above would be appreciated.\n\nI therefore ask in the name of Rev. Fr Baillargeon for a sum of $700 to $800 for above improvements with the authority to have work done without delay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10), volume 6109, file 661-9, part 1\nSeptember 14th, 1929.\n\nDear Father Guy,\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, with reference to the advisability of proceeding at this time with some additional clearing at the Kenora Indian Residential School. When Mr. Perrier was in Kenora in May, he authorized the Principal to expend $200 in this connection. As some of the Indians in the vicinity are in need of work, I am writing to Mr. Indian Agent Edwards authorising an expenditure of $750. He will explain to the Reverend Principal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. M. McLEAN\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Jos. Guy, O.M.I.,\nRector,\nMathieu College,\nGravelbourg, Sask.\nSeptember 14th, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Edwards,\n\nI understand that additional clearing is required at the Kenora Indian Residential School and that a road leading to a hayfield requires some improvement. The Church authorities write that it would be desirable to have this work undertaken now and that Indians who are in need of funds this year, due to the partial failure of the blueberry crop, should be given the work. You are authorised to expend $750 for these purposes, after consultation with the Reverend Principal. It is understood that Indians, as far as possible, will be employed. Please inform Rev. Father Baillargeon and cooperate with him in the matter.\n\nWhen an accountable cheque with which to pay labour is timely, you may make application.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM. D. McLEAN\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nIndian Residential School,\nKenora, Ont., Sept. 24th., 1929.\n\nAt the beginning of August last, I sent to Mr. Indian Agent Edwards vouchers for wages paid to Indians for clearing land at this school, and I beg to say that I have not as yet received any cheque from the Department covering these vouchers. I would be glad if you would be kind enough to look into this matter at your earliest convenience.\n\nIndians have to be paid as soon as their work is done, and very often even before, because they say they have nothing to eat. So, I have paid them, and now, I am in need of that money to buy the necessities of life for the pupils.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.E. Beallargeon, P.M.I.\n(J.E.

Will you please ascertain just what type of puller is needed and let me have your recommendation with estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nKenora, Ont\nNovember 20th, 1929\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter #129-1-9 of the 29th ultimo, re vouchers for wages paid for clearing land at the Kenora Indian Residential School. Under date of August 23rd I sent you Return of Labor sheets in duplicate, showing an amount of $187.50 paid out in wages. I mentioned in my letter that this money had been used out of cheque #2056 for $1,000 sent to the Principal. I have discussed the matter with the Principal this morning and he considers this amount should not be deducted from that cheque.\n\nTrusting this gives you the information desired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\nA.

SEMMENS ON THE CECILIA JEFFREY BOARDING SCHOOL, DATED August 22nd, 1916.\n\nIn my last report reference was made to the condition of the mud banks of the point upon which the school buildings are situated. It was this time observed in addition to the erosion of the shore line and the fall of many valuable shade trees, the surging waves have ploughed a deep channel through the neck of the peninsula so that the school site has become an island and the construction of a bridge has become necessary to connect with the mainland. The cattle wade this stream night and morning and every passage deepens the channel. This might not be worthy of special mention were it not for the fact that the water intake and the sewer escapes are brought into proximity by the new channel connecting the stretches of water north and south. High winds will be sure to make reverse currents and the intermingling of water may be unfortunate. It may be that the level of the lake will so far subside that the filling of the new channel will be possible. If so it will be most fortunate but I fear trouble if this cannot be done.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo: Tushaye Anderson Co.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Jan.28-30  | To account rendered per vouchers attached    | $71.40 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nForm 62.\n\n[Signature]\nAgent.\nTUDHOPE, ANDERSON CO., Limited\n\nWinnipeg Jan 9 1923\n\nShipped from Winnipeg\n\nSold to Dept.of Indian Affairs\n\nSHIPPED TO Rev.L.Baillargeon, AT Kenora, Ont.

The school have no plans on their file and as they are doing some fencing, we wish to get this for their information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\nOttawa, 12th February 1930\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo requesting two copies of plans of the Kenora Indian Residential School property and in reply I beg to say the Department has no further information than that supplied you in letter of the 11th January 1929. Two blueprints of the sketch are enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.F. MacKenzie)\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nFrank Edwards Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa, May 14, 1930.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to conversation with Mr. Ferrier when you were in Ottawa a few days ago. It was understood that approximately $4,000 could be expended on improvements at the Kenora Indian Residential School. It had been suggested that land be cleared, drained and fenced, that a hogpen be erected, the wharf repaired and some interior decorating undertaken.\n\nI now write to inform you that it has been found necessary to expend nearly $3,000 on very urgent repairs to the water supply and sewage disposal systems. Will you please correspond with the Rev. Principal and let me have a recommendation concerning how the $1,000 which remains for this school can best be expended.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. J. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nVery Rev. J. Wagner, O. M. I.,\n340 Provancher Ave.,\nSt. Boniface,\nMan.\nOttawa, June 13, 1930.\n\nIt is represented that it is now necessary to fence the pasture at the Kenora Indian Residential School. The church authorities state that a great deal of time is lost every day, searching for their milk herd. Will you please determine just what is needed and let me have an estimate of the cost, with your suggestions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nIndian Residential School\nKenora, Ont., 1930.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have received complaints from our neighbour north of the School land, Mr. W.G. Cameron, that the actual fence is, at some places, over his property; Mr. Cameron requires that said fence be put in proper place.\n\nI beg to say that this fence has been put up by one of my predecessors, and was likely done to the best of their knowledge, for the survey posts are not to be found, being rotten or run over, and that, for the benefit of our neighbours and of our own, I am anxious to have this error redressed. But, as we are not able to locate the survey posts, I beg to ask the Department to send a surveyor to trace them up and put permanent posts where necessary.\n\nTrusting I shall hear from you soon,\n\nI remain Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.E.

We would suggest a check should be made on the same if the work is approved.\n\nWe would also recommend that Mr. McKeen, the Ontario Land Surveyor run a line around the property so that there will be no mistake in the boundaries.\n\nThe original fence was put in a few years ago at the School and was run the easiest way irrespective of Ownership of the land.\n\nWe shall be glad to receive further instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 12th July 1930\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department desires to have the land limits of the Kenora school properties re-established and all corners marked with an iron post. The properties to be surveyed consist of two parcels; firstly, the East 1/2 of the East part of Location I.8, situated in the Township of Jaffray, which parcel is listed in the Land Registry Office, District of Kenora, as parcel No. 8721, a copy of the plan of which is attached to Patent No. 6161, in the Land Titles Office, Kenora.\n\nSecondly, that part of the Kenora Indian reserve No. 58B, containing 118.6 acres, which parcel is registered in the Land Titles Office at Kenora under number 9666 and subsequently transferred to the Crown by Transfer No. 18649.\n\nFor this work you will be paid at the rate of $15.00 per day and all reasonable expenses in connection with the survey. It is desired that you obtain as much of the labour assistance as possible through the school authorities. Your returns will consist of a plan on tracing linen showing the work performed and the location and nature of the boundary monuments. This should be accompanied by your account, with vouchers attached, all in duplicate. This survey is primarily to be undertaken for the purpose of immediately establishing the line which it is desired to fence and it is hoped you will be able to undertake the survey at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAlbert MacKenzie Esq., O.L.S.,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nAct. Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSchools Branch,\n\nAs arranged in conversation with Mr. Sutherland, herewith find instructions for Mr. McMeekin to perform the survey necessary. It is considered desirable that all corners of the school property should be monumented and the Department supplied with a plan, as the entire survey will cost very little more than that which is now necessary to establish the fence line.\n\nI would suggest that this letter to the surveyor be enclosed in your reply to Indian Agent Edwards, with instructions that he ascertain if Mr. McMeekin can perform the survey soon enough for your purpose and if so, to have him the instructions.\n\nMuchas thanks,\n\nChief Surveyor.\nOttawa, July 14, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Kenora Indian Residential School, relative to the fencing required and requesting that the services of a surveyor be engaged to trace the boundaries of the school property and put in permanent posts where necessary. The estimate, stating the quantity of fencing material and the approximate cost of same, together with the labour required in erecting the fence, as mentioned by you, has also been noted.\n\nRegarding the surveying of the school property, I enclose herewith a communication addressed to Albert McKeenin, O. L. S., Kenora, authorizing him to examine the limits of the property, as mentioned therein and have all corners marked with an iron post. You should consult Mr. McKeenin and ascertain if he can perform the survey at an early date. If so, you should hand him the enclosed letter of instructions. After the boundaries of the property, where the fences are required, are determined by the surveyor, the Department will approve of the fencing necessary and you may arrange for the purchase of the fencing material, gates, etc. The other authorities should assist the surveyor in his work as far as possible and also in the labour of erecting the fence. It is assumed you estimate the cost of the material and the labour to be $671.65. The Department considers that this figure is high and hopes that a considerable saving in this amount can be effected by you in the purchase of the materials and in the labour.\n\nAfter the fence has been erected, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of all materials and for the labour employed. You should also have the surveyor prepare his accounts, in duplicate, covering the cost of the survey. He will be allowed payment at the rate mentioned in the letter to him. Please give the above matter your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

All the rest will have to be bought. It is about the same thing with hay; every year we have to purchase two or three carloads.\n\nTo keep our school going we have to make very heavy expenses, and when we have to buy these commodities we can hardly live on the grant we receive from the Government; this you can easily understand.\n\nWhy have we such a poor crop? Because we have not not enough land cleared. There are about fifty acres that could could be cleared at about one hundred dollars an acre; but, up to the present time we have received very little help from the Department. It is true, in the past, we received a grant of a few hundred dollars, but, it was not even sufficient to prepare the land for clearing. It is a low lying piece which must be drained, and the grant received was about equal to one half of the money necessary to have the drainage done.\n\nI have asked the Department four thousand dollars to clear some land next year. I should have asked for six or seven thousand at least. I did not dare do so; it is so often said to me; \"The Department has no money!\" Nevertheless I am convinced that six or seven thousand dollars would be hardly enough to prepare enough land to derive a substantial revenue from our work, and give some work to our Indian boys and train them to cultivate the soil in a profitable way. This proposition should, it seems, receive attention from the Department.\n\nNow, I have a suggestion to make about some work I wish to have done this fall, as soon as possible. I wish to have four or five acres of land drained, and ditches dug in order to prepare the soil for next spring to grow potatoes and other vegetables. It is a very good time to do this work now; the ground is in the best condition possible on account of the extra dry weather we experienced last summer.\n\nMost of our Indians have nothing to do now, have hardly anything to live on, and are asking for work in order to be able to buy the necessities of life. To prepare this piece of land now would fulfill a double purpose, namely give Indians work and food, and give us a chance of raising at least a good crop of potatoes next year. Consequently, I come to ask you to obtain for us the sum of $1800.00 at once to start the work immediately before it is too cold.\nAs it is impossible to let the Indians work alone, I have the intention to engage as foremen Mr. Joseph Gauthier and his son. They have supervised already very successfully some work done by the Indians in draining and clearing land. They are expert workers themselves, and while supervising do more work than their men.\n\nAwaiting a favorable reply, I remain Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Pt. J.B. Baillargeon O.M.I)\n\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find letter received from the principal, Kenora, R.C. Indian Residential School, which explains itself.\n\nIt is true, the school has very little land cleared. If the Department approves, and if the school is not likely to be scrapped in the next few years, I would recommend that a grant be given for clearing and putting further land under cultivation. It should be distinctly understood, that Indians should be used as much as possible, but if anything is to be done this fall, it should be started immediately.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 4, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 108-2 of the 30th ultimo, enclosing letter from the Principal, with reference to draining and clearing some land this fall for the Kenora Indian Residential School. In reply I have to authorize you to expend approximately $1500 in this connection. This work should be done under your supervision and that of the Rev. Principal, on a day labour basis - Indians to be engaged as far as possible. An accountable cheque for $1,000 is being directed to you, under separate cover. Labour returns, in duplicate, should be forwarded in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nIndian Residential School (R.C.)\nSeptember 30th., 1930.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nNo doubt you have read with satisfaction that our new Government will spend twenty million dollars to relieve unemployment.\n\nMay we not take advantage of this situation to help our poor Indians in helping ourselves at the same time.\n\nYou have experienced several times that there is practically no road leading from the Golf Club to our School, a state of things that should not exist; we should have a decent road to go from here to town, there is no doubt about this.\n\nMay I ask you to kindly obtain that a road be built from the Golf Club to our school. It would cost approximately one thousand three hundred dollars, I suppose.\n\nThe work could be done mostly by Indians who are already in need of food and money. You are interested in these Indians; I had the occasion to notice it several times, and I am sure you will do your utmost to alleviate their misery and at the same time give us a hand in the best way possible.\n\nI thank you for your kind cooperation.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nE. Bannerman\n\nCaptain Frank Edwards\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM FRANK EDWARDS,\nINDIAN AGENT, KENORA, Ont., dated Oct. 3, 1930.\nHis No. 108-12.\n\nI enclose letter received from the Principal, in which he asks an appropriation of $1300.00 to repair the road to the school. This road is in bad shape, and the school authorities apparently do very little work on it. We could probably obtain cinders from the C. P. R., and if the school authorities or the Department would pay for the labour of hauling, a passable road could be made at much less cost than estimated by the Principal.\nOttawa, October 18, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your 108-12 of the 3rd instant, concerning improvements at the Kenora Indian Residential School, I have to inform you that there are no funds at the present time to improve the road leading to the institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

I send the farmer right away to get someone to doctor the sick horse, and they did all what could be done, but could not save him. The infection was so far gone from retention of stale.

The accompanying letter from the local veterinary suggests that two cattle could be sufficient, although a longer interruption might be undesirable.\n\nIt is felt that the school should take care of the school's daily requirements. It is also the suggestion of the veterinary and the farm staff that short-term milk production should be reformulated to accommodate the needs of the school until the herd is reinstalled.\n\nAll milk used at the school is pasteurized and stored.\n\nWe have been advised by the local veterinary that the school's milk supply is adequate for the needs of the school until the herd is reinstalled.\n\nIf it is the intention of the Department that we slaughter the rest now in order to reinstall a new stock in the fall we would have to lay off some of the help we now have and it may be a problem to get the right man when we need him.\nagain in the fall, although over the haying period it could be arranged easily.\n\nthanking you for your keen interest,\n\nI remain your truly,\n\nFather A.

MacKay, Esquire,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. MacKay,\n\nI have been informed that several of your Indian Schools in my constituency and particularly those located in Kenora conduct farming operations and have livestock to supply food products for the Indian children.\n\nUntil recently if any farmer had trouble with his herds of cattle, horses and pigs no veterinary services were available from sources nearer than Winnipeg Port Arthur or Fort William and usually as this was exceedingly expensive, a substantial loss had to be suffered alternatively. On a co-operative basis the Kenora Agricultural Society made arrangements for the establishment of veterinary service in the Kenora area with precedence of service going to members of the Association.\n\nThe Province of Ontario is paying one half of the annual cost up to $2400 per year. That means that the Kenora Agricultural Society must raise $1200 per year.\n\nI am told that since the establishment of this service Indian Schools have been getting regular aid but in return have given only varying support more or less at the discretion of the principals. Though it is understood that the Indian Department would supply veterinary services to the schools from Dr. Watts at Fort William, I am informed that emergency needs often arise and the only immediate help is to be found from the Kenora Agricultural Society's veterinarian.\n\nIt has been suggested that it would be better if the Department of Indian Affairs were to arrange to make an annual contribution to the Kenora Agricultural Society in return for veterinarian service at their several schools. I would appreciate it very much if you could have an enquiry made as to\nthe feasibility of such a proposal.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nW.M. Benedictson, M.P.,\nKenora-Rainy River.\n\nWMB/kjf\n\nNOTED. P.M.\n5/15/49.\n9th May, 1949.\n\nMr. N. Paterson,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nIt has recently been brought to our attention that the Kenora Agricultural Society made arrangements for the establishment of veterinary services in the Kenora area with precedence of service going to members of the Association.\n\nIt is claimed that since the establishment of this service, Indian schools have been receiving regular aid, but in return have given only varying support more or less at the discretion of the Principals. It is understood that the Indian Affairs Branch can obtain veterinary services at schools from Dr. Watts at Fort William, but in the case of emergency, the only immediate help is to be found from the Kenora Agricultural Society's veterinarian.\n\nIt is presumed that our correspondent refers particularly to the Kenora and Cecelia Jeffrey Indian Residential Schools. As you are aware, it is our general practice to require the school management to purchase livestock, and as a consequence, the livestock is considered their property and any veterinary services needed are paid by the school.\n\nWe would appreciate your interviewing the Principal of both the Cecelia Jeffrey and Kenora Residential Schools, and obtain a statement from each of them regarding the number of times during the past\nyear they have used the services of the Kenora Agricultural Society, and the approximate cost that each of them has paid to the Society for any services rendered.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard J.

In your summary of schools, I might add the McIntosh Indian School where Father Jomaa is stationed. He is very co-operative and uses the services of the Kenora Veterinary Association which has been established for three years. The Society has pointed out to Mr. Benidickson that in the case of emergency the local \"vet\" is the only one available and as the livestock are kept for the benefit of the Indian pupils who are wards of your Department, any loss due to delay even of some hours is a serious condition.\n\nIt would be appreciated greatly by the farmer of this District if it were made evident in a financial way, that the Department is interested in farming conditions in this area.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGerald F.

Henry,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nJune 1st, 1949.\n\nMr. G. Swartman,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nSioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nWe recently received a request from the Kenora Agricultural Society to make them a grant in view of the fact that the services of their veterinary are available when required. It is claimed that since the establishment of this Society, certain Indian schools have been receiving regular aid, but in return we only given varying support more or less at the discretion of the Principal.\n\nYou understand that it has always been our general practice to require school management to purchase livestock, and as a consequence, the livestock has been considered their property and any veterinary services needed are paid by the school. We have been informed that the McIntosh Residential School has taken advantage of the veterinary services provided by the Kenora Agricultural Society.\n\nWe would like to know what arrangements Father Comeau has with the Society. Does he pay an annual fee, and if so, how much, or is he only supposed to pay an amount whenever the veterinary's services are needed? If it is the latter, how much do they charge in this regard? We would also like to know the amount that Father Comeau has paid the Kenora Agricultural Society during the calendar year 1948.\n\nWe would appreciate it if you would get in touch with him immediately and let us have as much information as possible.\n\n[Signature]\nBernard F.

Benidickson, M.P.\nKenora Rainy River\nRe: Kenora Agricultural Society,\n\nThe above society provides veterinary services for members who own cattle. The Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School, Kenora Residential School, and the McIntosh Residential School have membership in the above society.\n\nThe following is the determining factors in regard to the membership fees which make the schools eligible for veterinary services:\n\nMinimum charge - $3.00\n3 to 10 head of cattle @ $1.00 per head,\nall over 10 head are charged at the rate of 50\u00a2 per head with a maximum charge of $25.00.

School have 15 cattle and 4 horses making a total of 19 head, the membership fee being $14.50.\n\nWe have a letter on file to the effect that during the year 1948 the Cecilia Jeffrey School paid fees totalling $39.00.\n\nThe Kenora Residential School stated that the veterinary visited that school six times during the year 1948, but on May 16, 1949, they had not received any account from the Society.\n\nThe principal of the McIntosh School in a letter dated June 12th, 1949 stated that during the years 1948-49 the following payments had been made to the Society:\n\nTo the Society: June 9, 1948 $10.00\nTo Doctor Orwill vet.

Benidiekson, Esq., M.P.,\n112 Fifth Avenue, South,\nKensora, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Benidiekson:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of July 4th regarding Departmental assistance for the veterinary services of the Kensora Agricultural Society.\n\nWe understand that the Kensora Agricultural Society require certain fees before supplying their services. The Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School and the Mainteach Residential School have paid the fees which are required. The Kensora Residential School advise that the Veterinary visited their school six times during the year 1948, but up to May 16th they had not received any account from the Society.\n\nI would ask you please to refer to the fourth paragraph of our Director's letter of May 9th. As stated in that paragraph, any expense incurred for veterinary treatment of the live stock at a residential school is the financial responsibility of the school management.\n\nThe Department has agreements with the Churches operating these residential schools. In these agreements and in subsequent correspondence we have clearly established Departmental responsibility and school management responsibility in the payment of the various expenses in connection with the operation of these schools.\n\nThe payment of these veterinary fees is the\nResponsibility of the Kamora Residential School and the Kamora Agricultural Society should send their account to the Principal of this School for payment. You will note that both the Cecilia Jeffrey and the McIntosh Residential Schools have paid the bills submitted by the Society.\n\nI hope that the information in this letter will help to clarify this situation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

These four produce eight gallons of milk daily. This eight gallons plus ten gallons of whole powdered milk is served to the pupils each day.\n\nThe average consumption per pupil is 1.4 pints each day.\n\nNorman Patterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency.\nJanuary 14th, 1950.\n\nMr. H. Paterson,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nRe: Kenora R.C. Indian Residential School. Your File 129/17-18\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of January 6th supplying information regarding the quantity of milk obtained from the dairy herd at the above school. It is noted in your letter that you only mention 7 cows.\n\nIn 1947 we purchased 10 cows for this school. (Reference your Voucher 436 dated September 13th, 1947, in an amount of $1,900.00 payable to Laurent Arpin, Pinwood, Ontario.) Are we to infer from your recent communication that there are only 7 cows at the school at the present time? If so, why were 3 cows apparently disposed of?\n\nYou will recall that we purchased the 10 cows to replace the herd that had to be disposed of owing to Bang's Disease. When the Department supplies cattle, it is expected that the school management will keep the number of the herd at least as high as the number supplied by the Department. An immediate reply would be appreciated.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F.

When I came here there was no bull for the herd. By 1949 a registered bull was bought and also three registered cows. In order to buy these cattle we thought it was necessary to dispose of some of cows of the herd already existing. They were not good milkers. It is possible in this way to build a better herd in a shorter time.\n\nTrusting these information is what you require, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. M.

I have analyzed the list submitted by the principal and find that the amount chargeable is as follows:\n\n| Band                        | Amount   |\n|-----------------------------|----------|\n| Six Nations                 | $5,296.71|\n| Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte| $873.33  |\n| Moravians of the Thames     | $500.00  |\n| Mississaugas of New Credit  | $322.50  |\n\n$7,012.34\n\nBesides the two following bands who have no funds available for the purpose,\n\n| Band                        | Amount   |\n|-----------------------------|----------|\n| Chippewas of Munsey         | $160.00  |\n| Oneidas of the Thames      | $160.00  |\n\n$520.00\n\nAs the bands have expressed their unwillingness to have any amount taken from their funds for the above purpose and also as a general vote for Indian Education is ample to pay the per capita grant in full for the maintenance of all the Indian children who are in attendance, I would respectfully urge that the per capita grant be charged to the Vote and the band funds be not held responsible for any amount towards the cost of the maintenance of the school during the past fiscal year and that Mr. Superintendent Smith be advised accordingly. The Six Nations Band have not sufficient funds at their credit in Interest Account to cover the above amount.\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.

Boyce,\nHawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\n\nI desire to express my deepest sympathy with you all in your bereavement.\n\n[Signature]\nC. Scott.\nOttawa, April 23, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, enclosing a list furnished you by the principal of the Mohawk Institute, giving the names of the neglected and orphan children in attendance during the year ending March 31st, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as the funds at the credit of interest account of the respective bands will hardly bear the cost of the increased per capita grant for the support of these children, it has been decided to pay the entire grant allowed the school from the appropriation for Indian education. The bands will, therefore, not be held responsible for the payment of any grant for the past fiscal year for the maintenance of the orphan children.\n\nWith reference to your notes regarding the orphan children, I beg to say, with reference to Beulah Wilson, that enquiry will be made regarding the payment of a pension.\n\nRegarding the case of Cornelia Thomas, the Department cannot consent to have the warrant which has been issued for the arrest of Hiram Bumbery withdrawn. This girl is stated on the return to be only 14 years of age, and the Department agrees with you, that it would not be advisable to overlook the matter and every effort should be made to have this man arrested and tried on the charge covered by the warrant.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nGorden J. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford,\nOnt.\nApril 23, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nThe financial statement which you forwarded from the principal of the Mohawk Institute has been submitted to me. You are being instructed regarding the per capita grant that will be allowed during the present fiscal year, this being based on the statements as submitted by Mrs. Boyce, of the past year's expenditure.\n\nRegarding your suggestion that an accountant be sent to open a set of books for Mrs. Boyce, I have thought that it would not occasion very much expense if the services of a chartered accountant, in Brantford, were obtained to open a set of books and give Mrs. Boyce instructions as to how they should be kept. An elaborate system of accounting is not required.\n\nKindly make enquiry and ascertain the amount of fees that would be charged in having the services of a chartered accountant. I will be pleased to have this information at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours truly\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\n\nGordon J. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford,\nOnt.\nCHURCH. Mr. Bilkie took all the services and administered Holy Communion March 6th and April 3rd. On Easter Sunday the School-room was appropriately decorated with flowers and plants and the Church brass by the pupils. On April 10th it was warm enough for us to commence services at the Church and it has been arranged that services be held at 10 a.m. for the season.\n\nRECREATION. The boys show great enthusiasm in the Cadet Corps drills and are busy preparing for the Annual Inspection on May 10th. To relieve the monotony of drilling under the same Instructor Mr. Rogers arranged for the Sergeant-major of the local Regiment to train the boys in certain work and they have responded very well. Much time is spent at the river fishing and ball games occupy most of the short recesses. Good Friday was a holiday after service and all Easter Monday. Easter Day all pupils had eggs for breakfast and candy eggs for supper.\n\nHEALTH. We have had a troublesome epidemic of \"pink eye\" with the boys, one case of uremic poisoning, one of erysipelas, and another of Scarlet Fever which was sent to the Isolation Hospital. One girl who had tubercular trouble in hand was sent to Doctors and X-rayed. Amputation was advised below the wrist but the father took the girl away for home treatment. Several pupils have been attending dentist and others the oculist. The changeable weather has given rise to several cases of sore throat and rheumatism.\n\nIncidentals. The Apple-storehouse was broken into one night and the chicken house locks were damaged. Strange men have been reported about the buildings on several occasions. On April 22nd a very heavy rain flooded the man-holes and one caved-in. The river and creek flooded the flats. The transformer was affected by the lightning and had to be replaced as did a pole carrying high-tension wires to it.\nIMPROVEMENTS. The gas was found to be inferior and causing damage to plumbing fixtures so it was cut-off entirely with the exception of the kitchen which must have an auxiliary cooking stove in case of emergency. Electric irons in laundry necessitated additional wiring. The Medicine chest was removed from Main Building to Girls Study Room and another was built in the Boys Wing. Drinking Fountains were placed in Boys and Girls Corridor. The Lower Corridor was grained and the School-rooms were painted. The Entrance steps were rotting at the Base so the lower one was removed and replaced by a brick step and the others were under-stayed. Brick steps were built on the front of the Gardeners Cottage to replace the wooden ones which were unsafe. The Chicken runs were re-fenced.\n\nThe Furnace chimney was re-built. The mortar had dried out and was crumbling away leaving the bricks loose and dangerous to those passing underneath. This was dangerous work and we protected ourselves by taking out an accident insurance for the period the work was in progress. A chimney which had been partly built when the building was erected was completed - coming through the roof directly behind the Cupola.\n\nA brick fire-place was built in the visiting room which was papered and decorated as an officers sitting-room. The former sitting-room is now used as a visiting-room. The gas-pipes throughout the entire building were removed, excepting the kitchen. The gas grate on the Principal's flat was converted into a coal grate.\n\nExtra wiring was required upon the removal of the gas stoves and a few wall connections for reading lamps were installed. The condemn control board was replaced by a new panel also the Entrance Service was altered to come up to Inspector's requirements at a cost of $600.\n\nThe Drawing Room and two Bed-rooms on the Principal's flat were papered, painted and the floors done over.\n\nFARM AND GARDEN. In spite of a very early Spring the varied weather made farming difficult. We have Spring ploughed 65 acres on Chabo commenced March 21st. We commenced working the low lands on April 4th and sowed oats. April 13th we commenced fencing the Plats and picking up stone after the floods. Planted the first potatoes April 22nd. We have ploughed the orchards and planted out new\nBi-Monthly Report. Mohawk Institute, Brantford Ont. March and April 1921\n\nand fruit bushes, transplanted the strawberries, sprayed the trees (this operation was hindered by the sprayer working badly). The greenhouse and hot-beds are filled to capacity much of the work being done by the girls. April 26th, we sowed barley and commenced working the root land. Farm teams hauled coal from the Grand Trunk Station, removed ashes, manured land and much wood was cut. The ice-house was re-shingled and sundry other roofs were repaired. The frost April 16th, did a good deal of damage. Killed three pigs for school consumption. Engaged Cattle-man and assistant-gardener for the season April 1st.\n\nNOTE: Mrs Boyce went to Ottawa for a week early in March. Miss Ward acted as Nurse and looked after the cleaning during her absence. Mr. Mutter Manual Training Instructor was delighted with the progress the boys made. Some of the models are excellent. Major Smith inspected both months. The Hydro Electric Commission made specifications for new line serving Institute. The Coal Contract was let to Gibson Company who commenced hauling March 21st, and filled all the bins. March 26th received cheque for $1,000, to be refunded in two years. The Buffalo visited the School and Reserve and photographed some of the pupils. We set our incubator in the Hospital with good results. April 13th, moved part of Mrs Boyce's furniture to the principal's flat. Mrs Ashton died April 14th, suddenly and the funeral took place on Sunday afternoon April the 17th. The Boys acted as Guard of Honour several of the older Girls sang in the Service very sweetly. Mr Lee for a long time Missionary at Cayuga and Mr Jeaking took the service. The Church was beautiful with Easter lilies and forms. Mr. Ashton was moved to the Institute April 18th, and the rest of the furniture sent down April 25th.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPoor Copy\nReport on Manual Training at Mohawk Institute\n\nA start was made in Manual Training in this school on Saturday, February 19th, 1921. I was engaged as teacher of the subject by the Principal Mr. Boyce, to take classes every Saturday morning until the beginning of May. Work started with a class of sixteen boys but as the tools supplied were not sufficient, the class was divided and came on alternate days. The work taken up was: The theory of timber and tools with notes and sketches of same.\n\nElementary exercises in woodwork. Planing, sawing, the making of halving and mortise and tenon joints, followed by more advanced work, entailing the use of these joints, such as the Oxford picture and four legged low seats. These latter were glued and clamped. Additional lessons were given in upholstering (webbing, stuffing, covering, etc.)\nAdditional work was taken up in the way of small local repairs.\n\nI attended 12 Saturdays for three hours per day, making a total of 36 hours so that 16 pupils received 18 hours instruction. The discipline and attention of the boys was excellent; they took naturally to the work and made a success of it in every instance and compare favourably with any pupils in this work that I have ever handled, showing fine self-reliance and perseverance.\n\nI would suggest that this is an excellent opportunity for a technical department being introduced at the Institute which would work in well with the training in farm work that the boys receive, besides opening other avenues of vocational choice for them. To continue there are only tools for a limited number. The workshop at the Institute could easily be arranged to accommodate a full class.\n\nSigned,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMay 14th, 1925\n\nJno. A.

All the services were held at the Church except that on September 25th when wet weather kept the children at home. Holy Communion was administered September 4th and on October 9th. Mr Pearson officiated on the latter date. We held Harvest Festival services on October 16th for which occasion the girls had artistically decorated the Church. On October 30th the pupils attended a special Children's Service at St. Jude's Church.\n\nHEALTH. We had an outbreak of Chicken-pox amongst the boys and a general epidemic of influenza which kept several of the staff and many of the pupils in bed. John Antone met with an accident while threshing and broke his arm as a result of falling from the mow. Leonard Benhamke fell on the stairs and injured his hip. Both boys received immediate medical attention and are well again. George Staats underwent an operation in the local hospital for double hernia. The minor complaints include several cases of sore eyes, the usual outbreak of itch following holidays and one case of acute eczema.\n\nSTAFF. Miss Walker engaged for one month as Housekeeper, on trial, was succeeded by Mrs Heale.\n\nMiss Kayen left October 1st having been ill off and on all September.\n\nMiss Cummings, teacher, from Reserve School No. 5 was engaged at once but could not assume her duties until October 25th. In the meantime Jessie MacNaughton took the Junior School very creditably.\n\nMrs Burnett, sewing teacher, had her vacation.\n\nMiss Lee, farmerette, had to leave suddenly, October 6th on account of illness at home.\n\nNOTES. Major Smith inspected September 1st.\n\nMr Standing, Public Schools inspector, was here October 17th.\n\nMrs Baythornhaeit of Moose Factory School spent several hours here on three different occasions.\n\nThe Staff of the French Train and the Board of Trade paid us a visit when they were in Brantford.\n\nLABOUR DAY. September 6th. The Boys were interested spectators.\nat the Battalion Rifle Matches held on the Ranges of this property. One of our senior boys taking part made a very fair score. The girls went swimming and visited the stores.\n\nSPORTS DAY. October 12th. In spite of very cold weather our sports were a great success. This year the local merchants were asked to provide the prizes and a very useful collection of articles was made. Our baker provided the refreshments. The pupils were very enthusiastic in their races and events. We were however disappointed that Mr. Abrahams was not present and he promised to judge our horses and Cattle. The boys' horses were splendid and our visitors expressed their admiration both of the cleanliness of the teams and harness and of the skilled manner in which the teams were driven. The cattle were also in good condition and very clean. Refreshments were provided in the School-room where we also staged a boxing contest. Mrs. C. J. Smith presented the prizes at the close of the afternoon.\n\nPLOUGHING MATCH. October 26th. It was considered advisable that our boys should attend the local ploughing match in company of the farm staff who were instructed to use the opportunity from an educational point of view. A marked difference in the quality of the work done by our teamsters since that date shows the benefit derived already.\n\nChawaken Fair. October 14th. The boys attended this Fair and attracted a lot of attention by their very smart turn-out.\n\nREGIMENTAL CHURCH PARADE. The Cadets were specially invited to attend Church Parade on October 24th. with the Regiment. Colonel Colquhoun in an address congratulated the boys on their general smartness in both dress and drill. The girls were present as onlookers.\n\nPUPILS DANCE. October 16th. The girls entertained the boys and gave a Box Social which they financed from their own funds. This fund comes from the new system of rewards which has had a marked effect in the tidiness, care of clothing and equipment.\n\nMrs. Boyce went to Ottawa for two days October 10th.\n\nThe assault case of Nettie Clench is causing much trouble and worry and so far little or no progress has been made towards securing conviction.\nWilfred Henry, who has caused much trouble and has been guilty of several petty thefts from officers another boys, absconded in company of a cousin L. Wilson and both are wanted by the police for theft. Ernest Snake has absconded several times being returned each time by the local police. He is absent now.\n\nThe girls are now wearing a most becoming set of \"tams\" made from the blue serge hospital gowns. The necessary issues of warmer clothing and extra blankets have been made and the centre furnace was lit on October 5th.\n\nSewers. These are a constant source of trouble and require very careful attention in order to keep them effective. Within two weeks recently two portions had to be dug out in order to remove stoppages. Owing to a very small pipe being used in this construction small rags scrub cloths etc cause obstructions.\n\nThe white paint recently applied to the outside of the building has greatly improved the appearance; the dome is now an ornament.\n\nThe new greenhouse and extensions to potting shed are nearing completion. All the greenhouse construction has been carried out by the staff and is all being painted.\n\nTwo hot-plates have been installed in the kitchen and sundry repairs have been carried out by electricians to meet the underwriters standards.\n\nThe laundry washing machine and the extractor have been thoroughly overhauled. Our old motor burnt out on September 26th but we have been able to rent another which will operate the machinery until the Hydro connect us to their system. This motor, however, will not work both machines at once as is necessary for efficient work.\n\nThe Hydro Electric commenced placing poles October 22nd. In order to keep the cost of this installation down as much as possible we are digging all holes.\n\nMr Coutts of the G.M.W. commenced a class in telegraphy and has expressed his pleasure at the progress made. The D.S.C.R. Toronto were able to provide us with instruments.\n\nHeavy gales blew down a quantity of apples. This year crop was not good although we seem to be more fortunate than our neighbours. We have not, however, been able to store as many this year as last but the children have been able to enjoy quantities already\nOur crops have been good and we have been able to store the following for winter use besides having been plentifully provided during the season.\n\n- 262 bags Potatoes.\n- 1,400 lbs Mangolds and turnips.\n- 3,000 head Cabbage\n- 3,000 \" Celery,\nand squash, pumpkins, citrons and beets.\n\nWe threshed:\n- 235 bus. Rye.\n- 118 \" Wheat.\n- 552 \" Barley,\n- 174 \" Buckwheat.\n- 1,492 \" Oats.\n\nIn all, we have 89 tons of good hay and owing to the very excellent corn crop we have a large quantity over and above that necessary to fill the silo. We have already husked 12 loads. The beans yielded well this year.\n\nHaving a surplus of straw we baled 18 tons which we intend to sell when the market is favourable.\n\nAlthough we have been exceptionally busy on the Farm and Garden and have accomplished much, we are glad to be able to report that in no single instance has any boy had to neglect his lessons or miss school in order that so much should be done.\n\nWe commenced:\n- Milling Silo...........September 14th.\n- Second threshing......October 17th.\n- Baling straw..........September 2nd.\n- Sowing Fall wheat.....September 7th.\n- Sowing Rye............September 2nd.\n\nWe were able to buy by auction and large quantity of bridg lumber from the County Engineer. There were seven loads in all and their will enable us to re-floor the horse stable, repair or bridges, generally take good and provide the Institute with kindling for the winter.\n\nAll the plaster throughout the building was repaired with the exception of the hall (bay-room) which needs a little more than painting to put it in order. The walls of the stairways and hallway at both wings were whitewashed adding greatly to their appearance.\n\nMr. Asheton went to stay at Grimsby for some months on October 24th.\n\nIs all suffered from poisoning on October 24th. It is thought that some girl put an irritant (possibly lye) in the baking powder and officers and pupils alike suffered. The suspected baking powder was handed over to local chemists and we await their report.\nIt is our intention to kill our own meat this winter. Already we have enjoyed one home-killed calf and chickens are available when required.\n\nOur first spring chicken to lay laid on October 15th.\n\nThe chicken houses and the apple house have been lime sprayed.\n\nWe lifted our geraniums and other stock early and have already several thousand cuttings struck. The greenhouses are a blaze of chrysanthemums of all shades and we have promising beds of ferns, lillies.\n\nWe expect to place fresh picked tomatoes and lettuce on the market for Christmas.\n\n[Signature]\n\nNovember 9th, 1921\nOTTAWA, November 14th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, enclosing the bi-monthly report of Mrs. A. M. Boyce, principal of the Mohawk Institute, for the months of September and October, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I have read this report with interest, and I am pleased to note that the work in all branches of the school is progressing favourably.\n\nI wish to congratulate the principal on the results obtained from the farm and greenhouses, also on the repairs which she has carried out to the building.\n\nRegarding the assault case of Nettie Clench, I will be pleased if you will state what action is being taken towards securing a conviction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nIndian Office, Toronto,\nNov. 15th., 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that from time to time I am having enquiries made for cheques which I sent in requisitions for some time ago.\n\nDrainage account, I only succeeded today in covering the overdraft at the bank by means of collections made since the first of the month. I have asked for an additional cheque of $2000.00.\n\nFile No. 25032-37. I enclosed requisitions for cheques in payment of land purchased for Benjamin Williams some time ago and the vendors are enquiring for them.\n\nFile No. 517316 on October 20th I requested a cheque of $33.75 from the Doxtater estate payable to Wm. H. Jamieson the administrator for the maintenance of the old father.\n\nThe request for cheque for School grant for the quarter ended September 30th has not yet been received.\n\nI am\n\nSir Your obedient servant,\n\nGordon J. Smith,\nSupt.\n\nThe Secretary-\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, Nov. 17th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 15th instant regarding the cheques for school grant, for the quarter ended September 30th, I beg to say that on October 6th, last, cheque No. 1672 for $3717.68, being the grant due the Mohawk Institute, was sent you, and on October 28th, last, cheque No. 5022 for $2250.00, being the grant for salaries of teachers on the Six Nations' Reserve, was also sent you.\n\nThese cheques should have reached you before this date, and I will be pleased to hear as soon as possible whether they have yet been received by you, and, if not, the Department will take steps with the Post Office authorities here to trace them.\n\nYou will be further advised regarding the other cheques referred to by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nGordon J. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nIndian Office, Brantford,\nNovember 16th., 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nIn answer to your enquiry of November 14th regarding the assault case of Nettie Clench, I regret to report that no progress has been made in securing evidence to warrant a charge being laid. Mrs. Boyce arranged with Nettie to send a letter to Miller requested him to come to the Mohawk to see her and arrangements were made to overhear the conversation in the hope that Miller might make some confession, but he did not answer the letter and did not turn up. It appears to me that he is getting suspicious and is watching his movements. The Crown Attorney informed me that it would be useless to attempt to secure a conviction on the evidence which we now have as there is no corroboration. It is a question which I have been considering whether it would be advisable to lay the information and bring the young man to trial in the hope that admissions might be made by him in Court and it is possible that a prosecution even if it does fail might have a beneficial effect on others as this offence is unfortunately too common on the Reserve.\n\nIn my letter of the 5th inst., making a request for the usual grant to assist pupils to attend High School I referred to the case of Helen Bradley who was stated by two young Indians to be the cause of their infection with Venereal Disease, but Dr. Greenwood has informed me that the usual blood test taken in such cases shows that this girl did not have the disease and since then I have not heard anything more in regard to her.\n\nI am\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGordon J. Smith,\nSupt.\n\nThe Secretary -\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nNovember 23rd, 1921.\n\nDear Mrs. Boyce,\n\nI have been giving attention to the case of Nettie Clench. Major Smith informs me that the county Crown Attorney told him it would be useless to attempt to obtain a conviction from the evidence we now have, as there is no corroboration. Major Smith has been considering whether it would be advisable to lay the information and bring the young man to trial in the hope that admissions might be made by him in Court. He thinks it possible that a prosecution even if it does fail might have a beneficial effect on others, as this offense is unfortunately too common on the reserve.\n\nIn consulting Mr. Williams, the Departmental Solicitor, he points out that if there were no corroborative evidence in support of the charge, the lawyer for the accused would not put his client in the witness box and there would be accordingly no chance of obtaining any admissions from him.\n\nI am quite willing to order a prosecution if you have no objections to offer and if you do not think it would be against the interests of Nettie Clench to have the case brought into the Court. Kindly let me have your opinion.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMrs. A. M. Boyce,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nThe second paragraph reads:\n\nper day in case of persons who fail to file returns after several demands.\n\nFor making false returns:\n\nsummary conviction a fine not exceeding $100 or six months imprisonment or both fine and imprisonment.\nIndian Office, Brantford,\nNovember 21st., 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nIn answer to your letter of the 17th inst. regarding my requests to have cheques forwarded, I beg to state that I regret that I was not more definite in my letter of the 15th. The School grant to which I referred was for the assistance of high school pupils which cheque I received on the 19th inst. The cheques for the Six Nations School grant and the Mohawk Institute have both been received by me.\n\nI am\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGordon J. Smith,\nSupt.\n\nThe Secretary-\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIndian Office, Brantford,\nNovember 25th., 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nMrs. Boyce has advised me that Mrs. Matthews who has charge of the laundry and dairy department at the Mohawk is making application for an increase in salary. She is now getting $30.00 a month which or course includes board, lodging and laundry, has been there for three years and has proved herself a reliable officer, but Mrs. Boyce thinks that she is really getting sufficient wages. She has every Saturday afternoon off twice a month and Sunday of every week. She does not feel like recommending any increase, although she would be very sorry to lose her. I therefore beg to recommend that Mrs. Matthews' salary for the present be not increased.\n\nI am\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGordon J.

Although I believe the girls story\u2014\nshe is really such a liar ordinarily that\nwe must stand little chance with her\nif she were confused. I'm not even sure\nabout her condition, she contradicts her\nown statements. I believe that she has only\ntold the story to two of the girls in the\nschool\u2014she is settled down and happy\u2014\nand most irresponsible\u2014so we will try to\nforget it. I will send her letter with\nfull confession to her father today\u2014\nand leave it to her father and mother\nto find any evidence they can\u2014as far as\nthey know nothing of the story. Her parents both\nold people of this school have both done\nwrong\u2014so we have little to hope for.\n\nI wanted to consult Major Smith\nbut he was not at the Office this morning.\n\nYours very truly,\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\n3rd December, 1921.\n\nDear Major Smith,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo, with reference to the case of Betty Clench. I note that the Crown Attorney considers it useless to attempt to secure a conviction as there is no corroboration, and that you have been considering the question as to whether it would not be worth while to undertake this prosecution with possibility of securing such admissions from the accused at the trial as would secure his conviction.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I have also received a communication from Mr. Boyce, who does not need to think there has come to light any evidence on which we could rely in the prosecution. If there is no corroborative evidence in support of the charge, the lawyer for the accused will not put his client in the witness box and there will be accordingly no chance of obtaining any admissions from him. I do not think that we have sufficient grounds to warrant an action being taken in this case.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMajor Gordon J.

A few days ago I was discussing the case with the Truant Officer and he told me that he still had the case in view and hoped after a time when suspicion had broken away that he might be able to get some evidence from Miller or from some of his chums so that if such evidence can be procured a charge would be laid against him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nGordon J. Smith,\nSupt.\nExtract from Agent's Report on the MOHAWK INSTITUTE, dated December 2, 1921.---Original on 154845-7.----------\n\nSince the terms of the Adolescence Act is to be enforced at the Institute, Mrs. Boyce is somewhat worried as to how the children are to be occupied especially if they pass the entrance examination and are not attending High School. She now has one girl who has passed the Business College examination before she is 16 and there are others who will pass the Entrance examination before they reach that age.\n\nAll the teachers and officers are rendering satisfactory services, particularly Miss Cummings, teacher of the junior class, who holds a second class Normal Certificate and has had long experience as teacher. Her salary at present is $40.00 a month but Mrs. Boyce feels that in order to keep her, her salary will have to be increased.\n\n(Sgd) Gordon J. Smith\nSupt.\nOttawa, December 14, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your report on the Mohawk Institute, dated the 2nd instant. I have noted that the Principal, Mrs. Boyce is somewhat worried concerning secondary education because \"the terms of the Adolescence Act are to be enforced at the Institute\". Might I ask for more information concerning this Act and its terms, as far as it applies to the Mohawk Institute? The Department understands that the wards of the Dominion Government are not subject to educational enactments of the Provincial Legislature.\n\nI am writing to Mrs. Boyce, explaining that the Department feels that she need pay no attention to the programme of the Ontario Department of Education, other than the course of studies. The Department of Indian Affairs has rules and regulations concerning the conduct of our schools, and these have been made without reference to any provincial laws.\n\nConcerning the teacher of the junior class, Miss Cummings, I am asking Mrs. Boyce for a recommendation in connection with her salary, if she feels that an increase is necessary at this time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nDept. of Indian Education.\n\nGordon J. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nOttawa, December 14, 1921.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Mr. Superintendent Smith's report on the Mohawk Institute, dated the 2nd instant. He has referred to the satisfactory service rendered by Miss Cummings, Teacher of the junior class, who holds a second class professional certificate and has had long experience. Mr. Smith states that you feel that in order to retain her services her salary of $40.00 a month will have to be increased. The Department would like to hear from you concerning this matter, and will give full consideration to any recommendation that you may make.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMrs. A. M. Boyce,\nPrincipal, Mohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nOttawa, December 14, 1921.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to refer to a matter arising out of the report of Mr. Superintendent Smith, dated the 2nd instant. Allow me to quote from Mr. Smith's report:\n\n\"Since the terms of the Adolescence Act are to be enforced at the Institute, Mrs. Boyce is somewhat worried as to how the children are to be occupied especially if they pass the entrance examination and attend High School. She now has one girl who will pass the Business College examination before she is 15 and there are others who will pass the Entrance Examination before they reach that age.\"\n\nThe Department believes that any ruling of this type by the Ontario Department of Education does not affect the routine or conduct of an Indian residential school. We have rules and regulations for our Indian wards and for their education, and no programme outlined by the Provincial Department of Education need be adopted unless Ottawa sees fit.\n\nI would like to have a communication from you in connection with the advisability of starting a class for those students who are qualified to take high school work. There has been some doubt on our residential schools in the West where the students before reaching the age of discharge were qualified to take secondary education. I feel that this matter should receive the Department's attention, so that any special training we initiate could be offered this winter.\n\nI had hoped to pay a visit to the Mohawk Institute this calendar year, but I am convinced that, due to the amount of work that has been presented to the School Branch at this time, my trip will have to be postponed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Merrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMrs. A. M. Boyce,\nPrincipal, Mohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nDecember 17th, 1921\n\nTo: Superintendent of Indian Affairs\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter re the advisability of starting a class in telegraphy among the students who are unable to pursue high school work. As we are so near the city schools - I think it will cost less to send our pupils to the town. We have got the accommodations for another class room - teachers rooms etc.\n\nAs we have to keep our children out of idleness we are making every effort to give them variety and entertainments both in and out of school. The pupils are taking real interest in the class in telegraphy - after passing the standard we hope some will continue the course at the G.H.W. office. When qualified - after say six months' months - they can earn eighty a month in normal towns - one hundred and twenty dollars a month in the cities.\nThe boys are interested in their manual training classes\u2014last week they repaired\u2014in some cases upholstered\u2014a lot of chairs that had been neglected for years.\n\nNext Summer I intend to give the senior girls a short course in knitting, crocheting, embroidery\u2014cooking in small quantities, making them write down the recipes and directions.\n\nMeanwhile we are making a start at an orchestra\u2014we have not found a suitable instructor in the girls\u2014for an advanced orchestra.\n\nOur Christmas entertainment will take place next Friday evening. The school room will be decorated\u2014we will close with a few carols and prayers\u2014as a few are leaving for their holidays.\n\nOn Saturday, I wish you could hear them\u2014we are looking forward to your visit\u2014and the children will enjoy cutting on a small exhibit for you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOTTAWA, December 22nd, 1921.\n\nDear Mrs. Boyce,\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 17th instant, referring to the educational work that you are doing in the Mohawk Institute for the senior students.\n\nIn the light of your statement concerning the training activities, I agree with you that it would be undesirable to commence high school work in the Mohawk Institute at this time. At a later date, when I am visiting Brantford, we can go into this matter carefully.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. T. H.\n\nBupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMrs. A. M. Boyce,\nPrincipal, Mohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nIn some years back we have not had a fully qualified teacher in our junior school - the salary offered was $400 a year - i.e., $100 a quarter - paid $34 a month $85 the next two months. A teacher is qualified for three of the holiday terms if she remains over six months. As the last teacher did not complete a year and we were without a teacher some weeks I have been paying this. Remuneration $40 a month. When she came here she forfeited her right to the Ontario teachers pension.\n\nWe give teacher a large bed-room, attendance board and writing - they share a sitting room and dining room. Our local college council this a $500 a year - perhaps we should count it at $400 a year. We require certain duties of our teachers outside school hours.\nAt the present time teachers are receiving such large salaries that I think we should give Miss Cummings more\u2014she has had several years experience. On the other hand she is not strong\u2014has lately had to give up teaching for two years\u2014and I am afraid she may break down again\u2014but if we give her I should like to engage a qualified teacher who would not have come here only she felt she could not remain in the reserve.\n\nWhile on the subject of salaries\u2014I know that Miss Hardie will not be content with her salary long\u2014as soon as her old pupils teaching on the reserve are earning more. She has given the best year of her life in her work here\u2014personally I should prefer a younger brighter teacher\u2014and would very much appreciate it\u2014if some system of pension could be arranged instead of a raise in salary. In schools like this officers after a certain time expect things to be made easier for them each year?\nTheir service - and its hard on them\nmanagement - when an increase of\nsalary is expected with a decrease\nof duties. Miss Hardie is a capable\nteacher - but she has served her this\nhere since twelve years of age -\nand her horizons is very limited -\nand she seems basically looking\nat the ways of the world. I think\na business plan would solve our\ndifficulty.\n\nTruly obediently,\n\nAlbert Briggs\nOTTAWA, December 23rd, 1921.\n\nDear Mrs. Boyce,\n\nI have yours of the 17th instant, referring to the matter of salary for Miss Cummings and the possibility of a pension for Miss Hardie. I will be pleased to offer for the approval of the Deputy a definite recommendation from you as to an increase for Miss Cummings. If you will indicate to me what you believe is fair and just I will be glad to approach Mr. Scott regarding the matter.\n\nConcerning the possibility of a pension for Miss Hardie, I have to state that at the present time there is no provision made for teachers of our residential or day schools upon their retirement. The desirability of pensioning a teacher of Indian children is not often brought to our attention. Day school teachers seldom remain many years in the employ of the Department, and teachers of residential schools are nominated by the church authorities and their care in later years devolves upon the church missionary society if it is found necessary to provide for old age. In the case of Miss Hardie, might I suggest that you write the New England Company in an effort to enlist their sympathy and their action in connection with their retirement fund.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMrs. A. M. Boyce,\nPrincipal, Mohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nIndian Office, Brantford,\nDecember 23rd., 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that on the 20th inst. I made my usual monthly inspection of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nThey were making Christmas preparations and arranging for amusements for the children on that day. Tonight they are giving a concert for the girls and on Monday night arrangements are made for a treat for the boys which will probably take the form of a drive in the motor truck which they received from Toronto. On Sunday the special dinner is a concert and a joint roast pork, turkey and plum pudding and for supper the table is to be specially decorated with flowers and ribbon and they are to have figs, dates, nuts, candies, oranges etc., as extras and on Monday hot pork, vegetables and mince pies etc. Mrs. Boyce expects to have all the pupils present and about eight present for the Christmas holidays as so many parents have been asked to keep them during the holidays as times are so hard on the Reserve that they cannot afford any extra expense.\n\nUnder the new Instructor which they have for Manual Training a great deal of useful work is accomplished as well as useful instruction given to the boys. All the broken chairs, benches etc., are repaired by the boys, new arms and seats put on the chairs some have been upholstered, all the benches in the new green houses have been built by the Manual training class and after New Years they intend to overhaul all the wagons on the farm.\n\nIn the stables there were 19 milking cows, besides 10 calves and the bull. The herd is gradually being improved and brought back to a profit basis. Green houses well filled with vegetables to go to market early when prices are high. Amongst one of the recent purchases of clothing was a quantity of suits purchased from Mr. W. Grant of Montreal, these have to be cut down and altered to fit the boys but Mrs. Boyce cannot get any clothing firm to tender for the work any lower than $750 per suit, the ripping to be done at the school which Mrs. Boyce considers too high, there are about 50 suits required at present. She has now arranged to secure the services of a tailor or tailoress to do the work at the school on a time basis which she thinks would save considerable cost. She expects to have this arrangement made after Christmas.\n\nBlackboards are badly required in both the Junior and Senior class rooms what they have being too high for the children to use. I suggested that tenders be asked for to\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nTo find out what it would cost to get what is needed, Mr. Standing the Inspector has several times called the attention of the Department to the want of blackboards.\n\nMrs. Boyce is also suggesting that the Department make a beginning on the promised addition to the school as the dining room is still in the basement and not at all satisfactory. Also a new building is badly needed and lavatories for both the boys and girls should be furnished thus doing away with the girls bath tub in the laundry and the boys unsanitary lavatory in the out buildings both of which are not in keeping with a modern school.\n\nI am\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGordon J. Smith,\nSupt.\nOTTAWA, December 28th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, reporting on your usual monthly inspection of the Mohawk Institute. In reply I beg to say that this report has been read with interest.\n\nRegarding the blackboards required in both the junior and senior classrooms, I beg to say that, if you will obtain from the principal the dimensions of the boards she requires and state whether slate or hyloplate is preferred, the Department will place an order through the Government Stationery here. You should also state whether it would be necessary to supply with the blackboards, moulting and chalk troughs. Hyloplates can be obtained in widths of 3', 3\u00bd' and 4' and any length, and slate can be obtained in widths 3\u00bd', 4' and 4\u00bd' and in lengths of 3\u00bd', 4', 4\u00bd', 5', 5\u00bd' and 6'. As soon as full information is received regarding the dimensions of the boards required, your order will be placed with the Government Stationery Office.\n\nMrs. Boyce's suggestion regarding the addition to the school building is noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

The program was:\n\n- Carol, \"We Three Kings of Orient Are.\"\n- Song\u2014Carrie Crowe and Sylvia Jamieson.\n- Dance\u2014\"Bacon Piper,\" Helen Frohman, and orchestra.\n- Piano Solo\u2014Florenta Elliott.\n- Dialogue\u2014\"The Ruggles.\"\n- Drill Club Swinging, Senior girls.\n- Recitations\u2014\"Christmas Doings,\" Little girls.\n- Chorus\u2014\"The Bells Are Ringing,\" VI.

Class.\n- Orchestra\u2014Selected.\n- School Yell.\n- Carols\u2014Accompanied by orchestra.\n\nMajor Gordon Smith was chairman and both he and Mr. Standing, teacher, praised the girls for their splendid concert.\n\nAll the numbers were worthy of praise; the recitations were spoken very clearly and the choruses were musical. The drill and flag drill were excellent and the little stories were exceptionally good. The acting was carried throughout showing artistic talent.\n\nThe school room was decorated with Xmas and Christmas bells and other decorations.\n\nBoys' Concert At Mohawk Institute\n\nOn Monday evening at the Mohawk Institute the boys gave a very successful concert that was enjoyed by all in the house and others who came out as visitors. It was long enough to be good and proved to be highly diverting.\n\nThe program included the following numbers: Chorus, \"O Canada,\" by school; drill, by six large boys; solo, \"Good King Wenceslas,\" done by Bertie dance, three little Nigerian song, by Mr. Rogers, school jointing in chorus; sketch, \"Sale of an Automobile,\" dance, three little boys; closing exercise.\n\nMr. Mutter of Hamilton was the chairman. The boys were glad to welcome him back, and were proud to show off the automobile which was bought by the boys for the boys' class. It was a wonderful success. As one girl said at breakfast next morning, \"My, I laughed till my side ache!\" All others echoed this with loud all over. It certainly was surprising the number of accidents that could happen to a second-hand auto when exhibited for sale.\n\nThe dancing done by the three little nurses was excellent. They were amusing.\n\nMr. Mutter congratulated the house and at the close of the exercises an unfortunate accident happened. An open door caused a candle to set fire to the velvet hangings at the back of the chimney. It was soon in an inferno. The heavy curtains were soon pulled down and the fire put out; buckets of water and fire extinguishers which were rushed in did not reach. Many badly scorched heads and ruined curtains and decorations were the result.\nOTTAWA, January 5th, 1922.\n\nDear Mrs. Boyce,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of the newspaper clippings which you forwarded containing an account of the Christmas festivities at the Mohawk Institute.\n\nI have read the newspaper report with interest, and am pleased to learn that the children had such a successful and enjoyable time and that they acquitted themselves favourably in the performance which they put on.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMrs. A. M. Boyce,\nPrincipal, Mohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nSCHOOL. All the services were held at the School as there is no means of heating the Church. On November 5th the Church was decorated for Thanksgiving Service and on Christmas Day a very pleasing effect was obtained by using cedar, poinsettias and holly in a most artistic manner about the silver and brass candle-sticks. Holy Communion was celebrated on November 13th and December 11th. At the close of the Christmas Service Mr. Fiske said Good-bye to the children as he was leaving to take up the work in another parish.\n\nHEALTH. A few colds with sore throats and rheumatism caused by the unset tied weather were the orders. John Antone's arm which was broken made a perfect recovery and he is now free from pain. He has put his thumb whilst on holidays and Uncle has had a badly impacted fracture of his tooth. Both are better. Florence French whose eye-lids were dreadfully disfigured by burns when she was a baby was operated upon at the local hospital and her appearance is wonderfully improved in appearance. Of course, it will take time for the discolouration to disappear.\n\nNotes\n\nTHANKSGIVING DAY - November 7th was a general holiday and the girls went for walks and called at the stores. A shooting match was arranged for the boys on the Rifle Ranges. The evening was spent in candy making with a taffy pull as the finale.\n\nARMISTICE DAY - November 11th a service was held in the Senior School attended by the pupils and staff so that the two minutes silence was generally observed. Mr. Rogers addressed the school.\n\nTie\n\nAll our pupils visited town in order to see the stores and the Christmas Displays but as there is much croupheria we arranged these trips before the Public School holidays commenced.\n\nThursday and Friday before Christmas we spent in decorating the school rooms and the Entrance Hall. We were able to cut the cedar, hemlock and pine from our own shrubbery. This with red wreathing and bells lent a charmingly festive appearance to the whole building which most of our visitors commented upon.\n\nThe link in the boys playground was flooded on December 20th and the hill by the girls playground was put into condition for skating.\n\nOnly those who have been attending over four years were allowed to go home this Christmas. Although over twenty could have gone home only one boy and five girls chose to go. After this we intend to have no holiday leave until Christmas but will give them during the summer.\n\nAll who remained had a most enjoyable time here. The seniors girls had a party on the Principal's flat on Christmas Eve and afterwards played Santa Claus.\n\nChristmas Dinner on the Sunday was a feast of Roast Pork, pickles and baked beans followed by Plum Pudding and Sauces. The supper tables were bright and cheery with Christmas dollies covered with sandalwood, oranges, nuts, candy, dates and fancy biscuits. On Monday we followed much the same program with variations in the way of food and an addition of mince pies to the menu.\n\nENTERTAINMENT. On the Friday before Christmas the girls gave a Concert and Dance and the boys supplied a program. The programs of these concerts have already been forwarded. Every evening or the week we had arranged for some sort of treat. Either a set of games or a dance or a sing-song attended by some of the officers and all the pupils occupied the time between supper and bedtime. During the day there was splendid skating and coasting to be enjoyed. The motor truck also contributed to the amusement by the holiday trip around the town. To please public interest were made. Over thirty girls accompanied by an official visited Mary Wannaneppe at the Ontario School for the Blind one afternoon and they were shown over the buildings etc., and entertained by the blind girls. The following afternoon a party of blind girls visited this Institution and the girls gave an impromptu concert for their benefit.\n\nNovember 8th, Mr. Rogers went to Toronto to inspect Moto. He chose one the transfer of which was arranged for by the Deputy. November 18th, Mr. Rogers and Mr. Clark went to Toronto and brought back loaded with office furniture. Two large general equipment arrived by rail the same day. November 19th, we sent the truck fully loaded.\nSERVICES.

Mr. Cudmore returned by easy stages with a horse and wagon whilst Mr. Rogers and Clarke returned the same day with a load of ladders, drop cloths and painters' equipment.\n\nNovember 3rd and 4th. Teachers Convention. We took advantage of these two days and had a general clean-up of play-grounds, flower-beds and all untidy spots made so by the falling leaves. The attic and store-room were also overhauled. We have a quantity of most useful stores from the D.S.C.R. many of which are in use but others we have procured ready for equipping a larger Dining Hall.\n\nFloretta Elliott commenced taking violin lessons at the Conservatory. We have some instruments for a small orchestra but so far, have not found a suitable teacher.\n\nThe Sunday Class under Mr Coutts is held weekly and the pupils are making good progress.\n\nFire Drill was practised on November 14th and December 9th. On the latter occasion the girls were playing in the basement and failed to hear the alarm. To obviate this we are installing electric Alarms. This is being installed by the Manual Training Classes and the equipment was in part obtained from the D.S.C.R.\n\nNovember 30th. We posted transfer of Stock belonging to the New England Company to that Company.\n\nNovember 6th. Mr. Standing inspected Schools.\n\nNovember 29th and December 20th.

A water front was installed in one of the kitchen ranges to heat a boiler that was previously heated by gas.\n\nA new toilet was installed in the boys dormitory to replace one broken.\n\nAll glass was inspected and broken glass replaced. The Storm windows were overhauled, repaired, cleaned and put up.\n\nThe room usually occupied by the farm hands as a bedroom was re-furnished as a Study room for the senior boys.\n\nThe Western Canadian Electric Co. reported that two of our poles were down on November 18th, but they made temporary repairs until the Hydro line was restored. The school is now equipped with a 5 H.P. motor and our troubles so far an insufficient power supply over. The Hydro contract was signed on November 30th the day connections to that service were completed.\n\nThe Girls Playground has been levelled and a new fence built around it.\n\nRough partitions were built up in the attic and a large store-room formed in which can be locked all stores liable to be tampered with. All cupboards containing clothing have been lined with tar paper to insure protection from moths.\n\nThe Carpenter's shop has been re-arranged. Stairs were built from the shop to basement which now contains all stores, paints and fittings. The shop itself has been adapted as a Manual Training centre. The electric lights were amended and a stove erected. All this work has been part of the Manual training programme which while it aims to teach the finer work also ensures that the pupils learn such carpentering and fitting as will be most useful to those who follow farming as a vocation.\n\nThe Manual Training Class has repaired a number of chairs and benches for the School. The bench for the new greenhouse were built by the boys who also made bob-sleighs and outdoor sports tools and their own enjoyment. Picture framing has also been taught and the boys are now competent to make coat hangers.\n\nSome old man-hole tops have been repaired.\n\nOne section of our open drive shed has been partitioned off and extended to accommodate the new truck and the power sprayer. This is fitted with folding doors also made by the boys.\n\nA new road has been made by the new greenhouse and a lower bed put in.\n\nGreat fun was taken by the boys who built a \"proverb\" car which played a great part in the boys' entertainment.\n\nCLOTHING.

A gentleman visitor pulled down the curtain and badly burned his hands. The Fire Insurance adjuster has examined the damage for which we expect compensation but by dint of much steaming, cleaning and repainting we have been able to re-hang the curtain.\n\nAll pupils who went home for holidays returned on Saturday 31st December.\n\nIt was reported to us that an Indian living in town has been cutting wood on the Glebe property and that he has been casting off black soil. This report was handed on to the local Indian Office for action.\n\nAndrew Martin, an old pupil who passed his entrance examination when a pupil here visited us in company with his wife who was a Mount Elgin girl. They had with them their baby in whom we see a prospective pupil.\n\nAn Indian child named Clarence was buried at the Old Mohawk Church November 29th. Our men prepared the grave.\n\nOur apple house was broken into on December 12th by some person who cut out a Yale lock. An attempt was also made to enter the chicken house. A week later the apple house was again entered but this time the heavy hinges were removed. Owing to hard times there is much petty thieving in the district.\n\nOn November the 16th a blizzard put the town in darkness and we were without electricity for some hours. Fortunately, we have a supply of candles and lamps always ready for use and consequently work was not disorganised.\n\nWe killed pigs for the pupils Christmas dinners and had fat chickens for the officers and men.\n\nWe are grateful for many presents. Mr. Hutchison the local bakers gave us pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving, jelly rolls which were acceptable after the concerts besides contributing to Santa Claus.\n\nMr. W. F. Cookshutt gave a case of oranges. Mr. E.V. Burnell presented us with two games of indoor golf and a lady sent us a number of children's books.\n\nMiss Cummings, Mrs. Burnett and Mrs. Neals had the first part of the holidays and Miss Hardie and Mrs. Matthews were away for New Year.\n\nFarm and Garden. The fall ploughing was finished and all fence lines were cleansed of weeds. All rubbish and ashes were cleared away before the heavy frosts set in. A quantity of coal which we had to put in a bin removed from the School building was moved into more convenient bins. All the lands that are endangered by spring floods have been taken up.\n\nGood purchases earlier were sorted for various purposes and the culled wood cut up for kindling. We used a cart-load of straw to Toronto. This is the first occasion that we have had the situation to do this.\n\nWe have bought two cows recently which are proving good milkers.\n\nOwing to the fact that we shall probably be quarantined so far as corn growing in this district next year we have hired a cutting box and engine to cut up corn stalks and so far we have not had to touch our silo which is full of good ensilage and will feed for next winter.\n\nThe barn yards are being kept free from manure this year by removing the manure almost daily. This allows much more exercise room for the animals.\n\n[Signature]\n\n3rd January 1922.\nIndian Office, Brantford,\nJanuary 5th., 1922.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to enclose the bi-monthly report of Mrs. Boyce principal of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nOn the third page, you will notice that she reports that an Indian living in Brantford has been cutting wood on the Glebe property and carting off black soil. I was informed of this last week and gave orders to the Forest Bailiff to investigate the case.

Mrs. Boyce recommends that the salary be fixed at $500.00 a year which also includes board, lodging and washing.

If we could get a loan of $2000 to pay salaries, phone, electricity, and all other orders such as margarine that have to be paid in ten days, we could manage by having all the bills to be paid out of the grant coming in for the quarter ending March 31st.\n\nWe have received a wonderful supply of clothing, furnishings etc from the S.C.R., which will bring down our expenses for the next five years, but on which I did not calculate at the beginning of the year - freight charges, packing charges etc - that account for our shortage. I think the June quarter will see us straight if we do not have to pay for our coal at one time.\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the MOHAWK INSTITUTE, Oct. 17th and November 8, 1921.\n\nBetter seats and desks have been placed in the junior room.

Standing,\n\nInsp.\nJanuary 31st, 1922\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs,\n\nSubject: Indian Affairs\n\nSir -\n\nI draw to your attention the case of Nettie Cleugh - the 13 year old girl who was criminally assaulted last summer. I recently discovered that her teeth were loose and her gums in bad condition and sent her to the \"Free Clinic\" for general treatment. She undoubtedly has gonorrhea - and we are treating for it - hoped to have the result of Wassermann test yesterday - but it did not work - and it may be a week before I can send it to you.\n\nMeanwhile she is a danger in the school - her home is at Ohsweken - where she could get daily treatment from Dr Greenwood. I think we can also get the doctor to round up the young man who assaulted the girl - find his condition - and by that means bring him to trial. Can I disturb you?\n\nFree Treatment Service\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Director\nIndian Office, Trentford,\nJanuary 30th., 1922.\n\nI regret to inform you that Nettie Clancy has developed gonorrhea. Mrs. Joyce got suspicious last week and had her sent to the clinic in Bancroft. It is the verdict. Blood tests were taken to ascertain whether or not she has syphilis but the report is not expected until Wednesday. In the meantime Mrs. Joyce felt that for the sake of the other girls in the Institute she cannot with safety keep Nettie at the school. The dormitory is not sufficient to keep her entirely isolated from the other children and as the danger of infection is considerable, she informed me today that she felt it to be her duty to send the child back to her father or her sister, all of whom live in Ottawa where she could receive the needed medical treatment from Dr. Greenwood. I told Mrs. Joyce today that I would write you today in regard to the matter.\n\nThis development may lead to evidence against Harry Wilson or his associates or both, if so the case any evidence may be got to without a charge against him of having criminally assaulted this girl.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCorion J. Smith,\nSupt.\n\nThe Secretary:\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIn Indian Office, Toronto,\nFebruary 1st., 1928.\n\nSince writing to you on the 30th ult., in regard to Nettie O'Neal, now at the Wi. Institute, I have been making further enquiries and find that her father who is a widower lives with his eldest daughter Mrs. D. L. Martin and in the house are three children from Martin's first wife and two young unmarried girls, the family is very large and it is doubtful if they will have proper treatment when there. I confess I am at a loss in regard to what should be done with Nettie so I urge instead that she can get work or try to be self-supporting here in the vicinity.\n\nI am,\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary-\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, February 4th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 30th ultimo and the 1st instant regarding the case of Nettie Clemch, a pupil of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a communication was received from the principal requesting that authority be given for the discharge of this girl and that she be sent home. There is no doubt that she cannot, with safety, remain in the school. In view of your report concerning the house conditions of this girl and the doubt of her receiving proper treatment from them, it is very difficult to decide what should be done in order that she will receive proper treatment. Her discharge from the school is imperative and is approved.\n\nIt may be possible for you to have her placed in a hospital where she would receive the necessary medical attention, and I would be pleased if either you or Mrs. Boyce would make the necessary enquiries and arrange, if possible, to have her accepted in some hospital or institution, and the Department will pay the cost of her maintenance and treatment.\n\nYou should arrange to see that the expenditure incurred for this purpose is kept down to the lowest possible point, and as soon as the hospital authorities consider that she has sufficiently recovered to prevent infection, she should be sent home.\n\nYou should take immediate steps to have her placed in a hospital or elsewhere where she will receive the attention her case requires, as it is necessary that she leave the school as soon as possible. You should consult Mrs. Boyce and together it is hoped that some solution can be made of the problem as to what is best to be done to give this girl the necessary care and attention her case demands.\n\nI will be pleased to hear from you later as to what arrangements you have made in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nGordon J. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBRANTFORD, Ont.\nBRANTFORD, 18th February 1929\n\nRussell T Ferrier Esq\nSupt of Indian Education\nDepartment of the Interior\nOttawa Ont.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nWill you please be so good as to inform me as to the method pursued in the purchase of supplies for the Indian Schools situated on the Reserve near Brantford.\n\nI understand that formerly all necessary supplies were obtained from J.L. Sutherland & Co., Stationers of this City but that recently there has been some change in the system so that the business is not done through him. He has a large stock of goods on hand and feels very anxious to dispose of them. I believe that the business was always satisfactory and the goods supplied at reasonable and just prices. Mr. J.L. Sutherland enjoys a very high local reputation in his business and for reliability.\n\nCan you tell me of any reason why the business should not still be done through his firm?\n\nI remain yours sincerely,\n\nW.G. Raymond.\nOttawa, February 22nd, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to the supplies for the Indian day schools on the Six Nations Reserve.\n\nChapter 50, R.S.C., 1906, \"An Act respecting the Department of Public Printing and Stationery,\" requires that all such supplies be purchased through the Government Stationery Office. Previous to 1918, the supplies for the schools on the Six Nations Reserve were purchased in this manner. About January 1, 1918, several complaints were received regarding inconvenience caused the schools owing to delay in securing supplies ordered through the Government Stationery Office; and, as these supplies were paid from Indian Trust Fund and not from Parliamentary appropriation, the Department decided to allow purchases being made from different local merchants. At that time the Indian Superintendent was instructed to obtain prices for supplies from different dealers and to purchase at the lowest price.\n\nIn December, last, the Purchasing Commission of Canada, who must pass on all expenditures either from Indian Trust fund or Parliamentary appropriation, drew the Department's attention to the requirements of the Act above quoted, and pointed out that they could not see their way clear to authorise payment of supplies purchased otherwise than required by the Act. The Department is, therefore, at the present time, purchasing supplies through the Government Stationery Office.\n\nI might point out that the Government Stationery Office purchases all supplies in large quantities and at wholesale rates, and a recent comparison of prices showed that an appreciable saving would result in securing the supplies in this manner.\n\nFrom the information furnished in this letter, I feel that you will appreciate that supplies can only be purchased in the present manner, and that, in view of the Act and the requirements of the Purchasing Commission of Canada, this Department has no other alternative.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. G. Raymond, Esq., M.P.,\nBrantford,\nOnt.\nOttawa, February 28, 1923.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs is desirous of having the Behawk and Lytton Industrial schools come under the care of the missionary society of the Church of England in Canada. I therefore make this formal request, believing it to be in the best interests of these two institutions.\n\nIn this connection, I wish to refer you to my communication to you of the 31st of October, last, which sets forth in detail the agreement between the New England Company and the Department of Indian Affairs. It will be a source of much gratification to me if the Behawk and Lytton Industrial schools are placed by your board in the same category as the Church of England Indians residential schools in Canada.\n\nIt is understood that the maintenance grants provided by the New England Company will be funded with the appropriation for school purposes, to be applied towards the per capita earnings of the institutions in question.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, M.D.,\nGeneral Secretary, Missionary Society,\nChurch of England in Canada,\n151 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nToronto, Ont.\nMarch 4th, 1922\n\nSir:\n\nWill you kindly let me know if you require the Annual Report for the Department made out on the form issued last year.\n\nI am leaving for England April 7th and hope to have everything up to date. You will notice by bi-monthly report that the farm foreman was discharged\u2014Mr. Rogers is going to take over the entire management of the outside departments so he will be able to help me with the office work as he has done lately. I think it will save friction in the farm and gardens department and Mr. Rogers is most enthusiastic.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, March 9, 1922.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 4th instant, referring to the Mohawk Institute. I have noted that you are leaving for England on April 1st and that Mr. Rogers is now in charge of both the farm and garden.\n\nIn reply to your query concerning the annual report, I have to inform you that the new report forms are still in the hands of the printer, and, as you are desirous of having everything up to date before you leave, I am enclosing some of last year's forms which you can use.\n\nI am looking forward to visiting the Mohawk Institute this spring, and, as I wish to be in Brantford before you leave for England, I propose the week of April 10. If this date is suitable to you, I will inform the Principal of the Mount Elgin Institute that I am coming to Western Ontario at that time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nEnclos.\n\nMrs. A. M. Boyce,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nDear Secretary,\n\nI am writing to you because I don't know any of the men officers and I trust you will help me to make a wrong right. When I was a pupil there at school I went to town one Thursday and while in town a man (a stranger) stopped me in the street, and asked me how many boys were at school. I told him the number there were there and he gave me a dollar ($1.) to buy a present for them. But I kept the money and spent it for myself. And now I am sending you the money to give it to the boys there now. It is the least that I can do. Please give it to them in any way that you see fit.\n\nThis is all.\n\nYours sincerely for the Best,\n\n(Signed) Lewis Laforme\n\nFour dollars was enclosed\u2014which we have contributed to our \"Honor Roll\" fund.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAnn Beagle\nMarch 7th, 1932.\n\nDear Mrs. Boyce,\n\nI was quite interested this morning in reading a copy of letter received by Miss Hardy from Lewis Laforme. Instances of the payment of \"conscience money\" are not rare, but I think it speaks well for the training that this boy received while in the institution. Unfortunately the letter does not show where Laforme is now living. I take it, however, that he is prospering to an extent that he feels he should make good the wrong that he did some time in the past.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMrs. A. C. Boyce,\nJohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nR.R.No. 6, Hagersville, Ont.\nMay 1, 1922.\n\nMy Lord Bishop,\n\nAt the last Council Meeting here on the Reserve the question was asked \"is it true that a girl of 13, a pupil in the Mohawk Institute, was about to be confined?\" The Assistant Principal said it was so, but that the girl was well cared for. After a discussion several of the chiefs advocated the closing up of the school.\n\nI think, My Lord, there should be an investigation as to who is responsible for this state of affairs. I understand this is not the first case of the kind that has occurred.\n\nSeveral of the children have run away from the Institute the last couple of months and could not be induced to go back. There is something radically wrong in the present management.\n\nYours respectfully\n\n(signed) James G. White.\nLondon, March 3, 1922.\n\nThe Reverend\n\nCanon Gould\n\nConfederation Life Bldg.,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI enclose to you a copy of a letter which I received this morning from the Rev. Mr. White, one of our Missionaries on the Indian Reserve at Kanyen'keh. It shows that the condition of affairs at the Brantford Institute is by no means satisfactory. As yet, of course, we have no power to conduct any investigation, but, if, when we take over the Institution at Brantford, we discover things to be in the condition indicated by this letter, there will be lots of work to do.\n\nBelieve me, yours faithfully,\n\nDavid Huron.\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nToronto, Ontario March 6th 1922\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nEnclosed please find correspondence received by today's mail from the Bishop of Huron. The matter alleged therein is of such importance that I feel confident you will desire to have the information placed directly in your hands. Kindly return the correspondence after perusal.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated,\n\n(1) Feb. 25th, dealing with the future management of the Mohawk and Lytton Industrial Schools.\n\n(2) Feb. 28th, in connection with the difficulties arising out of different religious beliefs when recruiting pupils for Indian Residential Schools.\n\nI will bring the former of these two letters before our Executive Committee for consideration at its next meeting on Thursday, March 30th.\n\nReports received seem to indicate that the Rev. A.R. Lett is happily and successfully entering upon his duties as Principal of the Lytton School. There is, therefore, no reason for undue hurry in connection with the transfer of that Institute, I hope, however,\nthat it will be possible to complete arrangements under our usual procedure re estimates in order that the M.S.C.C. may assume administrative responsibility as from Jan. 1st 1923.\n\nThe condition of affairs at the Mohawk Institute, if the statements alleged in the enclosed correspondence be true, would indicate the desirability of more immediate action and the early transfer of responsibility to the Missionary Society. We have, I may say, a very experienced and reliable clergyman, with a practical knowledge of farming, who would be willing to assume the Principalship at an early date. Our difficulty arises, as I described to you, from the fact that our financial estimates for the next Calendar year are passed upon and decided by our Board of Management at its annual meeting in September. As an expedient, under the circumstances, I suggest that, in the case of the Mohawk Institute, the Missionary Society should assume administrative responsibility at an early date the Department, however, to guarantee, for this year only, the Society against financial loss in the conducting of the Institute, an obligation which the Department is, of course, carrying.\n\nIf you think it desirable to carry out this suggestion we shall of course assume the administrative responsibility without prejudice to subsequent negotiations concerning the financial basis which, after due investigation, may appear to be necessary as a condition of the assumption by the Missionary Society of permanent responsibility for the Institute.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nMarch 8th, 1922.\n\nDear Canon Gould,\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with enclosures returned herewith.\n\nI am somewhat surprised at the tone of the letters from His Lordship the Bishop of Huron and the Reverend James White because they seem to take for granted that the report is true. His Lordship says that it is shown that the condition of affairs at the Monseak Institute is by no means satisfactory. I consider that the condition of affairs at the institute is highly satisfactory - we must have a conversation with reference to the staff there; but I trust that His Lordship's letter does not foreshadow a desire to make any change in the management of the institution.\n\nThe facts with regard to the case mentioned in Mr. White's letter are as follows: a girl named Bettie Clench claims that a criminal assault was made upon her when she was at home for the holidays. Mrs. B. has reported this to me as soon as she knew of it in the autumn, and we endeavoured to prosecute the guilty party but failed to get any corroborative evidence. The girl was watched carefully and has never been reported to me as anything. However, we have discovered that she had contracted a venereal disease and last month I ordered that she should be discharged from the school and placed in a hospital in order that she might have proper care. From the moment I heard of this case it has been under my own observation. I do not want to make any extended comment on Mr. White's...\nMr. White's letter, further than that the Chiefs of the Six Nations would close up the Mohawk Institute tomorrow if they could do so - not from any reasons of mismanagement or any cause for dissatisfaction but simply from their inextirpate desire to thwart the Department in its best endeavours for their progress. The implied idea that, because two children ran away from the school, there is something radically wrong with the management, shows little appreciation of the difficulties with which we have to contend.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

Gould, M.D.,\n131 Confederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nToronto, Ontario, March 14th 1922\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated Feb. 25th conveying the information that,\n\n\"The Department of Indian Affairs is desirous of having the Mohawk and Lyiston Industrial Schools come under the care of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\".\n\nYour communication will be considered at the next meeting of the Executive Committee to be held on Thursday, March 30th.

My idea is to obtain a new cheque book & sign my signature thereon, and have it with Major Smith at the Indian Office.\n\nDaily salaries, emergency accounts, and monthly accounts need be paid - the butcher, grocer etc are only necessarily paid quarterly. The Rogers would present accounts to Major Smith and obtain his signature.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPov.

I will in all probability catch some morning train from Toronto.

I have noted the fact that truancy has hurt the attendance at the institute, and it is my suggestion that one or two of the worst boys be committed to the Mimico Industrial School. This action would have a good all round effect on the general discipline, not only at the school but on the reserve. The cost of their maintenance at Mimico can be met from the Vote for Indian Education, if it is thought unwise to charge the account to the Band funds. What is your opinion regarding such a proposal?\n\nDuring Mrs. Boyce's absence in England, I believe it advisable that the Bank be instructed to honour cheques jointly signed by Mr. Rodgers, the Assistant Principal, and yourself.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL.

The supper was provided by the boys.\n\nIt has been installed a series of fire alarms throughout the building connected to a large siren in the entrance hall. We obtained the alarm from the D.S.C.R. Toronto.\n\nThe shoe finishing machine has been installed in the Carpenter's shop and the boys are receiving instruction in shoe repairing. They are very interested in the work which is made so much more attractive to them by the installation of the machine.\n\nBoth boys and girls lower dormitories have been painted.\n\nThe cottages shed and the coal bins in the greenhouse have been completed.\n\nAny farm implements and two farm wagons have been overhauled and painted by the boys in the course of their manual training.\n\nA power drill, broom-making and printing machine received from the D.S.C.R. has been erected here and enables us to manufacture such things as double-trees, neck-yokes, wagon plates and machinery parts.\n\nAll these things are being done by the boys under instruction and they are showing great interest.\n\nWe have been able to prune a great deal this year and our orchards are greatly improved. The greenhouse lettuce is ranks with the best in town as there has been a steady call for our forced rhubarb. We have had no failures of flowers and have been able to supply the demand.\n\nThe boys have been very busy in the garden and have been able to grow a good crop of vegetables.

This has caused a great deal of traffic over our farm roads as part of the road is blocked at times.\n\nFour boys have been giving considerable trouble by absconding. Leonard Wilson who is sixteen has reportedly abandoned us. We have had him returned because we had hopes of doing something with him. He is a lazy fellow who has taken schooling no account at all.\n\nTheodore Joseph is a worthless type and very shiftless. He has a father and relatives who are capable of looking after him and so he lives near a school where he has refused to re-admit him.\n\nBaron Ray was returned very promptly by his parents who find very difficult to handle, but as we have the support of his parents we took him back and will try to make something of him.\n\nRobert Morgan is a constant runner, he not infrequently returns of his own free will, but he is a disappointment to us all. He is bright and very intelligent but very lazy also. He is strong although underfed and he could do well with his studies if he would only try himself.\n\nAs he has only an aunt and grandmother who ever take any interest in him we feel that it would be a good idea to take him back although his presence in the school is harmful to the morale. He could try his entrance this year.\n\nWe engaged a tailor at $28.00 per week and he re-made the boys uniforms. This was an excellent opportunity for the girls to work at tailoring and some of them did very well. The uniforms have a very nice look and are uniforms which have only cost us $4.00 each.\n\nWe kept the tailor an extra week cutting girls coats but as we found we could not possibly complete the coats and dresses by the end of April we decided to discontinue with the tailor until the Fall. This will allow us to have the dresses completed for the spring.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMarch 6th, 1922\nOTTAWA, March 29th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of the bi-monthly report of the Principal of the Mohawk Institute for the months of January and February, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I have noted the activities that have been carried on during these two months, and that the work is progressing satisfactorily in all branches.

It is located just outside of town and has been opened recently. The students are doing well and the teachers are very enthusiastic.\n\nI hope you will be able to visit soon. We would love to show you around.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, March 31, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Smith:\n\nI have yours of the 27th instant, concerning my proposed visit to the Mohawk Institute and the Six Nation day schools.\n\nI am grateful for your information concerning the roads, and I have to inform you that I will set aside the 20th and 21st of April for the day school problem. I will arrive in Brantford on the 18th and, after a couple of days at the Mohawk Institute, I will visit the work further west and come back to the day school inspection on the above mentioned dates. If Mrs. Boyce's departure for England will make it difficult for you to assist me on the 20th and 21st, you had better wire me to that effect, and I will make still another change in my plans.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nGordon J. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPersonal copy attached to this letter.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that I made a visit to the Mohawk Institute yesterday as Mrs. Boyce happened to have me there before she left for England on her holiday. I was there this afternoon. She has on the roll 69 girls and 13 boys, being absent at present. The main part of the halls and corridors have been grained and varnished which I believe is the first time this has been done since the building was put up. The upper dormitory on the second floor has been freshly white washed and painted which makes it look very clean and neat. The whole building inside has now been painted and cleaned up.\n\nAmongst the recent army supplies received from Toronto was a large number of red bed covers, all the beds in the boys dormitory are now covered with these goods which gives it a good warm, cozy appearance. They also have enough for the girls beds, but they are not yet in use. One girl was recently discharged as she had a slight case of Tuberculosis following a bad attack of pneumonia. Mrs. Boyce thought she required plenty of fresh air and good food such as eggs, milk and as her father Frank Montour a returned soldier is comfortably well off she should be well looked after at home.\n\nA new chicken house with runways is being built as it is proposed to increase the number of chickens. Seeding started about ten days ago but owing to recent wet weather, rain and floods, it has stopped for the present.\n\nIf the present heating system is to be used next winter 140 tons of egg coal and 70 tons of nut will be required, but if a new furnace is put in which is expected, soft coal will be used.\n\nThe Honor Roll prepared at the meeting of the New England Company just arrived at the Institute yesterday which contains 56 names and is beautifully engrossed and illustrated with a picture of the Institute and the Mohawk River and surrounded with the flags of the Allies. I understand a similar copy is to be presented to the Indian Department, the cost is $100.00 which is to be raised by subscription, a large portion of it having been already subscribed for it.\n\nThe account in the Bank is over drawn to the extent of more than $1000.00 partly caused by the delay in the promised grant from the New England Company which was mentioned in a\n\nThe Secretary\u2014\nDept.of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nin a recent letter from the Department but which grant has not yet come. About the middle of May Mrs. Boyce says the garden will produce enough revenue to carry on, but at present $1200.00 is required to cover an over draft until the New England Company Grant arrives.\n\nThey are looking forward to the visit of Mr. Ferrier next week.\n\nI am\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGordon J. Smith,\nSupt.\nOttawa, April 24, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have yours of the 20th instant, referring to conditions generally at the Mohawk Institute at the time of Mrs. Boyce's departure for England.\n\nI have noted that the interior of the building has a much fresher appearance, following the decorating that has been done recently. The action in connection with the girl who was discharged, following the development of tuberculosis, is approved.\n\nIt is hoped that Parliament will see fit to vote funds to enable this Department to carry out certain repairs and alterations at Mohawk this year, and the securing of a supply of coal will have to wait until such time as further information is known concerning the type of furnace which will be in use next winter.\n\nThe Department is pleased to learn that a copy of the honour roll is to be presented to Ottawa. I believe this will be the first gift of its kind from anywhere in Canada.\n\nI have noted that $1200.00 is required to cover an overdraft, until the New England Company grant arrives. If, in the course of a day or two after receipt of this letter, it is advisable to have an advance on the quarterly earnings, and you will intimate this fact, a ready response will follow your request.\n\nMy plans are unchanged of late, and I expect to be in Brantford on Thursday, the 27th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGordon J.

Mr. Pearson of St. John's Church took the services during March and April. Rev. Mr. Owen the new Pastor of Trinity Church took charge in April. Holy Communion was administered the second Sunday of each month. On Good Friday the children attended the three-hour service in St. Jude Church and on Easter Sunday the church was beautifully decorated by the pupils. On Easter Sunday the boys attended Trinity Church and the girls attended St. Jude's Church for the special afternoon service for children. We opened the Jehovah Church for Sunday services on April 30th. Professor Anderson took the service on May 6th.\n\nHealth: We had an epidemic of Grippe in March which developed into pneumonia in some cases. Dorothy Montgomery did not make a good recovery and was consequently allowed to go home on sick leave. We had another epidemic of Grippe in June.\n\nOfficials: Mrs. Myers, housekeeper had a bad attack of Grippe and as she did not get strong again she left on April 5th.

Several evenings have been devoted to dancing for the boys and girls. The boys joined the local School \"Aerobics league\" and gave a very good account of themselves. We were lucky enough to secure an old mural, Mr. J. Lockhart, as a contribution. On July 24th all the pupils went to Mohawk Park to attend the opening game of the season. Our boys won, the score being 4-0. In their return supper we served on the lawn and games were played. On June 14th, the children all went to a circus presentation and were admitted to the show in the afternoon.\n\nVisiting Inspectors: Major Smith inspected April 19th, May 27th, and June 25th. Mr. Standing, Public Schools Inspector, examined school on March 13th and 14th. Mr. Abrams visited on April 7th and 8th and visited again on June 27th, 28th, and 29th, devoting part of his time to schools on reserve. The Indians were inspected by Col.

Ferney called on June 5th re deed of St. John's property.\n\nRev. Owen, our new clergyman visits frequently and takes evening prayers occasionally.

Besides our usual strangers to town we have received visits from the Ontario Bureau Convention, April 1st, Water Works Convention, May 20th, Congregational Convention June 7th, and the British teachers from Toronto on June 20th.\n\nOther: We painted all the old brick white for the girls and grey for the boys. The corridors in the wings have been repainted and varnished. All woodwork and panelings of front hall were repainted. Slate blackboards have been installed in Schoolrooms. The classrooms have been repaired and the girls' upper dormitory has been whitewashed and painted. Miss Smith, our old janitor, who passed away and standard at the Conservatory of Music here, graduated this spring. It is claimed that she is the first Indian in Canada with this degree. Miss Joyce left for England on April 1st.\n\nThe floods this spring the second, which was unexpected, was due to heavy rain. We suffered severely from a storm on March 31st. Electric, telephone and telegraph lines were torn down and many of our ornamental trees were badly damaged.\n\nWe purchased a large flock here from the imported stock of Mr. F. Shutt.\n\nIncubators were started on March 10th. Our young chickens have done well. We were able to purchase a very fine cow.\n\nWe sent our cows to pasture for daytime on May 10th and were able to milk them on the 17th.\nThe interior of the horse stable has been remodelled and a harness room built in. The pig pens have been overhauled and repaired.\n\nWe were fortunate enough to secure some very large tile from the City with which we have made a culvert to replace an old wooden bridge which was becoming unsafe.\n\nThe farm is now managed from this office, the farm foreman not being replaced, and we find the arrangement much more satisfactory.\n\nAll our crops have done well so far and promise good yields.\n\nWe have completed trying and have in our barns 83 tons of choice hay.\n\nWe have been able to sell the local markets in the supply of tomatoes, peas, cabbages and cauliflowers from our garden.\n\nOur hot-house cucumbers have been on sale for over a month and are fetching big prices.\n\nSUPPLIES\n\nWe have been very fortunate in securing supplies from the H.S.O.R.R., most of which we have been able to haul ourselves from Toronto in the big Kelly truck.\n\nRecently we obtained a Fordson truck which has greatly added to the efficiency of the farm and garden, besides bringing much pleasure to the pupils who are from time to time taken for rides.\n\nWe received a large quantity of red counterpanes and pink bedspreads from the A.D.A. Green dresses and material to match from which we have been able to make three sets and four skirts with two waistcoats to match.\n\nWe have also been able to supplement our very poor furniture with desks, chairs, cabinets, kitchen utensils and tools. Two typewriters were procured and these are most useful for our advanced pupils who are attending Business College.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJuly 29th, 1927\nOttawa, August 3, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, informing the Department of the dates on which the Mohawk Institute will be closed for summer holidays, also stating the changes that have been made in the staff.\n\nIt is noted that temporary arrangements have been made to supply the place of Junior Teacher, Sewing Teacher and Housekeeper.

Also attending are the Hamilton and Hamilton Collegiates and the Caledonia and Ingersoll High Schools, and we pay our share of the net costs at these institutions and in addition give a small grant to the parents of the children attending so that proper clothing can be provided. Further, one pupil from the Six Nations Reserve is, with our help, attending each of the following institutions:\u2014Canada Business College, Toronto; Brantford Business College; Lester Memorial College, Montreal; Upper Canada College, Toronto. In these last mentioned cases we assist with a grant of from $100 to $150 per academic year. The band funds are used for the payment of the tuition and special grants for the 29 Indian children attending the local Collegiates and high schools. The other 8 are receiving assistance from the appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nI have outlined these facts in an effort to show you that we are doing all we can to provide a higher education for the brighter boys and girls on the reserve. If there is any accommodation in the Mohawk Institute we are always pleased to have high school pupils in attendance there, and I wish to assure you that the matter of providing a continuation school right on the reserve is receiving serious consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

Canon S.

Mr. Ashton has returned from Canada where he had been living with his son Vallee during the summer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, Oct. 5, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, reporting on your recent inspection of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nWith reference to the children who are absent without leave, I beg to say that arrangements should be made at once to have them returned to the school. The three Carpenter children, especially, should be returned as soon as possible and, if necessary, the services of a constable may be obtained for the purpose.\n\nThe principal should be careful in granting leave, to see that only those pupils who would return promptly upon the expiry of such leave, be allowed home.\n\nWe are pleased to learn that the general work of the institute is progressing favourably, and the changes in the staff have been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Smith,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nOTTAWA, October 31st, 1922.\n\nSir -\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th instant, with reference to the amount charged by Truant Officer John R. Lickers in returning pupils to the Mohawk Institute.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department considers he should be allowed only his railway fare, bed, breakfast, dinner and stabling for his horse in Brantford. The charge of $1.50 for arresting each child and 50 miles of mileage cannot be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nGordon J. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nOn July 9th we had our closing service and also celebrated Holy Communion. As most of our pupils left for one month's holiday we discontinued services at the Church and the few remaining attended Trinity Church. Services recommenced in the Old Mohawk Church on August 13th and on September 10th we held a Communion Service. Our Harvest Festival service was conducted by an outside clergyman and the Church was prettily decorated for the occasion by the pupils.\n\nThe General Synod met in Brentford about this time and the Primate, Archbishops and clergy were very interested visitors to both the Church and the School. The Rev. Mr. Preuer of the wonderful new school at Chapleau stayed with us and took the services on September 24th.\n\nSTAFF. Miss Higginson, a graduate of the O.A.C., was appointed to the Junior School.\n\nMiss Elsie Clausen, one of our own pupils who has just completed a year's course at the Business College has undertaken the duties of sewing teacher.\n\nThe pupils returned AUGUST August 12th. The older boys were in many cases kept back on the farms or where they were employed and some have not yet returned. As Miss Hardie did not return for two weeks after the pupils the older girls were given special instruction in Domestic Science, Fancy Sewing and Knitting for which the supplies from the D.S.C.R. were most acceptable. Many girls are wearing scarfs or sweaters of their own make.\n\nThe D.S.C.R. supplies have filled many long felt wants. The pupils now have feather pillows. On receiving a supply from the D.S.C.R. we had to empty the feathers into clean cases. Our office is now properly equipped and the typewriters are available for pupils who are taking courses. We feel especially grateful for a number of heavy green V.A.D. greatcoats which fit our older girls and are hoping to obtain a number more in order to make them over for our smaller pupils. The blue dress ingownes have been made over into useful and becoming dresses for our girls. We have just completed making the boys a suit of \"teddy-bear\" overalls for outside wear this winter. This will enable us to issue the hospital clothing we have received for the boys to wear underneath.\nUpon the recommendation of Mr. Orr we pulled down an unsafe chimney and replaced same with galvanized piping.\n\nMrs. Boyce returned from England July 4th.\n\nMrs. and Miss Gerrie Smith left for the West on July 5th.\n\nDr. Westgate, Field Secretary M.S.C.O., wrote July 11th requesting reports, inventories etc., re taking over School.\n\nMajor Smith paid his regular monthly visit of inspection.\n\nJessie MacNaughton, Sylvia Jamieson and Floretta Elliott passed the Entrance Examination to local Collegiate. Jessie is attending the local Collegiate; Sylvia is living at home and attending the continuation School at Omandana; and Floretta is taking a course in telegraphy at the offices of the C.N.R. These pupils, with Hazel Elliott who is accepted for training at the Brantford General Hospital as a nurse, are in receipt of the grant from the Department of $100.\n\nGerrie Crowe completed her course at the Business College, has a good position in town and is boarding at the Y.W.C.A.\n\nOscar Hess is taking special course in farming and is leaving in the Spring to commence farming for himself.\n\nMr. White of the Department, with three assistants spent several days surveying Institutes property.\n\nMr. Orr and a representative from the Dunham heating firm inspected on July 26th. re alterations and extensions.\n\nMr. Redermacher of the D.S.C.R., Toronto visited August 5th, and Mr. Keating also of the D.S.C.R., was here August 10th.\n\nMr. Rogers visited Ottawa September 24th.\n\nSports. July 12th, our boys played lacrosse at Chawaken.\n\nAmusements. Football and Base-ball are very popular games with the boys. During the holidays the remaining pupils had a very enjoyable time. In fact several who were not called for at closing decided to remain so as not to miss the fun.\n\nThe pupils attended several lectures and entertainments in town. We find that local folks are beginning to take an interest in our work and are often issuing invitations for our children to attend happenings in town.\n\nFarms. Crops generally have been good and our farm is beginning to improve but owing to the serious Industrial situation in Brantford prices are very much down and consequently farmers in the district are suffering financially.\nwe baled twenty nine tons of straw on August 16th.\n\nDuring the fruit season in Niemara we sent truck loads of baled straw to Grimsby. This we exchanged for fruit on the trees and a party of boys had a good outing to pick same which we brought back to Trentford and sold on the market at a very fair profit in addition to supplying the School with canned fruit for the winter.\n\nWe have rebuilt our chicken houses. These houses are of the portable type which will reduce the cost of removal when next necessary.\n\nWe commenced cutting corn for silo on September 15th.\n\nFarmers in this locality have for several years discussed the question of buying a community power plant of some kind. Mr. Rogers was able to purchase a 12-24 H.P. Tractor through some friends at a very reasonable figure and this has met a local want and bids fair to becoming a stable source of revenue to the School. This year it has already earned sufficient to pay running expenses and to cover the first installment. We only made this purchase on September 5th.\n\nWe have been able to supply the pupils very liberally with small fruits and apples and our preserve cupboards are full.\n\n[Signature]\nAlice Boyce\nSept. 14th, 1922\nOTTAWA, November 10, 1922.\n\nMadam -\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your report for the quarter ending September 30th, last, reporting on the general activities of the Mohawk Institute during that period.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are pleased to note the work of the school has progressed satisfactorily.\n\nI also note that the pupils, with a few exceptions, have returned from holidays, and that the classroom work is progressing satisfactorily.\n\nIt is further noted that the crops, generally, were good, and that an ample supply of fruit was secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Our informant is the Bishop of Huron.\n\nWe also heard that St George's School, Lytton had actually been taken over by the M.S.C.C.\n\nThe members of the Company will naturally wish to know what is the actual position, and I shall be most grateful if you can give me any information before December 13th.\n\nWith apologies for troubling you,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nCharter Clerk.\nNovember 16, 1922.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 6th November, I have to inform you that while there was at one time a proposal that the N.S.C.C. should take over the administration of the Mohawk Institute, after due consideration it was thought advisable not to make any change at present, and the school is still being conducted under the supervision of the Department, and, I must say, to the satisfaction of the Department.\n\nI have also to inform you that the N.S.C.C. have not as yet assumed any responsibility with reference to the St. George's school at Lytton, B.C., and they have no intention of doing so at the present.\n\nUnder separate cover I am writing to Mr. Matthews, giving a report on the improvements that we are carrying out at the Mohawk Institute. I have very good reports from St. George's school. The Principal seems to be a capable man, and very much interested to make his work a success.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ.R.

I paid a visit to the Mohawk Institute when I was informed that Mr. Sydney Rogers was promoted to the principalship, and that official notice to that effect would reach me in due course.\n\nThe alterations to the building have turned things very much upside down as there is smoke, plaster and dust every place but it seemed to me there was not a great deal of work required to make it much more habitable than it is at present.\n\nThere was no sickness amongst the children and all the children are to remain in the building during the holidays.

Previous to entering this work Mr. Rogers had sound business experience and he will I am sure be able to do justice to the administration work.\n\nI will attend to the internal management of such affairs as could not be easily controlled by a man \u2014 planning during non-work \u2014; changes of uniforms \u2014 clothing and bedding \u2014; supervising dietary buying.\nhousehold supplies\u2014training new officers in their work\u2014overlooking the sick and backward children\u2014and general attention to Chamberlin.\n\nMr. Rogers will continue personal supervision of the boys\u2014from and garden and all outdoor activities\u2014take over the books\u2014records\u2014banking etc.\n\nAs to the question of salaries\u2014they stand at $1200\u2014$1000\u2014I would recommend that Mr. Rogers be raised to $1400\u2014and Miss reduced to $600\u2014and that we devote the remaining $200 towards the salary of a playground mistress when we have accommodation for an salaried officer\u2014but of course this question we leave to your judgment.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.

We have regular reports from Mrs Boyce regarding the Mohawk Institute, but have not heard anything of Lytton for a long time. Perhaps you would be good enough to ask the Principal there to send us a quarterly report.\n\nThe Company are sending out one thousand pounds to the account of the Mohawk Glebe Trustees in Brantford. This is part of the scheme which the Company have adopted of repaying to the Trust the sums taken for the buildings at Lytton, and it is proposed that the Trustees should hand this sum over to the Indian Department towards the expenses of the new buildings. Similarly the yearly grants made for the maintenance of the Mohawk Institute will come through the Trustees.\n\nWith my kindest regards to yourself and Mrs Scott\n\nBelieve me to be,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nGovernor.\nOttawa, Jan. 11, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Mathews:\n\nI have received your letter of the 20th ultimo, with reference to the future of the Mohawk Institute and the Lytton Industrial School.

I wish to thank you for this consideration, and I will see that the funds are expended in alterations or new buildings at the Mohawk Institute.\n\nMrs. Scott wishes to be remembered to you.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nDuncan C.

The usual Sunday services were held in the School-room with Rev. Owen officiating. Special Services were arranged for Thanksgiving and Christmas on each of which occasions the altar and chancel were suitably decorated.\n\nAt the end of October Mr Owen commenced training the Confirmation Class. This year we caused all children over twelve years of age to attend the classes but left them to decide whether they would offer themselves for Confirmation. We were pleased to present thirty candidates (24 girls and 6 boys). Among our interests worthy of note is that a boy who was a Diet and had not given any sign or wanting to be confirmed presented himself during the Confirmation Service.\n\nThe Bishop held the Confirmation Service on December 11th. For which service the School-room was tastefully decorated with masses of Chrysanthemum blooms.\n\nPrior to the Confirmation Service and baptismal was held on December 3rd.\n\nClothing. During the quarter we have been able to buy stockings and mits directly from the mills at Paris and were fortunate in securing a jobber's lot of underwear.\n\nThe girls have very successfully manufactured sets of one-piece overalls for the boys. These serve a double purpose in that they look tidy and cover up the ill-fitting and bright coloured clothing procured from the D.S.O.C., with which we are able to keep our boys very well clad.\n\nStaff. Miss Higgins, a Graduate of the Ontario Agricultural College has been appointed teacher in the Junior School.\n\nOn November 1st we were pleased to welcome Miss Stanley O.A.C., Graduate as housekeeper and Mrs. Haythornthwaite as matron. Mrs. Haythornthwaite was at Moose Factory where her husband was Principal and she has come to us to study the management of a larger institution. She is going to take charge of each department in turn in order to gain an intimate knowledge of detail.\n\nMrs. Matthews left after being in charge of the laundry for three and quarter years.\n\nClass-room Work. This has been faithfully carried out despite the difficulties due to the presence of workmen.\n\nAmusements. October 25th. 25 girls and Miss Hardie went to Girl Guides Concert at the Collegiate.\n\nOctober 6th. The girls were taken to Chawken Fair in trucks and the following day the boys attended.\n\nOctober 30th. Forty pupils attended a Concert at Wellington Street Church to hear Miss Maclean's recital.\n\nOctober 31st. Halloween Masquerade. We had a lot of fun made all the more enjoyable by a pleasant afternoon of games and races.\n\nNovember 4th. We held our first Plowing Match on this date and were fortunate to secure as judges two very experienced men who claimed that they had never seen better plowing accomplished by boys. We have to thank the Department for supplying the prizes on this occasion.\n\nThanksgiving Day it rained but a series of indoor games were played and the girls made a quantity of pretty necklaces from the beads sent by the Department and which we afterwards used as prizes and Christmas\ngifts.\n\nArmitage Day. The pupils attended the Community Service held at the Armories.\n\nDecember 4th. Luckily this was a mild day and we were able to hold our Annual Sports which had somehow been postponed from time to time. The boys' horse and cattle were judged from a cleanliness point of view and such good work was done that there was nothing but praise. The announcement of the wedding of Mr. and Mrs. Rogers was made by Mr. Owen following which the Prizes for Sports day and the Ploughing Matches were distributed. The evening was concluded by a feast of nuts and candy and a dance.\n\nDecember 19th. The Arcade, a local store, invited our pupils to a reception by Santa Claus and afterwards entertained them to a Punch and Judy show. All pupils had opportunities to visit the local stores before Christmas.\n\nDecember 23rd. The outdoor rink was made.\n\nDecember 25th. The Senior School-room was decorated for Christmas.\n\nThe Christmas holidays were much enjoyed by all. This year no pupils were allowed to go home. From previous experiences we have found that the small number who do go home usually return with more such trouble as the itch or scabies and this leads to a great deal of trouble. Then there is always a section whose parents disappoint them and they are difficult to satisfy while away. Fortunately that none would go home and consequently all the pupils just looked forward to having a good time at school. We started off by giving every child a present of some kind and as there was a plentiful supply of nuts and candy besides very excellent meals we found that we were able to have a very happy time. Every day some special amusement was planned such as truck rides or sleighing parties.\n\nDecember 28th. I was able to obtain a free pass for the whole school to the Brant Theatre. Special pictures of interest to children were kindly shown.\n\nNotes. One of our senior girls, Carrie Crowe, graduated from the Business College and has secured a position as stenographer at Bradley, Carrotson.\n\nOn October 23rd, work on the extensions was commenced.\n\nDuring the local Teachers' Conventions no schooltime held and we devoted our attentions to general housecleaning and replacing screens with storm shades.\n\nIrene Edmondson, daughter of one of the farm hands died October 15th and the school was off a number of days.\n\nOn October 23rd, we had to locate the clothing rooms, store rooms and men's dining room in basement to allow reconstruction work to proceed.\n\nOn October 30th, Mr. Rogers and Mr. Clarke secured a quantity of cooking utensils and oats from the B.S.C.R. at Burlington.\n\nMr. Orr visited on Nov. 7th and stayed two days during the commencement of the new heating system.\n\nWe have had considerable difficulty with the heating arrangements this year. We commenced running with wood only and when the coal arrived we suffered from our old furnaces leaking black smoke into every part of the building. However the new system which is almost complete promises to do away with this unpleasantness.\n\nMr. Rogers and Mrs. Boyce were married at the Cathedral in Hamilton on December 12th.\n\nSeveral pupils during this term have applied for admission voluntarily although they were runaways of some time back.\n\nMrs. Boyce, unfortunately, was quite sick during the whole of Christmas holidays and most of the staff have been down at different times. Colds and sore throats have kept numbers of the children in bed a few days.\n\nVisitors. Hon. O. Stewart, Mr. Raymond and Major Smith visited the School on October 6th.\n\nOld pupils attending the Fair paid visits about that time.\n\nMr. Standing, Schools Inspector was here October 17th and 18th.\n\nFarm. The farm work has gone on steadily and we are gradually building up a stock. We have not any surplus milk on the whole farm now although we have been killing sufficient to run the Institute for some time. We have threshed over 1200 bushels of late grain and had to leave a quantity of corn in the field for winter feeding as we had no more room in silo. Our mangolds were excellent and our turnips secured prizes at a local show.\n\nWe were able to earn a nice sum with the tractor by filling silos during the year we have been unfortunate so far as our horses are concerned but we have now some very fine horses in our barns. We lost one cow through sickness.\n\nOwing to an old bridge across a creek collapsing we secured some...\nlarge tile from the city, free of charge, and have built a permanent culvert with cement wall facing.\n\nOne of our boys has been taking a course on farm work and he has become a very useful hand. He expects to run his mother's farm when he leaves so we have given him every opportunity and so far as he is concerned the experiment is a success.\n\nThe greenhouses were a steady source of revenue during the Chrysanthemum season and we sold blooms that were without equals in town.\n\nThe soft coal we have been compelled to use has been disastrous since we find it difficult to keep steady heat with it. However, we have not suffered any very serious losses of stock but we have been unable to produce our usual winter crops of lettuce etc.\n\n28th January 19...\nOTTAWA, February 15th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your report on the activities and progress of the work at the Mohawk Institute during the quarter ending December 31st, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are pleased to note that the work at this school, both in the classroom and on the farm, has progressed satisfactorily.\n\nThe changes made in the staff during the quarter have been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Rogers, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nChurch. All Sunday services were held in the School-room with the Rev. Mr. Owen in charge. Holy Communion was administered on the second Sunday of each month. Mr. Owen takes a great deal of interest in his work with the children.\n\nStaff. Mrs. Hayworth left on March 13th. We were sorry to have to part with her after her connections with the work but we found that her judgment could not be relied upon.\n\nMiss Higgins left to be married on March 31st.\n\nMiss Hardie left for Easter holidays on March 31st.\n\nAmusements. On January 2nd the children were able to have good skating and truck rides were arranged for the whole school. In the evening the staff and pupils met in the School-room where we had a sing-song and dance with plenty of nuts, dates, candy and biscuits for refreshments.\n\nOn January 13th, the boys had a sleighing party and the girls used the boys rink.\n\nWe purchased a cheap Victrola and this has been available for the pupils in their spare time. We have found that this and the Books of Knowledge have had a very good effect on the discipline of the children since it has afforded them much pleasure and amusement and kept them well occupied at times when supervision is more or less relaxed.\n\nNotes. The Steam radiation was connected up on January 4th and on the 15th we fired the new boiler for the first time.\n\nJanuary 18th. The new laundry was installed in old laundry from up.\n\nOwing to the plumbers neglecting to plug a pipe leading into the boys clothing room steam escaped into this room for two days and we had to thoroughly overhaul the entire contents of the room which were saturated.\n\nMr. Ross and Mr. Robertson of the Department of Indian Affairs visited.\n\nMr. Rogers returned from holiday on February 13th.\n\nWe suffered considerable damage in our hot-house during the blizzard on February 14th.\n\nWe were able to wash by hand in the new laundry on February 19th.\n\nNew Laundry Machinery was installed in the new building on February 19th and credit is due to the Beaver Laundry Machinery Co. for the excellent manner in which they overhauled and installed this machinery.\n\nWe have been able to turn out very fine work since.\n\nDuring the quarter the Dormitories have been thoroughly house-cleaned but we have been unable to do very much in this direction on account of the building and alterations being in process.\n\nThe old Laundry building was torn down on March 9th.\n\nMr. Axford and another representative from the Soldiers Aid Commission visited John Antone and expressed themselves satisfied with conditions.\n\nMr. Standing inspected the School-room work. March 19th.\n\nDuring this quarter we have discontinued purchasing meats etc. from retail stores and are now in a position to buy from packing houses and in that manner effect a considerable economy.\n\nMr. Orr of the Department of Indian Affairs has paid periodical visits of inspection of the building and staff on Health. During the early part of the quarter we suffered from much sickness. The alterations caused the building to be more or less drafty and that together with an epidemic of \"la grippe\" kept many in bed. At one time there were no less than twenty four girls and eleven boys and three of the staff ill bed at one time. However, we were able to get the sick on their feet in a very short time and all made good recovery.\nhad one serious case of illness in that of Lena Jamieson who after a complaint for a day or two was discovered to be suffering from appendicitis in a very serious stage and was rushed to the hospital and within two hours of the Doctor's decision she was operated upon. Since the operation she has made a wonderful recovery and is now quite well.\n\nPupils. This quarter we have experienced considerable trouble with boys absconding. It appears that the children are more or less influenced by the conditions on the Reserve. Just now there is a scarcity of farm help in this quarter the boys are often made tempting offers. The parents are also very keen to remove the boys from school as soon as they are big enough to be useful but realizing the state of morals on the Reserve they are prepared to leave the girls in the safe-keeping of the School until they are old enough.\n\nIn one instance the spirit of rebellion was so very pronounced that two boys armed with clubs openly defied the Principal. They were taken before the local Chief of Police who showed them the seriousness of their conduct and were instantly dismissed from the School after having been provided with sufficient funds to reach their respective homes. One boy has since obtained his release and through a friend has sought readmission. Five other pupils have absconded and two boys have absconded for the third time.\n\nOn the other hand, we have just heard from three ex-pupils who have secured very good positions. Grace MacNaughton has been appointed head of the sewing-room at the Johnstone's Doorway Company. Eva Curley has been recently re-elected President of the Girls' Conference an organization of about seven hundred members. Carrie Crowe has also taken a position as School teacher on the Kinsey Reserve.\n\n10th April 1923.\nOttawa, May 9, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your report on the general activities and progress of the work at the Mohawk Institute during the quarter ended March 31st, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say we are pleased to note that the general conditions at the school are satisfactory and that those pupils who were ill during the quarter have now recovered.

R.

Rev. Jnr. Owen was in charge of all services during the quarter except that on April 22nd, when he exchanged pulpits with Mr. Shellgrove of Galtland on May 27th, when the Rector of Ingersoll was in charge. The Communion service was celebrated on the second Sunday in each month. The appearance of the Church has been considerably improved by the renovation of the windows.\n\nOFFICERS. Mrs. Forsall was engaged as sewing teacher. We had been running short staffed during the building operations. Mrs. Knowles has been engaged as junior teacher to replace Miss Higginson who left to be married. Mrs. Knowles is not in possession of certificacies but is capable, enthusiastic and most interested in her work. Mr. Knowles holds a position in a local office and is living in the Institute, in return for which accommodation he takes night duties with the boys and generally relieves the Principal when and where possible.\n\nIt was found necessary to replace Mrs. Haythornthwaite with Mrs. Martin. Mrs. Clark and Mr. Hammond left at the end of April and were replaced by Mrs. W. Duffield and Mr. F. Plummer. Owing to the shortage of big boys it was necessary to engage Mr. Hume as an extra man. Mrs. Merlin resigned owing to ill-health and Miss Flith assumed her duties on May 12th.\n\nMiss Clausen was on holidays commencing June 16th and her duties were carried out by Jessie MacNaughten a Collegiate pupil. Miss Elliott was engaged as sub-officer on June 28th.\n\nAMUSEMENTS. On Easter Monday April 2nd, we moved into the new Dining Hall and celebrated the event by a special dinner which was improved by a liberal supply of candies. In the afternoon the girls went to stores and put a show. The boys volunteered to start the work of constructing the new Dining Hall and Assembly play-room and had a great deal of fun tearing out the old partitions. Empire Day was suitably observed. The I.O.D.E. sent representatives to present a prize won by one of our pupils for general efficiency and after an address on the Empire, by the Principal the Victrola Record of the King's speech was played. One interesting feature of this evening was the manner in which every boy responded to attention as soon as the record commenced playing the National Anthem.\n\nOn Victoria Day the boys were taken by our truck to Burford and Mr. Brethour, the owner of the largest pure-bred cattle and his farm in this district kindly devoted a couple of hours to the boys and showed them his property. While the boys were out the girls went to a show in town and to the park. After supper the boys team defeated the girls team at base-ball.\n\nWe have made arrangements for both boys and girls to swim in the river and during this past quarter we have greatly encouraged sports between the boys and girls. We find that this opportunity for the boys and girls to get together is reducing the passage of letters and the clandestine meetings which were so frequent before.\nJune 11th. Mr. Orr spent the day inspecting alterations and improvements.\n\nJune 19th. Allan Johnson died and Miss Hardie again applied for leave to visit Mrs. Johnson, which was granted.\n\nJune 26th. Mary Waswanipi arrived here from the Ontario School for the Blind.\n\nCassie Arabela, Iraha Longboat, Rita Green and Mary Jacobs were successful in passing the Entrance Examination.\n\nJuly 1st. With Easter Monday we began to take up our new quarters and to vacate that part of the old building which has to undergo alterations. During the whole term we have been constantly making room for rooms to another and for nearly two months have not been able to even use our office. However, we are beginning to see the end now and are hoping that when next we write our report that we shall be comfortably settled. We have ordered our new purchase a large butcher's refrigerator and we have installed same in the basement to our advantage. With this equipment we can buy meat wholesale and even kill a beast during the hottest of weather without fear of loss.\n\nOur new lavatories and baths are a great aid to health and cleanliness.\n\nJuly 3rd. During the Quarter we suffered two losses from our stables. One horse had to be shot and another after being constantly attended to night and day for a week became so paralyzed that she had to be shot.\n\nWe were able to commence working the land on April 10th, and general farm activities have occupied the male staff since that date.\n\nOn April 15th. we had a surprise flood and had to drive teams into the water waist high in order to save fence posts that we had laid out for boundary fencing.\n\nWe have discontinued the practice of making butter at the school. There was always considerable leakage in the poundage through carelessness and extravagance and we find that by issuing a stated quantity of butter each day we are getting bigger returns. We now sell our cream to the local creamery and purchase our butter there. This business also provides us with the opportunity of buying large quantities of butter-milk which is invaluable in pig-raising.\n\nWe bought a splendid team of mares to replace our losses and one has since given birth to a very fine colt.\n\nOur spare time has been taken up in grading and tidying up after the builders.\n\nOne June 20th. we cut hay and we were picking strawberries the following day. It would appear that we are to have good crops this year but the prices of farm products are so low that a big profit can hardly be expected this year.\nOttawa, August 1, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your report for the June quarter, last, on the general activities and progress at the Mohawk Institute, during that period. In reply I beg to say that this report is satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ.

At the standard rates paid by the R.C.M.P. for such accommodation I expect to net about $175.00 profit per month while they stay here. This and the fact that possibly their presence may help me in the solution of our boy truancy problem were the deciding factors in my making these arrangements.\n\nTrusting that this is satisfactory,\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, August 3, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo in which you inform the Department that you have given quarters at the Mohawk Institute to the R.C.M.P.

The usual services were conducted by Rev. Owen on July 1st, we held patriotic services and the following Sunday we celebrated Holy Communion. During the month's vacation the pupils who remained at school attended Trinity Church where Mr. Bonfield was in charge of our opening service and Mr. Mitchell supplied on August 19th and 26th while Mr. Owen was on holidays. The Rector of Glencoe was preacher for our Harvest Festival service on September 16th.\n\nHardly a day has passed without a number of visitors to the church and meetings in the Churchyard due to the extra attention has generally found favourable comment.\n\nGeneral. Miss Hardie left for her holiday on June 30th, and Mrs Knowles took the Senior School pupils on a course in elocution and memory training while Mrs Rogers gave instruction in embroidery, crocheting, and fancy work. Our girls greatly enjoyed this and we discovered some very skilful and artistic work done. A student of the type of the Junior School was able to assist in this work.\n\nAs a result of Mrs Knowles' training we were able to stage a Closing Concert which was an undoubted success. Larry Wesenepi from the Ontario School for the Blind was very well received and her selections on the piano much enjoyed. The following day the pupils left for their holidays on August 1st.\n\nThe pupils who were not fortunate enough to leave for holidays were presented with a bathing suit each and the girls were given a pair of white shoes and two pairs of stockings and every boy had a pair of running shoes.\n\nLeo Kinney was admitted July 10th, and Miss Ford of the local hospital kindly lent us a chair for him. He has since been fitted with appliances which enable him to move around our premises.\n\nThrough the kindness of General Ashton our Cadet Corps has been presented with some German war trophies.\n\nWhile on her holidays Miss Hardie returned to Brantford for medical examination and had to undergo an operation for appendicitis on July 17th. She was given extension of leave until September 15th when she returned, recovering on excellent recovery.\n\nWe were very fortunate in securing a good supply teacher in Mr. Wood. His closure last August was succeeded by Mr. Brown an old pupil and a Business College graduate.\n\nOn the return of our holidays our pupils returned promptly. In fact the roll call was complete with the exception of those who had for some reason or other not been able to commence their holidays on the right date.\n\nOn August 27th, we visited the Paris Kinney Mills and were able to purchase material for repairing our girls' work dresses and also material for next year's summer dresses.\n\nMr. McVittie visited August 30th.\n\nDuring the quarter we have made one of our pupils Floretta Elliot a sub-officer, in which position she has greatly relieved our staff generally. She answers the telephone and door, takes charge of girls on walks, teaches music and relates to other officers.\n\nMiss Flora housekeeper left and was relieved by Mrs Woods who arrived with a very bad cold and after a few days broke down entirely.\n\nMiss Elliott and a number of her girls decorated the Church for Harvest Festival.\n\nHealth has been excellent.\n\nThe pupils had some difficulty in settling down after the holidays especially those who had been berry picking. They were prone to get out of bed early and could be impatient, careless about their dress.\nQuarterly Report, Mohawk Institution, September 30th 1923.\n\nSeveral ran away to be returned very promptly by their relatives.\n\nAfter a long controversy I have at last succeeded in getting the wholesale houses to fill our orders. The retail houses have been fighting us in this move but at last we have won and are hoping to effect considerable economy as a result of this new method of buying.\n\nSports & Amusements. We have been able to give more attention to sports this summer and many games have been played between the different divisions in the school. The best ball games have been those between the boys and girls teams. The boys have the stronger team but our girls have been playing very spiritedly. This scheme of mixing the boys and girls on the playing field has had a very desirable influence on the school and such things as the passing of notes from boy to girl or girl to boy has not been heard of for some time. We find that by making the whole school play together they soon divide and the boys begin to play alone and the girls play their own, forgetting entirely of the boys.\n\nSwimming in the Grand River has been good and on occasions the city swimming pool has been visited. Now the cooler weather has set in our new bathes and plentiful supply of hot water are in great demand.\n\nStrawberries were plentiful and the children had their share. One evening we had a strawberry and ice cream feast at the expense of a few others who had been working here.\n\nDuring the holidays the truck was in use on several occasions taking parties of pupils to the movies.\n\nJuly 26th, the children were given ice cream as a reward. They had never before volunteered to help with the harvesting operations when we were badly in need of help and they would have been playing at the river or doing something else.\n\nAugust 5th, Civic Holiday the children went to town for truck rides and dinner. It is raining now.\n\nIt seemed like rain all morning but didn't last long. In the afternoon it rained again and shortly after dinner, Mr. Holley was cool enough to build a fire and get the children out of the cold and into the sun. We were able to rent for a little longer so for curiosity's sake we went inside and found the house beautifully reserved. Besides being able to give every child a cool drink.\n\nAugust 8th, successful corn roast closing our evening with a sing-song round a roaring bon-fire.\n\nImprovements. We are unable to fully express our appreciation of the improvements that we have had carried out. Our staff Dining Room is small and isolated and when the kitchenette is completed will be almost ideal. The new Sewing Room with its large roomy cupboards and big oven is undoubtedly going to be an improvement in this department. We have enlarged the room to accommodate the new sewing machines and also added a closet for the storage of clothes.\n\nThe hardwood floors throughout the main floor, with the exception of the dining room, are the same as the rest of the building and are extremely hard wearing. The walls are painted a light color and the floors are polished to a high shine. The rooms are well ventilated and the lighting is excellent.\n\nAugust 14th, we were visited by a number of influenza cases amongst our horses. To prevent this we had every horse inoculated on August 17th. The terrible thunderstorm that night drenched the streets and killed one of our sheep.\n\nOn August 20th, we received a message from Mr. Holley saying that he was coming to see us. We were very pleased to see him and he came on September 1st. He is an excellent worker and we are pleased to secure his services.\n\nMr. Holley is an honest and hardworking man and owner of a threshing machine which he has used this year and gave him a trial. He did splendid work for us and we are able to thresh at the rate of a thousand bushels a day. We threshed a total of 4,400 bushels this year.\n\nWe filled our silo with our own machinery but owing to a series of cutting work we have not been able to fill other silos by contract as we intended.\nQuarterly Report, Mohawk Institution, 30th September 1923.\n\nThe early potato crop was a failure but due to our irrigation system we had a plentiful supply of cabbage, corn, turnips, carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers, rhubarb, fruits and apples.\n\nOur pure-bred hogs are beginning to attract attention and I have hopes that this is going to be a source of remuneration to no little extent.\n\n6th October 1923.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nOwing to pressure of work I have been unable to inform you earlier that I have arranged to leave for England on the \"Resina\", on the 27th of this month.\n\nAs I did not wish to leave before the quarterly accounts were completed and certain other work was finished I was only able to make these arrangements this morning.\n\nWill you please make the necessary arrangements with the local bank to honour Mr. Rogers signature.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMohawk Institute\nBrantford\nOntario\n\n20th October 1923.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nOn closing my Quarterly Report which is now being prepared for forwarding to your office I find that it will be necessary to again ask for an advance from this quarter's grant for $2,000.\n\nThere are several reasons for this state of our finances. Only lately have I succeeded in being able to deal with wholesale houses for our supplies. This, naturally, means a great saving but where a retail merchant would allow us to run our accounts quarterly the wholesaler wants his cash monthly and this means that we must have a bigger balance for current expenses. Eventually, I hope to establish the finances of this school in such a fashion that we will be able to meet this.\n\nUnfortunately, this section of the country was seriously affected by a drought this summer which has considerably curtailed the profits from our farm but within this disadvantage our farm and garden receipts for the past quarter are in excess of any similar quarter for a number of years past.\n\nThen, again, the alterations and re-decorations that have taken place this year have made it necessary for us to put in certain improvements that have increased our expenditures. I, however, feel satisfied that the results have more than justified the cost. For instance, last winter in order to light a school-room it was necessary to walk round\nand soon light on separately. This, of course shortened the life of the lamps considerably and put a strain on the wiring each time the lights were required. In view of this, I had the wiring altered to that of switch control before the room were decorated, since when I have not had to replace a single lamp. This expenditure will, therefore, be shortly covered by the economy in maintenance.\n\nAnother improvement has been carried out in the play-rooms. Every year we have had to spend a considerable sum on glass to replace that broken by pupils. To avoid this I have had substantial frames covered with a very heavy screening placed over all windows in the playrooms and have also guarded all electric lights. Now the children can play ball in their playrooms without doing damage.\n\nAs we buy our meat wholesale and have to take delivery weekly it was necessary to increase our cold storage. To do this we were fortunate in securing a butcher's store refrigerator at a very reasonable price.\n\nI also had to furnish a substitute for Miss Hardie during her absence following an operation.\n\nIn spite of the foregoing expenditures we have been able to keep a very good standard of efficiency and were able to reduce our last quarter deficit by \u00a3200.\n\nI mention these facts for your information and remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nMOHAWK INSTITUTE\nBrentford.\nOttawa, Oct. 24, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to request that you will honour Mohawk Institute cheques, signed by Mrs. S. Rogers, for the next two months during the absence from duty of the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nThe Manager,\nBank of Hamilton,\nBrantford, Ont.\nOttawa, Oct. 24, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with further reference to your leaving for England. In reply to your request to arrange with the local Bank to honour Mrs. Rogers' signature, I have to inform you that a letter is being directed to this end. It might be well for you, in addition, to go to the Manager of the Bank and arrange for Power of Attorney in favour of the Acting Principal.\n\nI have also to acknowledge receipt of the report on the activities in progress at the Mohawk Institute during the quarter ended the 30th ultimo. The Department is pleased to have this interesting report and to note that the work has been carried on in a satisfactory manner.\n\nI have also your letter of the 20th instant, in which you ask for an advance on the current quarter's grant. I have noted, with satisfaction, that you hope to be in a better financial position in the very near future, and I am pleased to have your explanation of the need for this advance payment. I regret that this summer's drought has prevented you from having a bumper crop. A cheque for $2,000, being an advance on this quarter's per capita earnings, is being directed to Mrs. W. Rogers, Acting Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMrs. Rogers, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nAngry, Run in Indian Home\n\nSister of Pauline Johnson Explains Trouble at the Reserve.\n\nSENDS OPEN LETTER\n\nDeclares Mohawks Want Chance For Higher Education.\n\nThe situation at the Mohawk Indian Reserve near Brantford, which has been the subject of attention for a long time, is now being addressed by Miss Evelyn H. E. Johnson, who seeks to place the responsibility where it belongs.\n\nShe says:\n\n\"The people of Ontario, and later, the people of the other Provinces as well as Americans, are continually asking 'What is the trouble with the Six Nations Indians?' Even Brantfordians who are contiguous to the Reserve, ask me this question. In Hamilton and Toronto I am asked the same question. No one seems really to know what is going on about, but everyone seeks for information.\n\n\"There are many reasons for the present spirit of unrest and rebellion in this Reserve. To-day I wish to draw the attention of the Canadian public to the Mohawk Institution, an educational boarding school near Brantford, for Indian children of both sexes. It is a school similar in nature to an industrial school and is a school for many children who have no parents or for orphan children, whose parents are living in the town. The children of the Reserve, however, are at variance with the system of the institution. The children do not appreciate the conditions in the Reserve and are seeking better treatment for higher and better education.\n\n\"The New England Company, which for many years has operated the ten day-schools in the Reserve, together with the Mohawk Institution, has been doing their best to turn out the maximum of educated pupils, whereas, for forty years not one single pupil from these schools passed the entrance examination to the high schools. Furthermore, one annual school conducted by the Six Nations Council had passed a number of scholars into the high schools. At the present time no less than 150 Indian children are attending high school at various places. A school which is badly wanted in our midst.\n\nASKS INVESTIGATION.\n\nThe labor element in Brantford recently asked the Government to investigate the conditions at the Mohawk Institution. Colonel A. T. Taylor, appointed by the Government, came here with an investigation team in the Reserve and it is to be regretted that the Mohawk Institution was not included in the investigation. During the Summer more than 200 children have been running wild in the school. The assertion is made that they are hungry, and the Indians say there is something radically wrong when children abandon wholesome, an institution such as this. The Indian Department contributes generously toward the upkeep of the Mohawk Institution and the New England Company does the same in its support. There are at least two hundred acres of land in connection therewith, plenty of fruit and vegetables, and a large herd of cattle. It is said that no one in Canada that these children runaway in the winter because of their claim of hunger.\n\nSome of the missionaries and bishops who have visited the Reserve met no one in their direct field of work in the Reserve who is the Mohawk Institution. The missionary's wife begged me, with tears in her eyes, to do something to better these conditions. I told her I have no influence; the Indians lie behind me.\n\n\"Why not turn the Mohawk Institution into a first-class educational school where boys and girls can be trained in science, by qualified teachers, so that they will be equipped to take up their way in life even if they do not wish to attend school to take up higher education?\n\nBoys Burned Buildings.\n\nThe first executive officer, Mr. Hubert Ashton, went out from England by the New England Company to take charge of the Mohawk Institution in this early settlement. During his time many boys ran away from the institution and brought back to the institution they were garbed in clothing similar to that worn by the Indians, the trousers being of blue denim and the shirts of red flannel. The road was easier to color.\n\nIn 1930 some of the boys turned and burned down the Mohawk Institution to the ground. The late Rev. James Rogers, missionary and his wife told me it was nothing more than they had expected for a long time. They had complained to him and sentenced to the Ministry for punishment, which Rev. said they thought would be the Mohawk Institution. What a punishment!\n\nMiss Evelyn H. E. Johnson wrote to me that she had not been leaving immediately on a trip to visit friends in British Columbia, she herself, would have taken care of the situation.\n\nThe Mohawk Institution was rebuilt by the New England Company. On October 1st, 1930, Mr. Rogers, the Superintendent, his son Mr. Norman Ashton received the appointment. Shortly after this the old building was torn down. When these girls were returned to the institution, their hair was cut off, and they were shut up in the dark rooms. They were given nothing but bread and water. Chief George Hill, who is very sentimental Mr. Nelles Ashton for this treatment of his little daughters. He said was very much against Mohawk Institution.\n\nA Brantford jury of twelve men turned a verdict of four hundred and seventy-five damages against Mr. Nelles Ashton together with the statement that his institution is not a reformatory, it is an industrial school.\n\nMrs. Horne, now Mrs. Rogers, and who is a daughter of Rev. Rogers, then obtained the appointment of Superintendent of the Mohawk Institution. The province is full of mission workers, especially those who believe in feeding the poor right at their doors.\n\nAnd the press of the United States is raising the question why the trouble with the Six Nations Indians?\"\nAt...Brantford,...Ont,...\n\nNovember...19,...1923.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDe.: Sir:-\n\nI attach a cutting from the Toronto World of November 18th, containing a bitter attack upon the Mohawk Institute by Miss Evelyn Johnson, sister of the late Pauline Johnson.\n\nOwing to the rumors, much to the same affect as this article which have reached my ears, I have made it my business since I have been in Brantford to particularly note conditions in the Mohawk Institute, which I have visited some 7 or 8 times as well.\n\nIt is unnecessary for me to say that there is not one single word to truth in the whole of this article.\n\nI believe Miss Johnson to be actuated by malice on account of the fact that she was obliged to obtain permission to bury her brother in the Mohawk Church yard and in view of the fact that such lying propaganda at the present juncture will have a bad effect on the Reserve and in the\nBrantford, Ont.\nNovember 19, 1923.\n\nVicinity, I shall be grateful if you will inform me if it is your wish that I should take any steps to reply to this article in the public press.\n\nBoth Mr. and Mrs. Rogers are extremely capable and take a keen interest in the management of the Institute and she therefore feels all the more keenly about this uncalled for and entirely false attack.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nLt.

The Company grants \u00a31,000 per annum for current expenses and, when they can find funds, they are assisting the Department of Indian Affairs with capital expenses. In the last two years the New England Company has granted \u00a37,015.25, which has been used for alterations and repairs.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs, before leasing the Mohawk Institute, made per capita grants for current expenditure each fiscal year. For the past few years the per capita grant has amounted to:\n\n| Fiscal Year | Grant Amount |\n|-------------|--------------|\n| 1914-15     | \u00a312,000.00   |\n| 1915-16     | \u00a312,000.00   |\n| 1916-17     | \u00a312,000.00   |\n| 1917-18     | \u00a312,000.00   |\n| 1918-19     | \u00a312,000.00   |\n| 1919-20     | \u00a312,000.00   |\n| 1920-21     | \u00a312,000.00   |\n\nDuring these years no grants were made from Parliamentary Appropriation, for buildings or equipment.\n\nSince leasing the institution, the Department has not only paid from Parliamentary Appropriation a per capita grant for current expenses:\n\n| Fiscal Year | Grant Amount |\n|-------------|--------------|\n| 1921-22     | \u00a320,000.00   |\n| 1922-23     | \u00a320,000.00   |\n| 1923-24     | \u00a320,000.00 (estimated) |\n\nbut also grants for buildings and replacements, as follows:\n\n| Fiscal Year | Grant Amount |\n|-------------|--------------|\n| 1921-22     | \u00a31,465.00    |\n| 1922-23     | \u00a36,068.13    |\n| 1923-24     | \u00a35,800.00 (estimated) |\n\n-Since leasing-\nSince leasing the Mohawk Institute from the New England Company, the Department has met, roughly, 85% of the current expense and has appropriated, roughly, 95% of the money needed for the alterations and repairs that have been undertaken in the past three years.\n\n**MANAGEMENT:**\n\nUnder the terms of the lease, the Department is to maintain the Mohawk as an educational institution for Indian boys, or girls, or for both, and the pupils are to be drawn, as far as possible, from the Six Nation Indians. The religious instruction shall be the teachings and doctrine of the Church of England. It should be noted that the responsibility for the management of the Mohawk Institution is practically entirely with the Department.\n\n**INSPECTION:**\n\nThe Brantford representative of the Department visits the Mohawk Institute each month and reports to the Department. The new agent, Col. Morgan, has already paid some eight visits. The Public School Inspector for the County inspects the classroom activities twice each year and reports to the Department, concerning the progress of the pupils and the pedagogy of the instructors. The date of the last inspection by the Public School Inspector was the 7th instant. The Superintendent of Indian Education has paid two official visits to the Mohawk Institute during the past two years. The Department Architect has visited the school at frequent intervals during the alterations and additions to the buildings.\n\n**RELIGIOUS:**\n\nChurch services are conducted regularly each week by an Anglican Clergyman, communion services being held each quarter. The Bishop of Huron is the official church visitor.\n\n**INSTRUCTION:**\n\nThe Department requires each pupil in residence to be in the classroom at least five half days per week. The elder boys and girls spend the other school hours in one of the departments, for the purpose of assisting with the domestic duties and the farm and garden activities and to receive instruction along vocational lines. The Department expects the younger pupils to be in the classroom during the whole of each school day.\nTRUANCY:\n\nA study of the reports sent in by the Mohawk Institute shows that during the quarter ended September 30th, last, two boys and one girl truanted. The Principal states in his written report that \"several pupils ran away, but were promptly returned by their parents.\" The returns for the same quarter a year ago show that six boys and two girls absconded and two years ago, a like number.\n\nThis year three boys and seven girls did not return promptly after the annual vacation. A year ago seven boys and two girls had not reported one month after the school opened. Three girls did not return following the holidays of 1921.\n556 Cannon St. E.\nHamilton, Ont.\nNov. 17, 1923\n\nMinister of Aboriginal Affairs,\n\nSir,\n\nIt is not my wish to offer any criticism with regard to the enclosed report.

The Ontario Department of Education has established an excellent school.\nat Montreal, Que.\n\nIt seems to me, from a knowledge of the possibilities that lie within the scope of the Northern Academy gained from eight months' experience there as a member of its teaching staff, that such an institution would work splendidly on the Six Nations Reserve.\n\nThe institution could be made\npoor copy\n\nof a portion of\nan educational institution\ncould be applied to\nplanting the\ntrees and shrubs\nin the direction of\nall over the\ngrounds for\nbetter\npurpose.\n\nV. Campbell, Ed.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the Mohawk Institute, November 7, 1923.\n\nAs mentioned in my last report the attendance of the larger boys has, in many cases been unsatisfactory. After staying a while they run away to their homes and often no action is taken to send them back. The result is that in the senior school there are three times as many girls as boys.\n\nI note that while the girls are given some good practical training in sewing, cooking and general housework, and the boys with some work with the gardener and on the farm, there is, nevertheless, no provision for systematic instruction in the principles, either of household science, manual training or agriculture. It would, I think, be most desirable in a school of this kind if the heads of the various industrial departments were also qualified to teach the principles of these subjects. Possibly as changes are made in the future this requirement may be kept in view.\n\nIn the junior division teachers have changed too frequently to admit of steady progress. A well trained primary teacher is desirable for this department, although it may be difficult to retain a suitable one in this position.\n\nT. W. Standing,\nInsp.\nThis reporter brought in, also, a letter written by Miss Johnson which is practically the same as that quoted in other periodicals. I told him that in a measure like this there is sub judice pending Colonel Thompson's report, the Parliamentary decision regarding it, etc., it was impossible to avoid some measure answering Miss Johnson's attack so as not to have done so, when in this instance, have resulted in the publication of this letter by the Star, with a comment that they had sent a reporter and were unable to obtain denial. The reporter therefore took Miss Johnson's letter paragraph by paragraph in the presence of Mr. Rogers, myself and Miss Harris, who was an original, a skill and who was also a teacher in this school for 74 years.\n\nI suggested that we should publish this letter and the reply side by side and I will send you a copy as soon as it appears.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nLt.

D.,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Doctor Scott:\n\nThank you for your letter of the 24 inst. with reference to Miss Johnson's article on the Mohawk Institute.\n\nYou will remember that I received instructions from you to publicly deny the rumour that instructions had been received by me from you to announce an elective council, and the question arose as to whether the best method would be to put a personal letter from me in the Brantford Expositor or a paragraph by one of the Expositor's reporters. On my return to Brantford, I interviewed Mr. Preston, who said in the visit that a personal letter would be best. I attach a copy of the letter I wrote in which you will see I just touched upon the question of Miss Johnson's letter as it has caused some local comment.\n\nOn Saturday evening Mrs. Rogers rang up, asking me to come to the Mohawk Institute to meet a reporter from the Toronto Star who had been specially sent down by that paper to illustrate into the truth of Miss Johnson's allegations.\nTo the Editor\n\nThe following invited attention of the press on an important meeting of public interest. It must be free from personal attacks and accusations.\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS.\n\nSir, I have been told that at the time of the last council meeting of the Six Nations Indians at Ohsweken, on November 4th there was a rumor that instructions had been received by me from the Indian Department to announce an important decision which would affect the affairs of the Mohawk. Other chiefs for those not holding that position. As this rumor appeared to have caused great excitement, and perhaps some misunderstanding, I would take advantage of your valuable columns to say definitely that no such instruction has been given or that I know nothing whatever about it.\n\nThere who have followed the attacks against the Indian Department and the Mohawk Institute, which have been found in the press of Canada, the United States and Great Britain will realize that there is a deliberate campaign of calumny in papers and newspapers directed against the Mohawk people for their own ends, led by a lawyer in Rochester, N.Y., who remains beyond the jurisdiction of the Dominion.\n\nAs this is one of the schools which comes within my jurisdiction as Superintendent of the Six Nations, I have occasion to be constantly exposed to various and unexpected slanders and can, therefore, say from my personal knowledge that there is no truth whatever in these allegations.\n\nIt is the policy of the Government of Canada to uncover children's obstructions of personal spite appearing in publications which have attacked themselves of slanderous, but I am convinced that the situation cannot be worse than it is now, and I should ask you to publish a detailed report on this column of half-truths, distortions and suppositions of fact.\n\nIn conclusion, I would emphasize the importance of having an accurate statement of such reports.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. H. MCKINNON,\nSuperintendent,\nSix Nations.\nNovember 27th, 1923.\n\nDear Colonel Morgan,\n\nI have your note of the 26th November with enclosed letter. I approve of the wording of your letter. It seems to me admirable. I shall be anxious to see what the \"STAR\" says, so kindly forward me anything that you may note, in its columns.\n\nI was phoning to Col. Starnes this morning and he tells me they have fixed up the Police post.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nLt.-Col. C. H.

Thompson, K.C., of Ottawa, who was appointed under Order in Council of the 20th March 1923 to investigate matters in connection with the administration of Indian affairs on the Six Nations Reserve. Col. Thompson proposes to make a report on the management of the Mohawk Institute and I shall be glad if you will afford him every facility in carrying out his duty.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMrs. S. Rogers,\nActing Principal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nTHE MOHAWK INSTITUTION\n\nTo the Editor: The people of Ontario and other provinces, as well as Canadians, are continually asking: \"What is the trouble with the Six Nations Indians?\" Mr. Bradfield, who is contiguous to the reserve, asked me this question. In Hamilton and Toronto I am asked the same question. No one seems to know what the unrest is about; but everyone seeks for information.\n\nThe Mohawk Institution is a school for the present spirit of unrest and rebellion on the reserve. Some of them have already touched upon it in my personal experience. Yesterday I wish to draw the attention of the Canadian public to the Mohawk Institution as an educational institution, near Brantford, for Indian children of both sexes. The school is intended to be an industrial school and is a home for many orphaned boys and girls, as well as for other children whose parents are living.\n\nPractically the whole Indian population in the reserve, however, is at variance with the present existing situation and its executive head. The Indians of both opposing factions in the reserve are seeking and begging the Indian department for better education. The New England company, which for many decades controlled the ten schools in the reserve, together with the Mohawk Institution, no doubt believed that they could secure a maximum of educated pupils, whereas, as far as I know, not one single pupil from these schools passed the entrance examination into the high schools; yet, the one single school conducted by the Six Nations council has been more successful than any of the high schools. At the present time no less than 35 Indian children are attending high school very well placed. A high school is badly wanted in our reserve.\n\nThe labour union in Brantford recently passed a resolution suggesting that the government makes a thorough investigation of the conditions and the conduct of the institutions. Col. A. T. Thompson, appointed by the government, in September, found such an investigation in the reserve, and it is to be regretted that the Mohawk Institution was included in the investigation. During the summer more than 10 children have run away from the home-school. All of them claim that they are hungry, and the Indians are angered.\n\nThere is something radically wrong with the way we are wholesale an institution such as this is supposed to be. The Indian department has spent many thousands of dollars towards the upkeep of the Mohawk Institution and the New England company also reside in it. They have at least two hundred acres of productive farm land in connection therewith planted in fruit trees, orchards, and a large herd of cows, and it is a crying shame to Canada, that these children run away in such numbers because of hunger.\n\nOne of the missionaries and wife declared to me that they had met no one in their direct field of labor in the reserve who liked the school or thought it was desirable. This is suggestive of something rotten in the state of Denmark. The missionary's wife begged me to help her in her endeavor to influence to better these conditions. I told her I have no influence; the influence lies with the Canadian government.\n\nWhy not clean up this sore in the reserve and put the Mohawk Institution in the hands of educated Indians? Why not make the school teaching trades, nursing and domestic science by qualified teachers? Why not take out boys and girls fitted to make their way in life, even if they do not own fields abroad, whereas this work affords them the opportunity to attend higher education?\n\nMembers of the family who have been sent to the Mohawk Institution have returned to the reserve. What is the trouble with the Six Nations Indians? EVELYN H. C. JOHNSON\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6200, file 466-1, part 1)\n\nPoor copy\nOctober 30, 1923\n\nMrs. D. C. Scott,\nDeputy Dept. of Ind. Affairs\nAttorney Gen.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed herewith you will find a copy of a letter by Miss E. Johnson regarding the Mohawk Indians.\n\nThere seems to be an undesirable amount of dissatisfaction on the part of our people and a very decided unrest amongst the children attending the school. As the school is now directly under your control it seems to me to be quite reasonable to suggest a thorough investigation to clear matters up. This would be an act of justice to the officials of the school and also to the children.\n\nI trust that you will see fit to take action in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nElliott Ross.\nDecember 4th, 1923.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo with reference to the inspection of the Mohawk Institute. I am sure that you are aware that regular inspections are made both by our officers locally and by those from headquarters. In addition to this a thorough inspection has been made recently.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent General.\n\nMr. Elliott Moses,\nChewesen,\nOnt.\n26. Bloomsbury Square,\nLondon, W.C.1.\n\n19th December 1923\n\nDear Doctor Scott,\n\nWe had the pleasure of meeting Mr Rogers the Principal of the Mohawk Institute when the Court of the Company met on the 5th instant, and he made a most favourable impression both as regards his ability and also his keenness for the welfare of the Institute.\n\nAmongst other things he is very anxious to get his band properly organised, and as this is a valuable part of the boys' training, I am writing to ask if the Department would allow the New England Company to help him in getting the Band instruments.\n\nI should also like to ask if the Department could allow for extra tuition for the Band, as this would be a great help.\n\nMr Rogers gave us a good account of the building operations at the Institute, and we are glad to think that the Company has been able to help towards the cost.\n\nWith regard to St George's School, Lytton, we should be glad to have more frequent reports from Mr Letts. He seems to be doing good work there, and the Company naturally takes a keen interest and would like to hear more about it.\n\nThe question of Fire Insurance has cropped up with regard to both the Schools. We understand that the policies in respect of St George's have lapsed, and also that although Mrs Rogers has kept the Mohawk Institute provisionally covered pending instruct-\nwe understand that it is not the practice of the Department to insure. I should be very glad to hear from you on this point, if the Department does not see its way to effect these insurances the Company will have to do so.\n\nTrusting that you have now recovered from your illness, and with kind regards Believe me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nErnest Matthews\nOttawa, Jan. 6, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Mathews:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant and am pleased to learn that Mr. Rogers, of the Mohawk Institute, has made a favourable impression at the Court of the Company. I shall be very pleased if you can assist him with band instruments for the boys, and the Department will try to make provision for some tuition of the players.\n\nI regret to state that the insuring of Indian residential schools is not in harmony with our practice, and, if you wish to cover your equity in the buildings at Lytton and Brantford, I should be pleased if you would make arrangements direct with the principals. I have noted in Mr. Bush's letter of the 20th instant, which I am pleased to acknowledge, that the premiums have been paid lately in the case of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nMay I thank the Company for their remittance to the Bank of Montreal at Brantford of \u00a3180, which represents the balance of the Mohawk Claws Trust Funds which were used for the buildings at Lytton. This sum will be applied on the replacements and repairs which we are undertaking at the Mohawk Institute.\n\nI am today instructing the Rev. Mr. Lett to send to the Company more frequent reports concerning the interesting progress of the Lytton Indian Residential School.\n\nMrs. Scott joins with me in Best Wishes for the New Year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nErnest Mathews, Esq.,\nGovernor,\nNew England Co.,\n26 Bloomsbury Court,\nLondon, S.W.C.,\nEngland.\nBank of Montreal\nBrantford, Ont.\n3rd January, 1924.\n\nDr. Duncan Scott,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe are in receipt, from our London, England, branch, of the sum of Eight Hundred and Sixty Two & 71/100 Dollars ($862.71) deposited by New England Company.

This amount represents $862.71 received from New England Company, London, England, less 36\u00a2 for War Tax Stamps on draft.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPro-Manager\n\nC.A.V.,\nE.C.\nSir, I have the honour to submit the following report on the activities and progress of the work of this Institute.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNovember 1st, 1923.\n\nServices were held at the church throughout October with the exception of Sunday, 13th, when our children were invited to join the choir and Sunday School Classes of Trinity Church in a Children's Service. We closed the Church for the winter at the end of October and held our classes in the School Room. Owing to the limited space in this room we are unable to allow the whole school to remain throughout the service and consequently only twenty pupils was sent to the Junior school after the opening of the service. On December 15th the pupils attended the unveiling of the Christmas tree at 10:40 and a well attended Carol Service at 6:15.\n\nChristmas morning was a very delightful Carol Service. Some of our older girls were able to join in the service. The children learnt a number of carols for the Christmas Concert and the Christmas tree festivities. Our senior girls were specially invited to the Carol Service at St. Luke's Church on the 24th before Christmas.\n\nIn addition to the services we have singing practice and exercises at 9 a.m. and 2 p.m., and Sunday School at 11 o'clock.\n\nThere has been considerable trouble with the Housekeeper on October 1st. She is an English school-teacher on leave of absence and due to her enthusiasm and energy we have been able to re-organise the kitchen department with very good results.\n\nOn October 15th, we lent Miss Crowe to Col. Vernon for a week to assist him in his office work.\n\nMiss Crowe had been acting as handy-woman on October 1st. Mrs. Ludmore has been out in charge of the boiler room for the winter in addition to acting as cattle-maid. She had to take up on October 1st.\n\nAll the beds in the house were turned over and leaves at third floor. Due, no doubt, to the improved sanitary conditions and better heating we have had a variety of sickness among the children which have not been in need of a doctor. Several children have had trouble with their teeth which have received attention.\n\nOn October 1st, we filled neighbour's silo.\n\nOn October 15th, we killed five pigs for sale. Commenced lifting bulbs for winter on November 1st. We converted the basement of the old Playhouse into a very effective apple and root store-room. During the alterations one of the soft water boilers on the North end of the Institute fell into the house so we have run a pipe from it into the greenhouse and now use this water instead of the city water. Full advantage was taken of the mild fall weather and fields were ploughed, hedges trimmed, fence lines cleaned and fruit bushes pruned.\n\nOn November 27th and 28th, the boys and girls were issued with new shoes and socks or stockings, while the girls had further issues of bloomers and combinations. Our girls are wearing the blue serge dresses for school and most of the boys are wearing their blue uniforms. Owing to the warm clothing we have been able to make use of the E.S.O.C. supplies we have allowed the girls to wear the grey pyjamas for play as the weather becomes colder for best.\n\nThis is the first opportunity we have had of allowing our girls coats for\nto wear in the playground and they look most comfortable in them.\n\nWe have made a new issue of aprons for the girls but during the winter we do not propose to put them into use. It is our custom to patch and darn the aprons when necessary to save our new clothing for Spring. A new set of blue uniforms has been ordered for the girls.\n\nOct. 1st. Mr. Rogers met Mr. G.J. Parker and Colonel Morgan at the Inn Office. Colonel Morgan stood with us until he and his family could locate a house and move to Brantford.\n\nOct. 3rd & 4th. Our girls went by the truck to Chawaken Fair and the boys went the 6th & 7th. We took our lunches with them and being relieved of the milking by volunteer girls. It is also pleasing to note that the girls brought back Lucinda Henry, a girl who had run away the day before and had already repented. She has done well since her return.\n\nOur truck made several trips to Burlington during this month where the school was closing down and we were able to get a good supply of chairs, lockers for girls' playroom, cinematograph and cabinet, kitchen and dining hall supplies, rugs, bath mats, furniture, an organ and some plants and shrubs.\n\nOct. 5th. Several British teachers made an extensive visit and Mary Jacobs and her brother, old pupils, arrived in two fine cars one morning bringing their respective families to see their old school. They both speak high-Isle of the White men in the villages.\n\nColonel Morgan presented the pupils with four baskets of very fine grapes.\n\nOct. 14th. Mr. and Mrs. Rogers went Grimby and brought back a quantity of peaches which the children enjoyed for several suppers.\n\nOct. 12th. Leo Winnie was foiled in an attempt to make three other boys become with him one night. He had persuaded them to wheel him about fifteen miles on a wheel chair. One boy, William Snake, did get away and we have not been able to locate his whereabouts.\n\nOct. 23rd. We contracted with the B.T.T. Bakery to supply home-made bread for the school and we were able to reduce the cost by one cent per loaf.\n\nOct. 28th. Mr. Rogers left for Ottawa and England.\n\nOct. 29th. The pupils dismissed and taken home by Mr. Gudmore.\n\nOct. 30th. Mr. Rogers returned celebrated by the children supplying taffy and lemonade while the school supplied apples and bananas. During the evening the girls were allowed and the boys thoroughly enjoyed or in the girls' shriek with their chest parades.\n\nNov. 1st. Connected up radiator in senior school that was in old channel. The Western Electric Commission altered our service to take care of the new wing passenger lamp.\n\nNov. 7th. Mr. Standing inspected classroom work. Although he expressed approval and satisfaction on the progress here he reported to the Department of Indian Affairs that we too frequently change our junior teacher until that we needed a qualified teacher in that position. In this connection he said that the last four changes have been out of our hands entirely; two sent on account of ill-health and two to get married. Our present teacher, Mr. Monk, is a very intelligent and most enthusiastic. He finds the qualified teacher too rigid to our liking and interests solely to the class whereas the type of teacher is required to take part in the general life of the pupils. Mr. Monk is also our clerk guide, etc.\n\nNov. 8th & 9th. Teachers' Convention held and no Junior School. The weather was very cold and two legs out of doors in the flower beds a great mistake.\n\nNov. 11th. Captain Howorth of the local Fire Brigade examined the boys' fire teams and gave all very fine marks.\n\nNov. 12th. Christmas tree was decorated by a group of parents and lam and boxes for dinner and gifts were purchased for the children.\n\nNov. 13th. The weather was very mild and we were able to plant the orange trees.\n\nNov. 14th & 15th. We devoted these two days to sewing for our own church needs. We removed the church curtains and were very happily set and received the best of thanks.\n\nNov. 16th. Mr. Monk received a special message from Mr. Johnson, Secretary of Education.\n\nNov. 17th. Colonel Morgan wrote to the Department and Colonel Johnson in this connection.\nRev. Col. Colonel Morgan inspected.\nNov. 29th. Started winter routine.\nNov. 30th. The boys' house chimney fell in. Fortunately it did little damage and our men were able to repair it.\nA reporter from the Toronto Star visited the school in connection with Miss Johnson's letter. He spent several hours here and returned the next day to see the children at their meals.\nNov. 27th. Archdeacon Jones Bedford visited the school with Mr. Bishop and was most interested.\nNov. 28th. Colonel Morgan unexpectedly paid a visit of inspection for the Department. He took sworn statements from the members of the inside staff and thoroughly investigated every phase of the school work. He expressed his approval.\nNov. 29th. Fire Alarm Drill. Our Boys team were playing water on the library roof when the minutes of the sounding of alarm. We found our alarm gong batteries run down and had them replaced.\nMiss Knowles and Miss Elliott with several of the girls commenced a course for Girl Guides.\nAfter the issue of Miss Johnson's letter we experienced a trying time with the pupils. They showed resistance to discipline and one girl became most disobedient and defiant. This girl was in the second year at the Brantford Collegiate Institute and was dismissed but the effect was immediately shown in the improvement of the general conduct.\nDec. 5th & 6th. The Hydro Electric workers put in a new transformer and altered the interior distribution of services.\nDec. 5th. The pupils went to town to see Santa Claus and to see the Community Christmas tree on the market square.\nAll the girls went in charge of officers to town during the weeks preceding Christmas to see the stores and to buy their Christmas presents. In addition pieces of orange, cords silk and crochet were given to each girl for making into presents for relatives.\nSome very novel and excellent work was turned out.\nDecember 14th. The pupils of Toronto and Mrs. Watts, Captain of Brant and Norfolk's colonies organized our Girl Guide Corps, No. 6 Brantford. All over twelve years were accepted on four months probation and were formed into the following patrols, Blue Bird, Canary, Oriole, Pheasant and Robin. Colonel and Mrs. Morgan were present and their daughter Betty with her gardener two daughters joined our Corps.\nThe following two days our guides went to the Y.W.C.A. and the Collegiate for drill.\nDecember 21st. We decorated our Dining Hall and Entrance with boughs and colours and in the evening we staged our Christmas Concert in the Dining Hall. This was an undoubted success and we felt very grateful to Miss Knowles for the successful manner in which she had trained the pupils. Colonel Morgan took the chair and many friends and old pupils were present.\nDec. 23rd. We called two days for the finest and the weather was so mild that we were able to send the truck to town with flowers and plants. Many pupils went to town with friends and those who were less fortunate were taken out by officers.\nDec. 24th. We had a wonderful Christmas Tree in the Dining Hall. All pupils were present and they brought their families to swell the number. We purchased an enormous bunch of apples to supply every child with a present and a candy bar. Mr. Thompson sent a crate of oranges and Mr. and Mrs. Knowles gave every child a small owse. One of the tall-staffed ladies in the latter was the number of trees in the hall placed on the tree for one another.\nThe pupils had very enjoyable holidays. There was sufficient snow for sleighing on the hills and the building snow forts yet it was mild. Each evening the whole school gathered in the Dining Hall for games and fun of all kinds.\nDr. Souls of the Brant Museums Ltd. gave each pupil an invitation to the local cinema and a box of chocolates.\nDec. 27th. Mr. B. Bishop called to see the school and to get some particulars. He said an old friend of his felt he ought to reply to Miss Johnson. His father, he was sure, never made any statement as represented in the article. He freely stated that the enemies of the school were to be found almost entirely in the ranks of the Baptists. On referring to the list of runaways immediately before Colonel Thompson's enquiry on the Reserve we discovered that they were all children of Baptists with the\nexception of a family of Whites who have an aunt who is very bitter in her attitude towards the school. Although she is an old pupil the reason of her antagonism is that years ago Miss Hardie refused to allow her sisters to take an entrance examination for which she was entirely too stupid to write.\n\nWe killed another pig for the New Years Day dinner and gave all our men ham for a Christmas present.\nOttawa, Jan. 22, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your report for the quarter ended December 31st and I have to inform you that this has been examined with interest. The Department is pleased to note that conditions at the school show a continued worthwhile activity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nS.

All the services this quarter were held in the Senior School-room. Owing to the fact that this room is too small to accommodate the whole number of pupils, we have had to conduct a special Sunday School for the younger pupils in the Junior School. Rev. Mr. Owen was in charge of all the religious services during which period the clergy have been extraordinary pupils. On March 26th, Rev. Mr. Richard took the service and we were very glad to hear his comments upon our school. Mr. Richard had spent a number of years on the Mackay Reservation and he said he was struck by the brightness and intelligence of our pupils. The whole school was gathered for prayer Sunday morning at 9 o'clock and another service was held after the smaller children had been dismissed.\n\nOn Sunday evenings we have had a series of social talks by the principal some of which were illustrated either by lantern slides or by the microscope. Once we had a Radio service from the Buffalo Studio.\n\nFive of our older girls have taken turns in playing the organ for the services.\n\nHealth. With the exception of a slight epidemic of chicken pox we have had little or no trouble this quarter other than a few thousand colds. This is all the more remarkable since most of our boys were seriously affected by outbreaks of several infectious diseases including smallpox. We had only one visit from the doctor this quarter and that was to examine a child who had been kept in bed for three days out of bed and who had it was stated had received some internal treatment.\n\nStaff. Miss Browning (now Matilda teacher on leave) has returned to the country. She had been splendidly well in recent weeks and looked lovely. Miss Allen took her place and we find her very efficient.\n\nWe have had our usual skating parties and very active work in the organized Guides and Soldiers bringing our girls to the front in the affairs of the camp. We had snow all the quarter in fact so much so that we could not be able to keep our skating rink in good order. However, we sent all pupils out frequently for sleigh rides until the roads became too badly drifted. The boys sometimes came here for playing on their sledges we had to send them out for walks to keep them exercised. Our pupils have had a great deal of enjoyment this winter out of the vehicle and a radio set which we were able to borrow for them.\n\nJanuary 1st, we had a tea-party with the tables daintily decorated.\nwith red bow s containing candles and so on. The evening programme included games and singing.\n\nJanuary 23rd and 26th. The Girl Guides went in sleighs to the Armouries to practice for the Trentford Parade at which they were inspected by the Lieutenant Governor. This was on the 26th January and our troupe were splendid. Each Guide wore a uniform made from the Blue Dressing gowns we obtained from the D.S.C.R., by themselves since the first of January and a pink kerchief and scout hat completed their outfit. There were visitors from all parts of Ontario and our girls secured the first prize for their display of needle-work and second prize for first aid work. The drill display by our troupe was second to none.\n\nIn the same afternoon our boys were guests of the Kiwanis Club at their annual Christmas Show.\n\nMiss Turnbull, our sewing teacher, was so pleased with the nice work on the uniforms and their display that she gave them a party at which all the female officers helped to give the girls a good time. On March the 4th, the girls all gave a party to the boys school in the dining room. Small boxing contests between the boys and the girls took place but it looked so simple that they asked to be allowed to box. We all found their efforts very amusing.\n\nOn March 16th, a Bible class from the school attended a play for the pupils and it was very much enjoyed.\n\nImprovements. During the re-decorations we have tried to keep all wiring and plumbing in such condition that we shall not be compelled to nor floors walls or ceilings in the near future by repairing. In this connection we have wired the officers' pantry to take care of an electric stove although at the present time we are using a hot-plate. Wall switches have been installed in playrooms and clothing rooms in order to protect the residents.\n\nThe second staff bath-room has been completed and small alterations made to the lighting.\n\nDuring the quarter we had several days during which a blizzard blew steadily on the front of the house and although we were running the boiler hard two radiators were frozen. We thawed them out without any difficulty and discovered the cause to be ill-fitting doors and windows which allowed a direct draft of cold air to blow on to the returns from the radiators. To prevent a recurrence of this we had a new storm door made for the upper verandah and had all windows fitted with weather strip pine. Since doing this we have had very severe weather and been quite comfortable. In fact it was only necessary to keep a man on duty at night to care for the boiler on three occasions.\n\nMr. Peters commenced work on January 15th, and with pupils help has painted several of the rooms on the principal's flat, refinished stairways, stripped several old floors and re-decorated the new bath-room.\n\nThe pupils have also painted the dormitories which we had previously had white-washed. The men's Dining Room was also plastered and painted.\n\nClothing. During this quarter our girls have made great headway in their sewing. Beyond keeping every article of clothing in repair they have made a complete issue of new serge dresses and aprons ready for Spring wear. They have in addition to this completed two issues of boys shirts.\n\nFor the winter months the boys were outfitted with rubber shoes, heavy stockings and new sweaters.\n\nNotes. Miss Hardie was away for three days in January owing to the death of her friend Miss Davis.\n\nColonel McCrimmon of the Cadet Corps visited on January 18th.\n\nColonel Morgan and an officer of the R.C.M.P. visited on January 21st.\n\nTwo boys, possibly old pupils, climbed the fire escape and knocked at the\nGirls Dormitory window on February 19th. The police were notified\nthat we are keeping a close guard.\n\nInspecting inspected March 5th.\n\nOn March 11th, we held a staff dinner in the Principal's Dining Room.\nThis is an innovation that was so successful that we purpose to repeat\nit from time to time. It serves to bring the whole staff into closer\ntouch with one another and tends to a more uniform standard for the\npupils. The table was effectively arranged by Mrs. Rogers and three\nof the senior girls waited at table in a very smart manner.\n\nThe Orange Convention was held this year in Brantford and we were visited\nby nearly every delegate. They were quite interested in every depart-\nment of the school's activities.\n\nMrs Colonel Morgan, who has been ill, and whose daughter was taken to\nthe local Sanitarium, came on a visit to recuperate.\n\nDiscipline. The disturbing effects of Miss Eva Johnson's newspaper\npropaganda are no longer noticeable. The introduction of Girl Guides\nhas had the tendency to improve the general discipline of the girls\nalthough we had one rather serious case to deal with during the quarter.\nA number of girls banded themselves together under the name \"Jesse James\nGang\" and they started out on a regular reign of tyranny over the other\ngirls. However, we became acquainted with the \"gangs\" activities and\nwere able to break it up. There is a splendid spirit amongst the\nboys now. Although at times I had feared the honour system was imprac-\ntical amongst them I am glad to say that at last, I am finding very good\nresults. The senior boy in the school had for some little time been\nbullying the small boys but the intermediates took the matter up and\nafter severely thrashing him brought him to me and made their report as\nto his conduct. This is the first instance of its kind to my knowledge.\n\nFarm. In common with all farmers in this locality we have had a very\ntrying winter so far as hogs are concerned. The litters were small and\nweak and we had considerable difficulty in wintering them over.\nWe had the horses thoroughly examined and were able to control another\noutbreak of influenza. The horses teeth have been filled.\n\nWe converted an old brick building that had gone into disuse into an\nice-house by excavating floors.\n\nThe old carpenter shop, the foundations of which were collapsing has been\nmoved to a new location and will be converted into a tool room and farm\noffice.\n\nOwing to very heavy snow on the greenhouse roof a small section of same\ngave way but we suffered no loss with the stock on that account and temp-\norary repairs were soon made. We had to keep our snow plough out nearly\nevery day in order to keep the roads open to town.\n\nAs our bull had become unsafe he was sold to a butcher and another to\nreplace him was purchased from the Duncan Farm at an auction sale.\nAn old horse that had been raised on this farm had to be shot as she had\nbecome unable to digest her food.\n\nHaving a number of very good poles on the farm we sent them to a saw mill\nand the boys are converting the lumber we got out of them into double-tree\nsingle-trees and other farm necessaries.\n\nWe purchased an ice plough as we had difficulty in borrowing one this year.\nThe ice harvest had to be made quickly this year and everybody was rushing\ntheir work this year.\n\nWe had several suspected cases tested for tuberculosis in the cow barn and\none milk cow had to be destroyed.\n\nThe incubators were set early in March and we have had excellent results\nfrom them.\n\nThe Farm has been able to contribute well to the upkeep of the school by\nsending in plentiful supplies of milk, potatoes, cabbage, other vegetables.\nan abundance of apples.\n\nWe killed a pig, a calf and several chickens for home consumption.\n\nThe farm teams have kept the small coal bin filled and have been making pool roads with the cinders which they have kept cleared from the buildings.\n\n7th April 1924.\nASKS Federal Government to Fight Chicago Scheme to the Finish\u2014Premier and F. H. Keefer Show How Ontario Faces Real Peril\u2014Many Interests Are Affected\n\nTORONTO, April 5.\u2014With unanimity which submerged all party differences in the recognition of an issue of outstanding importance, the members of the Ontario Legislature yesterday adopted a resolution protesting against the diversion of water through the Chicago drainage canal and urging that the Dominion Government should act in behalf of the province. The question had been discussed by members of all three parties in the House. What the amount of water involved was more than that which goes over the American Falls at Niagara and that the loss would have been occasioned is $500,000, and this was perhaps seldom realised, which the debate stressed and which influenced the members to lend it their unequivocal support.\n\nThe question was raised by F. H. Keefer, member for Port Arthur and Under-Secretary for Agriculture, who pointed out the magnitude of the question and who strongly suggested that the Chicago sanitary district should be treated as \"an enemy child\" by Washington and made to observe the country's obligations in its water treaties. He pointed out that for the sewage sludge proposed Chicago required only 600 to 1000 feet per second flow, not the 10,000 feet which it was taking now. He strenuously argued that Chicago should be made to pay for the erection of a sewage disposal plant, even if the completion of such a plant would require six times as engineers had computed.\n\nAFFECTS MANY INTERESTS.\n\nPremier Ferguson followed and emphasized the intimate relation of the Chicago diversion to the serious problems which the Province was facing. An amount of water equal to that generated at Niagara was being used in the province in the case of the scarcity which was inevitable in the immediate future. Fishing, navigation, and hydro-electric power were severely affected by the diversion.\n\nWHERE SLEEP...\nMOSLEMS OF INDIA CONDEMN TURKS FOR CALIPH'S FALL\n\nAttacks Are Levelled Principally at Mustapha Kemal and Ismet\n\nBLOW TO ISLAM\n\nDUBLIN, April 17.\u2014The abolition of the Caliphate by the Turkish republic has been condemned by all classes throughout the provinces among the Moslems of India. Their attacks have been directed principally at Mustapha Kemal and Ismet Pasha, who are charged with being dangerous to the religious office. The Indians are also claiming that the action has dealt a blow to Islam, which cannot not be recognized by Indians, as it was by the Turks.\n\nThe Turks themselves have lost the powerful influence they once had over the Moslems who have upheld the Turkish cause because they believed the Caliphs in danger.\n\nGLAND REJUVENATION IS ONLY TEMPORARY\n\nNo Permanent Renewal of Youth Through Gland Operations\n\nHOLYROOD PALACE DRY FOR FORTNIGHT\n\nLord High Commissioner, Labor M.P., Is to Break All Traditions\n\nAny Hair Now Easily Removed\n\nSealsweet Florida Oranges\n\nJuicy in the extreme, whether bright, gorusct in color, Sealsweet Florida oranges in flavor, sweetness and other good qualities.

TO THE CITY AND RURAL SCHOOLS\n\nImpressive Ceremonies Take Place in Each Instance, and the Scholars Were Much Interested\u2014Descriptions Given of the Various Patriotic and Historic Subjects So Skilfully Portrayed by the Artists.\n\nPictures which form a part of the War Memorial of the I.O.D.E. were presented to the city schools by the various chapters during the afternoon. A similar ceremony was carried out by each chapter in each case the program began with the raising of the Canadian flag, followed by the singing of the national anthem. Presentation of the pictures was made to the principal or pupils of the school. The program for the various schools was under the direction of Mrs. F. P. Adams, Municipal educational secretary, the educational secretary of each chapter rendering assistance.\n\nIn each case the following from the national anthem concluded the program.\n\nThree schools.\n\nDufferin Rifles chapter made presentation to Alexander River School and King Edward School, who attended the ceremony. After the ceremony the pupils visited the school grounds.\n\nMr. J. S. Rowe, principal of the school, received the picture on behalf of the pupils and teachers of the school. A charming Easter song was sung by the pupils.\n\nThe picture of Joseph Brant was presented by Mrs. N. D. Smith, who said that the picture would remind them of the early days of Canadian history (1742-1807) and a loyal British subject, Sir William Brant, who named the original of the painting from the brush of Romney, hangs in the national gallery at Ottawa and could be seen by the children so that they may be reminded of your heroic heritage. In the name of Canada, the Imperial Order of the Empire presents this picture to remembrance. May we always remember our country, our homes and our people.\n\nA brief description of the picture was given by Mr. Fred Popplewell and Miss Doris Mitchell. Miss Popplewell and Miss Gertrude Read. The program concluded with the national anthem.\n\nCentral School.\n\nAt the conclusion of the ceremony the pupils sang the National Anthem and commenced the salute. Miss Smith made the presentation of the pictures on behalf of the chapter. Mrs. Buck gave a description of each picture. \"The Defence of Quebec,\" by Mr. F. P. G. L. Adams, first vice-president, was presented by a very heavy bombardment, which obliterated the picture.\nHeadaches Caused By Catarrh\n\nNo need to suffer from catarrh. Use Nerviline Freckles.

They are beginning to develop an \"esprit de corps\" and that certainly tends to make better discipline.\n\nOn April 1st, Mr. Conley and Miss Elliott attended the course held in Brantford for training Girl Guide Officers. They were enrolled on April 4th, when all Girl Guides and officers were present.\n\nMr. Conley was discharged April 5th, and Miss Elliott returned to her place. Miss Elliott living in the Farm Tent Room until his cottage is ready for occupation.\n\nMr. Taylor arrived from England on April 1st, and was taken on the staff to assist in supervision of boys and to take care of animals, which are minor responsibilities.\n\nMiss Taylor left on April 15th, for one month's holiday.\n\nOn June 7th, the girls, again together, left for one week's holiday.\n\nOn April 2nd, the girls returned to their homes, i.e., to their families. Miss Elliott visited by the principal but no traces could be found in the girls. The girls were notified that they have not been reported on.\n\nApril 13th, we got our first snow and had our first snowstorm.\n\nApril 16th, the snows came up but there was no serious damage.\n\nMiss Elliott is now well following the treatment. Our small girls are quite normal and the older girls ready to their activities at school.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, the Girl Guides met every Friday evening under the instruction of Miss Elliott and Mr. Elliott in the Family Hall. These activities include games, country dances, singing, and story telling stories in addition to drill and we attribute the improvement in the girl discipline to the largely due to this training.\n\nOn April 13th, the Royal Foresters Chapter of I.O.O.F. presented the school with a picture entitled \"The Forester's Gift\" to the school. Colonel and Mrs. Murray were present at the ceremony of presentation and were most effectively married.\n\nOn April 17th, Mr. Yale of the Great Lakes Institute visited us on April 17th.\n\nThe girls who are on the verge of becoming adults have been for about three weeks. They looked so well with each other that they did not want to leave on April 27th, which proved to be a rest.\n\nOn May 3rd, we had a meeting of parents and invited them until June 7th.\n\nOn May 10th, the pupils were called back and all have made good recoveries.\n\nOn May 17th, the boys' windows and doors and school closed because of this. This is not a month later than usual.\n\nOn May 18th, Miss Elliott and Miss Conley came and lunch here. The Bishop was unable to visit the whole school and expressed his satisfaction.\n\nMay 19th, Mr. Conley, who is to visit Canada yesterday or the League of Nations and make a visit. We told of last year to Chief Levi Gabriel at Teewa and I think he was very impressed with what he heard. Needless to say, he was convinced that the Normal Institute was far from being neglected.\n\nAnd everything in the school and I to this spring the girls have shown several days of the flowers to be in very great improvement.\n\nJune 12th, Messrs. Foster, Vincent, and Mr. Dorso attended the Farmers Demonstrations at the Ontario Agricultural College.\n\nOn June 16th, Miss Foster and Miss Conley through Mr. Dorso to attend the Convention at Toronto, visited the school and Church.\n\nMiss Waswanipi from Ontario School for the Blind came June 17th.\nJune 18th. The Delegates to a Convention Of the Daughters of England visited the school. There were twenty-three full of delegates and it took practically two hours to show them everything they wanted to see. June 25th. Mrs. Rotariu who had heard of us from other visitors came to see us on their own house.\n\nJune 26th. Mr. and Mrs. Rogers with Mrs. Knowles and Mrs. Howarth visited our Elgin Institute. It was a most interesting day and all members of the party felt the trip worth while.\n\nJune 27th. Our new boiler heated a car of coal in seven and a half hours. Strawberries were picked for the first time.\n\nJune 30th. A garden party for the Girl Guides was held at the Johnson family house. We contributed four gallons of ice-cream and our guides danced and helped with the visitors.\n\nJuly 1st. We painted all the beds, the girls white and the boys grey enamel.\n\nThe girls painted and varnished the burlap in the new wing which had discoloured badly owing to the dampness.\n\nThe farm cottages at the church were thoroughly re-decorated and the roof repaired. This cottage was in a bad condition as it had not been able to do any work for years.\n\nThe attics have all been varnished and the verandah floors painted.\n\nAll the wood in furniture has been painted and the polish renewed.\n\nWe have had little to ordinary farm work as we have filled the woodshed with wood cut with our own tractor, all roads have been graded and re-filled.\n\nOur poultry have kept us well supplied with eggs for setting and the pupils have been plentifully supplied with eggs.\n\nThe old carpenters shop has been removed from its old site where it was too close to the new wing and is now conveniently situated near the farm building where it has been converted into store rooms for tools with a large room for use by the men.\n\nOn April 21st, we had the first fine weather and all the crops at our feet. We needed the first fall with rain on April 18th.\n\nApril 21st was rather cold over night for several days.\n\nAll the fences on the place have been erected early in May.\n\nAll our fruit trees are in good order.\n\nWe have been very busy with our work.\n\n5th July 1923\nOttawa, July 9th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge, with thanks, the report of the Mohawk Institute for the quarter ended June 30th, last. This report has been read with interest, and the Department is pleased to know that conditions at the school show continued activity and progress.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. Rogers, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrantford, Ont.\nSeptember 4, 1924.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nThe New England Company, in 1922, decided to repay to the Mohawk Globe Trustees the sum taken for the buildings at Lytton, the trustees to hand the payments over to the Indian Department towards the expenses of the building activity at the Mohawk Institute (See Pyle 134275 for the letter showing original decision). The first payment of \u00a31000 was made in December, 1922 (Pyle 32-0-1). Subsequent payments of \u00a3250, \u00a3250 and \u00a3193 were made up to December 1923. These payments total $7878.60 and the Charter Clerk's letter of the 20th December, 1923, announcing the payment of \u00a3193, stated \"this sum represents the balance of the amount of Mohawk Globe Trust Funds which the company used for the buildings at St. George's School, Lytton [Pyle 540514].\nDear Mr. Rogers,\n\nMy attention has been drawn to the financial condition of the Mohawk Institute and I note, with regret, that during the 15 months ended June 30th, last, there has been a loss of approximately $4,000 in current financing.\n\nThe quarterly statements for the period in question show balances as follows:\n\n| Date       | Credit Balance |\n|------------|----------------|\n| April 1, 1923 | $1,690.85      |\n| June 30, 1923 | $68.44         |\n| Sept. 30, 1923 | $797.01        |\n| Dec. 31, 1923 | $558.96        |\n| Mar. 31, 1924 | $1,797.10      |\n| June 30, 1924 | $2,800.45      |\n\nThis is a serious situation and demands thoughtful consideration, so that remedial measures may be taken. It is particularly disturbing when one compares the grants which the Mohawk Institute has received with those paid to other Indian residential schools in your area, where the Department endeavours to care for replacements and repairs to buildings. The regular grant for these schools is $150 per capita per annum. In the case of the Mohawk Institute the per capita grant for the period under consideration has been at the rate of $160. In addition, you have received during the 15 months payments from the New England Company amounting to approximately $7100. Divide this amount by the average pupils of 115.6, and the amount of the New England Company grant has been approximately $50 per pupil per annum. The Mohawk Institute has therefore received grants totalling $110 per pupil. Compare this with the regular grant of $150, and the seriousness of the retrogression is apparent.\n\nYour financial statements have been examined in detail and, with the exception of the September quarter, the expenditures have exceeded the receipts.\n\n| Quarter     | Receipts   | Expenditures |\n|-------------|------------|--------------|\n| June quarter, 1923 | $7,207.47 | $9,910.86    |\n| Sept.       | $1,953    | $4,004.77    |\n| Dec.        | $1,922    | $8,064.29    |\n| Mar.        | $6,170    | $7,601.36    |\n| June        | $6,941    | $7,806.81    |\n\nThis statement, taken alone, indicates that expenditures have been undertaken without sufficient hesitation and consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Rogers,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\n\nI wish to -\nI wish to compare the quarterly expenditures during the calendar years 1922 and 1923:\n\n|       | 1922     | 1923     |\n|-------|----------|----------|\n| March quarter | $5,870.48 | $5,841.57 |\n| June   | $7,429.80 | $9,918.86 |\n| Sept.  | $6,460.60 | $6,904.77 |\n| Dec.   | $7,165.82 | $8,069.89 |\n\n$26,646.70 $30,754.49\n\nThis increased expenditure, which is not confined to any one quarter, can be accounted for only partly by an increased average attendance of approximately 3.\n\nThe fact that, before the middle of the quarter, you have considered it advisable to ask for advances totalling $4,000 on the current quarter's earnings (estimated $4,400) is indicative of the fact that the institution is behind financially and that you have found it necessary to expend the per capita grant before it was earned.\n\nThe Department is prepared to assist you in the effort to improve the financial condition of the school. An officer of the Schools Branch will be in Brantford on the 24th and 25th instant, for the purpose of examining the vouchers at the Mohawk Institute and making a study of the expenditures for the past few quarters. After his report has been received, Mr. Perrier will find an opportunity to visit the school, for the purpose of assisting in any way he can.\n\nIn the interim, I have to instruct you to incur no expense that is not absolutely necessary for the satisfactory conduct of the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nQuarter 1st, 20th September 1934.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the activities and progress of the work of this Institute.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n2. All Services held this morning were held at the Church under the direction of Rev. James Owen. In the exception of the holiday services for which our children attended Trinity Church in the city of Toronto. This summer we have been able to be served by visits from various members of the Board and the latest plans to make for the future to all those interested in our work. Our friends and helpers will be grateful for the work they have done.\n\nWe have had a very successful year at the school, and I am pleased to report that the children's attendance at the school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nwere invited to the Fire to Exhibition and afternoon tea at the school for six pupils and four officers to see the firemen. Due to the kindness of the local \"Twilight\" Rotary Club, we only had to bring a lunch with us and they supplied the refreshments for our pupils. We also were able to use a car, but not in the coldest weather. The principal followed the trucks with his own horse and cart so he could keep an equally good lunch. The following day was hot, although with it came a slight rain. We went out driving, we danced, and I did not lose our pupils except to report that only one remained during the night. We have no anxiety on account of a pupil being missing. We will call the next crowd I am able to get in touch with. A child by the name of Smith was there. We explained that he had hidden behind the back of a platform, where a sword-fight was about to take place in order to find out how it was done.\n\nThe material for Girl Guides' ordinary recreations have been found and placed in the library school.\n\nNOTES: On July 5th, Mr. Levitt and Mrs. Levitt visited the school.\n\nJuly 7th: The Girl Guides were enrolled by Mrs. Atte, the local Dominion leader, at the school. After the ceremony of enrolment, the school was opened by Miss Jane, the leader of the Order of the Empire, who presented our flags with its colours. She had a number of visitors including Mr. and Mrs. Colonel C.M. Brown and the event took place on the following day. After the event, our girl was an addition of nine and twenty-three. The whole affair reflected great credit upon the hard work of Mrs. Knowles, our leader.\n\nMrs. Levitt left that evening for her headquarters of which she spoke in training at the Girl Guides Camp.\n\nBefore school holidays all the staff of the interior had one weeks holiday. July 14th: Colonel Brown brought down the Musical Director of the Canadian National Exhibition to see the school. We met the director, who so kindly arranged for our pupils to have free entrance to the Exhibition.\n\nJuly 19th: Miss Leslie and pupils left for holidays; there were only 20 boys and girls left in the building at six o'clock. Mrs. Knowles and a few children left the following week.\n\nJuly 23rd: Mr. Elliott of the Board invited Colonel Brown from Alberta and Mrs. Parsons to meet the excellent members of the Six Nations Reserve.\n\nJuly 26th: We had the pleasure of entertaining visitors from the Cecilia College School on the Snow Lake Reserve.\n\nJuly 27th: Colonel Brown was sent over by Colonel Brown.\n\nJuly 28th: Colonel Ashton inspected the former school buildings.\n\nAugust 2nd: Mr. Elliott, Mrs. Elliott, and four others of the staff returned to Winnipeg.\n\nAugust 10th: School reopened and pupils attended as usual; but Mr. Elliott was off to the Army College. Mrs. Elliott was not able to attend because of the sickness of their children. There were only a number of students attending school that day.\n\nAugust 16th: School was closed for school closing and commencement of the new school year. Only Mrs. Elliott attended.\n\nAugust 23rd: School lessons were given in all kinds of weather, whether it be cold or hot. The weather was very fine and education was fine too. Mrs. Elliott kept on her feet. We unfortunately had only too much to do, but we understand the duties in consequence.\n\nSept. 6th: Mrs. Elliott was sent to hospital to attend the children.\n\nSept. 11th: Mrs. Elliott with fell off skiing and broke her arm. She was sent to the hospital for treatment. The doctor said Doctor could discover this fall was not serious.\n11th October 1941.\n\nThe weather has been quite good recently, although there have been some showers. The crops are doing well, but we need more rain to ensure a good harvest. We have started harvesting our wheat and are making progress. The silos are almost full, and we are preparing to store the grain. The government has provided us with some equipment to help with the harvesting process. We are grateful for their support.\n\nWe are also working on improving our irrigation system to ensure better crop yields. The government has allocated funds for this project, and we are confident that it will be successful.\n\nWe are looking forward to the upcoming harvest season and are planning to sell our surplus grain at the local market. We are also considering selling some of our produce to local businesses.\n\nThank you for your continued support. We look forward to working together in the future.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RC 10), Volume (200), File 466-1, Part 1\nOttawa, October 21, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge, with thanks, receipt of your report on the Mohawk Institute for the quarter ended the 30th ultimo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nS. Rogers, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nOctober 21, 1924.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nOn the 24th and 26th ultimo Mr. Phelan audited the books of the Mohawk Indian Residential School and made a study of the expenditure for a period of fifteen months ended June 30th, last. He prepared a comprehensive report, which is hereunder, and I was able to discuss with Mr. Rogers, upon the occasion of my visit to the school last Wednesday, the best methods of placing the institution on a sounder financial basis.\n\nI am convinced that the deficit of approximately $3,000 in current financing is accounted for largely by (1) the replacements and additions to stock and agricultural machinery, (2) interior decorating of the main building. The replacements and additions were necessary if the farm was to be put on a paying basis and the decorating was advisable for general reasons and particularly because of the large number of visitors to the institution. I know of no Indian residential school in Canada, that is subjected to the same continuous stream of visitors as the Mohawk.\n\nThe tuition period in the case of the boys of the Mohawk Institute is short. The reasons for this are truancy and delinquency following holidays. When pupils did not return and could not be brought back without considerable difficulty and perhaps unpleasantness, they were struck off the roll. This all results in few large boys for the farm and garden activity, which in turn affects the financing of the institution. The principal promised to report to Superintendent Morgan cases of delinquency when it was considered advisable to have the pupils returned. In view of the unsettled conditions at present on the Six Nations Reserve, no drastic action will be taken. If the R. O. M. P. can quietly assist, they will be asked to cooperate.\n\nThe principal has a good chance to improve the financial condition of the school, as practically $4,000 expenditure during the past fifteen months will not have to be repeated for some years. Further, the barns are filled with feed and the natural increase of the stock will be a source of revenue. Besides, I have made arrangements with the principal to requisition for drugs and classroom supplies. The expenditure in this connection has in the past been provided by the management from current funds.\nI wish to point out that all bills have been paid promptly and the reputation of the institution is not suffering in the business world because of any outstanding accounts.\n\nMr. Rogers welcomed any scheme that would assist him in the general financing in the future and I promised that favourable consideration would be given to the necessary replacements and repairs to plant. Further, special expenditures only should be met from the New England Company grant and the principal welcomed the assistance of the Department in the administration of this money. I advised him to write to the Charter Clerk, informing him that the Department would fund the money in a special trust account and would assist in the administration in the future. The Department also should correspond with the New England Company in this connection.\n\nThe principal expressed his willingness to carry on with advances on the per capita grant from time to time for a further period and to make a determined effort to get on a sounder financial basis. He will receive, as heretofore, the $160 per capita grant and will use this entirely for regular current expenditure. Special requirements will be referred to the Department for decision.\n\nCertain small accounts for interior decorating and repairs will be paid from appropriation during the next few weeks and will not be charged to the present school funds.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, October 23, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Bush:\n\nThe best method of financing the Mohawk Institute has been given considerable thought by the principal and the officers of the Department. Mr. Rogers would like our active cooperation and this can best be given if we advise him concerning all expenditures other than those of a purely current nature.\n\nThe school is paid $150 per child per year from Parliamentary Appropriation and is also allowed from the same source grants for replacements, repairs and additions to plant and equipment when funds can be found for the purpose. The principal and I agree that the New England Company grant of \u00a31000 per annum should be used for special expenditures which are necessary from time to time, if the school is to continue to be a point of interest and satisfaction to the hundreds who visit it every year. I know of no Indian residential school in Canada that is subjected to the same continual stream of tourists and visitors as the Mohawk Institute. I am pleased to inform you that the Superintendent of Indian Education has lately visited the school and he reports that not only is splendid work being done, but that the buildings, the grounds and farm are in fine condition.\n\nTo assist Mr. Rogers with special expenditures, it is advisable that the New England Company gift be paid to the Department, the same as in the case of the Lytton Industrial School, and I should be grateful if you would arrange to have the quarterly payment, which you will send out in December, addressed to me and made out in my favour. I will deposit it in a special trust account and it will be used upon the principal's request with my approval, as needs arise.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nF. B.

F. MacKenzie Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa,\n\nDear Mr. MacKenzie:\n\nI have just had a talk with Mr. Rogers, who tells me he thinks that the Department wishes me to inspect the Mohawk Institute.\n\nI have refrained from doing this hitherto as I have received no definite orders regarding it and I do not understand the position or what is required of me.\n\nI am satisfied that the Mohawk Institute is well conducted and as the Principal corresponds and deals directly with the Superintendent of Schools and that Officer visits and inspects the school himself I am not clear what is required of me.\nIf the Department will be good enough to write me definite instructions and furnish Mr. Rogers with a copy I shall be glad to act upon them.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCM/B.\nOttawa, November 28, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Rogers:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information and guidance, a copy of my letter of today's date to Superintendent Morgan, outlining his duties in connection with the Mohawk Institute.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nS.

It will not be necessary for you to certify to the vouchers of the school, but I wish you would check over the bank and other books and the receipts each quarter, and certify to the four financial statements which the principal sends in to the Department each year.\n\nAll applications for the admission or discharge of pupils from your agency will, of course, come through your office. Give the principal what assistance he requires in the matter of the return of delinquent pupils. Mr. Rogers is receiving a copy of this letter for his information and guidance.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nLt. Col. O. H. Morgan,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nBrantford's Oldest Educational Institution\n\nMohawk Indian Institute Was Founded Nearly 100 Years Ago\n\nThe Mohawk Institute was founded in 1826, nearly a hundred years ago, by the New England Company who, it will be remembered, aided greatly in the work of the old Mohawk Church, one of the original first places of worship in this locality. In recent years, however, much more money has been given by the Department of Indian Affairs, which has had the result of making the school more prosperous.\n\nThe best possible facilities have been provided for the propagation of Christian knowledge among the Mohawk Indians and their children. The school was opened in 1826, and has been in operation ever since. It is now under the management of the Mohawk Institute Board, and is conducted by a staff of teachers who are thoroughly trained in the methods of education.\n\nThe school offers a wide range of courses, including English, History, Geography, Mathematics, Science, Music, Art, and Physical Education. The students are encouraged to participate in various extracurricular activities, such as sports, drama, and music.\n\nThe school also provides a variety of vocational training programs, including carpentry, sewing, and cooking. These programs are designed to equip the students with the skills they need to succeed in their future careers.\n\nIn addition to its academic and vocational programs, the school offers a strong emphasis on religious education. The students are taught about the principles of Christianity, and are encouraged to develop a personal relationship with God.\n\nThe school is located in a beautiful setting, surrounded by trees and fields. The campus is well-maintained, and provides a peaceful environment for learning.\n\nThe school is open to all students, regardless of race or religion. It is a place where students can come together to learn, grow, and succeed.\n\nSunday Schools Give Religious Education\n\nStrong Staff or Devoted Teachers Utilize Sunday Schools Effectively.\n\nIn the city schools of the city there are many religious schools for young people used to meet their religious needs, which is a total equal to that of the children attending secular schools. But the Sunday schools include adults, and although the same is true of the institute, it is probable that the attendance at the Sunday schools is more than in the city or parish.\n\nIn most cases the Sunday school is attended by a large number of adults, and although the same is true of the institute, it is probable that the attendance at the Sunday schools is more than in the city or parish.\n\nIn most cases the Sunday school is attended by a large number of adults, and although the same is true of the institute, it is probable that the attendance at the Sunday schools is more than in the city or parish.\n\nInstitutional Building, Staff and Pupils of the Mohawk Institute\nHEALTH!\n\nThe Part Brant Creameries, Ltd. Play in the Child Life of Brantford!\n\nThe Value of Ice Cream and Butter\n\nTo a child these two\u2014ice cream and butter\u2014are necessities, and here at the Brant Creameries we pride ourselves on the excellence of our product. Statistics show that ice cream is a body builder and is the most valuable food for children. The doctor says in his letters to mothers regarding ice cream is sufficient in itself to commend ice cream as a daily part of a child's food. Butter too, is nourishing, and what healthful food can one think of than bread and butter?\n\nOur plant is among the very best equipped for production of these foods, and the cleanliness of manufacture will meet with the approval of the most pronounced critic.\n\nBrant Creamery Butter\n\nHave you tried Brant Creamery butter\u2014good judges of butter have told us that it is the best they have ever tasted. Only the finest and richest cream is used and no expense spared to make Brant Butter the best.\n\nNext time you order butter ask for Brant\u2014dealers get it fresh every day.\n\nIT'S WORTHWHILE TO INSIST ON BRANT PRODUCTS\n\nHeathization Insures Purity\n\nBrant Ice Cream is Heathized. You may ask what Heathization is and what it means\u2014answer\u2014it is a method of making ice cream perfected by Prof. Paul Heath whereby all the air in ice cream is expelled and replaced by C. O. 2. This is carbon dioxide, which creates the healthful, sterile, natural food atmosphere and is the same thing that gives soda water its zest and sparkle. Ice cream made by this process is a perfect food for children.\n\nBrant Ice Cream\u2014A Health Food\n\nWhy should you give children ice cream? Because they like it? Because it seems to be so good? Because it is good\u2014yes, but there is another reason why ice cream is good\u2014the best reason of them all. Ice cream will help build strong, starchy bodies, especially ice cream like Brant, where only the finest of ingredients are used and everywhere care is exercised to preserve the absolute perfection of the finished product. There is a store near you selling Brant Ice Cream all winter long.\n\nIt is Our Wish That Your Christmas May be a Merry One and That the New Year Will Bring You Happiness, Health and Prosperity\nINSTITUTIONAL BUILDING, STAFF AND PUPILS OF THE MOHAWK INSTITUTE\n\nThe junior go to bed at 8 p.m., the seniors at 9 p.m. They rise at 5 a.m. and get up at 6 o'clock. Each child has a certain number of hours in school each day, and all religious exercises are conducted in the chapel.\n\nThe building is very fine, solid red brick structure known among architects as the most beautiful of its kind in Canada. It stands in extensive grounds approached through an avenue of trees and lawns with flowers and shrubs. In the midst of 12 acres of land the Institute farm, stretching away over a large area comprises orchards, fields, and grain is the pasture, pasture fields, and the barns, sheds, and stables. There are suitable living quarters, root houses, silos and pig pens.\n\nWhen Santa Comes\n\nHurrrah! for the snow, hurrrah! for the moon,\nAway we go sliding, all in a row.\nWe are glad that winter is here,\nThat is why we play and cheer.\n\nThe trees are all bare and the ground all white,\nWe shall make snowballs and have a grand fight.\nAnd when I'm in bed as snug as can be,\nTis then that dear old Santa comes to see me.\n\nPicture-Books\n\nSummer fading, winter comes,\nFreshly mown, the grass grows,\nWoven into wreaths, they hang,\nAnd the children laugh.\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nA CHRISTMAS TALK\n\nBy Robert Power, Author of the widely read \"Two-Minute Talks.\"\n\nChristmas is not the word festive with a fine spirit of jollity and good cheer, the suggestion of reunion, and the time when we call \"True\" to dull care and carking worries.\n\nThat day that is these modern days \"Christmas\" is dying out as a festival. All the time there are kiddles in the homes and sometimes in the hearts of fathers and mothers. Learned professors and those who give amid ancient customs and time-worn ceremonies, tell us that Christmas is but a pagan survival, an improvisation of Woden's Jule. Modern writers say there is a deeper meaning in the Festival than can be explained away by myth or legend.\n\nIf we Jo but gorge and gusset at Christmas we enter into the grave aspect and miss the spiritual significance of the Festival. Or if our Christmas experience has been phlegmatic, drowsy, or prosaic expression, it is but a barren season. A Christmas word is better than a Christmas card and a hearty shake more effective than a stilted letter of \"good wishes,\" which, after all, may mean nothing.\n\nThe story of the Nativity is often that goes down to the roots of human life. The star raised in the East, and the Magi hastened to the stable where the angels sang in the Highest. Peace! Goodwill toward men for an old world. And we are poor spirits and children in imagination if we cannot catch something of the glory of the Christmas season. A festival! A season of good cheer! A trace of divinity, a time to remember the poor. Come, let us wascall his neighbor.\n\nChristmas in the time of God's Remembrance. The Nativity blends earth with heaven, the past and the present made One. It is the day when we should take wings and fly away and find it means another mile down in the journey of our life. To some it is the first Christmas; to others it will be the last. How memory flies back to other seasons when times we have been were with us and whom we knew are far away or whom we think we have thrown behind the clouds of the valley.\" In the last silence, when we assemble for our Christmas festival, shall we be able to bring to those who have kept their feet wide awake and show so sweetly true the words of imagination, the gentle poet of everyday life: \"The spirits of the lovely dead, whisper the story of old times.\"\n\nWhat is the special message for this Christmas? One of patience and hope. Some say the times are very hard. Many point to great and overwhelming evidences that the nation is burdened almost beyond endurance. The pessimistic signs that there are no signs of the return of the old-style Christmas. Things are not what they were\u2014they roam.\n\nNo, I am thankful they are not. For while it is true that we are burdened with many problems, and Life is very hard to-day, it is just this trouble that we have no cause to despise. A new spirit is abroad among the people. More understanding, larger tolerance, a greater disposition to see the best in man, and that much finer afforded by birth, that matters. We shall be patient, and the situation means that discontent of change. The war has brought its aftermath of settlement, but it has also produced a greater understanding. Patience\u2014Home needs a full day, and social changes, upheavals of what seemed so fixed, and fresh adjustments of value, all this surges on.\n\nPeace!...and Peace! Yet the peace of interregnum, or of slumber, but the peace which comes from the clear consciousness and the consciousness of work done. If I had to wish a Christmas greeting upon those I love, I can think of no better than to desire for them a settled contentment. I love those words of dear, warm-hearted Addison, when keeping his diary Christmas in his circle of friends, all of whom are gathered 'round the stars of Old London in its literary home. He says: \"I've never seen such a Christmas. 'T give you my best respects; I salute you in the name of Charity and Friendship; may the Peace of the Magier rest upon you in all your days.\"\n\nA good Christmas is not a riotous one. It may be quiet, but it should be full of those who love rocks and excitement. But if it is to be with your dear ones and promotes the fellowship of the family\u2014why there can be no better way of keeping the day hallowed in the Christian Calendar. Let it have its place, relative, half in life, a time for consideration, a Christmas at the end of one year, the threshold of another.\n\n\"Watchman, what of the night?\" was the question asked in ancient days. Yes, there has been cloud and gloom. The memories of the war are still with us even at this Festival of Joy. How many a broken household does the war leave behind in the springtime of life, and whom does shoulders in a forlorn land? Yet there who mourn, be patient with the mothers and the wives who grow thoughtful and fall into a reverie. Perhaps their hearts are sad over in the human life joy is mingled with sorrow, and smiling is heard even in the hour of rejoicing.\n\nLet us think, too, of those brave ones who fought and suffered and who are still with us. In many a home, pitiful tragedies of the war still linger. Silent sufferers, lonely and despairing, seek them out. Help them. Let your Christmas mission be to render thanks for past benefits by affording practical assistance to those who are in need.\n\nComfort the lonely. There are those who realize to the full the bitterness of being solitary when Christmas comes and most homes are filled with joy of reunions. Perhaps an opportune invitation, or a cheery word showing that after all somebody has remembered them\u2014this is the real Christmas spirit in practical expression.\n\nTime steals on, and as the minutes tick away, the fingers in the belfry of the old church prepare to wake the music of the chimes. I know of no more inspiring and memory-awakening sound than the toll of the church bells ringing for the joy of Christmas-tide. As I listen, there is a vague seem to be repeating the age-old message of God to man:\n\n\"Glory to God in the Highest; and on earth Peace, Goodwill toward Men.\"\n\nRing on, brave bells! Times change, and generations come and go. But as long as the years endure, the message shall awaken the Christmas season. Goodwill, Peace, and Fellowship among the sons of men!\n\nLong Before Brantford School Children Were Born\n\nTHE GIBSON COAL CO.\n\nfirst commenced to supply coal to the citizens of Brantford. Just 31 years ago we opened our offices and in that time we have built up a reputation for efficient service and square dealing, and our\nFeeding Schedule For Breast Feeding\n\nBY DR. STANLEY CLEMONS,\nAttending Physician, Children's Ward, Wesley Memorial Hospital, Chicago.\n\nHuman milk is the ideal food for the baby. Not only does it contain fat, sugar, protein, salts and water in the proper proportions for the infant's needs, but it also contains other substances which provide the baby with immunity against disease. The superiority of breast milk to any other food is strikingly demonstrated by the fact that only four out of every hundred babies die among those who are breast fed.\n\nThese figures furnish irrefutable proof that no mother can afford to deprive her baby of breast milk if she is capable of supplying it unless her own physical condition is such that her physician forbids her nursing the baby.\n\nEven though she may not be able to supply a sufficient amount of milk, the baby that receives a portion of his food from the mother has a better chance than the one who is wholly bottle fed.\n\nSTAY LATE, FOLKS!\n\nThe mother's milk does not appear in the breast until three or four days after the baby is born. Nevertheless, the baby should be put to the breast at regular intervals both to accustom him to nursing and to stimulate the flow of milk. It is also important during these first few days to give the infant water frequently.\n\nWhen the mother's milk supply is established, the nursing intervals should usually be either three or four hours. In general the mother will produce more milk if the baby is on a three rather than four-hour schedule.\n\nWhen the mother has plenty of milk, and the baby is strong and vigorous, the four hour feeding is to be preferred. By so doing the mother has longer intervals both to save time and the infant is less likely to suffer from vomiting and colic.\n\nWhether the three or four hour interval be adopted, one feeding can usually be omitted at night.\n\nKEEP RIGID SCHEDULE:\n\nOnce the feeding schedule is decided upon, it should be rigidly followed. If, for a short time, the baby may be allowed to be awakened at nursing time, he soon learns to awake at the proper time.\n\nTo offer the breast when he cries, or when it suits the mother's convenience, usually results in a fussy, colicky baby who disturbs the peace of the entire household. Particularly bad is the habit of allowing\n\nFor the Dearest Baby in All the World\n\nYour baby, daughter's baby, son's baby, sister's baby, brother's baby, friend's baby, chum's baby, any baby, just baby. \"Two chubby, dimpled legs, ten tiny toes, soft and warm, what a marvel of creation!\" Deserving of the best you can afford and what a sweet thought of mother love in every hand stitch that makes the little wearables, so dear to mother's heart.\n\nMadriga Embroidered Bibs from $1.50\nPadded Silk Jackets $2.50\nStamped Dresses from $1.50\nBaby's Wrappers from $1.50\nBaby's Nighties from $1.50\nBaby's Bonnets from $1.50\nBaby's Pillow Covers from $1.50\nBaby and Ma-Ma Dolls from $.50 to $3.00\n\nOur service is unsurpassed and we gladly inform you in the finishing of any garment you buy.\n\nMISSES Mcgregor\nFancy Goods Store\n149 Colborne St.\n\nhave built up a reputation for efficient service and square dealing, and our\n\nD.

Rogers, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nI found the dormitories on the side clean and swept, the white-enclosed beds and walls rendering them comfortable and attractive.\n\nThe playrooms are dingy and delapidated, and the old bat and plaster ceilings, etc., are falling away in many places, require replacing, and a general painting and renovating is desirable.\n\nOwing to a snow-storm and the depth of snow on the ground I did not visit the farm or the farm buildings.\n\nI recently was advised by the Dept. of a successful action by the Six Nations against the England Company, and received instructions in the same letter to \"take up the land which was the subject of the action.\" I spoke to Mr. Rogers regarding this but neither he nor anyone I can find appear to know what land this relates or from whom I could take delivery in the name of the Six Nations. I will discuss this question when I visit Ottawa next week.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nLt. Col. C. F. Morgan,\nSupt. Six Nations.\nJanuary 16, 1925\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to report that I inspected the Mohawk Institute today during the children's dinner hour.\n\nI found the dinner, which consisted of liver, potatoes and turnips, followed by buns, plentiful, of good quality, and well and cleanly served. There were 73 girls and 44 boys, of which 8 girls and 4 boys were laid up with slight grippe colds, but there is no serious illness in the Institute.\n\nOne boy, Huben Fox, is in the Hospital suffering from Malaria, but he is expected to be out in about six weeks.\n\nI visited the kitchens, laundry and other utilities and found them clean and well kept.\n\nThe children are very\u6574\u6d01 and appeared cheerful and happy, while the staff is able and efficient.\nOttawa, January 23rd, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, reporting on your inspection of the Mohawk Institute.

Col. O. T.

C. H. Owen was in charge of all services which were conducted in the Senior School-room. He administered Holy Communion once each month. Owing to the lack of space in School-room a number of the Primary children meet in the Boys School-room and receive religious instruction. The School is divided under the teachers for Sunday school which is conducted every Sunday at 10.45 a.m. In the evening all attend prayers and after the younger children are dismissed choir practice is held. Twice a month the Principal gives a talk on current events or Lantern slides are shown with suitable readings.\n\nStaff. There was no change of staff during the quarter. Mrs Knowles, who is a very energetic officer, was poorly and as a nervous breakdown was feared she was granted a weeks rest commencing March End.\n\nMrs Rogers left for holiday on February 7th.\n\nDiscipline. On the whole we have had very good discipline which has made the work much easier and has enabled the pupils to obtain greater benefits from their school-life. It is most gratifying to note absence of insolence which used to be so common and the children are constantly showing evidence of greater confidence in their teachers. It is felt that the restoration of law and order on the local Reserve has helped a great deal to bring this condition about.\n\nWhile our ordinary pupils are showing improvement, it is regrettable that our students attending the Collegiate and Business College are not so satisfactory. They take no interest in the tasks allotted them at the school and are inclined to be impertinent to the staff. They are frequently quite late in returning from their classes and appear to think that other pupils should be detailed to wait on them. Possibly the lack of discipline in the Collegiate and Business College accounts for their attitude.\n\nAmusements. On January 1st, sleigh-riding and skating were the order of the day and a special dinner of Roast pork, baked potatoes, mashed turnip and mince pies. During the evening all the school met in the Dining hall for games and competitions.\n\nOn January the seventeenth the girls went for a sleigh ride and took eggs to Reuben Fox at the hospital they then called for Mary Waswanipi at the Blind School. Mrs Knowles has kept the Girl Guide and Brownie movement active and has had good success despite the fact that the local Commissioner has been out of town and has therefore conducted no Rallies, which always serve to stimulate our girls' interest.\n\nOutside competition always serves to increase our girls' enthusiasm. The boys had a good rink and were allowed to water hill near the school on which they had some very fine sleighing. A number of boys were given opportunity to build their own sleighs. They used old\npacking cases and barrel staves for lumber and made some very novel mischief.\n\nHEALTH. We commenced the quarter with a fairly clean bill of health but in January we had an epidemic of colds with nasty sore throats and in February we had another spell of the flu. It was necessary to call Dr. Brown and Dr. Macdonald and many children who had had ear complications left by the measles were again troubled during the flu epidemic. However, good care resulted in the restoration of our usual freedom from sickness.\n\nReuben Fox, who was taken to hospital last quarter to be operated upon for mastoid after a recovery, developed subarachnoid meningitis with fatal results on 17th February. Mr. Fox's kindness and co-operation on record his appreciation of the kindness of both the hospital staff and the Doctors of this town. On one occasion when Reuben's condition was puzzling our Doctor no less than four other Doctors came and held free consultations.\n\nNOTES. School re-opened on January 2nd, with a full staff. During the quarter Rev. Jones of Chawesen visited the school often. His visits keep him in touch with the pupils from his Parish and it is felt that this has a good effect.\n\nJanuary 8th. Frank Fox visited his brother at hospital who had taken a sudden turn for the worse. We also telegraphed Mr. Macdonald to inform father of the latter's arrival and pleaded poverty so we boarded him for several days for which we got credit but not payment.\n\nJanuary 12th. We brought Lizzie Snake home from hospital.\n\nJanuary 13th. A neighbour, Mr. G. Good, suffered the loss of his house from fire. Our men and boys helped to free and care for stock and we started the cottage to him until such time as he can rebuild.\n\nJanuary 16th. Mrs. Dunlop, the former housekeeper here, visited us. She is connected with Children's Amalgamation and has experience in that work both in England and here and she says that our standard of living and accommodation is far better than the average home she visits.\n\nOn February the seventh we commenced upon a spell of very mild weather February the Thirteenth took Reuben Fox's body to Middlemiss.\n\nFebruary 19th. A large convention from Hamilton visited the School. The mild weather and rain caused floods on 24th, February.\n\nFebruary 26th. The temperature dropped suddenly and a very high wind caused two radiators to freeze during the night. This made it very difficult to heat the building.\n\nFebruary 28th at 7.30 p.m. we felt an earthquake shock.\n\nMarch 2nd. Mrs Knowles took sick leave.\n\nColonel Morgan inspected monthly.\n\nINDUSTRIES. The Girls have altered Cadet Marine uniforms to fit our boys and made suits for the small boys from jersey cloth purchased at the Paris Mills. They have also made two issues of shirts for boys and one of aprons and combinations for the girls. Besides this they have made new kitchen and Dining Room aprons and kept all clothing being worn in repair.\n\nWe have commenced a new work with our girls. All scraps of cloth now are being saved and made into very attractive rag rugs. The boys have renovated the Girls playroom and painted it.\n\nThis is a great improvement.\n\nFarm and Garden. We have carried out the usual work for this quarter in a very satisfactory fashion and in addition we have painted all the farm wagons, made new double-trees and single-trees and over-hauled our machinery. The hospital, which was touching the new wing has been moved to a new site and is now attractively situated on the side of the tennis lawn with row of spruce trees for a back-ground. After removing the hospital the ground was graded several hundreds loads of earth being necessary for this work.\n\nWe shall commence this year's farming operations better prepared than has been the case for several years.\nOttawa, May 19th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your report on the activities and progress of the work at the Mohawk Institute for the quarter ended March 31st, last. We are pleased to note that the work progressed satisfactorily; that the general health of the pupils was good and that the school was ready to commence this year's farming operations better prepared than has been the case for several years.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAas't. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. Rogers, Esq.,\nPrincipal, Mohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nDear Mr. Post,\n\nThe Bishop of Huron has given considerable visit to the Mohawk Indians on the day before, in view of gathering information regarding his visit prior to carry out the wishes of the Anglican Church, which recently in Timiskaming had to be over the Indians. Mrs. Boyce told today that she had heard in a recent news that the Bishop wanted to take over the Mohawk Church, and she also said that the New England Congregationalist to retain control of this church, will provide for the clergy of the church until the next installation of it.\n\nIf I may add something, I believe that the Union it would be great to see the Mohawk tribe into control of the Bishop of Huron. It is a possibility that the church will be taken over by all its historic association for the Six Nations. . . . . . . . . . . . . .

A bad feeling will be experienced on the Reserve by the omission of those who consider they should have been invited.\n\nYou will please issue invitations through me to the Council, the School Board, the Indian C.F.V.A. (those who should also I think be asked to attend), the parents of fallen soldiers, and all members of the Six Nations Band who wish to attend.\n\nAs the representative of the Indian Department I should also be present and upon future occasions when public meetings are held at the Mohawk Institute, which involve the use of Departmental, or Indian lands or buildings, I shall be obliged if you will be good enough to notify me beforehand.\n\nThe invitations should reach me before June 4th in order that they may be read to the Council on that day.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCecil E.

Morgan,\nSuperintendent.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nJune 5th 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI regret to say that the attitude of Mr. Rogers of the Mohawk Institute towards myself, as Superintendent, is such as to leave me no alternative other than to either dissolve me from responsibility regarding him or to definitely notify him that it is your wish that I should continue upon the same lines as my predecessor, Major Smith, and that he must not commit actions, without first consulting me, which may lead to complications in the relations between the Department and the Six Nations.\n\nI have previously told you that since I came to office there has been a systematic attempt by the Indians to influence between the Institute and this Office. First, the Indians wrote to the Indians until you yourself notify me today that his returns should be closely watched before sending out, and that it was your wish that a friendly investigation should be made by me.\n\nTo avoid unpleasantness I have, therefore, been resigning these duties and have done my utmost to avoid any further complications in any way possible.\n\nYesterday I was recently met by Mr. Frank Lortner who asked me whether his daughter, Dorothy, could leave the Institute to attend the Sun Dance, and I gave him a letter to Rogers, of which I attach a copy(A). I also attach one of Major Smith's letters of a similar\nnature, and other facts. His Missive (B) to show that no letter was written so courteous or unusual.\n\nOn May 27th Rogers told me that he had asked the Bishop of Huron to unveil a new memorial to fallen Indians in the Church early this month.\n\nI had heard nothing of this officially from the Department I thought it odd and, knowing that the Council was on the look out for any excuse to accuse the Department of ignoring it, in the case of the statement of Mr. J. C., not merely written over, I wrote Rogers my letter back marked (C).\n\nThis was the height of folly. When he called me a liar, \"I'm writing to tell you that the Institute has nothing whatever to do with the children. If you receive instructions only from Mr. Rogers and you\", in reply to this I wrote:\n\nOn June 1st, Johnson returned over to Mr. Hill's, who is now Chief of the Ojibwa Band, and on the 3rd day of the Colored People, the Ojibwa Band, a missionary service, so I could not go. On the 4th day I went there and \"He said he had nothing to do with the race\".\n\nThe Council, as you know, is divided into two parties, one loyal to Mr. J. C., the other, its representatives, as to the Chief Counsellor Mr. J. C., and by Councilor Johnson, Mr. J. C., which loses an opportunity which offers to covertly\ndefy the Department and spread the seeds of dissention amongst the loyal section of the Council whenever possible.\n\nIt was Johnson who reintroduced the question of \"Status\" into the new Council. Johnson opposed the Kitchener Oil Vote. Johnson raised the controversy that the Department had slighted the dignity of the Council by erecting No 6 School by hired labour, instead of calling for contracts. In his chagrin that he could not sell the Department nails at 7\u00a2 a pound which were being bought elsewhere for 5\u00a2, and it is Johnson who poses in the Council as the arbitrator between it and the Department. Don't I am told he says, bother about the Indian Office, I will see Dr Scott about it the next time I go to Ottawa.\n\nI was informed that Rogers flung an apple of discord by a direct invitation to be present at the unveiling of a memorial of which no one had previously heard.\n\nSeveral Councillors and members of the School Board asked me why the Department had not invited them to deliver a speech on the nature of a war memorial to fall on Six Nations soldiers to be erected in the Six Nations Church.\n\nI was obliged to admit that I knew nothing about it, and to say that I did not think that the Department did either, and that not only had I, as representative of the Department received no notice but that also I had received no notice to be present, so I concluded that it had been done by Mr Rogers upon his own authority.\n\nMy omission from the list was, as obviously, in the eyes of the \"loyal flock,\" an attempt by this employee of the Department to do what they are constantly themselves striving for, get away from local supervision, that they called it with each election or vote to listen, and some no doubt ill, but the loyal element, being the stronger, voted against\n\nMr Rogers called at Colby's house or may have explained something\nattention, on the grounds that they considered that if the Department had any knowledge of the matter they would first have been consulted before the memorial was erected in their church to their dead, and that the information and invitations to attend would have reached them from the Department through the Official channel of the Indian Office.\n\nSome were favoring to you to stop it but finally they consented themselves with refusing the invitation.\n\nIn conclusion may I repeat what I have previously written you that far from wishing to exercise any authority or officiousness with the Rogers I would far sooner have nothing whatever to do with the Institute.\n\nIf the Department feels that Rogers can be trusted to be freed from all local supervision and control by the Indians, it will give me considerable relief to me, although I cannot see how my responsibilities for the Indians can be likely confined to those who are grown up and residing on the Reserve.\n\nIn any case I trust that steps will be taken to prevent any recurrence of this episode and that if Mr. Rogers finds it necessary to communicate in future with the Council or others on the Reserve that he may be told to do so through me.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nS. H. Burgess\nJune 9th, 1925.\n\nDear Colonel Morgan,\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to your relationship to the Mohawk Institute and the Principal, Mr. Rogers. I regret to learn that there has been some unpleasantness.\n\nI cannot see that there should be any doubt in your mind concerning your duties in connection with the school. If you will read my 32-0-1 of November 28th, last, you will note that you are not asked to supervise school activity or accept any responsibility. I requested a monthly inspection and report. Further, you are required to make an independent check of the school's quarterly financial statements.\n\nI have noted your letter to the Principal, relative to special leave for Dorothy Monture, one of the pupils. I think it would have been more considerate if you had suggested or recommended to the Principal that the girl be allowed to go home with her father.\n\nYour communication concerning a Memorial to pupils of the Mohawk Institute was couched in language which would be sure to cause offense. The Memorial is not a Six Nations matter\u2014it is for pupils of the school and is to be placed\nin the Mohawk Chapel, for which the Principal of the Institute is responsible to the Department. I am sure Mr. Rogers intended to send invitations to you and to the members and organizations of the Indian band. It is probable that your peremptory letter to him on this subject halted any cooperation with your office that was originally intended.\n\nI do not know what contribution Mr. Rogers has made to the present unpleasantness in your personal relations, but I wish to state that you are not responsible for him. Further, I am not prepared to criticize his actions in connection with the Memorial to former school pupils.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nLt.-Col. C. E. Morgan,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBRANTFORD, Ont.\nQuarter ending 30th June 1925.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the activities and progress of the work of this Institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChurch. Owing to the coldness of the weather we did not commence holding services in the Church until May 10th, when Rev. Soudamore was in charge. Rev. G.H. Owen conducted all other services with the exception of that held on June 28th by Rev. Smith. The children decorated the school-room most tastefully for the Easter service.\n\nStaff. During the quarter Miss Crowe resigned and her place was taken by Miss Allen who promises to develop into a very efficient officer. Miss Hardie has not enjoyed very good health but otherwise our staff has worked most satisfactorily. Miss Jackson and Miss Hardie attending Business College have had a great deal of trouble and I am glad to find that they have in the habit of absenting themselves from classes. They failed in their first examinations and although given an opportunity of an extra month's tuition only Effie Montour passed. Maggie Jackson and Helen Froman continued to trifle and were consequently dismissed after trying their examination for the second time. Dorothy Montour who is attending the Gold Plate passed her first year and has shown a very marked improvement lately.\n\nNews. A party of teachers from Hamilton visited the school early in April and showed much interest.\n\nApril 6th. Thirty children were outfitted for Chapleau. These children were forbidden to enter the school and slept in a cottage nearby. Some were in very filthy condition and although we took utmost precautions we had quite a lot of cleaning up to do after they left.\n\nThe boys had some good fishing on Good Friday and Easter Monday. Mrs Rogers returned on the 2nd.\n\nOn May 1st, our pupils were invited to a Band Concert at the local Armouries and we were encouraged by the kindly comments made as to their appearance and behaviour.\n\nMay 23rd. Mr. Ferrier visited and matters pertaining to school advancement were discussed.\n\nMay 22nd. The Remembrance Chapter of the I.O.D.E., of which Miss Hardie is a member, presented a prize for the best paper on Hygiene. This was won by Beulah Stonefish.\n\nMay 24th, being Bob Rogers birthday was the occasion of a party. We had a large birthday cake and all the staff and pupils shared it.\nJune 1st. Commenced preparations for unveiling Roll of Honour in Church. The pulpit has been removed and was presented to St. Peters Church at Onawaken.\n\nJune 5th. A Garden Party was held at St. Peters Onawaken and several of our pupils attended by Mrs. Rogers took part in the programme. In this connection it should be mentioned that due largely to the cooperation of Rev. Jones of that church there is a much more friendly spirit shown towards the school.\n\nJune 11th. Bishop Williams unveiled the Roll of Honour in the Mohawk Church. He was assisted by the Reverends Lee, White and Owen. The Town Band from Gananoque offered their services and paraded our children to and from the Church. So large was the crowd that many of the pupils had to remain outside the Church. After the service the visitors were entertained on the School Lawn to ice cream and cakes while the band played. Mrs. Pearson was absent for ten days holiday in June.\n\nMary Macdonald from the local Blind Institute commenced her annual visit on June 15th.\n\nDuring the quarter the girls were issued with new low shoes and aprons while the boys received two new shirts, new overalls, caps and hats.\n\nBuildings and grounds. In an attempt to add to the beauty of the school grounds we have reorganized our activities in that direction. Mrs. Rogers has taken charge of the flower borders and with a number of girls is giving them the care they need. This relieves the gardener who can now bend every effort to production. Large white stones have been placed along the drive and our verandah is in very fine condition.\n\nA new wall has been placed under the verandah and paint is being applied as opportunity occurs.\n\nWe have built a garage to house the new truck and to make room in the old drive shed for our implements.\n\nThe new hog pen is well under way and in the course of a week or so will be ready to occupy.\n\nFarm and Garden. We have suffered a very severe disappointment in these activities. For nearly two months prior to June 24th, we had no rain and practically the whole of the farm crops in this area threaten to be a failure. We have one field of about forty acres in hay and it is impossible to cut it. Nowhere is the grass as tall as it was last year in height. Some of our crops which showed so much promise has ripened at a height of about ten inches. However, due to having a fair acreage of alfalfa which are in a better position than most farmers.\n\nFor the same reason there were no small fruits this year and our lawns are scorched.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE. On June 30th, we had to call the Doctor to Batay Isando a recent admission who had become quite ill. It was discovered that she had been injured by a fall and had been in bed a week before she came here. She is up and appears to be well.\n\n9th July 1925.\nOttawa, July 13, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, covering the general report on the Mohawk Institute for the June quarter. This has been read with interest. I regret to note that the field crops, small fruits and lawns have suffered because of lack of moisture.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nS. Rogers, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nThe ninth General Council of the Six Nations Council met at Ohsweken July 6th, 1925.\n\nNo. 18.\n\nMoved by Frank Miller, seconded by Fred L. Johnson that we accept the invitation of the Principal of the Mohawk Institution to attend the unveiling of a war Memorial in the Mohawk Chapel on June 11th. Lost.\n\nNo. 19.\n\nMoved by Wm. Smith, seconded by John R. Lickers that in the matter of the invitation from the Principal of the Mohawk Institute to attend the unveiling of a War Memorial that this Council do not accept same as we learn that the Superintendent Col. Morgan has no knowledge of the Memorial and that no intimation that such was in contemplation has been received from the Indian Dept.\n\nThe Council does not consider it likely that the Department would ignore it and slight the fallen dead and the sorrowing living by selecting and erecting a War Memorial without first consulting the Six Nations as to what form they would wish such a Memorial to take.\n\nCarried.\n\nBrantford, July 11th, 1925.\n\nNos. 18 & 19.\n\nThe Council refused to accept the invitation of the Principal of the Mohawk Institute to attend the unveiling of the War Memorial in the Mohawk Chapel as they considered that the Council should have been consulted first as to the nature of the War Memorial they were going to erect.\n\nCecil J. Morgan,\nDept. Six Nations.\nQuarter Ending 30th September 1925.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the activities and progress of the work of this Institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChurch. During the holidays the Church was not used for services but every Sunday a short service was held in the School-room at 9.30 a.m. by the Principal and most of the remaining pupils attended Trinity Church for the morning service afterwards. Many Tourists visited the Church throughout the summer and those who have memories of the pulpit expressed themselves as delighted to see the interior of the Church as it had been for so many years. We had to hold the services at home on several occasions on account of rain. Rev. Mr Owen has been in charge and on September 12th he celebrated Holy Communion.\n\nStaff. There have been no changes in the staff during the quarter. Miss Hardie and Mrs Knowles had six weeks holiday and on their return Miss Wilson, the housekeeper had two weeks leave. Mr Knowles took two weeks holiday and Mr Thurlow attended the Dufferin Rifles Camp.\n\nDiscipline. There has been a decided improvement in the general discipline since the holidays. We have two pupils attending Collegiate and very definite rules have been laid down for their guidance, with quite severe punishments for misdemeanours. As a result they are only too anxious to do their share in maintaining their place in the school. We were also able to dismiss a number of older girls who were not a good influence. We are now, for the first time, able to maintain a Waiting List and as all the parents and pupils know this, there is a very decided effort on everyone's part to retain a place in the school.\n\nWorks. During the holidays the plaster throughout the school was patched and repaired and the girls re-varnished the stairs, wainscoting and linoleum.\n\nRev. N. Lee visited and borrowed the Principal's car to visit his old parish on the Reserve.\n\nMrs Watts, Commissioner, and Girl Guide Officers from England visited our Corps on September 1st.\n\nSeptember 16th. Nugent Bardy, one of our boys, was kicked in the shoulder by a horse in the pasture. First aid was rendered and the Doctor summoned. Upon examination it was found that only a painful bruise was the outcome.\n\nWe were also visited by Miss Bauslaugh whose father was the Principal here some sixty years ago. It was quite interesting...\nto hear her discourse upon school life in those early days.\n\nReverend Westgate and Canon Fotheringham visited the school on September 20th.\n\nOn the 24th September the members of the Rotary Club Convention were here.\n\nAfter the holidays the pupils returned promptly and early in the term we were in the fortunate position of starting our waiting list. We are very pleased to report that we have not approached any person with a view to inducing pupils to enter the school. Our pupils went home and apparently compared so favourably with other children on the Reserve that before the close of the holidays we were having applications for children that we could not accommodate.\n\nAmusements. On July 1st, the girls visited the stores in the morning and played soft-ball. In the afternoon they went in a body to Mohawk Park. The boys spent a good day at the river with the Principal.\n\nA Closing Concert was held on July 3rd, when Miss Hardie left for Victoria and Mrs Knowles for the Girl Guide Camp.\n\nJuly 4th. Closing Day. The day passed very quietly and we were left with 30 girls and 20 boys. We gave these children a more liberal diet in the way of fancy articles and generally speaking made it possible for them to have a good time at the school. Once or twice a week they went to Mohawk Pleasure Park where the management were most kind. Our pupils were allowed to ride the ponies and the merry-go-round free and they made good use of the other amusements there.\n\nOn two occasions we took a number to Grimsby where they picked fruit in the mornings. We provided picnic lunches and in the afternoons they visited the pleasure Park there and enjoyed spending the money they had earned.\n\nOne afternoon as a reward for some extra help the girls had given they were taken for a round trip on the town street car. The boys were very willing whenever volunteers were called to help handle a crop and on the whole the summer holiday passed most pleasantly. During the last week all pupils were paid a small sum in proportion to the help they had given and they went to town to spend the same.\n\nOn the 17th August, the Monday following School Opening, all the staff and pupils held a Gala at Mohawk Park. This served to settle them all back to school life after which steady work was the order of the day.\n\nOur annual Corn Roast was held on the 24th September.\n\nFarm and Garden. Despite a very backward spring and severe drought our crops were quite good, on the whole. Apart from ordinary farm activities we have completed our new pig pen, laid the cement floor and sprayed it ready for use. We have also unloaded all the coal for the coming winter and stored it away. In preparing our Fall wheat ground we had a most interesting and instructive time. Members of the Verity Plough Company brought several ploughs here and tests were carried out. The Company's expert was here and we all felt that we had learned a great deal about ploughing and ploughing when they left.\n\nOur second crop of Alfalfa was exceedingly good and a hay field, that at one time appeared as though it were ruined, revived after the heavy rains and we were able to cut a huge crop off it.\n\nOn September 8th, we threshed our grain and had over 1700 bushels in our granary as a result.\n\nThe long flower borders on either side of our drive have been thoroughly cultivated and we are in hopes that next year we shall have that more beautiful than ever before. Every plant was lifted out and the whole manured and plowed. After the girls under Mrs Rogers had replaced the plants we obtained several hundred fresh plants to fill in the many bare places.\n\n8th October 1925.\nOttawa, October 10, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your report on the activities and progress of the work at the Mohawk Institute for the quarter ending September 30 last. This report has been read with interest and we are pleased to note that the work generally progressed satisfactorily; that the pupils who remained at the school enjoyed their summer holidays. Also, that despite a backward spring and drought the crops yielded a good return. We note further that there has been an improvement in general discipline and that there is now a waiting list of pupils for entrance to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A. F. MacKenzie)\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. Rogers, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nBrantford,\nSeptember 30, 1925\n\nMr. S. Rogers\nMohawk Institute\nBrantford.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI hereby tender my resignation as Junior Governess in your school. Resignation to take effect October 30th, 1925.\n\nAllow me to extend to you my sincere thanks for the many kindnesses you have shown me during the time I have been in your employ.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nNeva Knowles\n12th October 1925.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to report that the Junior Governess has resigned her position here, and that we have been successful in securing the services of Miss McNicoll who is in possession of the necessary qualifications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nMOHAWK INSTITUTE\nBrantford, Ont.\n12th October 1925.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nMay I respectfully make the following proposal for the betterment of this Institution.\n\nFor some time I have been discussing the advisability of increasing my inside staff by one female officer. At the present time the members of our housekeeping department are called upon to take care of more work than can be effectively accomplished. Whilst the work is always done it is felt that the training of our girls is necessarily neglected along certain lines.\n\nI feel that as an Industrial School it should be our first object to teach our pupils the correct methods of labour and not merely regard each pupil as a unit of labour. With this in view it is easy to see that unless the housekeeping officers have sufficient time to teach the various domestic sciences we are falling short of that high standard of efficiency that is desirable.\n\nMany of our girls have to take positions as maids when they leave the School and whilst they have quite a good idea of cooking for large numbers they are absolutely incapable of cooking for a family. This is quite naturally the case since there is no opportunity given them under existing conditions, to acquire the necessary knowledge and experience. Then, again, they are not well instructed in the care and cleaning of furniture, carpets and floors, and whilst we are always particular as to cleanliness we are of the opinion that better results would be obtained could more time be given to instruction.\n\nIn view of the foregoing could I be authorised to engage another officer. I believe I could get the type of person I want for about $25.00 per month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nINSTITUTE\nOttawa, October 25, 1925.\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, reporting a change in the staff at the Mohawk Institute. I trust that Miss McNicoll, who replaces Mrs. Knowles, will have a career of much usefulness.\n\nI have also your letter of the same date, relative to the advisability of adding one female officer to the inside staff. The Department considers that seven lady workers is not too large a staff for an institution the size of the Mohawk. Before approval is granted for the additional worker, however, I should be pleased if you would intimate how the duties are divided between the housekeeper and assistant housekeeper and indicate what work would be undertaken by the extra officer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nS. Rogers, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nCHRISTMAS TREE.\n\nThe following evening, Christmas eve, the whole school and staff gathered in the dining hall where there was a light show that shone by hundreds of coloured lights on the giant Christmas tree. One member of the staff had an unfortunate thing that Principal S. Rogers was too busy to attend the party. The staff had made his visit and departed.\n\nSanta Claus, however, did arrive. Two red planks were placed across the floor and down these he slid with a sleigh and a bag full of presents. He said he had so many presents and such a large sack that he could not have put all the gifts on before and after dinner. He was very glad to make the presentation. Then a very funny game was played. A piece of board was hanging from the bottom of the tree and as a result the whole contents dropped out. From a gun the whole school pounced upon them. The board had been so strangely scattered. After dinner was served, each class came in and out of the one hundred and ninety-five rooms. Every one had a present, an orange. The remainder of the evening was spent in a period of fun and frolics off their previous work and playing.\n\nChristmas Day.\n\nOn Christmas Day the staff and pupils met in the school room for a special celebration. The children, Christmas Lunch, at 9 o'clock, and the remainder of the morning was spent in various activities. The pupils played games, sang songs, and danced. After lunch, the boys went out to play football while the girls remained inside. In the afternoon, the pupils attended to their chores in a more leisurely manner. And because of the Christmas spirit, they worked hard.\n\nNew Year's Day.\n\nNew Year's Day was the occasion for much fun and frolics. It was also the final day of the holiday. The pupils returned to school for the re-opening of school lessons, and a normal routine.\n\nDuring the whole of the holiday the girls have carried on with the usual routine. They have attended to their chores in a more leisurely manner. And because of the Christmas spirit, they worked hard.\n\nAs the boys were suffering from the cold, they volunteered to clear the snow away for the girls. The space was flooded and now they have a right fine place to play in. In the evening the pupils were allowed to dress up and the staff appeared in various costumes. There was a clown, a jester, and a... \"Arrive from 'arrivals'.\" Need...\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the activities and programs of the work of this Institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\n[Institution Name]\nBrantford, Ont.\n\n[Text continues below]\nDuring the two weeks preceding Christmas all the pupils were given an opportunity of visiting town and seeing the window displays and stores. Many of them were fortunate enough to see Santa Claus. The Trinity Dramatic Club very kindly came to the school on 17th December and played Pollyanna for the benefit of the pupils.\n\nTo describe our activities during the Christmas recess would fill a press volume. The little girls under Miss McKeown made three rag rugs whilst the senior girls made the officers a complete set of linen luncheon doylays, trimmed with crochet work. To match this there was also a side table and sideboard runner made in the same fashion.\n\nWe tried to interest the girls in knitting themselves scarfs and mittens as soon as the pupils were expected to do this in their own time we failed to get very much work done in this direction.\n\nNotes. Girl Guides were re-organized on October 1st, and went for a hike during which they gathered wild flowers and plumes for Harvest Home decorations.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Rogers went to Toronto to make wholesale purchases Oct. 7th.\n\nOn October 8th we had to commence heating the building and on the tenth we had to issue heavy underwear to the boys on account of the sudden cold weather.\n\nBy October 12th, all the girls' summer clothing had been replaced by heavier wear for winter, and all store windows were in position.\n\nOn October 13th Miss Chamberlin was assigned. She has a second class certificate and teaches the kindergarten children during work hours. Among other duties she has assumed are those of instructing junior pupils in making rag rugs, elementary sewing, supervision of cleaning and play director.\n\nMiss Knowles was taken ill on the 26th. October so we had Miss Chamberlin assist her in her duties until Miss McKeown arrived.\n\nThe Stamford Laundry issued a public invitation for inspection of its plant so Miss Allen who is responsible for the laundry work here and Miss Chamberlin took twenty-five of the senior girls who were welcomed by the President of the Company who kindly acted as guide throughout the whole of the plant. In addition to this highly instructive inspection the girls were presented with five dollars which they placed in the Radio Fund.\n\nWe have now a powerful receiving set with one loud speaker operated in one of the classrooms and we are now trying to sell our fund sufficiently to install a loud speaker in both classrooms. We find the talks to children broadcasted from the various stations are most attractive and the older children enjoy the good music. Of course, the jazz is always popular.\n\nOn November 7th, three girls who had absented themselves after the holidays without sending any word applied for re-admission. They and their parents were quite surprised and indignant when we could not accept them on account of the school being over-full. We are hoping that this action will ensure prompt return from holidays in future.\n\nIrene Isaac, a very naughty small girl, and Betsey Isaac, who is sub-normal, absconded on November 25th in their work dresses with no coats. After searching all morning for them I informed the Mounted Police and the girls were returned the next day. They were ordered that no one should shelter them and that they were reported to the police as Mohawk Institute pupils. This shows a very welcome change of attitude on the Reserve.\n\nWe were offered a piano very cheaply and as we were in need of another instrument we purchased same on November 27th. Our music classes are growing rapidly.\n\nOn the 12th December we fetched a wagon load of evergreens and bring the Saturday before Christmas most of the pupils were visited by friends or relatives and went to town with them.\n\nDuring the week preceding Christmas everyone was busy. Girls were decorating and boys killing pork and poultry and getting ready for Christmas inspection.\n\nWe were able to arrange for the inside staff to have five days either at Christmas or New Years.\n\nMr. Elmer Jamieson was given the classrooms for carrying out intelli-\ntests with the pupils on the 19th and 24th December.\n\nClothing. In addition to making the necessary seasonal changes in clothing, the girls were issued with new high shoes; they made twenty heavy coats and altered thirty-five heavy green coats in addition to re-making some old grey coats; an issue of new stockings was also made. The boys received new shoes, socks, heavy underwear, overall sweaters and were re-fitted with winter uniforms.\n\nHealth. Whilst the general health of the pupils has been very good we have suffered one or two severances and there has been an epidemic of accidents. Missie Snake had a very trying time with pneumonia and as she began to recover another little girl named Powless contracted the same complaint. There were also a few bad colds with indications of pleurisy but by careful attention there were no serious results. As far as the pupils are aware there were no serious results.\n\nIn the matter of accidents investigation showed that the cause was either purely accidental or else directly due to the carelessness of the victim. Myles Isaac left his shoe lace undone and this tripped him as he was entering the greenhouse with the result that he fell and broke his clavicle bone. George Oba came down on his shoes and clipped whilst carrying a plank. This broke his forearm. Another boy walked in front of some wood that was being pitch and was struck in the forehead causing a cut an inch and a half long which bared the bone. Another boy slipped whilst skating and cut his lip on a skate. All these cases were promptly attended to and no ill-effects seem yet be evident.\n\nFarm and Garden. Speaking generally this has been the most successful year in both these departments during the period I have had the honour to control them. Whilst there were drawbacks due to the early drought our ultimate crops compare most favourably with some of the best farms in this locality. Our barns were filled with live-stock and savings were thus made.\n\nOn October 13th, I inspected the farm and our fall crops were all ready to harvest. As the weather was mild I decided to discontinue classroom work until we had the work of harvesting well in hand. As a consequence we were able to commence operations all over the farm. The school teachers took the very small children out to pick beans, a large number of boys assisted in gathering apples in the orchard and as they picked a number of larger girls sorted and packed away the fruit in the cellar; other squads were busy pulling the manure and picking up potatoes. Every morning I called for more effort and I have never witnessed such enthusiasm as the pupils and staff displayed. In about a week we had the work well in hand and school was resumed. We had only a few hours' work before the harvest was in hand and when the weather broke we had very severe frosts which spelt ruin to so many farmers. We had to have all our cattle in winter quarters by October 26th. After the frost we dug the potatoes that were left and picked what few apples there were unpicked and found them quite good if used immediately. In this way we did not lose anything.\n\nOur obysenthamums this year were exceptionally good and were in great demand. Out of the thousands of blooms I do not think we had a dozen in the school as buyers were here daily taking everything they could buy. In this connection great credit is due to our gardener Mr Henderson. We are also indebted to Major General H.C. Ashton G.M.C. for the many choice species he has secured for us from the Experimental Farm.\n\nWe had several cows tested for tuberculosis and have had to dispose of several that reacted badly.\n\nOwing to our boar failing to breed we had to purchase a new one which was obtained from the Ontario Hospital, Hamilton.\n\nBy arrangement with the Canadian Poultry Company our older boys are visiting that plant chiefly to learn the hog industry. They are allowed to accompany the Government Grader who explains to them all the various features that control his grading. This work is most interesting and the boys are quite enthusiastic. On December 30th, one of our boys was within ten pounds of the correct weight of any pig he saw when estimating prices.\n\nOwing to a very uncertain market in feeds I was advised to buy a carload in October during a dreary spell in the markets.\nI acted upon this advice and by the time the car was delivered the price locally was $5 per ton higher than that which I had paid. We are steadily building a reputation as breeders of the bacon type hog and as our name improves so we find the demand for our stock increasing. I am indebted to Messrs J. B. Brethour and Nephews for much assistance in this direction, and to Mr. R. A. Thompson, miller for information regarding the Feed Markets.\n\n5th January 1926.\nOttawa, January 8, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your report on the activities and progress at the Mohawk Institute for the quarter ended the 31st ultimo. This report has been read with interest and I am pleased to note that general conditions are satisfactory and that truancy is decreasing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nS. Rogers, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\n30th January 1926.\n\nThe Superintendent,\nIndian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIt is with great regret that I have to report a very serious breach of discipline on the part of a number of the senior boys and girls of this school. For a period of two or three weeks a number of boys and girls found means of meeting in different parts of this Institute and in fact a party of boys on several occasions made a trip to the Girls dormitory. This was discovered by myself when investigating a report by a junior officer who had occasion to correct the girls for noisy conduct in the dormitory about 5 a.m. on January 9th, 1926.\n\nI made a very extensive enquiry and caused every pupil implicated to write me a full confession of the whole proceedings and it would appear that serious as I at first thought the matter to be, it was more in the nature of a series of wild escapades. During the period that has elapsed since this occurrence I have had every officer co-operate in obtaining information concerning this affair and today I find them of the opinion that the affair was in the nature of a \"lark\".\n\nNeedless to say great care has since been exercised to prevent any possible recurrence and an system of alarms has been worked out to warn of any movement during the night. The culprits have been punished by having leave cancelled and they have also an hour extra work daily.\n\nShould any information reach me that would alter opinion of this affair I will immediately report to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa, February 4, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, reporting a serious breach of discipline at the Mohawk Institute. The Department has read your letter with much regret and I have to instruct you to take steps to see that there is no opportunity for a repetition of the offense.\n\nIt is not clear to me how this breach of discipline was possible. Are not the dormitories locked at night?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nR. Rogers, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nOttawa, February 11, 1926.\n\nThis is to certify that this Department, during the year ended December 31, 1925, has received from the New England Company the sums of \u00a31,000 and \u00a31,200 for maintenance of the Mohawk and Lytton Indian Residential Schools, respectively.\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, February 21, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Bush:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd ultimo and in reply am pleased to enclose certificates that this Department, during the year ended December 31st, last, has received from the New England Company the sum of \u00a31,000 and \u00a31,800, for maintenance of the Mohawk and Lytton Indian Residential Schools, respectively; and that the sum of \u00a3400, payable to the Company as rent for the Lytton institution, has been expended according to the terms of the lease.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nP.

C. H. Owen. A number of junior pupils have had extra Bible instruction under the junior school teacher during service hour as they would cause the senior school-room to be overcrowded. During February Mr. Owen commenced a Confirmation class. Holy Communion was celebrated each month.\n\nStaff. There have been no changes in the staff during the quarter.\n\nParents. Whenever possible the girls the girls have had two walks on fine days. Sleighbidding and skating were enjoyed by both boys and girls. During stormy days the children were able to listen to all kinds of radio programmes. We have found the boys very active in entertaining the girls in former times it was necessary to keep them out of mischief. We have now a lot more space in our school-room.\n\nNew Year's Day was celebrated in the usual way. All the girls went sleigh-riding and after a supper very well decorated, we met in the Dining Hall for games and frolics.\n\nJanuary. Mr. Elmer Jamieson tested those pupils in the Training Room. Fire Drill and all equipment tested.\n\nFebruary. A breakage occurred in the steam pipe in the Girl's Dormitory. This was quickly repaired with material we had on hand.\n\nJanuary. This was a very fine day and we had a great number of visitors.\n\nJanuary 27th. As we were unable to purchase chestnut coal we were in great difficulty with the cooking arrangements. The local dealers were asking $14 per ton for coke and consequently were being put to considerable expense. After careful consideration we decided that the installation of the electric stove would help us considerably. Our electrician gave us very reasonable terms and the range was installed on this date. Since its installation we have been giving senior girls who will be entering Year training in its operation and so it serves a double purpose.\n\nMr. Jamieson has spent most week ends with us conducting his intelligence tests and we have been most interested in the results. In the case of one girl who has always been very troublesome, it was discovered that although only eleven and in the senior class she really has the mentality of a child of five. It is Mr. Jamieson's intention to put her through further tests.\n\nRev. Mr. MacKenzie who several years ago was closely in touch with the school paid us a visit and greatly admired the additions and alterations in the buildings.\n\nDuring the quarter the largest department store in Brantford closed and we were able to buy quantities of equipment at very reduced prices. Mr. Ford and Co., who have been our grocers for so many years also closed down and after their sale we bought quantities of their \"dead\" stock at ridiculously low figures.\n\nMarch Mr. Standing inspected.\n\nIn March we worked on picture frames. Some of the boys...\nOttawa, April 9, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge the report on the Mohawk Institute for the quarter ended March 31st. The report on the whole is satisfactory and indicates that good work is being done. I regret to draw to your attention official letter of October 16th, informing you that favourable consideration could not be given to the installing of an electric stove in the officers' kitchenette. I note from the report that, in January, this equipment was purchased. Do you consider that the school is in a financial position to warrant expenditure which the Department cannot authorize?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell F. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nS. Norris, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\n3rd May 1926.\n\nThe Superintendent,\nIndian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nCould the following girls who have Settlement Funds with the Department for safe keeping be allowed 25 each? They are taking music lessons and as they are extras they need a little funds to make their payments. This money would be placed to their credit in the pupils accounts here and would be spent under the supervision of Mrs Rogers.\n\nJohn Antons has also a sum of money standing to his credit. He is seventeen years of age and his Grandmother is trying very hard to secure his release but he is very simple minded and I feel sure that the only reason any interest is taken in him by his relatives is that they hope to secure his money. I have refused to allow him home for two years and I am trying to keep him interested in the farm here. If he could be allowed 25 as spending money I am sure he would be much more contented.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nINSTITUTE\nBaintford, Ont.\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, May 8, 1926.\n\nWith Cheques,\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 3rd instant, asking that $25.00 be given to each of the Maracle children and Eva J. Lickers to enable them to take music lessons, I beg to enclose cheques Nos. 1374 and 1375 for $50.00 and $25.00 respectively.\n\nThe cheques are made payable to you and the Department will expect you to forward receipted vouchers showing how the money is expended on behalf of these children.\n\nYour request for money on behalf of John Antone cannot be made as the records here do not show that any money is held in his name. It may be that he is known by some other name at the Department, and, if you will give further information so that it could be traced up the Department will be pleased to consider your request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. Rogers, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the activities and progress of this Institute.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChurch. The weekly services have been held under the charge of Rev. G. H. Owen. Good Friday morning service was led by the Principal and the girls went to partake of the three hour services in town. For Easter we had special decorations and on April 11th we had Easter Communion. We could not attend the Church until May 9th. Three pupils were baptised and the Bishop confirmed twenty-two pupils on June 12th. We were able to complete a flag-stone path into the Church before the Bishop's visit. The Board of Works of the City of Brentford kindly gave us some flag-stones and the farm staff and boys laid the walk in about six days. We have also built a stone barrier at the foot of the Church hill to prevent thoughtless motorists from damaging the turf. On June 6th, Rev. O. Rodinon came to pray with the children.\n\nStaff. On April 1st, engaged Mr. Foster as teacher but as he was not satisfactory he was allowed to leave at the end of one month. We were fortunate enough to get the services of Mr. Thurlow for the spring work. During the quarter Mr. and Mrs. Rogers, Mrs. Persall, Miss Chambers and Miss Allan had each eight days' holiday. Mr. Persall was quite off for two weeks with lumbago and Miss Wilson had to lay up with an injured leg for three weeks. Mr. Thurlow was given an opportunity to resign as he was not proving satisfactory.\n\nMrs. Persall has on the doctor's advice resigned but we are not anxious to lose her and have only made temporary arrangements in the hope that she will recover and return to us. We were able to get Miss Mason, daughter of Rev. R. Mason to take her place.\n\nI have Miss Chambers resignation as she has secured a position near her home.\n\nHealth. During the quarter the general health of the pupils has been excellent, apart from a slight epidemic of croup. Several pupils have been to visit the dentist and optician. On June 11th Dr. Selby visited the school and examined a number of girls who were giving us a little concern and he pronounced Gladys Watts as tubercular.\n\nDiscipline. There has been a marked improvement in the conduct of the children and a very pleasing spirit is evident.\n\nNursery. Elmar Jamieson held tests on April 8th and 9th.\n\nDuring the quarter we have painted the beds and the woodwork in the dormitories. Early in May we were able to have a spring clean-up outside the building and it is generally remarked that the grounds have never looked so trim.\nOn May 6th, this district was visited by sneak thieves and we lost five tires from the school truck during the night.\n\nThey've been fitted out with new overalls, shirts, shoes and at times and the girls have new summer dresses, underwear, stockings and kitchen aprons.\n\nMay 16th. Zion Church girls called at school whist hiking.\n\nMay 17th. The Bishop of Huron and friends were entertained after Service of Confirmation. Mr. Johnson the famous New York tenor was in town on that day and called to see the Church during the service. It was delightful to see him enter in the singing with the pupils and he was very complimentary in his remarks afterwards.\n\nMay 18th. Mr. and Mrs Rogers visited wholesale houses in Toronto in search of clothing for boys next winter.\n\nFrom May 18th to 20th we had two delegates of the Women's Auxiliary billeted with us. The Bishop asked if the Queen Anne Silver could be loaned as they had to add to the Communion Plate at Grace Church for the Delegates service. As the delegates do so much work for Indian Missions I thought it was very fitting that they should on this occasion have the use of the service so I made the necessary arrangements for its safe keeping much to every person's delight. During the time the delegates were in town we were constantly visited.\n\nJune 10th. Mr. and Mrs. Hundfland, German journalists, visited the school to collect data for a book they are writing.\n\nJune 14th. We fetched Rev. and Mrs. Lee who spent a few days with us.\n\nJune 21st. Large hot water boiler sprung a leak and we had to have it replaced.\n\nJune 22nd. Irene and Betsy Isaac again absconded but we had them back in a few hours. Neither of these girls are normal and they give us quite a lot of trouble.\n\nJune 25th. Mr. and Mrs. Peters from No. 6 School on the Reserve spent week end here.\n\nThree girls and three boys wrote their entrance examination. Two girls dropped out of class, one was sick and the other did not wish to continue.\n\nJune 29th. Visited Mills in Paris and purchased blankets and stockings.\n\nAmusements. Easter Monday the girls went to the stores and to a show whilst the boys had a good day fishing.\n\nOur pupils attended Miss Frances Nickawa's recital at a city church.\n\nMay 24th. Girls went to Mohawk Park and the following day the Remembrance Chapter presented a prize for general efficiency to Norman Lickers. The pupils held a short patriotic concert and the Chapter made a presentation of library books.\n\nJune 8th. We had a general holiday and Mr. Rogers took four senior boys to the Agricultural College.\n\nJune 22nd. Miss Hardie took a party of girls to help at a concert at a Reserve Church.\n\nJune 29th. Circus Day and all those who had the money were taken in the afternoon.\n\nFarm and Garden Work generally was slow this spring and our garden suffered considerably from cutworms. However, crops are very promising and I hope we have very full barns this fall. Boys have been attending the pork factory to receive instruction in hog farming.\n\nWe have installed a new lawn water service and laid the water into the new pig pen. All the trees on the property have been trimmed and the hedges have been pruned to control the borders. We have planted all the farm buildings and they present a very smart appearance. We have laid a new cement driveway in one of the farms to replace one of the paths. The wells have been cleaned.\n\nThe fences are in good order and one other after staining. Our vegetable garden looks very nice and we are planning a very bountiful harvest.\n\n3rd July 1926.\nOttawa, July 7, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your report on the activities and progress at the Mohawk Institute for the quarter ended June 30th, last. I am pleased to note that general conditions at the school are satisfactory, especially as regards health, discipline and farm and garden work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Rogers\n\nChurch. Services were held at the Church on July 4th and 11th. The Church was closed for six weeks during the holiday period. During holidays and short service was held each Sunday morning at 9:15 and pupils were allowed to attend the Churches in town for morning and evening services. The girls went in charge of an officer and the boys were allowed to go unattended.\n\nThe Church was re-opened on August 26th under Rev. C.H.Owen. Holy Communion was celebrated September 26th.\n\nStaff. Mr. Thurlow resigned and his services terminated July 15th. Mrs. Smith was engaged to fill the vacancy and was on duty July 12th. On July 31st Miss Chambers, Domestic Science teacher, left to take a position she had secured near her home which was much better paid. Miss Mason, a temporary officer left on the same date and Mrs. Forsell who had had a month's leave of absence, returned to duty.\n\nMr. Hughes, a farm instructor, went to Hospital on August 31st and was away three weeks.\n\nMiss Wilson resigned on September 1st. She was a very efficient officer but since an automobile accident a year ago her nerves had gradually become worse until they rendered her undesirable. We replaced her with Miss Bates but she showed no signs of becoming a good officer and so was allowed to leave at the end of one week.\n\nOn September 5th Mr. and Mrs. Rogers left for a short motor trip which included Ottawa in its itinerary. They returned to duty September 13th.\n\nSeptember 15th, Mr. Howarth took material for boys suits to Greene Swifts of London.\n\nDiscipline. On the whole this has been good especially amongst the boys but we have had several unpleasant cases of theft and petty stealing amongst the girls.\n\nNotes. On July 1st the girls went to the River to bathe and to Mohawk Park while most of the boys found work at neighbours.\n\nGladys Staats went to the Sanitarium, Hamilton with Mr. and Mrs. Rogers. On July 8th all boys were kept from School. Owing to the cool wet weather, weeds were making much more rapid growth than our corn and roots and it was considered advisable to devote a day or two's work to saving the crop. By comparing our corn crop with our neighbours it is easy to see that we were wise in doing this. At the same time the girls tidied the playgrounds under the supervision of the school teachers and some silver spoons and fountain pens that had been stolen were found cached.\n\nThe Shrine Club entertained our pupils at a Circus on July 10th. On July 14th we ventured a Garden Party and Closing Concert. The grounds were beautiful. This being the result of the work Miss Rogers and the girls in the flower beds. The weather was ideal and we had a\nThe Tennis lawn was gaily lighted and there were booths for the sale of ice cream sodas, drinks and specimens of the children's handiwork. We used the front veranda as a stage for the concert and seats were placed on the lawn. The school electrician very kindly loaned us string lights and the building was very attractively decorated. We had the early evening parade of visitors who proceeded through the school buildings by officers. During the Concert prizes were given to the pupils who had made most consistent progress during the year and we were able to announce the results of the Entrance Examinations. We had three girls and three boys write this examination and all passed, one boy with honours.\n\nJuly 26th. The school closed for holidays but we had 42 girls and 28 boys remain. Several were able to leave later when their relatives assured sufficient money to outfit them.\n\nMiss Hardie and Miss McKeown also left for their holidays. During the vacation the girls were required to work each morning and the afternoons were devoted to amusements such as bathing, visiting parks, taking round trips on the street cars and going to shows. We spent the sum of $25 upon these outings.\n\nWith the boys it was necessary to hire a number of the older in order to keep the farm work in hand. These boys, however, were allowed to attend the moving pictures and sports meetings at night with an officer.\n\nOn July 28th. James Macdonald was suddenly taken very ill and on the following day was taken to hospital and Morrison rushed him to hospital after consultation and operated for appendicitis. He did very well and returned home at the end of two weeks.\n\nOn August 9th. Rev. H. Lee who used to be a missionary on the Reserve spent a few days with us and on the 12th. we motored him to Dr. Davis at Brantford where he was treated for his complaint.\n\nThe Manager of the local theatre entertained our children on 16th.\n\nOn August 22nd. the water front in the kitchen stove burst and we found water all over the basement floor.\n\nFriday August 27th. the last day of the holidays we had a big night ice cream and games on the lawn. During the holidays we varied the diet as much as possible and served ice cream several times for supper.\n\nAugust 28th. the pupils returned from holidays; they were prompt and in good spirits. Some new pupils arrived two and three weeks ahead of time. Some children were even left without papers and had to be sent home.\n\nMonday August 30th. all departments of school work were re-opened in proper order.\n\nAugust 31st. Mr. Rogers took 12 boys by truck to Toronto Exhibition. These boys had done particularly well during the holidays and spent a very happy and instructive day, witnessing the Grand Stand Performance at its close.\n\n1st. September a car of coal was unloaded on this day and two others were delivered during the month.\n\nLabour Day on September 5th. was a school holiday.\n\nSeptember 9th. Mr. Williams of the Department and Colonel Morgan visited the school.\n\nSeptember 25th. Major Rogers and Mr. Smith attended Great War Veterans' Dedication at Brantford and were able to take a delightful spray-bouquet of flowers from the school Farm and Garden. This section of the country has been very ill-favoured by the weather this year. Hundreds of farmers have scarcely saved any hay or grain but we have been particularly fortunate. There remain about five acres of hay uncut and we have garnered all the grain except about 100 bushels of rye which is sprouting badly. Our wheat yielded forty bushels to the acre and our other crops were correspondingly good. It was necessary to hire extra help as we had one man in hospital and whenever it was possible to draw in the grain we made a point of crowding as much work as possible into a day to avoid the grain being left out for more rain.\n\nOn rainy days we have worked around the barns and greenhouses and have accomplished a great deal of repair and constructive work. We have replaced one rotten wood barn floor with another of cement. Torn out\nbenches in greenhouses that were on the verge of collapse and replaced them with cement of a permanent nature. We have built cement cold frames and have generally improved our buildings. There is much favorable comment locally over the improved appearances of our buildings in their new coat of paint.\n\nA store house on the farm has been moved about four feet from its old location where it obstructed the light entering several windows of the new pig pen.\n\nWe have over-hauled our tractor and owing to collapse of our old cutting box we had to purchase a new one for silo filling.\n\nAll glass in buildings and greenhouses has been re-set.\n\nHoliday Improvements\u2014All plaster throughout the building has been patched and the school-rooms and sewing room re-painted.\n\nA room in the basement that had previously been used as a refrigerator and store-room was refitted as a clothing room to accommodate forty senior girls. The old clothing room was refitted to accommodate the smaller girls. Boot-racks were placed in all clothing rooms and an addition made to that of the boys. The girls' lavatory and dressing-room was whitewashed and repainted. Most of this work was done by the girls; men, of course attending to the ceiling and other high work.\n\nThe stairs and main hall were re-varnished.\n\nThe lockers in the girls' playroom were repaired.\n\nThe large refrigerator was rebuilt in the Dining Hall in a convenient corner.\n\n2nd October 1926.\nOttawa, October 6th, 1926.\n\nSir!\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your report for the quarter ended September 30th, last, on the activities and progress at the Mohawk Institute.\n\nThis report has been read with interest, and I am pleased to note that conditions at the school generally are satisfactory. I have also noted the number of improvements that have been made by the pupils and staff during the holidays, and that excellent crops were obtained from the farm and garden.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mr. H. Owen has been in charge of the weekly service. On October 11th we celebrated our Harvest Festival and the Church was very prettily decorated by the senior girls for this event. The pupils attended a Social Children's Service at Trinity Church on October 17th. Holy Communion was administered on the last Sunday in each month. It was arranged to hold Thanksgiving Services in the Church but we have not held them there since. The Christmas Services were very prettily arranged but on Christmas morning we had a special Carol Service.\n\nHealth. On the whole this has been particularly good with but two exceptions. Miss Skye has sent several weeks in bed. She has been ill for about two years and but the doctor cannot find out his own ailment although he has had repeated examinations. She developed dysentery. This has been good but we found it necessary to discipline Miss Skye and Miss Martin as they were guilty of several serious breaches of discipline although they were senior girls they were actually younger girls to stand and behave disobediently.\n\nNotes. Miss Macdonald's grandmother died and she came home for a short time.\n\nThe children of the wards present pictures of normal life. They make many excursions of various kinds in their daily life.\n\nPatriotic songs.\n\nOctober 11th. Harvest Festival services were held. We had a special prayer and sang a \"Thanksgiving\" song.\n\nGeneral Assembly visited the school for a day in order to inspect the general work.\n\nOctober 25th. Miss Macdonald visited.\n\nThe boys and girls were given a lesson on the Royal Navy.\n\nNovember 2nd. Mr. James visited and made a special inspection of the children.\n\nThe Teachers' Convention was on November 4th and 5th. On these two days the boys cleaned up the farm buildings and the girls worked on the lawns and in the flower beds.\n\nNovember 5th. Miss O'Leary and Mr. Owen visited.\n\nNovember 9th.

It is controlled and managed solely by the Department. You need have no hesitation in underwriting this risk.\n\nThe address of the New England Company is as follows:\n\nNew England Company,\n26 Bloomsbury Square,\nLondon W.

Ltd.,\nMetropolitan Bldg.,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nQuarter ending 31st March 1927.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report of the activities and progress of this Institute.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChurch, citing the fact that Mrs. Green, wife of our school doctor, has been ill for several days, I am obliged to contrast the services of our former doctor, Mr. Smith, who was very efficient in his duties.\n\nHealth conditions have been most satisfactory. In examining several cases of sore throat which occurred in December, there have been no serious cases except a few sore throats and colds. The only exception was that of Miss King who stayed in bed for a period without the doctor discovering any cause. The boy Mr. Holman also had a slight cold.\n\nDiscipline has been excellent throughout the term. However, the boys have been very restless during the Christmas recess, which reflects badly upon their spirits. No new discipline has been introduced since the position of boys' master on January 1st.\n\nMr. Thurlow replaced Mr. Smith on January 1st. Mr. Thurlow has been very successful in his dealings with the boys and has managed to maintain discipline. However, I am unable to secure a very good record from him. He has been very attentive to the boys' needs and has been very successful in keeping them busy.\n\nWith the mild weather this spring three girls absconded but were promptly returned by their parents. We are glad to re-assign one girl as she had a very bad record and we found that she was a ringleader in many of our troubles.\n\nStaff: Mr. Thurlow replaced Mr. Smith on January 1st. Mr. Thurlow has been very successful in his dealings with the boys and has managed to maintain discipline. However, I am unable to secure a very good record from him. He has been very attentive to the boys' needs and has been very successful in keeping them busy.\n\nWith the mild weather this spring three girls absconded but were promptly returned by their parents. We are glad to re-assign one girl as she had a very bad record and we found that she was a ringleader in many of our troubles.\n\nSchool re-opened January 3rd.\n\nJanuary 12th: Mr. Rogers, Mrs. Smith and several girl chums visited Gladys State at the invitation of Miss Smith.\n\nJanuary 25th: Mr. Rogers, Mrs. Smith and three girls attended funeral of Gladys State. The school wreath was the only floral token.\n\nJanuary 29th: Miss Smith took a large party of girls to the local cinema.\n\nFebruary 10th: Miss Smith, Mrs. Smith and several girl chums visited Gladys State at the invitation of Miss Smith.\n\nMarch 6th: Mr. Standing inspected the class-rooms.\n\nMarch 18th: The kitchen stove collapsed but the officers remain...\nfor that department rose to the emergency and kept the meals on time in a most satisfactory manner.\n\nFarm. All departments of the farm and garden have shown progress although business conditions have been adverse. Owing to the hog market falling we have not had as large returns from that department as we expected, and the fact that the local fruiters are importing rhubarb from California has reduced our income from its production here. Despite these conditions we have increased our supplies and have been able to keep the school very liberally supplied with apples and all kinds of vegetables.\n\nDuring January all the farm implements were overhauled. In February we harvested our ice and the farm men were used to carry out some of the improvements inside the building. We had a very high flood early in March and as the ground became fit to work upon we commenced grading and levelling the playgrounds.\n\nImprovements. As the floors in three small rooms were in very bad repair we took advantage of a price war in Brantford and secured some flooring and other lumber. For about $17.00 we were able to place hardwood floors in these rooms. The floors were laid by Mr. Rogers. In several parts of the building we made permanent broom cupboards. All the paint work was thoroughly done over and any retouching necessary was done. We placed a marble slab in position in the kitchenette for pastry making.\n\nThe laundry machinery was giving trouble so we overhauled it and made several replacements.\n\nWe have also sheeted over the boys play-room ceiling.\n\nThe small girls have been busy making rag-rugs for bed-rooms and we were able to sell one or two for the benefit of the radio fund.\n\n9th April 1927.\nOttawa, April 13th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge, with thanks, the receipt of your report on the activities at the Mohawk Institute for the quarter ended March 31st, last. I have noted, with interest, that the general conditions were satisfactory during the quarter covered by the report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. Rogers, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nQuarter ending 30th June 1927.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the activities of this Institute.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. Rogers\n\nChurch. Owing to the fact that Mrs Owen, wife of our Chaplain was seriously ill at the beginning of the quarter the services were conducted by the Principal. On April 16th, following Mrs Owen's death the services were conducted by Rev. Adamson of Paris. On Good Friday many of the older pupils attended the three hour service at St. Jude's Easter Sunday with Rev. Owen in charge Holy Communion was celebrated. The altar was decorated with flowers by our senior girls.\n\nThe first service to be held this year in the Mohawk Church was on May 22nd. On this occasion the Thayendanegea Chapter I.O.D.E. placed a wreath on the tomb of Joseph Brant.\n\nThe remaining services were conducted by Rev. C. H. P. Owen.\n\nHealth. We have had very few cases of sickness. In April there was a slight epidemic of Chicken-pox but this was confined to the girls.\n\nDiscipline. On the whole this has been very good but early in the term we had a few cases of truancy as is usual at that time of the year. Two of the pupils who tried their Entrance Examinations have been troublesome during their term at the School so their parents were told that they would have to assume responsibility for them should they be successful.\n\nNotes. April 6th. Mr. and Mrs Eccleston, Miss Hardie and Mr. Rogers to Mrs Owen's funeral.\n\nMrs Persall returned to duty after an absence of seven weeks during which time she underwent two serious operations.\n\nThe Salvation Army Band visited the school and rendered a delightful concert after which the senior boys entertained them to light refreshments.\n\nApril 10th. Sir Alfred Stewpot, Dominion Meteorologist visited the School and found much of interest.\n\nApril 18th. The weather was very mild and being Easter Monday was spent in fishing and outdoor sports.\n\nMiss Allen and Miss Hooper both had a week's vacation in April.\n\nMay 4th. In response to an urgent telegram two boys Montour were allowed to visit their dying father they returned after the funeral and have since tried their Entrance Examination.\n\nMay 10th. Miss Hardie fell and badly sprained her ankle. She was very lame for some weeks.\n\nAbout this time we were able to successfully bid on the uniforms of the Cadet Corps of the Brantford Collegiate and were thus enabled for a very small sum to purchase next winter's clothing for our boys.\n\nMay 16th. We had a very serious stoppage of the sewers. After some trouble we discovered some small girls had dropped a book into a toilet.\n\nThe pictures of the Confederation period were very much appreciated by the Staff and pupils. They have been put away and are to be framed by the boys next winter.\n\nMay 25th. The Remembrance Chapter I.O.D.E. paid their yearly visit and presented prizes.\nJune 14th. Mr Phelan of Schools Branch arrived to audit accounts.\nJune 15th. Mr. Orr visited to inspect the barn in bad condition.\n14 girls and two boys wrote their Entrance Examination.\nOn June 29th we held our Closing Exercises and the prizes were distributed. Each pupil received a Confederation Medal on this occasion.\nJune 30th. School closed leaving 36 girls and 31 boys.\n\nImprovements. As soon as possible the teams were put to work ploughing and regrading both playgrounds. This work was necessary to clear the playgrounds quickly of water after rains and they both present a much more attractive appearance as a result.\nThe boys' playroom ceiling was sheeted after the old damaged plaster had been removed.\nAll the plaster throughout the building was repaired and a new ceiling put up in the officers bath-room. Three small rooms were redecorated.\nThe drying tumbler was installed in the laundry.\nBuilt-in sundry cupboards and linen closets.\nThe bridge across the Canal became unsafe and had to be almost rebuilt.\nCement steps and approach were laid to cottages near the Church.\nThe Gardener's Cottage was painted and the verandahs of the school were repainted.\n\nFarm and Garden. Work started on the land fairly early but owing to rains and cold weather the seeding season was unduly long. However, this weather made for very fine hay and wheat crops and these crops are still most promising. Work was kept well in hand in the garden and we shall be amongst the first to place our produce on the market. The plants which were wintered in the new frames were in excellent condition and the potatoes pitted last fall will carry us well through the summer. Hay stored four years ago was baled in order to make a thorough inspection of the cow barn which was found to be in a very unsafe condition.\n\nGrounds. As these are cared for by Mrs Rogers and the girls I feel they should be dealt with under a separate heading. Our grounds are a continual source of comment and congratulations as they have been a blaze of colour since the earliest blooms. The hard work of the last three years is showing to perfection this year.\n\n8th July 1927.\nOttawa, July 13th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge, with thanks, receipt of your report for the quarter ending June 30th, last, on the general activities at the Mohawk Institute. This report has been read with interest, and we have noted the improvements that were carried out and the farming and gardening operations which are being conducted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell F. Terrick,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nB. Rogers, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe regret that as the New England Company's funds was not received until June 30th, we could not close down the quarterly accounts and have them audited before Major Rogers left with the 5th Battery for Ottawa Camps. He will return August 10th and the school will reopen August 13th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAugust 24th, 1927\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the activities of this Institute.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChurch. During the holidays, short marriages held each Sunday morning and evening and parties of pupils were allowed to attend city churches. We resumed services at the Church on August 21st. Several visiting clergymen officiated during Mr. Owen's vacation. He administered Holy Communion on September 4th.\n\nVacation. The pupils returned promptly and the whole school settled down to school work very well. Those who remained during the holidays behaved in a most satisfactory manner.\n\nHealth. Several girls who had been causing anxiety were examined at the local Tubercular Clinic. Pauline Simms was advised treatment in a Sanitarium. Dorothy Turbine returned to the but nothing more serious. Several children who had to attend the dentist or dentist, he had an epidemic of summer fevers but the most severe cases were only sick two or three days.\n\nClothing. The boys were issued with new overalls and scout hats whilst the girls received new shoes and morns.\n\nPatriotic. July 3rd. Some pupils who remained for the holiday attended a Big Civic and Military Parade in the morning and went to the Tattoo and Firework Display in the evening. We heard the Dedication of the Carillon over the Radio perfectly.\n\nJuly 4th. The pupils attended the local Industrial Exhibition.\n\nJuly 6th. We chartered a street car and the pupils toured Brantford.\n\nJuly 7th. The pupils were given a special outing to O'Leary's.\n\nJuly 16th. A group of mothers chartered a motor bus to O'Leary for week-end.\n\nJuly 25th. The police advised us that they had found an Indian girl wandering on a highway near here. The Principal went to investigate and took the girl out of custody as she was discovered to be a pupil of our school. She was delivered to the care of the local welfare to take her home and then back to school. Our co-unionist with Count Plain will meet the child on the road.\n\nDuring the holidays, a treat was provided for mining pupils in the form of ice cream sundae visits to parks, motor rides and local places.\n\nAugust 10th. We visited school with regard to new boys.\n\nAugust 18th. The opening of the new Bridge was very clear.\n\nAugust 26th. The management of the Temple Theatre arranged for a programme free for the pupils.\n\nAugust 10th. Chartered street car for children to the rounds of city.\nAugust 13th. School re-opened with a very large percentage present in very good spirits. Miss Hardie and Miss McMillan were on duty.\n\nAugust 13th. Colonel G. K. Morrison called for Queen Anne Bible.\n\nAugust 16th. A number of senior boys who had worked very hard during holidays were motored to Port Dover for a days outing.\n\nAugust 18th.

Mr. Hurley went on holidays; Miss Allen commenced her vacation on the same day.\n\nSeptember 15th. Left for short vacation, taking a trip to Virginia accompanied by Miss Ashton from ...Judd.\n\nFarm and Garden. We have had a very busy season on the farm. The abundant hay crop required a tremendous amount of labour on account of the rain spell that occurred just when it was ready to harvest. The grain crops were successfully harvested during the drought which followed the heavy rains but the ground was left extremely hard for ploughing. In fact the ground was too hard for a boy to plough.\n\nIn addition to the routine farm work we have had to devote a large part of our staff and labours to moving barns and preparing land before erecting the new Dairy Barn. This work has progressed most satisfactorily and soon the Oshawa Institute will be the proud possessor of the finest barn of its type in the country.\n\nThe potatoes, roots and late crops suffered badly from the late drought but fortunately we withheld from selling a large part of the early potatoes when the price fell. This will help us greatly with our fall short.\n\nThe garden work has been successful and well done. One bench in the greenhouse rotted out and is being replaced.\n\n15th October 1927.\nOttawa, October 20, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge, with thanks, receipt of your report on the general activities at the Mohawk Institute for the quarter ending September 30th, last. It is noted that the work has progressed satisfactorily since the school re-opened after the summer holidays. The work performed on the farm and garden has also been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nS. Rogers, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nQuarter ended 31st December 1927.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the activities of this Institute.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChurch. The services have been conducted by Rev. C. H. P. Owen and Holy Communion was celebrated monthly. We held our Harvest Thanksgiving service on October 23rd, for which service the girls had very artistically decorated the church interior. We kept the decorations for Thanksgiving Day since when we have held the Services at the School. Christmas Day was the occasion of a very pretty Carol Service.\n\nDiscipline. There have been no serious breaches of discipline during the quarter.\n\nHealth. With the exception of Eva Lickers, who is in hospital suffering from diabetes, we have had no sickness at all. We feel quite proud of this fact since the town of Brantford has suffered from epidemics of scarlet fever, diphtheria and smallpox.\n\nStaff. There have been no changes in the staff. We were able to grant all the inside staff four days holidays either at Christmas or New Year.\n\nClothing. Winter clothing has been issued and the boys provided with rubber boots and the girls had an issue of new high shoes.\n\nNotes. On October 6th, Mr. MacKenzie and Colonel Morien paid us a short visit, and Mr. Orr was here on the 14th.\n\nOn October 16th, Lord and Lady Killineon opened the new Hospital at Chawaken. We took a representative party of our Girl Guides and the boys who were inspected by their Excellencies. When the principal and Mrs. Rogers were presented His Excellency decided to visit the Old Mohawk Church. Arrangements were quickly made and when the party arrived a number of our girls were on guard as a guard of honour. Our Girl Guides were delighted to present to Lord Killineon a gift from their Canadian Chief.\n\nMrs. Harry Scott visited the school on November 8th. In company with Mr. and Mrs. ... on December 1st, Mr. and Mrs. Rogers visited Toronto College.\n\nDecember 1st. Mr. and Mrs. Rogers visited Toronto College.\n\nNovember 11th. We had our annual Sports Day on October 11th. It was a very full day and the children had a great deal of fun.\n\nOn November 7th, the children held a barn dance in the New Barn. The Radio was moved into the barn and five loud speakers were attached. As reception was particularly good the children were well provided with music.\nOur electrician kindly loaned us two or three hundred feet of wire with coloured globes attached and the barn was a very gay affair. A large number of neighbours came in and all helped to make the evening a riot of pleasure for the children.\n\nThanksgiving Day was bright and cold and nineteen of the boys were granted leave for the day. Most of them visited the scene of the local militia manoeuvres. The fact that the Principal was commanding the local artillery Brigade added quite a deal to their interest.\n\nOn December 23rd, the Trinity Church Choir presented a delightful concert after which the Principal attired as Santa Claus officiated at the Christmas Tree. Owing to the fact that kind friends had sent sufficient gifts all the smaller and poorer children awoke on Christmas morning to find that Santa Claus had visited their homes. The Grand Theatre very kindly entertained the whole school on the 24th, to a showing of \"Pinocchio.\"\n\nOn December 25th, the Dining Room was very handsomely decorated and the dinner was quite a function for the staff had arranged the table with new runners, coloured candy baskets, fruit and so on.\n\nThe usual Christmas Dinner was served on Monday. During the first half of the holiday the pupils had much fun here with their sleighing but unfortunately I knew some of them had to resort to their own indoor amusements.\n\nBy and by, owing to delightful weather in October we were able to complete the harvest work to get all the work well in hand. Many of the girls were out daily gathering leaves and putting them into beds for winter. Our tomato plants are very poor this year and our apple crop is not as large as usual.\n\nWe built a new supply shed to the barns and have linked up all outside pipes to this supply. The new barn is occupied and work has been commenced on making the dormitories there.\n\nThe Charles Reid Co., who have very fine premises, have a large lot of old lumber which they are willing to sell us. We have completed installing cement sheds in place of the rotten woodwork between the two parts of our greenhouse. We think we can do this work ourselves at less cost than lumber and will have a permanent job when completed.\n\nImprovements. At a very small cost we have built a workroom in the attic which is most useful since all minor repairs can be effected there and hobby instruction can be given.\n\n7th January 1928.\nOttawa, January 11, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your report on the general activities at the Mohawk Institute for the quarter ended December 31st, last. We have noted that the health of the pupils is good; that an enjoyable time was had by the pupils and staff at Christmas and also the repairs and improvements that were carried out during the quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nS. Rogers, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nMohawk Institute\n\nWhile not a civic institution, one which is closely linked with Brantford and which, in point of history, extends to the earliest days of this city named after the famous Six Nations chief, the Mohawk Indian Institute, founded in 1831 by the New England Company, London, England, is one which meets the specific needs of the Six Nations Indians. It is a boarding school for children from the nearby Tuscarora reserve and is located on 300 acres of excellent land. This enables the carrying out of the dual instruction system based on theoretical and practical work in the school room and practical work on the farm itself, for the boys, and domestic life for the girls.\n\nFor many years the head of the institution and the rector of His Majesty's\n\nMohawk Institute\u2014(Inset) Major Sidney Rogers, Principal.\n\nChapel Royal of the Mohawks (familiarly known as Mohawk church), was Rev Robert Ashton, who was succeeded by Major A. Nelles Ashton, and he by Rev C. M. Turnell. The present heads are Major and Mrs. Sidney Rodgers. The choir of Mohawk church, it should be noted, is formed from the pupils of the Mohawk Institute, who this term numbered 125.\nJanuary 28, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Rogers,\n\nI have been informed that the work of shoe-repairing for the Mohawk Institute which for the past ten years has been done by Mr. Arthur Johnson, 68 Erie Avenue, Brantford, has been recently taken from him. It is reported that he is a first-class worker and is suffering a considerable loss on this account.

Macdonald's letter of the 25th instant, I send you herewith a reply received from the Principal of the Mohawk Institute. It is self-explanatory. This school is conducted on a per capita basis, and we do not usually interfere with the arrangements made by the management. In this instance it would seem to me inadvisable to interfere, as Mr. Rogers seems to have made the change for compassionate reasons.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the activities of this Institute.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChurch. The usual services have been conducted by Rev. Mr. Smith. Holy Communion was celebrated monthly. A confirmation class has started March 6th.\n\nJanuary 1st. Miss Allen was taken quite sick all day due to several days and is now under treatment.\n\nMiss Smith fell and fractured her wrist on February 1st. Mr. Horner was compelled to stay in bed for a severe illness three weeks.\n\nFebruary 27th. Mr. Smith had a painful leg injury, and he was unable to carry out his duties as the river limit was inside the Institute such as picture framing, painting, refinishing furniture which he greatly improved the interior appearance.\n\nMr. Huffman resigned to be replaced by Mr. Milton as assistant housekeeper.\n\nMr. Burlo left on March 1st.\n\nThe schoolroom several of the other rooms are still on account of sickness the health of the pupils has been wonderfully good. It was very fortunately avoided the epidemics that have been rather severe in town. These good results are due to the close cooperation between the teachers and the parents. The parents have been very generous in their contributions toward the welfare of the school.\n\nIn general, the school has been very good. Some little difficulties have arisen from the attitude of the children, but these have been overcome. It will be necessary to have the committee make a better schedule next term.\n\nNote: I have received a note from Mrs. O'Brien regarding the holiday arrangements for the students.\n\nDuring the holidays, the school was closed.\n\nOn the 1st, everyone was called to the Institute for the annual meeting.\n\nThe school was closed on the 1st to receive new clothing and the pupils were instructed to take the school. It was noted that the building was in need of repair.\n\nThe pupils were transferred to the Lady Willingdon Hospital where they are still patients. It was noted that the hospital was in need of help as there was an unexpectedly rush of patients and so we left Marjorie Hill, who has passed the Entrance and is taking special training.\nApril 14th, 1928.\n\nDuring the period the school was closed, we found ourselves quite busy helping out in various ways. We assisted in preparing food for the school staff and their families, and we also helped with the cleaning and maintenance of the school buildings. We also brought home the school supplies and helped to pack them up for storage. We volunteered our time during play hours to make sure everything was in order.\n\nFebruary 17th: Dr. Smith visited the school and gave us a lesson on first aid.\n\nMarch 5th: The school was closed due to a snowstorm.\n\nImprovements: The school was painted inside and out.\n\nApril 14th: The pupils and teachers were entertained by the local band.\n\nWe are grateful for all the help we received during this difficult time.\nOttawa, April 19, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your report on the general activities at the Mohawk Institute for the quarter ending March 31st, last. This report has been read with interest, and I have noted that, although several members of the staff were off duty on account of sickness, the health of the pupils throughout the period covered by the report was good.

I understand that two representatives of the New England Company are coming, not \"ostensibly,\" but really to inspect the work which they are interested in this country. They intend to go to British Columbia to be present at the opening of the Lytton Residential School. The names of the gentlemen who are coming are: Mr. J.B. Chubb, a member of the Court of the New England Company, and Mr. F.R. Bush, the Charter Clerk. I take it that you would wish to call upon them and extend to them the courtesies of your office.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nLt. Col. C. M. Morgan,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nMay 15th, 1928\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir:\n\n\"Visit of Directors, New England Company to Brantford\".\n\nI understand that the Directors of the New England propose to visit Brantford on or about the 24th of May.\n\nI have received a visit from the Rev. Mr. White, one of the Missionaries on the Reserve, who tells me that a meeting was held last night on the Reserve of the Anglican Indians who desire to interview the Directors when they are here to lay certain matters before them in connection with the Churches upon the Reserve.\n\nMr. White tells me there is an impression that the Directors may stay at the Mohawk Institute and merely drive through the Reserve without giving the Indians an opportunity to see them, and as I have no knowledge as to the actual date that these Gentlemen are expected or where they may be staying.\nI would ask you to ask them when they visit Ottawa to make an appointment for a deputation of Indians to meet through the medium of the Rev. Mr. White at Sour Springs on the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt. Col. C. E. Morgan,\nSupt. Six Nations.\nMay 22nd, 1928.\n\nDear Colonel Morgan,\n\nIn reply to your letter of May 19th, regarding the visit of the Directors of the New England Company to Brantford, I have to say that these gentlemen will be in Brantford from Thursday evening next until the following Wednesday evening. I mentioned to them the desire of the Anglican Indians to interview them in connection with the Churches on the reserve and there is no doubt that they will have an opportunity of doing so. I may mention that Major Bash has a personal introduction to you.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nLt.-Col. C. E. Morgan,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nQuarter ended 30th June 1928.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report of the activities of this Institute.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChurch. During the early part of the quarter the services were conducted at the Institute and it was not until May 20th that we were able to attend the Mohawk Church, at which service there were a number of Baptisms. On May 27th His Grace the Archbishop of Huron conducted a Confirmation Service, the candidates having previously been prepared by Rev. C. H. P. Owen. The Church was very prettily decorated for this occasion.\n\nDiscipline. This has been quite up to standard during the quarter.\n\nHealth. The health of the pupils has been exceptionally good. There have been, however, a number of spring colds which have been difficult to control.\n\nStaff. Mr. Thurlow left April 2nd, and Mr. Raynor, a returned man who has spent some years in Hospital, was engaged in his place. The officers gave Mr. Thurlow a very good send off from Hamilton.\n\nOn April 29th, Mrs Hamilton, junior housekeeper, was taken seriously ill and it was necessary to send her to hospital. She was unable to return and Miss Smith who was engaged in her place collapsed at the end of a week. Mrs Harrington was engaged on May 5th, and is proving quite satisfactory.\n\nClothing. The usual changes in clothing for this season were carried out. The boys receiving new overalls and the girls made themselves new issues of aprons.\n\nNotes. On April 4th, the kitchen stove collapsed. We had had considerable trouble and expense with this stove for some time and the quickest replacement was by gas. We have had great satisfaction since replacement and are able to cook all meals for fifty eight cents per diem.\n\nApril 5th. Major and Mrs Rogers went to Toronto making purchases.\n\nApril 26th. A Class from Wesley Church Sunday school gave the pupils a very interesting evening in the Dining Hall.\n\nMay 6th. We had two pupils who had been inmates of Hamilton Sanitarium and as we had to go to Hamilton on business we took them to visit there.\n\nMay 17th. All pupils were taken to witness circus procession and a number of pupils went to the afternoon performance.\n\nPupils had holiday after service on Good Friday and Easter Monday. The boys were all busy fishing and made some fine catches. Good Friday was exceptionally hot and a large number of the senior girls attended the three hour service held at St. Giles.\n\nMay 24th was a holiday for the pupils and some of the staff. At 9.30 a.m. Karl Doellittle broke his finger whilst playing. This had to be X-rayed.\nand was very difficult case to set. Daily visits to the Doctor were necessary but the finger is now healed and doing well.\n\nIn the spring of the same year, Bishop and Mrs. Chubb arrived and stayed several days, making a very thorough inspection.\n\nMay 25th. The Archbishop of Huron arrived for Confirmations the following day on the Reserve and here.\n\nActivities. On April 10th the girls were able to uncover flower beds and generally clean them up. The following day the storm windows were removed and cleaning commenced. During April the girls made a number of rag rugs.\n\nMay 4th, the lawn water service was connected.\n\nThe City of Brantford have been relaying a number of sidewalks and have put broken sidewalks in their place. These have been laid across factories from the school to the shops to make better going during the muddy weather and to avoid the lawns being ruined. This has also made a great improvement in appearances.\n\nNotes continued. May 28th. Rev. H. Lee visited. Members Chubb, Bush, Lee and Rogers attended a meeting at Kanawagah organized by Rev. White.\n\nJune 3rd. Mr. Davis visited. We were also visited by the United Church and Commercial Travellers Annual Conventions. These visitors were most interested and inspected the whole school in addition to seeing the Bible, Plate and Church.\n\nJune End. The Queen Anne Silver was used for Communion in the Church and kept out for the visit the following day of the Canadian Historical Society to see.\n\nJune 6th. Rev. Owen left for England and the services have since been conducted by a student.\n\nJune 15th. Mrs Stanley of the Stoney Mission and School spent the afternoon here.\n\nJune 19th. Pupils attended the Brantford Industrial Exhibit, as guests of the local Board of Trade.\n\nJune 20th. The Elected Six Nations Council visited in a body and had a most interesting time.\n\nFarm and Garden. The work was commenced late this year owing to weather conditions and the sale of garden produce was very slow owing to late frosts and wet weather. However, as we had ploughed every available piece of land last fall we were able to get our crops in in better time than the average farmer of the district, and prospects are quite good. We are growing five acres of tomatoes this year as a cash crop for sale to the Canning factory newly opened in Brantford.\n\nWe took the gardener and some boys to plant up the flower beds at the Lady Willingdon Hospital.\n\n14th. July 1928.\nOttawa, July 19th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your report on the activities at the Mohawk Institute for the quarter ended June 30th, last. It is noted that the general health of the pupils was good, and that the prospects for farm and garden crops are also good.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. Rogers, Esq.,\nPrincipal, Mohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nThe Archbishop's Room\nBishop Crowne Hall\nLondon, Canada, 16th Aug., 1928\n\nDuncan Campbell Scott, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nLast week, I received a letter from the New England Company in which they stated that they have been allocating \u00a3100 a year for the services of a Chaplain at the Mohawk Institute and Mohawk Chapel. I was not aware that they did it. The present Chaplain for his services receives only $5.00 per Sunday and not \u00a3100 a year. I have written to Mr. Rogers, the Principal of the Mohawk Institute, and he states that the Chaplain has been paid out of the School funds at the rate of $5.00 per Sunday. Can you tell me who has the remainder of the \u00a3100 allocated by the New England Company? I think that \u00a3100 should go to the Chaplain as intended by the Company. It is the intention of the Company to have the Chaplain do certain work both in the School and in the Church, for which they set aside \u00a3100. If the Chaplain does his work properly the \u00a3100 will not be too liberal a remuneration.\n\nI would be very much obliged if you would let me know if the \u00a3100 is paid to the Department, and if so what becomes of the balance after paying $5.00 per service for the Chaplain.\n\nBelieve me Yours faithfully,\n\nD.H./B.\nAugust 25, 1938.\n\nDear Archbishop Williams:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to the stipend for the chaplain at the Mohawk Institute and the Mohawk Chapel. I am making enquiries in this connection and will have a further communication for Your Grace in due course.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D.

David Williams, D.D., D.C.L.,\nArchbishop of Huron,\nLondon,\nOnt.\n3rd September 1928.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that Mrs Rogers and myself will be absent from the School from the 7th inst for a matter of two or three weeks during which time we hope to visit several other Residential Schools.\n\nIn preparation for this holiday all Departments have been carefully inspected and the equipment and stores placed in proper order thus making any purchases unnecessary. Each department of the school is in charge of a fully efficient officer and the discipline will be supervised by the Head Teacher, Miss Hardie and the Boys Master, Mr Raynor jointly.\n\nWe are leaving instructions for immediate communication should occasion arise.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nMOHAWK INSTITUTE\nBrantford, Ont.\nOttawa, September 5, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to the holiday that Mrs. Rogers and yourself are contemplating. Leave of absence is granted for three weeks from the 7th instant. I note that you have made proper arrangements for the conduct of the school for the period you will be away.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nS. Rogers, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nEXTRACTS FROM LETTER OF ERNEST MATHEWS, GOVERNOR,\nNEW ENGLAND COMPANY, 26 Bloomsbury Square,\nLONDON, W. C. I., dated July 27, 1928.\n\nOriginal on 510305.\n\nLater on I hope to be able to submit a proposal whereby the Department may acquire the Mohawk Institute on similar terms to those on which St. George's School was handed over.\n\nWith regard to the Mohawk Institute, we think that more attention should be given to the religious training of the children. At present the Chaplain's duties appear to be to conduct one service each Sunday when weather permits and to prepare candidates for confirmation. I would suggest that it should be part of his duty to attend at the Institute at least three days in the week to give religious instruction to the pupils. No doubt, you will consider that this is rather a matter to be dealt with by the Archbishop, and I am making this suggestion to him also.\nSeptember 13, 1928.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your letter of July 27th, last, which has to do with the religious training of the children at the Mohawk Institute. His Grace the Archbishop of Huron has written to the effect that he has received a letter from the Company, in which it was stated you have been allocating \u00a3100 per year for the services of a chaplain at the Mohawk Institute and Mohawk Chapel. I should be grateful if you would let me know what disposition is made of the \u00a3100 mentioned. Is it part of the \u00a31,000 that is directed to the Department in quarterly instalments, or is there a special payment made?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nErnest Mathews, Esq.,\nGovernor,\nNew England Company,\n26 Bloomsbury Sq.,\nLondon, W. C. 1,\nEngland.\n26, Bloomsbury Square,\nLondon, W.C.1.\n\n26th September 1928\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 13th instant, addressed to the Governor of the Company, I do not think that the word \"allocated\" was used by us in our letter to the Archbishop. Actually no portion of the Company's grant of \u00a31000 is or can properly be allocated by the Company for any particular purpose. But when we were staying at Brantford Mr Chubb and I understood from Mrs Rogers that \u00a3100 was the stipend allowed to the chaplain who takes the services for the Mohawk Institute. We may have misunderstood her, but that was the figure that we reported to the Court, and it was a fair presumption, that as one of the stipulations contained in the Lease of the Institute to the Department concerns the religious training of the pupils in the doctrine and teaching of the Church of England, payment for such instruction would be considered part of the annual grant made by the Company.\n\nYou may rest assured that the Company has no wish to restrict the Department in any matter concerning the details of management of the Institute.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCharter Clerk.\nOctober 12, 1928.\n\nDear Archbishop Williams,\n\nUpon receipt of Your Grace's letter of August 16th, last, with reference to the stipend for the chaplain at the Mohawk Institute and the Mohawk Chapel, the Department made enquiries, and I have now to inform you that there is no special grant from the New England Company for this purpose. Payment for religious instruction is considered part of the annual grant of \u00a31,000, which is made to the Department by the Company. I presume that Mr. Rogers, the Principal, has made what he considers a fair arrangement with the chaplain.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nMost Rev. David Williams, D.D., D.C.L.,\nArchbishop of Huron,\nLondon,\nOnt.\nQuarter ended 31st October 1928.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the activities of this Institute.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChurch. July 1st. Dominion Day services were held at the School and during the holidays services were discontinued at the Mohawk Church and the pupils allowed to visit the local Churches. Rev. Owen who had been away in England reopened the School term with service at the Mohawk Church on August 25th.\n\nStaff. Mr. F. Hughes who has been with us as cattleman for some years left to manage a farm near Oakville and Mr. Howard was engaged to fill the vacancy.\n\nOwing to the small number of boys remaining here for the holidays and the pressure of work it was necessary to engage Mr. Lindsay as extra help.\n\nMr. Raynor was ill for several days.\n\nMiss Hardie and Miss Hooper were both away for six weeks and R. Howart had one weeks holiday.\n\nDiscipline. On the whole this has been very satisfactory. This is due in part to the fact that the parents and friends of the pupils are showing a much more friendly attitude towards the school. We find much more co-operation now than we had before.\n\nHolidays. School closed on July 14th. for six weeks and we had only forty pupils remain. Most of these were small and it was necessary to hire some of the bigger boys in order to maintain the farm work. All pupils remaining were able to have an enjoyable holiday. It was necessary for all to work part of the time but this work was interspersed with visits to the Cinema, to the Park and the River. While at other times they were given truck rides and minor treats.\n\nSchool opened in a most disappointing fashion. Had all returned who were expected and the new pupils reported promptly we should have had a full school, but this year there seemed to be a shortage of money amongst the Indians and only those who were near at hand were able to send the children in at the proper time. Several pupils were in the States, five asked for sick leave and others were kept in the berry fields until such time as sufficient money could be earned to pay the return fares.\n\nMajor Rocker went with his battery to Pettawawa Camp for Annual Firing practice on August 26th. July.\n\nMr. Sisson called August 2nd. and the matter of arranging the graves of the Johnson family was discussed.\n\nOn August 27th. the Principal and Mrs. Persall took a party of pupils who had behaved so splendidly during the holidays to Niagara Falls. This was a most pleasant and instructive day and in addition to the natural sights arrangements were made for the whole party to be shown over the big Chippawa Hydro plant. Lunch was served in Victoria Park and although we had a very strenuous day we all returned home.\nAugust 29th. Mrs Rogers took four girls to the Lady Willington Hospital for examination.\n\nSeptember 4th. Three boys started the Fall term at the Collegiate and we were able to find homes for several girls who had passed the Entrance Examination. In the case of the girls we find it much more satisfactory to place them in homes where they may earn a little pocket money than to keep them here and allow them to attend the Collegiate. They have to leave the School early and cannot possibly return before 4:30 or 5:00 p.m., and we find better results are obtained when a girl is so placed that she has to spend her noon hours occupied.\n\nOn September 7th. Major and Mrs Rogers left for a holiday during which eight schools were visited.\n\nOn September 27th. and 28th. the school for the first time placed some work on exhibit at the Chewaten Fair. Our boys were very proud of the results and we were glad to notice the good effect on the school morale. The classroom exhibits were also of a very fine quality.\n\nOn September 28th. Isobel Hill was taken to Hamilton to appear in Court in connection with an assault committed against her during the holidays and whilst in her Mother's care. We lent every assistance in the prosecution of this case and a conviction was secured. It was a matter of satisfaction to us to find the girl's mother so willing to take action in this case as unfortunately the Indian mother is inclined to be callous on the question of the daughter's morals.\n\nSeptember 29th. Mr MacKenzie, Colonel and Mr. Fairchild visited. The Newport Women's Institute visited the school and were entertained to tea. This organisation has been very actively interested in some neglected Indian Children in the school.\n\nClothing. The girls have been issued with smart new caps of blue, piped with black, with the school badge.\n\nImprovements. During the holidays we completed the painting of the school-rooms and the sewing rooms. These rooms and the small corridors were also Calcomined. These rooms now present a very fine appearance. The flower beds were very attractive this year and have called for very complimentary remarks from nearly every visitor. This work is done by the girls under the supervision of Mrs Rogers.\n\nFarm and Garden. We have a very trying season but have had good results. Owing to the wet spring crops were tremendously heavy to handle and the grain looked badly. It was necessary to purchase a new binder in order to harvest the grain which we managed to harvest in good condition. We have not completely threshed yet but very satisfactory yields are expected. The garden crops were good although delayed by the wet weather and we had a good yield of tomatoes which were grown for the Canning Factory.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nDuring the months of November and December, 1928, there was correspondence on the -5 of the file with reference to the business management of the Mohawk Institute.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

During the quarter the usual religious training was carried out. Rev. C. H. F. Owen was in charge of the weekly services. We held our Harvest Home on the 1st October and have held no services in the Church since October 14th. On October 31st, the pupils attended the Children's Special Service at Trinity Church. Holy Communion was celebrated monthly.\n\nDiscipline. There have been no serious breaches of discipline during the quarter and the fact that our boys have attained some prominence and distinction locally as runners has had a very marked effect upon the boys' general attitude. The girls worked some very nice badges for the boys running suits and every boy running under the school colours is very proud of the ovation the crowd always gives them. Naturally, this has a most desirable effect in fostering school pride.\n\nHealth. Although Brantford has had several bad epidemics we have escaped with only minor sickness. Several of the staff, however, have been sick.\n\nStaff. There have been no changes in the staff. Mrs Perall and Miss Allen have had holidays.\n\nClothing. The usual seasonable changes have been made and new shoes issued.\n\nNotes. We received a report from the mother of Isobel Hill, a pupil that she had been assaulted during the summer holidays and had her medically examined. The mother prosecuted and the man was sentenced by the Hamilton Court.\n\nOctober 1st. Mr. MacKenzie visited.\n\nOctober 2nd. Two pupils were taken to Chawaken Hospital and were operated upon for abscesses and tonsils. Several others who had slight symptoms for concern were examined and treatments given.\n\nOn October 4th, the Church was decorated by the girls for the Harvest Thanksgiving service.\n\nDuring the quarter we had many visitors, including English teachers, here on Exchange; School inspectors from South Africa and New Zealand; the Church Army workers; the Principal from Alert Bay; Clergyman from Hamilton; the Stratford on Avon Festival Company; and the Public School teachers from St. Catherine's.\n\nOctober 19th. Major and Mrs Rogers visited Toronto to purchase supplies.\n\nThe School Inspector was here October 25th.\nOctober 20th. The fire alarm system was overhauled.\n\nNovember 1st. All Hallows Eve was celebrated by the pupils with the usual pranks and fun.\n\nHis Excellency the Governor General visited officially on November 3rd, and he pronounced the following Monday to be a school holiday.\n\nNovember 6th. Mr. Phelan visited and conducted an audit.\n\nNovember 9th and 10th. The local teachers held convention; on those two days they threaded.\n\nNovember 11th. A Community Service was held at the Centotaph. This was attended by all the Militia Units and every organisation in Brantford. Our pupils were also present and made a very creditable appearance.\n\nNovember 23rd. The Douglas Seed Company presented the school with a large quantity of imported bulbs which Mrs. Rossiter and the girls were able to plant in time for Spring flowering.\n\nDecember 7th. All hands were busy unloading a car of coal.\n\nDecember 8th. This was a notable day for the boys. The local newspaper sponsored a Road Race for Indians and there were five prizes. Present pupils secured three of these and a boy who has recently left school won another. This race run over a seven half mile course against fifty-two competitors, of which only 27 finished. Of our thirteen entries there were none who did not finish.\n\nSince the Race, the proprietor has presented each entrant with a medal as an appreciation of their efforts.\n\nDecember 12th. The boiler was removed from the water heater.\n\nDecember 14th. An Electric service switch-box was found to be out of order and immediately repaired.\n\nDecember 16th. Mr. Raynor's mother died.\n\nDecember 21st. The children began to decorate for Christmas.\n\nOn the 22nd, we had very few relatives visit owing to the bad condition of the roads. All the pupils were taken to town at least once before Christmas.\n\nSanta Claus arrived as usual and every child had a gift.\n\nOn Christmas Day a special service was conducted by the Principal and a most happy day followed. The Dining Hall was very gay and a special feast was prepared for every meal. In the evening we had a huge masquerade party and there were many weird costumes improvised.\n\nThe pupils were guests of Mr. Ernie Moul of the local theatre during Christmas week.\n\nOwing to the kindness of several merchants and friends we were well supplied with fruit and candles.\n\nAll the teachers had four days holiday arranged to include either Christmas or New Year's Day and most of them have been off duty since with the prevalent influenza.\n\nFarm and Garden.\n\nWe had very fine crops this year and harvested every one in good condition. The only failure was with the apple crop which was practically nil. We sold our wheat immediately.\n\nEvery portion of ground that it was possible to plough was ploughed and the whole farm is well prepared for next year.\n\nImprovements. A brick out-building was converted into a forge. The forge had previously been housed in an old wooden building and the fire hazard was too great. Some disused pavement was given us and laid as a side walk to the green-house.\n\nThe Gardener's cottage kitchen was put on a cement foundation and the walls lined to prevent freezing. A long wanted rail was placed on the front steps to be of assistance in wintry weather.\n\n16th January, 1926.\nQuarter ended 31st March 1929.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the activities of this Institute.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nParoch. All the services were conducted at the school except in February when the pupils attended Trinity Church for the morning service and those confirmed attended St. Jude's Church in the afternoon. In which service Archbishop David Williams preached. Rev. G. H. P. Owen conducted the musical service on Good Friday and Holy Communion was celebrated on Easter Sunday.\n\nDiscipline. We have had no serious breaches of discipline apart from the bad influence of Joe Hill. He has proved incorrigible and shown very bad influence. He persistently absconded and always took weaker boys with him.\n\nHealth. All students suffered from the epidemic of \"La Grippe\" which has been so prevalent and in most cases were off duty for several days. As we restricted visiting the pupils, fortunately, were not exposed and we had very few cases amongst them. Marie Hill suffered from a bad abscess which required medical attention. Marjorie Hill was badly attacked by the Collegeate and midwife position in town broke her wrist. We have had her in residence but arranged for her to enter services during the Easter Holidays.\n\nEva Liokas, a diabetic case, complained of a cold and was ordered to bed on January 24th. She was found in a state of coma the following day and treatment was administered pending the arrival of the Doctor. On his instructions she was removed to the hospital and died there.\n\nFour pupils attended the dentist and two received treatment from an acupuncturist.\n\nStaff. Miss Harrington did not recover from the attack of \"flu\" and resigned. Her post was filled by Miss Gilmore. Mr. John Hetherington joined as an active member of the staff at the beginning of the quarter. Mr. R. Howarth resigned in order to take a course in field engineering.\n\nNotes. Owing to fouling we pumped the soft water cistern and discovered we had been using water from a cistern of which there was no record. All necessary safety precautions were taken.\n\nAll plaster in the building was repaired and the upper girls dormitory was whitewashed. The floors were renovated and all woodwork and beds painted. The boys dormitory was completely painted and the beds put into good order whilst the girls lower dormitory was toned up where necessary.\n\nThe Laundry machine broke down and was overhauled by the staff. A new switch box was installed.\n\nThe Principal, Miss Hardie and Mr. R. Howarth attend...\nattended Eva Lickers funeral. Ten pupils were in attendance as pall bearers.\n\nFebruary 20th, Mr. Schuyler who inspected the school farm when Mrs. Rogers returned here in 1915 called on business. He was very much impressed with the improvements in all departments connected with the farm.\n\nMarch 4th, Mr. Truefitt, private secretary to Lord Rothmere and business manager of the Continental Edition of the Daily Mail visited the school and was most interested.\n\nMr. Standing, County public school inspector, spent a day in the class-rooms.\n\nMarch 19th, a visitor sketched the Royal Coat of Arms in the Mohawk Church.\n\nA new organ was bought for the services out of contributions received for displaying the Queen Anne bible and silver.\n\nAmusements. January 1st, Miles Isaacs ran sixth in a ten mile road race against the pick of Ontario. March 20th, the 91st Highlanders of Hamilton staged an indoor track meet and for our special benefit a race for Indian boys was run. Miles again led his school chums and was only a few seconds longer in covering the two miles than Pavlo Nurni. We secured every prize offered in this meet.\n\nMarch 29th, The principal and two of the staff took Miles and Norman Lickers to Toronto where Miles ran second in a six miles race and Norman secured the first junior in a three mile run.\n\nOn February 8th, the pupils were the guests of the Kiwanis Club at a matinee performance.\n\nOur senior girls have joined the Lady Willingdon Hospital Auxiliary and devote an evening once bi-weekly to making necessaries for the hospital. They entered a competition sponsored by the W.C.T.U. and we secured several good prizes.\n\nFarm and Garden.\n\nWe have hauled all the coal off cars this year.\n\nA sanitary house has been built for storing the milk pails and separator.\n\nA slide was built for the girls.\n\nIce was harvested on February 15th.\n\nAll possible work has been done and much manure hauled to fields in preparation for the spring work.\n\nAll roads have been graded.\n\nWagons and implements have been painted and gate posts have been built for the school entrance.\n\n1st April 1929.\nOttawa, April 5, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your report on the activities at the Mohawk Institute for the quarter ended March 31st, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. Rogers, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nOttawa, May 21, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is desirous of learning if the older girls at the Mohawk Indian Residential School are being trained in milking cows. As most of the graduates of your school will return to reserves that are largely farming communities, it is very important that the girls be fully competent in this particular. The Department expects that the older girls, under proper supervision, will be given a course of instruction in milking, and I shall be pleased to learn that suitable arrangements have been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nS. Rogers, R.M.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Indian Res. School,\nBrantford, Ont.\nMay 23rd, 1929.\n\nDr. D. C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nAs directed by you, I visited the Mohawk Institute at Brantford on the 20th and 21st instant.\n\nImmediately upon my arrival at the school, I interviewed Mr. Rogers with a view to eliciting information regarding the reports that had reached the Department in connection with (a) purchase of farm by Principal and (b) rumours regarding Principal's intemperance.\n\n(a) Purchase of Farm by Principal.\n\nMr. Rogers informed me that, about six weeks ago, he purchased a farm adjoining the Mohawk Institute farm. There are eighty-eight (88) acres of land with a good house and barn. He has already purchased eleven (11) saddle horses and it is his intention to conduct a riding school - as a matter of fact, he has already started and several residents of Brantford have arranged with him to receive riding instruction regularly. On the second day of my visit, (May 21st), he hired a man to conduct the riding school.\n\nAbout fifty (50) acres of this farm is being cultivated - the seed for this, Mr. Rogers states, has been supplied by himself while the labour from the school (both employees and pupils), as well as school farm machinery and tools, has been used. Mr. Rogers further stated that it was his intention to allow the school one half the proceeds of the crop raised on the acreage cultivated on his farm. He appeared to be of the opinion that this was a profitable arrangement for the school.\n\nFrom a departmental point of view, I believe that the ownership and the cultivation of the Principal's farm in the manner stated presents very serious difficulty - (1) Principal not devoting his whole time to supervision of school; (2) use of school equipment and school labour especially the Indian boys, on land owned by the Principal is likely to cause unfavourable criticism and (3) possible profits very problematical. I pointed out this attitude to Mr. Rogers and, while he agreed with me that the proposition is open to the objections just stated, he still seemed convinced that the financial benefit accruing to the school would offset the disadvantages of the scheme.\nWe discussed the whole matter for some time and visited the farm and I informed Mr. Rogers that the matter would be placed before you for your decision.\n\n(b) Rumours regarding Principal's intemperance.\n\nMr. Rogers stated quite candidly that he had been arrested on May 3rd on a charge of being under the influence of liquor while in charge of a car. The case has not yet come to trial owing to the absence of Mr. Rogers' doctor, but Mr. Rogers was very emphatic in assuring me that there was no doubt about his innocence. His explanation of the incident is that he had been under the influence for some time and was troubled with insomnia. On the day in question, he had been around the country with two friends in connection with the purchase of horses for his farm. At about three o'clock in the afternoon, they reached a certain farm where the horses had got out of hand. Mr. Rogers, presumably to look at horses, Mr. Rogers remained in the car and says he fell asleep. The County Constable came along and arrested him and Mr. Rogers claims that personal animosity on the part of the Constable prompted this action. He was taken to the police station but was allowed out within two hours.\n\nThe Indian Superintendent, Colonel Morgan, appears convinced that Mr. Rogers is frequently using liquor to excess and, as consequence, is not a proper person to be in charge of the school. Colonel Morgan's request I had a short talk with (1) Rev. Mr. Owens, (2) County Constable Blakeley and (3) Chief of Police of Brantford. Mr. Owens is the Anglican clergyman who attends the Mohawk Institute and he was of the same opinion as Colonel Morgan. The County Constable claimed that Mr. Rogers was drinking to excess. I must say that I am not very favourably impressed with this man. The Chief of Police stated that, while he had never seen Mr. Rogers under the influence of liquor nor had any charge been previously laid against him, still many rumours had reached him and he felt that Mr. Rogers was not altogether the proper person for the position of Principal of the Mohawk Institute. I had a confidential talk with the Librarian of the Bank of Montreal, where the school account is kept, and he had not heard any serious reports regarding Mr. Rogers' drinking and was unaware of the fact that he had been arrested on May 3rd. I did not inform Mr. Rogers of the above interview.\n\nFinancial Condition:\n\nThe school finances appear to be improving and a review of the accounts for the last five months showed that an endeavor is being made to reduce the deficit. The following brief summary will give you a fair idea of the present situation:-\nDeficit - March 31st, 1929 ....... $3,052.43\n\nExpenditures from March 31st to May 20th, 1929 .......... 3,692.86\n\nTOTAL ........................................ $6,744.69\n\nReceipts - March 31st to May 20th, 1929\nNew England Co. Grant ........ $1,200.00\nAdvance on June quarter earnings ........ 3,000.00\nFarm and garden sales ........ 1,545.58\n\nTOTAL ........................................ $5,745.58\n\nDEFICIT, MAY 20th, 1929 ......................... $999.11\n\nMr. Rogers estimated that the expenditures for the balance of the quarter will not exceed $3,000. The receipts will be about $2,200. ($1,800 balance of grain and $400 from sale of farm produce). On this basis, there would be a deficit of approximately $1,800 at the end of the present quarter, which would be an improvement.\n\nAs directed in your letter of January 24th, some of the hogs have been sold but the team of horses has not yet been disposed of as the Principal stated that he has been unable to secure a purchaser at the price he considers the team is worth. Attached to this report is a statement showing the livestock at present at the school.\n\nGeneral:\n\nIncluding the school farm and the Glebe farm, approximately one hundred and ninety-nine (199) acres have been planted, while it is intended to plant sixteen (16) acres more as soon as the latter is sufficiently dry to work.\n\nThere are one hundred and twenty-five (125) pupils in the school (71 girls and 54 boys), and all of them are in good health.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nMay 28, 1929.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI have before me the report of the officer whom I sent to investigate certain matters pertaining to your conduct as Principal of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nIn this report it is stated that some six weeks ago you purchased a farm of 38 acres adjoining the Institute farm, and further that you have undertaken the establishment of a riding school. I need hardly say that these activities are quite incompatible with your status as a full time employee of the department as the responsible head and principal of one of our most important Indian Residential schools.\n\nYou did not think it necessary to advise me of your intention to engage in other employment so that I feel quite free to make arrangements for the future conduct of the Mohawk Institute, as the duties and responsibilities of the position which you occupy require the entire attention of the incumbent.\n\nI note, moreover, that you have been using school equipment and school labour on your own farm land and that you actually utilized the services of employees and Indian pupils for this purpose. I must ask you to let me have a statement of these transactions showing the time spent and the value of the labour at a reasonable rate of wage in order that you may make compensation. You must cease immediately the employment of any equipment or manual labour from the Institute.\n\nI have to advise you that it will be necessary to arrange for the appointment of a new Principal and Assistant Principal at an early date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSydney Rogers, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.,\nJune 1st, 1929.\n\nDear Archbishop Williams,\n\nI find that it will be necessary to appoint a new principal and matron for the Mohawk Institute at Brantford and I would take it as a favour if you would give the matter consideration.\n\nAs you are no doubt aware the present principal and matron are husband and wife and I would be inclined to continue such an arrangement if persons well qualified could be selected. I think it is essential that the incumbent should be a good business man with knowledge of farming and stock-raising. It might be advisable to select someone in Holy Orders. It is our understanding with the New England Company that the pupils of the institution shall be trained in the teachings and doctrines of the Church of England.\n\nThe salaries of the present incumbents are $1,400.00 and $600.00 respectively, with residence and maintenance. I am desirous of carrying out this change as soon as possible and I know that I can expect valuable advice from Your Grace.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMost Rev. David Williams, D.D., D.C.L.,\nArchbishop of Huron,\nLondon, Ont.\nMay 29th 1929\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nWe received your letter today with deep regret. Mr. Rogers has put his personal interest at risk to save the school, and I have done two persons' work for years.\n\nI regret very much the attitude you have taken - with me the Mohawk always comes first and I have put in many years of untiring labor and thought to build up the school. As it is I can be proud to hand it over to a new staff. Don't think I want to take all the credit, but I must take all the blame.\n\nBuying the farm was not premeditated - several English families have settled in the neighborhood - and we were looking for a location for another friend to start their own and it looked to me to be an opportunity to mine. One reason the Mohawk farm does not pay is that there is no land surplus. After my purchase in April, the flood covered the property for some weeks. A good deal of the farm is in fall wheat and hay - the Rockwood Plow Company's wheeling nephew is sales manager - plowed by tractor the greater part of the remaining land. The middle of May...\nThe school ploughed, tenanted and sowed oats. The school has not touched the fencing. The foreman has kept strict account of all labor - the school to have half the crop which is more than the usual rate. Fall report of actions taken will be in the next quarterly return.\n\nWhen General Asheton was here last we told him our plan and asked him to take the initiative over with you - he thought it might do much with your approval - John's death I'm sure made him forget our little plan.\n\nWe have also moved the old people to the farm - and a man is managing the care and setting out of the ponies and horses. It is possible a limited stock company will be formed to manage the herd when it is built.\n\nWhen we first bought the farm Mr. Rogers thought I should be in his occupation at once - but I thought as the properties adjoin we would be more in the place than usual - we will not be taking afternoons away on any holidays. Our trip west last fall gave\nAs many pointers as to the management of other schools\u2014we do not think the Red Indian took second place to any of the sights we visited. In fact we do more in the way of painting woodwork, and beds and keeping furniture repaired than any school we saw.\n\nI'm sure the Palace found the school and grounds in good order\u2014the stables and yard have been better the pupils' health good and everything running smoothly.\n\nI am sorry I did not write you earlier, but Mr. Rogers' ladies office work and letter writing\u2014and I'm only under how to explain our views partly as I'm sure he will not\u2014I would have liked to remain here a few years longer\u2014yes, I lost most of my money during the war\u2014and we could have gradually altered stables\u2014put in electric lights\u2014firewood, plumbing etc., that the house requires\u2014but please be assured that while Sir. we will carry on\u2014and do our best to help our successor\u2014\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nAnn Rogers\nThe Archbishop's Room\nBlakely Cremon Hall\nLondon, Canada\nJune 3, 1929.\n\nDuncan O. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nYour letter of June let received, for which I thank you.\n\nIf you will kindly allow me a few days in which to make enquiries among the men that are suitable to take up the work, and I have two or three in view at the present time, I would be very much obliged. I think that I would be able to give you a definite recommendation within a week or so.\n\nAgain thanking you for your courtesy,\n\nBelieve me, yours faithfully,\n\nDH/HTP.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDavid Henson\nJune 2nd, 1929.\n\nDr. Duncan G. Scott,\nD/ Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nAcknowledging receipt of your letter dated May 28th I feel greatly surprised that your inspecting officer should have made any report that would prompt the attitude taken.\n\nOne of the chief reasons for purchasing the farm you refer to was that we would enable the Institute farm to make a better showing this year.\n\nI think I would not be making too much to be allowed to see a copy of the officer's report since I was certainly under the impression that he was convinced of the fairness and the wisdom of the activities to which you take exception. The matter of using school equipment was fully explained and I am sure the Mohawk Institute has by far the better end of the bargain.\n\nFurther points in your letter are noted and action is being taken.\n\nPersonally, I feel that after devoting the most important ten years of my life to the development of \"one of your most important Residential Schools\" your attitude does not impress me that my work has been appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nRev W.W.

His Grace Archbishop Williams has nominated Rev. H. W. Snell, B.A., of St. Paul's Church, Stratford, Ont., for the post. Mr. Snell appears to be well qualified, and I have offered him the position. He was brought up on a farm and has had experience in teaching. Mrs. Snell has been requested to consider the post of matron at the school.\n\nDuncan C.

The Department offers you a salary of $1650 per annum, with residence and maintenance for yourself and family. You would be chaplain of the school and of the Mohawk Chapel and you would superintend every phase of the school activity. It is understood that Mrs. Snell will undertake the duties of matron, at a salary of $600 per annum.\n\nI should be pleased if you would accept this offer without delay. At an early date, you should come to Ottawa at the Department's expense for an interview.

You must understand that it would be only with extreme regret and under real necessity that I should ask for the resignation of your husband and yourself. I have not been very well satisfied with his administration of the Institute and the recent events made it impossible to postpone the change which had been in my mind for some time.\n\nI beg to acknowledge fully your own very excellent services in the interests of the Institute. One reason which made it difficult for me to decide was the old association of your family with the school and your own good record.\n\nI have arranged for successors to Mr. Rogers and yourself and wrote him the other day stating that I would accept your resignations as of the 1st August. I note in your letter that you state that when you first bought the farm Mr. Rogers thought of sending in his resignation at once.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMrs. S.

The new principal will commence his duties on August first.\n\nI have had an interview with Mr. Snell. He is 49 years of age, was born in Canada and brought up on a farm. He has had experience in teaching and in other ways appears well qualified for his new duties. His wife will be the matron at the Institute. I think we can look forward with confidence to a successful regime under his management.\n\nI am sure you will understand that owing to the long association of Mrs. Rogers and her family with the Institute, it was with great regret that I made this change, but it was inevitable.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDuncan C. L.\nJune 24, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Mathews:\n\nI wish to inform you that it has been found necessary to ask for the resignation of Mr. and Mrs. S. Rogers, Principal and Matron of the Mohawk Institute. For some time, I have not been at all satisfied with the administration of the School, but matters were abruptly brought to a head a few weeks ago by an extraordinary action on the part of Mr. Rogers. Without giving me any intimation of his intention, he purchased a farm adjoining the Institute and commenced the operation of a riding school on this property. I immediately ordered an investigation and found that these were the facts and that he had even presumed to use the labour of pupils of the Institute and the staff on this farm.\n\nAs the importance of the work and the amount of detail which is involved in the management of the Institute is quite sufficient to absorb the energy of the principal, it was impossible to allow this dual arrangement. Mr. Rogers had stated to our officer that he intended to allot one-half the proceeds of the farm for the benefit of the Institute. Of course, this was purely speculative, and, if he had been frank with me, I would have refused to countenance the purchase or the proposed arrangement. Under the circumstances, I felt that an immediate change was essential. I therupon communicated with His Grace, Archbishop Williams, who, as you know, is deeply interested in the work, and\n\nErnest Mathews, Esq.,\nGovernor, New England Company,\n26 Bloomsbury Sq.,\nLondon, W.C.

He should compile complete lists of all live stock, agricultural implements, machinery, furniture, furnishings and supplies of all kinds, including food, clothing, bedding and grains, feed and harness. I believe it advisable to include the equipment, etc., of the Mohawk Chapel in this inventory. This list should show the Queen Anne gifts. A separate list should be prepared showing the furniture and furnishings, etc., owned by Mr. and Mrs. Rogers.\n\nAfter consultation with Mr. Rogers, Mr. Phelan will be able to recommend what instructions should be given concerning the financial transactions for July. It might be advisable to have bills, both payable and receivable, presented by July 15th, in order to facilitate the final audit which should be made just before Rev. Mr. Snell takes charge. Financial transactions during the last two weeks in July should be limited to those absolutely necessary. Mr. Rogers should be instructed that no further large orders for supplies should be given by himself and he should not arrange any sales other than those really necessary, without authority.\n\nDuncan Scott\nDear Miss Hardy:\n\nWe members of the Council of the Six Nations Band of Indians desire to take this opportunity to extend to you our most sincere appreciation, and to gratefully acknowledge your invaluable service rendered to us, to our college who have had the privilege of being pupils of your noble Institution; this Institution, which has been likened so often to our own, is to be congratulated on having on its staff so competent and conscientious an instructor as you have always been.

For many years I helped my parents with the management - care of the sick - class rook work etc., without any salary. Then I took charge for one year when my brother had leave of absence.\n\nDuring the war I lost most of my money in a railroad investment - so was glad to return to the school in 1918 as I could continue the care of my parents. I could have commanded a much larger salary in a hospital but that would have taken me away from Brantford. The school was in such a neglected condition that for four years it was work under a dreadful strain. Now I am proud to say we can hand the school over in as perfect condition as our funds would allow - a competent and contented staff - and healthy and happy children.\n\nThe school grounds and flower beds have never looked better. The Government Inspector who in 1918 said it would take at least ten years to build the farm up was here the other day and said he did not think we could have attained so much - he was sure there were not horses or cattle better cared for anywhere - and was full of praises for conditions all over the place.\n\nHoping that you can grant my request -\n\nTrustfully yours,\n\n(Signed) ALICE M.

Attached are statements showing the school property on hand, as follows:\n\nPages 1 to 6 - Articles in rooms on ground floor of main building.\n\" 7 \" 9 - Articles in rooms on second floor of main building.\nPage 10 - Articles in attic.\nPages 11 & 12 - Articles in rooms in basement of main building.\n\" 13, 14 & 15 - Articles in greenhouse, carpenter shop, work shop, granary and barn, dairy; also list of machinery and harness.\nPage 16 - Live stock.\n\" 17 - Articles in Mohawk Chapel.\n\" 18 - Fire equipment.\n\nDefinite instructions were given to the Principal not to make any purchases other than for current requirements between the date of the visit and the end of July.\n\nThe Principal was also instructed not to make any unnecessary sales. I might point out, however, that the 23 hogs listed in the inventory under the heading \"Live Stock\" are practically ready for market and will likely be sold some time during the month of July. A quantity of garden produce will also be sold. Instructions were also given to have all accounts submitted in time for the final audit.\n\nIn\n26, Bloomsbury Square,\nLondon, W.C.I.\n\n17th July, 1929.\n\nDuncan Scott, Esq., Litt. D.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nCanada.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nYour letter to me of the 24th June was placed before a Court of the Company today.\n\nThe Court greatly regrets to learn of the motion which Mr. Rogers has taken and feels that you had no course open to you but to call for his resignation. Incidentally, the Court are of opinion that it is in the best interest of the School and the objects of the Company that the Principal should be in Holy Orders.\n\nIt is a great satisfaction to the Court to realise that under the lease granted to your Department you are enabled to take prompt action without the delay of reference to the Court. And I was authorized to suggest to you that a sale of the Mohawk Institute to your Department on the same basis as that of the Lytton Institute would be a further simplification of our common responsibilities. I should be glad if you could, at your convenience, let us hear your views on this suggestion which was brought up in conversation between you and the representatives of the Company when they met you a year ago.\n\nMrs. Rogers has written a letter of which I enclose a copy. The Court could not entertain any grant of a pension. But as she was in the first instance a servant of the Company it might be prepared to make her a small grant - if you approved.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGovernor.\n\nEnclosure\nJuly 31, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Mathews:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to the Mohawk Institute. I am very pleased that the Court concurs in the action that has been taken. I am very hopeful that the Reverend Mr. Snell will make a good principal. The Superintendent of Indian Education is proceeding to Brantford today, to install him in his new position.\n\nI can see no reason why the Company should not make a small grant to Mrs. Rogers, in view of her services. She has had a long association with the Mohawk Institute.\n\nI shall be glad to consider your suggestion that the Department purchase the Mohawk Institute. I remember discussing this when Mr. Chubb and Mr. Bush were here, but the conversations were rather indefinite. If you could let me have a proposal from the Company, I will bring it to the attention of the Superintendent General. I should be glad to learn the conditions under which the property might be acquired and the financial consideration.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nErnest Mathews, Esq.,\nGovernor, New England Company,\n26 Bloomsbury Sq., R.,\nLondon, W.C. 1,\nEngland.\nBoys' Master, H.E. Jones. The engaging of a man who is a mechanic who can also assist on the farm and act as Boys' Master has abundantly justified itself in the saving of expensive visits of mechanics from the city. He has more than saved his salary for us in this way. As I had to give Mr Hughes a Month's notice, we had 8 women & 5 men on the staff during September. The Senior & Junior Housekeepers are both graduates in Dietetics with practical experience.\n\nNOTES:\nA great many visitors have called to see the Institute and Queen Anne Plate, among them was Dr. Guiness who spoke very appreciatively of the School and its work.\n\nThe children, 20 in number, who got no holidays were taken to Sprinbank Park for a holiday. They were specially interested in Zoo. The picnic was in the nature of a reward for good behaviour and compensation for the loss of holiday.\n\nA great deal of cleaning and painting has been done so that the building presents a very spick-and-span appearance inside.\n\nA change in the diet from skimmed milk to whole was much appreciated by the pupils and should be good for their physical development.\n\nA number of our boys competed in the races at Cheweken Fair. Norman Lickers ran first in the five-mile race with Harry Lickers third. Jesse Cayusa came first in the five-mile bicycle race. A four-year-old colt from the farm prepared and exhibited by Harry Lickers was awarded second prize in the general purpose class.\n\nFour prizes were awarded to garden stuff from here exhibited at the school fair. The whole school were guests at the Ohs. Fair.\n\nWe have 6 boys and 1 girl attending Collegiate from here. One other girl, Helen Miller, was removed by her parents after spending 16 days. They brought an order from Col. Morgan for her release. I was rather pleased as her removal made room for a needy case.\n\nFARM AND GARDEN:\nHarvesting is all completed and thrashing done. The yield was good considering the season. Our oats were particularly good. I sold the wheat soon after thrashing, realizing $522.62 @ 1.30 per bushel.\n\nThe garden has paid well, but we suffered a severe loss in tomatoes and peppers from the early frost which was most unusual. We estimate that we lost about $400.00. The late potatoes will be very poor owing to the very dry summer.\n\nWe have been unable to sell any of the horses. There seems to be no demand at present. The old brood mare died a few days ago. The loss was small as she was too old to be of any use. Another old horse will have to be got rid of this fall. If I cannot sell him I shall have him killed. Two or three old cows will have to be sold.\n\nOct. 5-29.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI submit herein report of the activities of this Institute for the months of August & September 1929.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nServices have been held each Sunday at His Majesty's Chapel of The Mohawks. The historical interest of the Church attracts a considerable number of visitors. This is good for the pupils as it tends to add importance to their service. The visitors, too, invariably comment most favorably on the reverent attitude of the pupils and the beauty of the service. Chapel Services are held each day in the senior class-room, and the children seem to enjoy them. The readiness with which they respond to the call to chapel is very gratifying. Simple Bible talks are given by the Principal at each evening chapel. The only drawback is the lack of a suitable Chapel. The school-room lacks atmosphere and one hundred and thirty-five pupils and teachers crowd the room very much.\n\nDISCIPLINE.\n\nOn the whole the pupils have been good. There was quite an epidemic of running away when I first took over but they seem to have settled down now that they have found out the reaction of the new Principal. A gratifying development has been the readiness of the pupils to cooperate in the prevention of absconding. Breaches of this rule are making the offender distinctly unpopular.\n\nThe most serious breach of discipline has been also a moral offense. There have been several instances of theft, most of them by two boys and one girl. Here, too, I have emphasized the harm done to their school and race. The scholars as a whole seem to have responded to this appeal, so that I was able to bring the last culprit, who happened to be the most persistent offender, to trial before his peers. He admitted his guilt and as a punishment was \"put through the lines\" and deprived of the trip to Oshweken Fair.\n\nHEALTH.\n\nThe health of the school has been good. There was a mild epidemic of influenza. Three of the girls, the Curly sisters and Certie Hill were taken to Lady Willington Hospital for tonsillectomies. There are three pupils, Ambrose and Horne Cayuga and Mary Batista receiving treatments for eye trouble. The two boys began them before holidays. George Hill and Lorne Cayuga suffered fractures of the forearm but are doing well.\n\nSTAFF.\n\nThere have been several changes in the staff. Mr. Raynor and Miss Bellwood left Aug. 30, Miss Hooper had resigned on June 1, Miss Allan left Sept. 30, as did also Mr. Hughes. All of them resigned to take other positions except Mr. Hughes, whom I had to let go in pursuance of the policy of reducing the male staff.\n\nThe new members are, The Principal and Matron, Assistant Matron, Nurse, Mrs. Smith; Junior Teacher, Miss MacBurney; Senior Housekeeper, Mrs. Jones; Junior Housekeeper, Miss Johnson; Mechanic &\nOct. 8-29.\n\nMr. Russel T. Ferrier\nSuperintendent of Schools\nIndian Department\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI happen to be the President of The Ontario Trustees and Ratepayers' Association, elected last Easter. The office does not make many demands on my time beyond attendance at the Easter Convention. I find that I get a great deal of helpful information from the Conventions, so that it is time well spent, especially now that I am in charge of an educational institution. As President, I am a delegate from this Association to The Canadian Education Association Convention to be held in Mount Royal Hotel, Montreal, on Nov. 5-7. As I shall be so near, I thought it might be possible to come over to Ottawa for a day, say Friday Nov. 6.\n\nPlease let me know what you think.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, October 9, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant and I believe it is quite desirable that you take advantage of your visit to Montreal for a call at the Department offices on Friday, November 8th. Your absence from duty for a few days is authorized, as the Department is sure you will make proper provision for supervision at the Institute.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell Ti-Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. H. W. Snell, B. A.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Res. School,\nBrantford, Ont.\nThe Mohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont., Dec. 16-29.\n\nTo the Parents & Guardians of our pupils,\n\nDear Friends,\n\nI am sure you will be interested to hear of some of the doings of the Institute during the past term.\n\nBut first let me say how much I appreciate the co-operation of many of the parents in encouraging the children to work hard and interest in their studies. Parents thus add much to the smooth running of the school and often save the school the trouble which must follow heedless.\n\nThere are at present 37 pupils in the School, the largest attendance I believe in our history. There are 18 boys and 19 girls. There is some possibility that the dormitory may be enlarged to accommodate the boys' dormitory, giving room for about 30 more.\n\nThe conduct of the pupils shows a distinct improvement, and I am convinced favorably with that of any other school for boys and girls. The Public School Inspector has visited several times and has been pleased with the school's condition.\n\nThe work of the teachers is very good, and I am sure they will be pleased to hear from you at any time. I shall be especially glad to have your report to me regarding your children's progress. We want them to be happy and contented here and if I know I can often remove a difficulty or show them how to improve the conditions. Of course, children often make mistakes and sometimes you know, but I hope I see that they are not repeated.\n\nI am glad to hear anything you may have to say in praise of our efforts to give the children a good education and to develop in them good, honest Christian character.\n\nWishing you a Very Happy Christmas and a Happy New Year,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nfor W.A.work among Indians in the Diocese together with a com-\nmitted off their executive visited the school and are recom-\nmending that the Branches contribute to the support of the Institute.\nI am hoping something may come from that source to help get\non our feet.\n\nFARM AND GARDEN. The implement shed on the foundation of the old\nbarn was completed today and makes a welcome addition to our equi-\npment. It was built almost entirely from the material of the old\nbarn and makes a good appearance. I am glad to say that we were\nable to keep within the estimate of $1800.00 in cost of building.\nThe cattle are doing particularly well. Each month has shown a\nsubstantial increase in production. Oct. 228.52, Oct. 270.05,\nDec. 396.41. The garden sales were mostly from the greenhouses &\nwere over $500.00. The old horse I mentioned in my last report\nwas sold for a small sum. All our horses now are first-class but\nI should like to sell some of them.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to submit herein a report of the activities of this Institution for the quarter ending Dec. 31, 1929.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nCHURCH. There have been no services held in His Majesty's Chapel owing to there being no way of heating the building. However, there have been regular services at the Institute, morning and evening prayer being held each Sunday by the principal, and chapel services were held each evening.\n\nDISCIPLINE. There cannot be said to be an improvement in the general conduct of the pupils. Misconduct notably decreased, probably owing to the unfavourable season of the year. Five boys left one morning, Nov. 5, but three of them returned of their own accord the same evening while the rest were brought back the same night. One new girl tried to run away but was brought back by the other girls. Cooperation for this sort of part of the pupils is very gratifying. The boys have not been disrespectful, and although there is a petty thieving than in last quarter, we still believe, to our satisfaction, strong public feeling against such offenses among the pupils.\n\nHEALTH. The health of the pupils has been excellent. There has not been a single case of sickness. Twenty-two of the girls who were diagnosed as having diseased tonsils have been taken to Lady Elgin Hospital for consultation. Phoebe Clausen, who prior to her operation had discharging glands, has been greatly improved since her operation. There are still several pupils who need similar treatment.\n\nI do not speak too highly of the hearty co-operation of the staff. I only hope I may be able to retain them all indefinitely. There have been no changes during the quarter. It is worth mentioning that I have not required the services of a mechanic from the city once during the quarter. Mr. Jones has been able to make all necessary repairs. This means considerable savings to us.\n\nFOOTBALL. The Institute is still well to the fore in sports. In a team contest between Brantford and Osgoode, the first two to finish in a five-mile race were Ingram Lickers and Miller Lewis, both pupils of the Institute. These two boys also won good places at the New Year's Meet at Hamilton. Norman was second in the three-mile race, Junior, being beaten by a step only by the champion mile runner. For the first time in many years, the open ten-mile. Other boys also ran well in both these events.\n\nA very enjoyable Christmas was spent by all. The festivities included a Christmas concert which would have done credit to any group of children, a Christmas tree on Christmas Eve, a comedy and a dance put on by friends from the city, as well as sleigh rides for the girls and skating parties for the boys. One result of the skating parties was that all the children were treated to a rabbit dinner on New Year's Day.\n\nI am glad to report too, that, for the first time in its history, I believe, the Church is taking an interest in the Institute. We have had a few visits, and Christmas presents candy store with some quilts and clothing. Our Circle W.A., or Grace Church here came down with 14 woollen blankets for pupils' beds. The Secretary\nOttawa, January 15, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge, with thanks, your report of the 7th instant on the activities at the Mohawk Institute for the December quarter. This report has been read with interest, and I beg to state the department is pleased with the generally improved conditions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\n[Signature]\nRev. H. W. Gaell, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nIf the Department will make an offer to the Company in accordance with the above, such offer will be submitted for the approval of H.M. Charity Commissioners without delay.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nErnest Matthews\n\nGovernor.\n26 Bloomsbury Square,\nLondon, W.C.1.\n\n14th January, 1929.\n\nDuncan Scott, Esq., D. Litt.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nMohawk Institute\n\nReferring to your letter of July 31st last, I am authorised by the Court of the Company to submit to you the following proposals.\n\nThe New England Company are willing to ask H.M. Charity Commissioners to sanction the sale of their Mohawk Institute property to the Indian Department of the Government of Canada for the sum of \u00a39,000 (nine thousand pounds), subject to certain conditions as follows:\n\nFor so long as the Institute is continued as an educational establishment the Company covenant to pay an adequate sum as stipend either to a resident Principal ordained in the Church of England or to a non-resident Principal ordained in the Church of England. For so long as the Institute is continued as an educational establishment the Department shall covenant to train the pupils in the teachings and doctrines of the Church of England. The Court of the Company, however anxious they may be to provide for the continuance of that religious education which is the main object of their Trusts, do not feel that they would be justified in attempting to bind the Department to continue the Mohawk Institute as a school should it be desired to convert it to any other use.\n\nAs regards the actual sale, the Company are prepared to accept similar terms of payment to those agreed in the case of St. George's School, Lytton, viz., the payment to be spread over a period of years bearing interest at 5% per annum on such of the purchase money as is unpaid. The existing lease would ipso facto be determined.\nJanuary 30, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Matthews:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to a proposal to sell the Mohawk Institute to the Department. While I am glad to hear from the Company in this connection, I regret that the Department is not in a position at present to make an offer. I wish to give the matter careful consideration and to discuss it with the Honourable Mr. Stewart. I am not sure that he would be justified in asking Parliament for an Appropriation for the purpose for the next year or two, as we have many pressing claims.\n\nI presume the Company's offer to pay the stipend of the Principal is in addition to the regular \u00a31,000 per annum, which is payable under the current arrangement.\n\nI am glad to state that, this year, the Department hopes to complete the top storey on the boys' side and to take in twenty more pupils. The Reverend Mr. Small, the new incumbent, has had a very auspicious winter season and I am hopeful time will prove that we have been very fortunate in securing his services. Next year, if an item can be provided in the Estimates, I propose to complete the rear wing by the addition of a chapel, etc.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

You might discuss this with Hilton Hill and the Indian Council and any of the old-timers, with a view to learning the names and occupations of distinguished graduates. There is no intention of limiting the successful graduates to only those who have made a mark in the professional world. Any first class farmers on the reserve or artisans should be named. The approximate year of their graduation would be a great help also.\n\nIf this could be attended to at an early date, the Department would be grateful. It is proposed to send a copy of the first draft, with brief history, to the New England Company for their comments and then to use the amended story in connection with the Centenary celebration. It is also proposed to incorporate the writing in the next year's Annual Report, as the Mohawk Institute is the first residential school to complete 100 years of continuous service.\n\nI am writing direct to Mrs. Rogers and to Miss Hardy, so you do not need to canvass these sources of information.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

They are temporarily without a minister. They have applied to the United Church but cannot be supplied for some time. In the meantime, they would like me to take charge. As there is only one service a Sunday afternoon, I thought it would be only a neighbourly act to accede to their request. Further it should contribute something to the feeling of goodwill toward the Institute among a very fine type of people in the community. However, as it may possibly last for some little time, I thought I should report the matter for your approval.\n\nI may say the Farrindons are an Independent congregation here in the city, of which the late Hon. Mr. Patterson was one of many outstanding members. They are few in numbers but very influential. In the old days they did their own preaching but the younger men have not kept up the tradition completely, hence the desire for someone to help out in this way.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, March 7, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the request that you conduct one service a week at the Farrington Church.

It was not in the mind of the Court that they should definitely bind themselves to provide the whole amount of their present grant in addition to the stipend of the ordained Principal or Chaplain.\n\nYou will realise that this decision leaves the Company in a freer position to aid in religious education in other parts of the dominion as occasion may arise.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGovernor.\nCurtis Grove from Muncey Reserve\u2014Banned Entry or Exit.\n\nAttended Pinegrove College for a year\u2014graduated 1922\u201430.

Sometime before 1872 when Mr. R. Ashton became the Principal, a wing at the back of the building had been added, where the Sr. School, the pupils' dining hall and the boys' dormitory were located. In 1886 a wing for the Principal's residence was added to the north-west of the main building. In 1891 a larger wing was added to the south-east of the main building, where the Jr. School, the girls' dormitories and the girls' play-room were located.\n\nThis whole building was destroyed by fire in April 19, 1903. It was set on fire by the following boys: Isaiah Antone, Roy Wilson, Jesse Debo and Frank Winnie. On May 7, they also set fire to the barns, and on June 19 the boys' play house. Numbers of the pupils were reduced, leaving about 40 boys and 45 girls. Temporary buildings were put up on the place for the accommodation of the boys. But the building which had been the Ladies College in the city was rented for the girls where they and some of the staff lived for two months. Then they were removed to the old Parsonage, where temporary additions had been made.\n\nMembers of the New England Company, Mr. Wigram and Lord Stamford visited the place and decided that the new Institution should be built on the old site. The new building was completed in the autumn of 1904 and we moved into it on Oct. 20, 1904. To the rear of this building a large wing was added in 1922, in which the pupils' dining hall, the kitchen, the laundry and boiler room are located.\n\nAll these buildings were put up by the New England Co. with the exception of the wing erected in 1922.\nNotes of Interest\n\nIn 1912, the track events competed in a half day doings and military review in Brentford, or J.J. L.\n\nDominion Day. They carried off the prize of the day.\n\nE. G. Taylor, who is now the current editor.\n\nIn 1913, the track events were carried out by the District of O. T. These were held at the\n\nSeveral hours of I. A. and I. B. races were run.\n\nThe race in Brentford on Thanksgiving Day, 1909, he also\n\ncame first in challenge race with record of 800 feet.\n\nagainst champion runner of Ontario\n\ncame second in New York (P.M.S.A.) in New York's\n\nrace. He also led for several races.\n\nHe won the race in New York City in the challenge\n\nrace event next to record. Robert Smith held up the\n\nD. C. L. and won the race.\nNOTES OF INTEREST\n\nThe Prince of Wales made his visit to \"His Majesty's Chapel of the Mohawk\" on Oct. 20, 1919. He was attended by Major Gordon Smith and received at the church by Mrs. A. M. Boyce, the Principal of the Mohawk Institute. The boys of the school acted as guard of honour and the girls curtsied as His Royal Highness walked between the lines.\n\nHe entered the Church where he signed the Queen Anne Bible and where the missionaries to the Indians\u2014Reverend Strong, Lee, Paget and Filkey\u2014were presented to him. Captain Joseph Brant's tomb was then pointed out to him, by the side of which he planted a pine tree. Then the pupils sang two Indian Pomes in front of the church.\n\nSometime after this visit he sent an autographed photograph of himself to the Mohawk Institute, which now hangs in the front hall of the Institution.\n\nIn Oct. 1917 the Duke of Devonshire, who was Governor General at the time and Professor Graham Bell, the inventor of the Telephone paid a visit to the Mohawk Church, where they were shown the Queen Bible and Communion Silver\u2014the pupils of the Mohawk Institution were present at the time.\n\nThe Duke of Connaught made a visit to the Mohawk Institute the day he visited the Six Nations at Cawkerk. Lord and Lady Willingdon visited the Mohawk Church on the day they opened the Lady Willingdon Hospital. Pupils of the Mohawk Institute were present at the church.\n\n[Signature]\n\nnot used in detail\nThe following signatures are on the side of the Governor General page:\n\nH.

Goldsmith has been coming weekly to train the children in singing and there is a noticeable improvement in the musical parts of the services. Our thanks are due to Mr. Goldsmith for his labour of love.\n\nDISCIPLINE. The conduct of the pupils as a whole has been good. A few have been in need of punishment, some of them several times, but the great body of them have behaved extremely well. The warm weather brought three or four cases of groups abounding but only one group were away over night. We had one case of a number of girls stealing food and one case of a boy stealing from another boy. He was dealt with by the boys themselves after trial and I doubt if he will repeat the offense. Several boys had to be punished for having data-pulse after being forbidden and the practice seems to be, at least, in abeyance.\n\nHEALTH. The pupils have been in excellent health excepting two little girls who have swollen glands in the neck. It is hoped they will improve as soon as they can be taken to Lady Willington Hospital for tonsillectomy.\n\nStaff. There have been no changes in the staff and all are co-operating splendidly.\n\nFARM AND GARDEN. The stock all looks exceedingly well. We have had a request from the Provincial Agriculture Department for some young brood sows which are to be delivered in the near future. This very gratifying and we hope will open up a new market for a number of our pure bred hogs. Prices have been good and we have had good returns from our hogs this quarter.\n\nNOTES. The principal has been asked to address several organizations on the work of the Institute. He has spoken to the Rotary Clubs of Brantford and of Preston, to several church organizations in the city to the Ladies' Club, the I.O.D.E., and also to a Men's organization in Windsor. Many of these have made or are to make contributions of books for the Children's library. They are also given to understand something of what the Department is doing for their Indian wards and how worthwhile it is.\n\nMyles Isaac again brought honour to the school when he stood second in a half-mile race at the Hamilton meet in competition with 42 entrants.\n\nThe Public School Inspector visited and spoke favourably of the work being done.\n\nA number of most enjoyable concerts were given for the children by city artists. They were also the guests on two occasions of the manager of the Temple Theatre.\n\nA corps of Girl Guides has been organized under the leadership of Miss McCurney, the junior teacher and a keen interest is manifest. It should be a strong force for character building.\nOttawa, April 23, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your report of the 4th instant on the activities at the Mohawk Institute for the quarter ended March 31st, last.

Would it be possible to add a short paragraph on Page 6 and bring the History completely up to date by including the appointment of Mr. Snell, after the statement that Miss A.M.

C. 1,\nEngland.\nTHE MOHAWK INSTITUTE\n\nBy Rev. H. W. Snell, B.A.\n\nThe City of Brantford may well be proud of its educational institutions. The oldest of them, and by no means the least valuable, is the Mohawk Institute. The idea of an institution goes back to the beginning of things in Brantford. A day school was carried there as early as 1828. But it was in 1841 that we find the first mention of the residential school, when the Mohawk Institute was opened with an attendance of ten boys. The object of the New England Company, who founded the institute, was to give the Indian boys a good education, to teach them to become useful members of society, and to provide them with good Christian habits and building. This has been kept steadily before the public ever since.\n\nThe Institute had become so much appreciated that work was extended to take in both boys and girls. It was built by the Company, and this, with a large endowment, insured the pupils until it was burned by fire in 1875. The present school was built on the same site, and a wing for the pupils' dining-room, kitchen, laundry, and new heating plant were added in 1922. Additional space is to be added this year and a Chapel in the new Institute is also provided with excellent barns, the latter built in 1877 at a cost of over $30,000. As garden space is limited, two small houses have been built and land has been bought for a third. A small revenue is derived from this source from sales of the market garden.\n\nAt present 134 pupils in residence; 78 boys and 56 girls are still ages, from 6 years to 18 years of age. Eight of them reside at the school while attending the Collegiate Institute in the city.\n\nThe pupils are drawn mainly from the Six Nations, but there are a number from Moraviantown, near Highgate; from Muncey Reserve, near Lorneville; from the Bay of Quinte Reserve, near Belleville; and from Caughnawaga, near Montreal.\n\nIn order to be admitted, a child must be an unenfranchised Indian. If he is of the Six Nations, the Principal has authority to accept him, but all other tribes and children not on the list must have their applications approved by the Department of Indian Affairs. The first claim upon the school is felt to be that of those who have no parents or guardians. These are probably as few as these. After that pupils are admitted in order of applications as a rule. The financial position of the parents, unless they are very poor, is not taken into consideration. The parents of several of the children are quite well off.\n\nThe course taught is partly academic, and partly industrial, the aim being to give them a good practical equipment for making a good living. The scholars are divided into two divisions, \"A\" and \"B\". Each division is in school for one-half of each day, which is divided into periods of the house, farm, and garden. For purposes of instruction and management there is a staff of twelve besides the Principal. The two school teachers are North American. One of them, Miss Harlow, is herself an Indian, who received her education at the Institute, and has almost completed her second year of teaching. She has a thorough knowledge of the pupils and her own language.\n\nThe Indians are divided into two classes. The other classes are: Nurse, Sewing Teacher, two Dietitians, both of whom are graduates of Macdonald Institute, Guelph the other of an English school, the Boys' Master and Mechanic, Farmer Teamster and Gardener. All the officers are employed within the pupils in their respective departments of work. In order to make the students realize how thoroughly practically trained our department to another. One half chance each week. This gives each pupil two weeks at each kind of work at a time. In the course of a number of years they have been many times through the whole round, but at no time are they kept at one thing until it becomes monotonous. The work is light, as many hands make light work, and the exercise is such that each miler has to milk and clean the cows, and his task is done.\n\nIn temperament and disposition the Indian differs very little, if any, from the white. In school they progress almost as rapidly as the whites in the Public School in spite of the fact that they attend school only half of the day.\n\nFinally, every effort is made to develop good Christian character among the pupils. It is said that the attempt has been successful. The graduates may be found taking up the old occupation of farming, some are leading farmers on the Reserve, others are in business or industry, while many are making good wives and mothers. While it would be impossible to over estimate the good that has been rendered these hundred years to the Indians and, through them, to the whole community.\n66 ERIE AVENUE\n\nWhere you will find a complete line of\n\nNew 1930 C.C.M.

Snell,\nPrincipal, The Mohawk Institute,\n\nDear Mr. Snell,\n\nI beg to return Mr. Ferrier's brochure on the Mohawk Institute, which both Mr. Hill and I have read with great interest and appreciation.\n\nMr. Hill asks me to point out an error in the second para of page 1., in which Captain Joseph Brant (Thayendanega) is described as \"Chief\".\n\nThis he was not as the name Thayendanega is not one of the perpetual names, such as Deskeheh, and no fighting man could be appointed as a Chief.\n\nHe does not appear ever to have been even a \"Pine Tree Chief\" but, owing no doubt, to his influence, the fact that he was intimately connected with Sir William Johnson, and that he was deputed by the nation to visit Great Britain as their representative, he has been popularly accepted not only as a chief, but frequently as THE chief of the Six Nations.\n\nYours truly,\n\nLt Col G.F. Morgan.\n\nSuperintendent Six Nations.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAttention Mr. Ferrier,\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI have received from Col. Morgan the sketch of the Mohawk Institute which I had referred to him and Mr. Hill as requested in your letter No. 32-0-1 May 14-30.\n\nI am enclosing his letter with Mr. Hill's comments which came rather as a surprise to me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHorace W. Snell,\nPrincipal.\nAugust 2-30.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have pleasure in submitting the following report of the Mohawk Institute for the quarter ending June 30-30. The report has been delayed owing to the fact that I have been ill from the effects of trench mouth ever since returning from my holiday two weeks ago.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCHURCH. Services have been held regularly in His Majesty's Chapel ever since the weather has been warm enough. We were fortunate in having as special preachers several distinguished visitors to the city among whom were Reverend Canon Gower-Rees of Montreal, Ven.R.F.Fleming, Archdeacon of the Arctic, and Reverend Mr. Sampson a young Indian graduate from Trinity University who has been recently ordained. A Confirmation class was presented to Archbishop Williams for Confirmation in the Chapel on the Sunday after Ascension Day. There were 21 girls and 18 boys and the Archbishop commented very favourably on the class. Chapel services are held daily in the senior school room.\n\nDISCIPLINE.\n\nI am very pleased with the improvement in the conduct of the pupils this quarter. There was one instance of two boys climbing to the girls dormitory but the girls gave the alarm immediately and the boys were scared off. I regret to say that the leader was a Collegiate boy who should have been an example to the rest as he comes from a good home. Both boys absconded before I had completed the investigation. The reaction of the pupils, both boys and girls was gratifying. Neither of the boys will be returning after holidays. Another encouraging feature has been the marked decrease in corporal punishment and the readiness of the pupils to respond to the appeal to their sense of right and fairness. Altogether I am very much encouraged as to the conduct of the pupils.\n\nHEALTH.\n\nThe health of the pupils has been excellent. We have been free from epidemics and have not had a single case of a pupil being ill enough to be sent to the sick room.\n\nSTAFF.\n\nI cannot speak too highly of the staff. We are having to make one change. Miss Johnston the junior dietitian has to go home to help her mother. Miss Lydia Smith is succeeding her at the same salary. She is an older woman and should be a very efficient officer.\n\nNOTES.\n\nThe buildings and grounds present a very pleasing appearance and are the admiration of the many visitors. All the interior of the building except the dormitories has been painted or varnished and almost all of the exterior has been painted so that the building looks very spick and span. All the work has been done by the pupils and staff.\n\nA difficulty will present itself when the school reopens with more pupils. The senior school room is crowded at chapel now. It will be exceedingly difficult to find room anywhere for the larger number which we shall have next term. I hope, therefore, that the new Chapel will not be delayed a moment longer than necessary.\n\nFARM AND GARDEN. Everything looks well and with a favourable season we should have good returns. The reduction in staff here has not done any harm.\nREV. R. ASHTON\nPASSES AWAY AT\nCRIMSBY HOME\n\nFor a Lengthy Period He\nWas Head of the Mohawk\nInstitute\n\nHis Interests Included\nMany Widespread\nActivities\n\nThere passed away yesterday at the\nhome of his son, Major A. Neles Ashton,\nGrimsby, Rev. Robert Ashton, who died\nafter a long illness. He was head of the\nMohawk Institute from October, 1872\nuntil 1910, and incumbent of \"Saint\nPeter His Majesty's Church\" at the\nMohawk Institute, formerly known as\nthe \"Mohawk Church,\" from 1865 to\n1915. Born in England January 13,\n1845, he came to Canada with Mrs. Charles\nAshton, he had attained the ripe age\nof 87 years. In his early life he was\nconnected with the staff of the Mid-\ndlessex Industrial school, and came to\nCanada where still quite a young man\nhe assumed charge of the Mohawk In-\nstitute, then under the auspices of the\nNew England Company, and he\nremained there representing in Canada\nuntil 1910.\n\nHe speedily won most effectively\nconfidence in the position and for\nnearly half a century discharged the\nmany difficult duties of the post with\nability and zeal, devoting his super-\nvision over the education of pupils of\nboth sexes, in the school rooms, and\nin the various departments of the\ninstitution, manifested great skill, and his\nadvice was frequently sought and his\njudgment highly valued by the leading\ninstitutions, not alone in Canada but\nalso in the United States. His love\nfor nature was evident in his constant\ncare of the grounds so that they became\none of the local show places, and the\nprovision of a large greenhouse for\ngrowing flowers was also another most\nsuccessful hobby. Indeed, his all round\nmanagement of the institution was\nsuch as to secure a handsome annual\nrevenue, applied to the expenses of\nthe school, and thus enabled him to\nsecure the wants of the pupils. He took holy\norders on June 11, 1901, and his ser-\nmons, delivered in the Mohawk\nchurch, were models of reason-\nable brevity and sound reasoning.\n\nMr. Ashton was a many-sided man\nexceptionally well informed upon a\ngreat variety of subjects, and the\npossession of a most logical mind. The\nmilitary life made a strong appeal\nto him, and as chaplain with rank of\nMajor and member of the officer's\nclub, he has always been interested\nin participation in the welfare of\nthe British Empire.\n\nHis favorite sport was the grand\nold game of cricket, and many years\nago he had a playing field and ex-\ncellently equipped cricket club on\nthe Mohawk Institute property, fac-\ning the canal. This was done entire-\nly at his own expense and was his\nown personal cricket club, and the\nclub of which he was the honorary\npresident. During the Wednesday after-\nnoon matches for many years and\nconsiderable period, he took a very\ndeep interest and frequently acted\nas umpire; his profound knowledge\nof the sport rendering him a most\nefficient official in this respect. He\nalways said that cricket was a game\nhe enjoyed and that the numerous visi-\ntors at these events were most hon-\nestly treated. It may be said too\nmuch to say that it was through\nthis kindly concern that the sport\nwas so much more retained in\nBrantford at a period when other\nmore modern games threatened to\nengulf it. He was also one of the\nearly officers of the Brantford\nMasonic lodge and enjoyed his very\ndeep interest. He was a member and\nPast Master of Masonic Lodge No.\n12 and A.M., District Deputy Grand\nMaster for a long period, and had\noccupied the chair of Provincial\nArch Masonry. Meteorological obser-\nvations likewise constituted another\nof his interests, and for a lengthy\nperiod he had charge of the Brant-\nford station, making the records\nwhen the observations were always\ncharacterized as something of unusual\naccuracy.\n\nTo the numerous visitors at the In-\nstitute his great knowledge of In-\ndian lore was also an attrac-\ntive, and he had the pleasure of\nbeing a host to members of the\nBritish Royal family and other\nnotable people whose signa-\ntures were always secured in the\nfamous guest book, now visible,\npreserved to the Six Nations in\nBrantford.\n\nHe was British to the core, and\nto his memory in the Empire\nwas a very dear individual.\n\nMrs. Ashton predeceased him some\nyears ago and two sons and three\ndaughters survive: Lieut.-Colonel\nR. C. Ashton, Toronto; Major Ash-\nton, Grimsby; Mrs. Sydney Rogers,\nMohawk Road; Mrs. F. C. Con-\nshutt, Brantford, and Mrs. C. D.\nCocks, Virginia; also one sister, Miss\nEmma Ashton.\n\nThe funeral will take place on\nSaturday afternoon from the home\nof Major A. Rogers, Mohawk road,\non Mohawk church.\nIncluded in the above disbursements and also in the Debit Balance is a payment made of $775.00 for insurance. This insurance has always been paid by the New England Company and the accounts have been forwarded by the Reverend Principal to them but he has not yet received reimbursement.\n\nIt should, also, be noted that the earnings for the quarter ended December 31st, 1930, amounting to $5,459.20, were not forwarded until January 8th, 1931, and are, therefore, not included in the above statement of receipts to December 31st, 1930.\n\nFINANCIAL PROSPECTS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 1931:\n\nOut of the proceeds of the December quarter earnings, viz., $5,459.20, which, as noted above, reached the school on January 8th, 1931, the overdraft at the bank and the outstanding cheques were paid, leaving $2,035.29 to the credit of the school. By the end of January, payment of current accounts had reduced this to practically zero. Consequently, it will be necessary to have another overdraft for the months of February and March, 1931. The future financial condition of the school was discussed very carefully with the Principal and he feels hopeful that, by the end of the current calendar year, there will be a credit balance. This feeling is based on the following estimate:\n\nPossible Receipts for 1931:\n\n140 pupils @ $160 per capita - $22,400.00\n\nReceipts from Farm - estimated at same amount as for calendar year 1930 - 7,917.28\n\nTOTAL PROBABLE RECEIPTS ...........................................$31,317.28\n\nDisbursements for 1931 - estimated not to exceed those for the calendar year 1930 - $30,190.31\n\nThe insurance policies were checked and I enclose statement No. 1 giving detailed information regarding them.\n\nThe policies are kept in the safe at the Mohawk Institute and all policies are endorsed as follows:\n\n\"Loss, if any, payable to Department of Indian Affairs In Trust for New England Company\".\n\n[Signature]\n\nPhilip [signature]\n| POLICY NO. | AMOUNT | PREMIUM | COMPANY | AGENT | EXPERTS | COVERED |\n|------------|--------|---------|---------|-------|---------|---------|\n| 3303669    | $35,000 | $518.00 | Union Assurance Co. of Quesnel | W.

The charge is at the rate of $2.40 per hundred pounds, which is the same as allowed if sold. This is approximately six cents a quart.\n\nFINANCES:-\n\nA careful check was made of the finances since the time Rev. Mr. Snell took charge, viz., August 1st, 1929, to December 31st, 1930. The Bank Account is in the Bank of Montreal and stands in the name of the \"Mohawk Institute - Brantford\". All cheques are signed \"Mohawk Institute - Horace W. Snell, Principal\". Vouchers for all expenditures made during this period were produced by the Principal and were checked with the quarterly financial statements submitted to the Department.\n\nIn addition, I was given the cancelled cheques and these were all checked with the Bank Account.

All this hose requires immediate replacement.\n\nI was informed by the Principal that they have not had fire drill since he took charge. He stated that, before fire drill could be adequately taught, it would be necessary to secure six alarm bells - one in each of the two classrooms and one in each of the four dormitories. Electric bells are not required. The Principal stated that suitable bells could be secured quite reasonably.\n\nBARNs AND OUTBUILDINGS:\n\nI visited the barns and outbuildings and found the machinery had been well stored for the winter and that all the live stock was in good shape. The following is an inventory of the live stock:\n\nHorses:- 3 colts and 10 aged.\nCattle:- 1 aged bull; 1 yearling bull;\n22 Holstein cows; 9 heifers; 4 calves.\nHogs:- 1 boar; 9 sows; 50 shoats.\n\nThe Principal informed me that the cows in the herd are all registered and that they have been recently tested.

The doors opening on the fire escapes have been changed to open out and have been equipped with panic bolts.\n\n(b) Pressure system has been installed to make it possible to use soft water in all hot water taps.\n\n(c) New toilets and slop basin as well as new cement floor in junior girls' toilet room.\n\n(d) New lockers in boys' playroom and in sewing room, also new tables and benches in diningroom to accommodate extra boys.\n\n(e) Extensive repairs to the existing plumbing which have resulted in school being much warmer.\n\n(f) The whole of the exterior painted by the boys and the whole of the interior, with the exception of the dormitories.\nMOHAWK INSTITUTE:\n\nPupilage increased to 150 from April 1st, 1931, and Rev.

They are both in the hospital there and I don't expect they will be able to be moved for quite a few days.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSeptember 10, 1932.\n\nDear Miss Snell:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, informing the Department of the regrettable automobile accident incurred by your father and mother, necessitating their being placed in hospital.\n\nIt is hoped that both will very soon return to the school, fully recovered, and that your father will be able to resume his duties. In the meantime, no doubt, arrangements will be made by the staff for proper supervision of the school activities. The Department will be pleased to hear of their early and full recovery, and expresses sympathy in their misfortune.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nMiss Owen Snell,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nOttawa, September 16th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nFrom information received from Inspector McGeehan, the Department understands that the injuries suffered by Rev. H.W. Snell, Principal of the Mohawk Institute, will require his remaining in hospital for a longer period than was at first anticipated. Please let me know, at once, who is in charge of the Mohawk Institute during the enforced absence of Reverend Mr. Snell.\n\nYou should, of course, give the management of the school every possible assistance while the Principal is absent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nLt. Col. C. E. Morgan,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nSeptember 17th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th inst., with reference to Rev. H. W. Snell and the Mohawk Institute.\n\nIn reply, I would say that Mrs. Smith, the Assistant Matron, and Miss Hardy, the Senior Teacher are in charge of the Mohawk Institute during the enforced absence of Mr. Snell. The Assistant Matron advised me this morning that everything was going along nicely. They expect that Rev. Mr. Snell will return to the Institute this weekend as he can be moved from the hospital at Orangeville. Mrs. Snell will have to remain at the Hospital a week or more before she can be moved. Mr. Snell was not injured as seriously as was at first thought. Mrs. Snell was injured the more seriously of the two.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt. Col. C. W. Morgan,\nSupt.

I cannot speak too highly of the staff.\n\nMrs. Snell is still in the hospital. She is progressing favorably and will be out in a week or ten days.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nSeptember 29, 1932\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith the conviction of Wilson Secord on a charge of theft which I am reporting to you in a letter of even date, I wish to say further that this last escapade began with the breaking into the room of Mr. Jones, boys' master, and stealing $30.00 in cash and various articles of jewelry, some of which were valued on account of age.\n\nI have felt that it was a pity that Mr. Jones should be called upon to lose this amount of money, and would, therefore, appreciate authority from you to reimburse Mr. Jones to the extent of $30.00 from the funds of the school.\n\nTrusting that this will be found satisfactory to you, I am\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nHorace W. Smith\nPrincipal\nOttawa, October 5, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, regarding Wilson Secord, a pupil of the Mohawk Institute, who has been convicted for theft and committed to the Mimico Industrial School. It is noted that this boy stole a sum of money from a member of the staff of your school. I regret that the Department will be unable to authorize you to refund the amount from School Funds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. H. W. Snell, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nOttawa, March 20th, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nA review of the quarterly financial statements from the Mohawk Institute shows that no reduction has been made in the salaries of the staff.\n\nAs you are aware, the Salary Deduction Act passed last year provided for a 10% cut in all salaries. The Department understands that this deduction was put into effect in the residential schools in other parts of Canada.\n\nIn order to meet the requirements of the Act mentioned above, the Department is obliged to direct that, from April 1st, next, the salary of each member of the staff of the Mohawk Institute be reduced by 10%.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. H. W. Snell, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nOttawa, September 21, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department understands that you intend making a change in a member of the staff of the Mohawk Institute. Please let me know exactly what member of the staff is being changed. You should detail fully the duties of this position and state the approximate age of the person whom you require to replace this staff member.\n\nNo doubt, you have been considering numerous applicants for this position and, in this connection, I would point out that no appointments should be made until you have advised the Department of the names of the applicants, their qualifications and which one you recommend should be engaged. In replying, I should appreciate if you would state if you have considered Mr. P. D. Vahcy, of Exeter, Ont., who is a graduate of the Guelph Agricultural College, a specialist in poultry, served overseas and who is stated to possess special qualifications for a position on the staff of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. H. W. Snell, B. A.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nSeptember 25, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter, no. 32-0-1, 21st instant, I have made two changes in the staff, Mr. and Mrs. Jones having left on September 1st. I have filled their places, as I have always done before, with selections of officers whom I knew to be particularly adapted for the work. Mr. Jones' position has been filled by Mr. C. R. Pengelley, formerly a teacher of manual training in the Brantford schools and peculiarly adapted for the position of boys' master and mechanic at the Institute. I received an application from Mr. P. D. Vahey, whom you mentioned, but the position was already filled. His training in the care of poultry would not be particularly important in the position which I had to fill. Mrs. Jones' position of Senior dietitian has been taken by Miss Turner, who was Junior dietitian, and the latter position is now held by Mrs. E. Pettigrew who is filling the place admirably.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHORACE W. SKELL,\nPrincipal.\nTo carry out the above repairs, lumber and paint to the value of approximately $300 to $350 would be necessary. All labour, with the exception of the plasterer, could be supplied by the school staff. I would recommend that the Principal be authorized to proceed with the above funds for the purpose being taken from Savings Account No. 457, in which account there is a balance at the present time of $4,863.92.\n\nMr. Henderson, the farmer, has been an employee of the school for the past fifteen years. He occupies a house on the school property, but this house has no bathroom, although it is piped with city water. Mr. Henderson is reported to have always given good service and I would recommend that a small addition be made to the house to provide bathroom facilities. This could be done for approximately $250. The majority of the work would be performed by the school staff. The necessary expenditure in this connection would, also, be a fair charge against Account No. 457.\n\nFarm Machinery:\n\nThe farm machinery is properly stored when not in use and no new machinery has been purchased since Mr. Small took charge of this school some four years ago. It will be necessary, however, to purchase, next spring, a combination drill and fertilizer. This can be secured from Cockshutt's at an approximate cost of $140.\n\nInsurance:\n\nThe following insurance is carried, premiums for which are paid direct to the Principal by the New England Company:\n\n| Amount | Expires     | Cover                                      |\n|--------|------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| $35,000| Feb. 19, 1936 | Main building and contents.                |\n| $15,000| Feb. 19, 1936 | Main building.                            |\n| $2,250 | Mar. 28, 1935 | Greenhouse and contents.                   |\n| $18,480| Dec. 1, 1935 | Outbuildings, contents, vehicles, live stock.

Mr. Snell should further be informed that, unless there is a decided improvement, Mr. Pengelley's services should be dispensed with. I also informed Mr. Snell that I did not consider the boys should be allowed to go into town looking for odd jobs such as cutting grass, etc. There is no necessity for them doing this and it only leads to complaints from residents of Brantford. If you concur in my instructions in this regard, this matter might also be embodied in the letter sent to Mr. Snell.\n\nFire Protection:\n\nThe school appears to have adequate fire protection, particularly when it is noted that it is connected with the water works system of the City of Brantford, which ensures an ample supply of water in case of fire and, also, the assistance of the Brantford Fire Department.\n\nThe platforms at the bottom of two of the fire escapes require repairs. This matter is mentioned under the heading \"Repairs\".\n\nLivestock:\n\nThe cows are registered Holsteins and are regularly tested. Just previous to my visit, it was discovered that they were suffering from \"Barn's disease\". As a result, it was necessary to dispose of 11 cows. This leaves only 7 milkers, which is not enough for the Mohawk School. The Principal will secure approximately $275.00 for the 11 cows sold and he intends to purchase, at least, 4 fresh cows to add to the herd.\n\nThe school has 11 horses and a large number of pigs.\n\nFinances:\n\nA careful check was made of the finances from the date of the last inspection, in May, 1933, to the end of June, 1934. The Bank Account is in the Bank of Montreal and stands in the name of \"The Mohawk Institute - Brantford\". All cheques are signed \"Mohawk Institute - Horace W. Snell, Principal.\"\n\nFollowing the last inspection, the Bank of Montreal was informed that no overdraft privileges should be allowed the school. From a review of the Bank Account, I may inform you that our instructions have been strictly complied with.\n\nReceipted accounts for all expenditures made between April 1st, 1933, and June 30th, 1934, were produced by the Principal and checked with the quarterly financial statements that he has submitted to the Department. The cancelled cheques were also checked with the Bank Account. All were in good order and found to be correct.\n\nThe following...\nOctober 13th, 1934.\n\nMr. Smith,\n\nI visited the Mohawk Institute at Brantford on the 2nd and 3rd instant. There were 137 pupils in residence - 70 girls and 67 boys. This means that the school can accommodate about 13 more boys. All the boys who enter institutions far or on the Six Nations Reserve have been placed in the school and, consequently, when visiting other reserves in Western Ontario, I informed the Agents that, if they had any boys who should be placed in a residential school, it would be possible to provide accommodation for them at Mohawk.\n\nThe Staff:\n\nThe Principal is Reverend H. W. Snell, B.A., and he has a staff of eleven (11) persons. As you are no doubt aware, there have been several cases of truancy at this school during the past year and, in addition, I was informed by the Indian Superintendent, Colonel Morgan, that he received complaints from time to time regarding the conduct of the boys. Some people have reported that some of the Mohawk Indians have stolen money from their milk bottles while others state that the boys are allowed to go uptown and they annoy people by asking for permission to do odd jobs and, if they are not engaged, they ask for money.\n\nI discussed all these matters very fully with the Principal and I am inclined to feel that there is some truth in the complaints that have been received. Mr. O. R. Pengelley is in charge of the boys during their leisure time and sleeps in a room close to their dormitory. I am not at all satisfied that he exercises proper discipline over the boys, although Mr. Snell considers Pengelley a very suitable man. However, in looking over the building, I found the boys' wash room in a very dirty condition and Mr. Snell agreed with me that this showed that Mr. Pengelley did not exercise as much supervision as he should.\n\nAs it is undesirable to lock the doors leading to the fire escape, I arranged with Mr. Snell to have a wire attached to these doors leading to an electric bell in Mr. Pengelley's bedroom. If any boy, in future, gets up early and tries to leave the building by the fire escape, the bell will ring in Pengelley's room and action can be taken to have the boy kept in the building.\n\nI would recommend that a reasonably firm letter be sent to Mr. Snell, advising him that the Department is not\nOttawa, October 26, 1934.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nAs you are aware, the Department has experienced considerable concern during the last year in connection with the many cases of truancy at the Mohawk Institute. As a result of Mr. Phelan's recent visit, I am inclined to feel that the supervision of the boys during their leisure time is not as effective as it might be. While Mr. Pengelley may be well qualified along certain lines, it is doubtful if he is capable of exerting the desired influence over the boys. As an instance of this, I may say that Mr. Phelan's report showed that the boys' washroom was allowed to remain in a dirty condition. For the next month or so, you should carefully supervise Mr. Pengelley's work, and, if there is not a decided improvement in the conduct of the boys, the Department considers that it would be in the best interests of the school to dispense with his services.\n\nThe Department also understands that it has been the practice to allow the boys to go into town and look for odd jobs, such as cutting grass, etc. The Department sees no reason for allowing this privilege, and it should be discontinued immediately.\n\nExcept in the case of the older pupils on whom you can place absolute reliance, no pupil should be allowed to go into Brantford without the supervision of some member of the staff. I think you will agree with me that it is necessary for all parties concerned to take every precaution to see that the actions of the boys and girls attending the Mohawk Institute are such as to reflect credit on the school and not be a cause of complaint on the part of residents living close to the school.\n\nI trust that you have already arranged for the installation of the electric bell from the doors leading to the fire escapes to the supervisor's bedroom.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMrs. H. W. Snell, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\nfactory and this has been corroborated by Mr Attwell and others from whom I have enquired. This, I need hardly point out may lead to the outbreak of an epidemic in the school, but the point is, how do these boys get out to go there?\n\nThe entire system needs revising and the man employed by Mr Snell to look after the boys should be replaced.\n\nBoth the day and night conditions are lax and I think that a man should sleep in each dormitory, in a cubicle if necessary to afford him privacy, in the same way as a Corporal sleeps in a military barrack room.\n\nThe boys are all over the town at all hours and it will be hard to get them back to normalcy, but not a boy should be in the city or away from the Institute without the man in charge of the boys knowing exactly where he is, when he left, and when he returns. He should report before leaving, when on permit to leave, and upon his return, whatever hour that may be.\n\nI am in a quandary regarding this as Mr Snell is a good chap and I do not want to make mischief for him but if he won't sack the man who allows all this and put his house in order himself I have no alternative but to bring it to your attention.\n\nThe garbage man says that the boys say that they do not get enough to eat so have to supplement it with garbage candy but this may be taken, \"cum grano salis\", as they certainly do not appear ill fed.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nPersonal.\n\nP. Phelan Esq.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Phelan,\n\nI received the letter from the Dept re transfer of the bible and Q.A. silver too late for the November Council but will bring it up at the Dec meeting. In the meantime I think that they should be put in the vault in this office and Mr Snell be instructed to bring them in and obtain a receipt from me.\n\nI am writing this to you and not to the Dept officially as it is apropos of our talk when you were here and you understand the matter and, also, I hesitate to take up the matter officially although I suppose, as representative of the Dept here, it is my duty to do so.\n\nThere has been no improvement, whatever you may have told Mr Snell to do, in the management of the boys and unless they are more efficiently controlled the Dept will be blamed.\n\nYesterday, at the Cenotaph ceremonial, one of the garbage men, who is an overseas man, said that he thought I ought to know that Institute boys visit the garbage dump early in the mornings, between seven and eight, to collect, and eat, scrap candies and biscuits that have been thrown away by Pattersons.\nOttawa, November 14, 1934.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of another report regarding the boys of the Mohawk Institute. It has been stated that a number of the boys have been seen recently at the garbage dump early in the morning and that they collect and eat scrap candles and biscuits. It is also again reported that the boys are all over the town at all hours.\n\nThe Department hoped that, as a result of official letter of the 26th ultimo, arrangements would have been made before this for the proper supervision of the boys. This matter has now reached a stage where drastic action must be taken by you, or there is likely to be very serious results.\n\nPlease let me know at once if the electric bell from the doors leading to the fire escapes has been installed. The Department also desires a definite statement from you to the effect that the precautions which you have taken have prevented the boys leaving the dormitories between the time they go to bed at night and the regular hour for rising in the morning.\n\nI would also direct your attention to the second and third paragraphs of official letter of October 26th. Please let me know if you have put into effect the instructions given to you in these paragraphs.\n\nI would also direct your attention to the first paragraph of official letter of October 26th, you will note that the Department desired you to carefully supervise Mr. Pascall's conduct before or after the date of our letter. You were also informed that if there was not a decided improvement in the conduct of the boys, the Department considered it would be in the best interests of the school to dispense with his services. If the reports that we have received are correct, it would appear that the supervision of the boys is totally inadequate, and immediate steps must be taken to remedy this condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. E. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. H. W. Snell, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nIt appears to me that anyone interested in the welfare of the boys should at least let me know of any misbehaviour of which they are supposed to be guilty.\n\nI have personally been very pleased with the conduct of the children and especially that there is a very evident attempt to please those in authority. I am quite sure that the conduct and spirit has never been so good since I became Principal. It is, therefore, very surprising to learn that complaints are being registered. I wonder whether there may be some spite involved in it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nNovember 15-34.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am indeed surprised at the reports referred to in your letter No. 32-0-1, 14th inst. It is true that some boys were at the dump. This is a habit that we have been combating for some time and which recurs at intervals even with the most careful watching. The boys referred were detected by us and were thoroughly punished. But it is certainly not a regular occurrence.\n\nAs to the boys being seen at all hours in the city I am certain there is no foundation for the statement. The doors are locked at eight o'clock each night and the boys are all sent to bed at nine o'clock, the juniors at eight immediately after chapel. The dormitories are inspected to see that all are in bed at intervals during the evening. The electric bell with switches controlled by the fire-escape doors was installed immediately after Mr. Phelan visited us and as the bell is in the bedroom of the boys' master, it would be impossible for any boy to leave the building without arousing him. I am inclined to think that any Indian boy seen on the street is from Mohawk Institute and there are many Indians living in the city.\n\nI have made inquiries from several people living near the Institute as to whether our boys ever gave them any trouble and they have all stated that the boys gave them no trouble. One lady remarked that they were likely to be blamed for much that was done by other boys.\n\nThe only times any boys have not been in the dormitory were cases of truancy. In one case the four boys returned voluntarily the next day. In the other we found them near Norwich.\n\nI am glad to report that I am having the fullest cooperation from Mr. Pengelley. He could not give more supervision than he does without leaving undone the mechanical repairs that are part of his duties.\n\nI should be pleased to know who are the people who make these complaints. No one has said anything to me.\nOttawa, November 20th, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the boys at the Mohawk Institute.\n\nThe Department is pleased to note the precautions that you have taken to prevent the boys from leaving the dormitories between eight o'clock at night and the regular time for arising in the morning.\n\nI trust that you will see that the boys receive every possible supervision. The instructions contained in paragraphs 2 and 3 of official letter of the 26th ultimo should be kept in mind.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.R.A. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. H. W. Snell, B.

He is solely responsible for the management and expenditures of the school, subject to inspection by officers of the Department.\n\nIn view of the clause in the agreement, mentioned above, regarding the qualifications required of the principal, the Department requested the Archbishop of Huron to nominate a Principal, who should be a good business man with knowledge of farming and stock raising. His Grace nominated Reverend H. W. Small, B. A., the present Principal, who assumed duties August first, 1929. The Archbishop of Huron has no responsibility for the management of the school.\n\nOther than per capita grant, this Department has expended very little, since the date of the lease from the New England Company, towards repairs or equipment - most of the cost having been paid from the grant provided by the New England Company.\n\nThis Department assumes no responsibility for the purchase of food, clothing, fuel, payment of staff and incidental expenses - all being paid by the school authorities from the per capita grant provided the school.\n\nThe land on which the school is located - ten acres - is the property of the New England Company. Besides, 300 acres are rented from the Six Nations Band for farm purposes.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDecember 3, 1935.\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nI have your memorandum of the 30th ultimo, requesting to be informed regarding the relationship between this Department and the Mohawk Indian Institute at Brantford, Ont.\n\nThis Institute was founded in 1831, by the New England Company, London, England, for the education of the Indian children of the Six Nations Band. The total costs of the school were financed by the New England Company up to the fiscal year 1891-92, when this Department gave a per capita grant for 90 pupils. The per capita grant has been continued up to the present time, and we now provide for 150 pupils at $160 per capita, less 6%.\n\nIn January, 1922, the Mohawk Institute was leased by the New England Company to this Department, at a nominal rental of One Dollar ($1.00) per year, for a period of 21 years. Besides, the Company grants $1,000 per annum for current expenses. Under the terms of the lease, the Department is to maintain the school as an educational institution for Indian boys or girls, or for both, and the pupils are to be drawn, as far as possible, from the Six Nations Indians.

The memorandum should describe the general layout as to who is responsible for the administration and how the purchases for it are made.\n\nSgd. W.J.F. Pratt.\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, February 26th, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nSince Mr. Phelan's visit to the Mohawk Institute last month, the Department has been giving very careful consideration to making certain changes at the school.\n\nFor your personal information, I may say that a communication is being directed to the New England Company in connection with the senior teacher. When their reply is received, you will be further advised regarding our wishes in this matter. In the meantime, our action should be regarded as confidential.\n\nThe question of the advisability of continuing the greenhouse is one that has engaged the Department's consideration at various times during the past few years. It is not a large source of revenue and it is doubtful if there is any much value in endeavouring to teach Indian boys to cultivate plants, etc., under conditions that they will not likely meet during the remainder of their lives. The Department, therefore, feels that the time has come to discontinue this work, and I would appreciate if you would give the matter your immediate consideration and advise how soon you can dispose of the stock on hand.\n\nThe Department also understands that no poultry is being raised at the Mohawk Institute. It is considered very important, for many reasons, that there should be a fairly large flock of poultry at each Indian residential school and I would, therefore, request that you make immediate arrangements to carry out our wishes in this regard.\n\nThe Indian Superintendent, Major E. P. Randle, is being informed regarding the contents of the last three paragraphs of this letter and, if he can be of any assistance, I am certain he will be willing to help you.\n\nA. F.

She began teaching here in 1886 and has taught here continuously since that time with the exception of the one year which she spent at Normal in Toronto.\n\nIt has occurred to me that there might be some protest from the Indians should she resent being retired but you will know better than I the weight of this consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHorace W. Swell.\nEX.\n\nMarch 2, 1936.\n\nDear Major Bush:\n\nMiss Susan Hardie, an Indian, was admitted as a pupil of the Mohawk Institute on March 20, 1878. She was at that time 11 years of age. In 1886, she was appointed as teacher in one of the classrooms and has taught at the school continuously since that time, with the exception of one year, which she spent at Normal School (a training school for teachers) in Toronto.\n\nYou will note, from the information contained in the preceding paragraph, that she is now 60 years of age, and, while she is still quite active, the Department considers that it would be in the best interests of the school to dispense with her services.\n\nUnfortunately, we have no provision for superannuating teachers of Indian schools, even though they have given such long service as Miss Hardie.\n\nAs you are aware, you allow this Department an annual amount to assist in the maintenance of the Mohawk Institute. Would the New England Company have any objection to this Department using $500 or $600 a year from the amount which you pay us to provide an annuity for Miss Hardie, in the event of our finally deciding to dispense with her services within the next year?

C. 1,\nEngland.\nMarch 17-36.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI regret to note the recommendation to discontinue the greenhouse here. It would mean the loss of so much revenue that the difficulties of keeping accounts balanced would be very materially increased. In fact I cannot see how I could possibly make ends meet without the revenue received from this source. During the last fifteen years the cash revenue from the garden has averaged $1800.00 and about ninety per cent of this has come from the greenhouse. The lowest year was 1933 when the cash receipts dropped to $740. But there has been a steady increase since, $534.53 in 1934 and $187.32 in 1935. With further improvements in the economic conditions this may be expected to continue to rise to the average. The current cost of running the greenhouse is very small, the only expenses being coal, about $170, seeds about $90 and a few hoes, pots etc amounting to less than $100.00 per year. This leaves, in a normal year, several hundred dollars more than enough cash received to pay the gardener whom we should need in any case. To these receipts would be added about $1000 per year for vegetables sent into the house and also the cost of vegetable and flower plants that would amount to nearly $500.00 if we had to purchase them on the market.\n\nOwing to the large amount of work by the gardener, the plant itself is now in excellent condition and will need no permanent repairs worth mentioning for years to come. All this, together with the new heating equipment recently installed, would be useless and necessarily fall into decay for lack of use.\n\nI trust, therefore, that the Department will not insist on the closing up of the greenhouse.\n\nThe suggestion in paragraph 4 has been attended to and we shall have 200 chickens on May 1st.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n26 Bloomsbury Square,\nLondon, W.C.1.\n\n19th March, 1938.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\n\nDear Mr. McGill,\n\nMohawk Institute,\nMiss Susan Hardie.\n\nI have just received your letter dated March 2nd with reference to Miss Hardie.

She is an Indian and a member of the Six Nations Band.\n\nAs you know, we have no provision for superannuating teachers of Indian schools, even though they have given such long service as Miss Hardie.

The Company was written an official letter on March 2nd, last, and a reply has just been received stating that they would have no objection to our using $500 or $600 of the amount they allow us in order to provide a yearly pension for Miss Hardie.\n\nIn view of Miss Hardie's age and reports that we have received in connection with the Mohawk Institute, I feel that it would be in the best interests of the school to retire her.\n\nI would, therefore, recommend that Miss Hardie be notified that her services at the Mohawk Institute will not be required after the end of August, 1936, and that, from September 1st, 1936, she will be allowed a retiring pension at the rate of $50.00 a month.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, May 7th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose, for your information, copies of letters of today's date to Reverend Mr. Snell, Principal of the Mohawk Institute, and Miss Susan Hardie, teacher of the senior room at that school.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMajor R. P. Randle,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nOttawa, May 7th, 1936.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nAfter giving the matter very careful consideration, the Department has decided to discontinue your services as teacher at the Mohawk Institute. The principal, Reverend Mr. Snell, is being so advised and is being instructed to allow you to remain at the school, if you so desire, until the end of August. He is, also, being instructed to allow you your salary until that date.\n\nThere is no provision for superannuation of teachers at Indian residential schools or Indian day schools and, as a consequence, teachers in these schools do not contribute to any Superannuation Fund. However, the New England Company makes a yearly grant to assist the Department in the maintenance of the Mohawk Institute and the Company has given its permission to the Department to use part of this amount for payment to you of a retiring allowance. As a result, you will be allowed, from September 1st, 1936, a retiring allowance at the rate of $500 a year. This amount will be paid on the basis of $50.00 a month.\n\nThe Department wishes to record its recognition of your long and faithful service at the Mohawk Institute and we are extremely pleased that it was possible to make arrangements with the New England Company for your retiring allowance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Susan Hardie,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrampton, Ont.\nOtter, May 7th, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of official letter of today's date to Miss Susan Hardie, teacher of the senior room at the Mohawk Institute.\n\nYou will note from this letter that the Department desires that Miss Hardie be allowed to remain at the Mohawk Institute, if she so desires, until the end of August and that you pay her regular monthly salary from school funds until that date. You will, also, note that, from September last, she will be allowed a retiring allowance at the rate of $50.00 a month. Funds for this purpose will be forwarded to you and you can issue the cheque monthly to Miss Hardie.\n\nThe retiring allowance to Miss Hardie was made possible through the cooperation of the New England Company. Our reason for making this arrangement was due to the long and faithful services that she has given, and it should be distinctly understood that this action is not to form a precedent.\n\nThe retirement of Miss Hardie will give you an opportunity of placing the teaching services at the Mohawk Institute on a proper basis. It is considered that a male teacher should be secured for the senior room. He should have the very best possible qualifications and, preferably, be able to teach the boys some manual training and assist in the management of the boys during their leisure time.\n\nA female teacher, fully qualified in primary work, would be secured for the junior room. The Department will expect you to exercise great care in the selection of these teachers. In view of the number of excellent teachers that are now available, there should be no difficulty in securing two teachers who will place the work at the Mohawk Institute on an advanced educational basis.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

At the inquest held on Friday night, Rev. H.W. Snell, Principal of the Institute, who, as far as I can find out, is an appointee of the Bishop of Huron, stated in giving his evidence:\n\n\"There was no special grant made by the Government for recreational equipment. The Institute was conducted by the Dominion Government and came under the jurisdiction of the Department of Indian Affairs.\"\n\nAs this puts the onus on the Indian Department and therefore on the Government, and as this is distinctly contradictory to the information given to me officially as President of the Brantford Liberal Association, I thought it should be drawn to your attention, hence this letter. I will be glad to receive from your Department any information which may arise out of this unfortunate affair, as to the actual jurisdiction of the Indian Department in the affairs of the Mohawk Indian Institute.\n\nBelieve me to be,\n\nYour humble servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

The school is administered under the direction of the Reverend Principal, subject to departmental inspection and audit. As stated above, the yearly amount from the New England Company is used for permanent improvements to the buildings.\n\nOne of the clauses of the agreement with the New England Company regarding the Mohawk Institute is that the pupils of this institution shall be trained in the teachings and doctrines of the Church of England. Consequently, when it was decided, in 1926, to appoint a new Principal, the Department requested His Lordship the Bishop of Karen to nominate a qualified minister for the position. It was at that time that the services of Reverend Mr. Snell were secured and, as just stated, he was nominated by the Bishop. However, Mr. Snell comes under the direction of the Department and is responsible to the Department.\n\nVery complete reports have been received regarding the regrettable accident which caused the death of Effie Smith. The coroner's jury did not attach any blame to any member of the staff, but recommended that the playground equipment be inspected every three months by a competent inspector.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nV.

During part of that time, the Department of Indian Affairs made a per capita allowance for each Indian child in attendance, but any expenditure over and above the amount allowed by the Department was provided by the New England Company.\n\nOwing to a reduction in their funds, the New England Company found it impossible to continue the arrangement mentioned in the above paragraph and, in 1928, the Company turned over the Mohawk Institute to the Department of Indian Affairs on a twenty-one year lease. To show their interest, however, they continue to allow the Department an annual amount to assist in keeping the buildings in repair.\n\nThe Department provides a per capita grant for each Indian child in the school and this money, together with proceeds from the farm and garden, provides the\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

We have, also, received a copy of the \"Brantford Expositor\" of the 14th instant, containing an account of the proceedings at the coroner's inquest.\n\nThe newspaper reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"Reverend Mr. Snell stated there were no regulations regarding the method of using the Maypole and there was no special grant made by the Government for recreational equipment.\"\n\nWhile this statement is true, at the same time it might give a very wrong impression to many people. It is considered that ample funds are provided for the proper maintenance of the Mohawk Institute and any reasonable request made by you has never been refused. The recreational equipment is under the direct charge of the Principal and, of course, the Department expects that it will be regularly inspected by yourself or some other member of the staff and kept in proper condition. It is hoped that, in future, detailed inspections will be made of all playground equipment and provision made for careful supervision of the children when using this equipment.\n\nThe newspaper also reports that Mr. Lager, the boys' master, said he saw the crack in the pole but it did not cause him any worry. The Department feels that this shows a certain amount of carelessness, because Mr. Lager should, at least, have reported the matter to you.\n\nMr. Superintendent Randle is being instructed to visit the Mohawk Institute at regular intervals and report to the Department any matters requiring attention. In future, all requests for equipment, repairs, etc., should be discussed with Mr. Randle, who will write to the Department giving his recommendations.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP. R. L.

It is not necessary for you to make a minute inspection on the occasion of each visit, but you should visit the various departments and report briefly. If, of course, there is any special matter that you think should receive our attention, full particulars should be given.\n\nYou will note from the last paragraph of the enclosed letter to Mr. Snell that he is being instructed to consult you, in future, regarding all equipment, repairs, etc. When he does so, you should ascertain if you would consider his request should be granted and advise the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnclosure\n\nMajor E.

The Crown Attorney asked me \"Does the Department make a grant for playground equipment?\" and, of course, I answered \"NO\" but added that the Department did furnish us with equipment such as balls, bats etc. He then asked if our equipment was sometimes homemade as in the case of the Giant Stride and I answered that it was. No one who heard the evidence could possibly have inferred that the Department was niggardly in its provision for the pupils.\n\nThe court did not think Mr. Lager was remiss, inasmuch as he explained that he took it that the ring around the pole had been placed there to strengthen the pole where it was checked. The check, as was shown to the coroner and jury, did not reach completely to the top of the pole. Had the ring been nearer to the top of the pole it would have effectually prevented the split that caused the accident.\n\nI may say that the mother attached no blame to the management. In fact she made the request that her little boy might be admitted next term if there is room for him.

All repairs to equipment and plant that can be done by ourselves are almost entirely done by the boys under the direction of the boys Master. This involves considerable training in carpentry, plumbing, painting and repairs to machinery. As an example, the new metallic ceiling in the senior school room last year was done entirely by boys, the boys master merely giving the directions and instructions necessary. I may say that it compares more than favourably with the ceiling in the junior room installed by regular workmen some years ago. In addition to this, the boys are given instruction in the making of models of various kinds, bird houses etc. The excellence of their work is shown by the fact that four of the five prizes awarded at Oshawken Fair were won by our boys. I am convinced that the boys here get a better training in manual work than they could get in any of our public Schools where Manual Training is given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHorace W.

P. Randle, Superintendent at Brantford.\n\nAs you have been informed by officers, the Department has recently received complaints regarding the food served to the children and the meal served on the occasion of the visit of the officers tends to show that some of the meals are not as appetizing or bountiful as could be reasonably expected at a school possessing the advantages of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nIt is, therefore, expected that you will immediately confer with those in charge of the meals and personally arrange for a decided improvement both in the quantity and quality of food served to the children. It is also expected that all meals be supervised by some member of the staff and that you will personally visit the diningroom from time to time in order that you may assure yourself that your instructions are being carried out at all times.\n\nThe Department desires that whole milk, and separated milk, be served to the pupils in future. The handling of the milk should also receive great care. It is understood that instructions in this regard were given to you by Major Randle and Mr. Phelan and the Department will expect these recommendations to be put into effect. It is considered advisable to have the milk cans scalded in the kitchen, rather than in the laundry.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to Major Randle and he is being instructed to visit the dinning-room at mealtime whenever he is at the Mohawk Institute. Major Randle is also being requested to confer with you regarding the cost of a new henhouse. If this new henhouse is erected, you should at once arrange for an adequate number of hens so fresh eggs should be served the pupils at regular intervals.\n\nThe Department trusts that the instructions contained in this letter will be put into effect without delay.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMrs. Hardie writes that she has not received her pension for the last four months.

H.A. Snell,\nPrincipal, Mohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been consulted by Mrs. Edna Chrysler of 101 Euclid Avenue, Toronto, concerning injuries sustained by her son, Ross Chrysler, who was a pupil in your school in June last. My client informs me that one of the teachers on your staff called Mr. Logan mistreated her son to such an extent that his body was covered with bruises when her sister, Mrs. Harold Carter, of Hamilton, obtained the boy from your school for the summer holidays.\n\nI hope you understand that I appreciate that there is a certain proper form of punishment in case a pupil misbehaves, but such punishment does not allow a teacher to take a pupil into a henhouse, as I am informed happened in this case, and flay him with a belt.\n\nI have advised Mrs. Chrysler to let me know if there is any further mistreatment and in that case I will communicate directly with the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa. I also advised Mrs. Chrysler that she is to tell her son that in case of further mistreatment the boy is to go direct to you and also go to a physician for an examination.\n\nI quite understand the difficulties which there may be in a school such as yours is, so far as the pupils are concerned, but feel that under the circumstances some explanation should be made to the boy's Mother.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.H., CRAIG\n\nP.S.

Are you aware of the present circumstances of either the mother or the aunt? The Department feels that it would be undesirable to re-admit this boy to the Mohawk Institute when the school re-opens after the summer holidays if any of the relatives are able to provide for his maintenance. However, a definite decision will not be made in this connection until you reply. In the meantime, if the boy should be brought back to the school he should not be accepted until you receive further word from us.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev.

Neither in your letter to me, nor in your letter to Mrs. Carter, did you make any effort to explain away the bruises and injuries received by Ross Chrysler while he was at your school. Such bruises and injuries do not happen without there being some reason. Your suggestion in your letter to Mrs. Carter that Ross \"lied\" concerning the situation is, in my view, entirely incorrect, and it appears to me that either the boys, which you say were questioned concerning the matter, either did not answer truthfully or did not know and understand the facts. If the boys understanding the situation clearly did not tell the truth I suggest that they did so because of fear.\n\nI note in your letter to me that you say it is not your practice to administer severe punishment and that you resort to it only when other means fail. Apparently, this practice was not followed in the present case because, as you say in your letter to Mrs. Carter, Ross cried from repentance after Mr. Lager had talked to him but he did not talk to him until after he had administered punishment.\nRev. Horace W. Snell\n\nAugust 14th, 1937.\n\nI call your attention to the fact that in the letter to me you state that Ross was punished only by four strokes from a light strap on the hands and in the letter to Mrs. Carter you say that Ross was given three strokes on each hand.\n\nI also note that neither in the letter to me, nor in the letter to Mrs. Carter did you say that you have taken the matter up with Mr. Lager, nor do you give Mr. Lager's explanation.\n\nI am forwarding a copy of this letter to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.H.

H. Craig, of Toronto, a copy of which he sent to you.\n\nIn connection therewith, I may say that the matter had been reported to me three weeks before by the boy's aunt and I had made a thorough investigation. A number of other boys were present at the time and they agreed that the boy deserved what punishment he received, that it had been done only with a light strap, and that it consisted of three strokes on each hand and that the boy was hit no place else and did not even cry as a result of the punishment. The boys who were there are entirely reliable (which Ross is not) and I have no doubt as to the truth of their statements. None of them had any knowledge of how the boy had received the bruises that his aunt found on his arms.\n\nMr. Lager, who is mentioned in the complaint is particularly wise and kind in his treatment of the boys and the boys whom I examined testified to his kindness and to the high esteem in which the boys hold him.\n\nAs you have not written me in this matter, I presume that you have not taken the report as true but I felt that you should have a statement of the facts of the case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHorace W.

You have not attempted to give any explanation as to how the boy received the injuries.\n\nAs I pointed out in my last letter to you injuries, such as he received, do not happen without some cause and those injuries alone are better proof of the truth of his story, than any words written or spoken by you. Apart from the injuries received by the boy, his story is confirmed by your letter in which you admit that the boy was strapped, not by a proper regulation strap as provided for such a purpose but by a belt which belonged to one of your staff, and further that the boy was punished at the hen house in place of being taken by the member of the staff into the office or some other place for punishment.\n\nI still think that in fairness to my client some explanation should be given as to the cause of the boy's injuries.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.H.

It is noted from your letter that a number of pupils were present when this boy was punished. Is this the usual custom at the Mohawk Institute?\n\nI regret that your letter is not more definite regarding the cause of the bruises which Ross' aunt found on his arms.\n\nRecently I received a copy of your letter of August 16th addressed to Mr. Craig.

This family are receiving assistance from this Department and we do not feel that they are in a position to look after this boy.\n\nWould you kindly inform us as to when this boy was admitted and from what Municipality; also, we would appreciate knowing where his mother is at the present time.\n\nWe have been informed by Mrs. Carter that it was necessary for her to take this boy out of the Institution.\n\nWe would appreciate receiving your report on the entire case before we take further action, as this home is not of the best type for a boy his age.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.P.

Leger\nAug. 31, 37.\n\nSecretary of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Snell informs me that you desire a signed statement regarding the reprimand and punishment administered to a pupil, Ross Chrysler some two weeks before the holidays by myself. This I am pleased to submit for your satisfaction.\n\nOn the particular day I was supervising some work at the poultry building when I heard a terrifying scream and one of the boys outside directed my attention to Ross throwing stones at a little fellow around five years of age by the name of Hubie Hill. I immediately went out of the building and called to the Chrysler boy to stop but he ignored me and continued to stone the Hill child. I distinctly heard two of the stones thud against the child's body and I was roughly one hundred and fifty feet away.\n\nI ran up to the boys and asked what Ross was thinking about throwing stones with such violence at so small a boy and also explained the serious consequences that may result from this method. I found he was not repentant so I gave him four straps on the palm of each hand to which he smiled so I again spoke to the boy and asked him how he would feel had he placed Hubie in a world of complete darkness for the rest of his life by blinding him, and to this end I was successful in making the boy feel sorry, also gaining his assurance that he would not throw stones again.\n\nover.\nMr. Lager had always treated him kindly and that he was not held in fear by him or the other boys.\n\nMr. Lager did not punish the boy in my presence. I cannot find that the principals of any of our Public Schools require that the staff shall administer punishment only in the presence of the principal. I would not say that it is usual to punish pupils in the presence of other pupils but it does happen occasionally. In this case it was fortunate as I was able to get corroboration for Mr. Lager's report of the incident.\n\nI could not be definite regarding the cause of the boy's bruises as they had not been reported to any of the staff and none of the boys had any knowledge of them. Ross told me last night that he had only two bruises, one on his groin and one, a very small one, on his wrist. I am inclined to think that both the mother and aunt exaggerated the boy's story to them and the condition in which he was found.\n\nThe lawyer was depending entirely on the story as told by the mother. Ross told me last night that he had not seen the lawyer.\n\nI suppose I was a bit curt in my last letter to Mr. Craig but I had sent him a courteous and truthful statement of the matter and I rather resented it when he \"suggested\" (to use his expression) that I was lying about it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nReplying to No.32-0-1,\nAugust 28, 1937.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRE: ROSS CHRYSLER.\n\nSeptember 1, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing the signed statement from Mr. Lager which, I trust, you will find satisfactory. I am also enclosing the belt with which the punishment was administered which you will see is too light to inflict bruises such as were alleged to be on the boy's body. I may say that Ross was here last night and I took occasion to question him. He corroborated all of Mr. Lager's report except that he contended that he was told to bend over and touch his toes while he was strapped across the sternum.\n\nHe identified the strap which I am sending to you as being the one used. He told me that there was a red mark on his groin that night and that it was black the next day. When I suggested that he might have knocked against some obstruction in his play and so caused the bruise he did not seem to be sure about it. It was interesting to note that he cried a little and, when I asked him why, he said that it was because he could not return to the school. He also told me that\nkept in mind before a decision is reached.\n\nI do not know that any good purpose would be served by holding a special investigation at this date. Instructions are being issued to the Principal that all corporal punishment in the future must be administered by a member of the staff with the Principal present. This, I understand, is the practice followed in the larger public schools throughout the Dominion, and I feel confident that it is a wise practice to adopt in the administration of our residential schools.\n\nThere are few laws or regulations governing the administration of Indian residential schools, for the simple reason that these schools, without exception, are conducted in cooperation with the churches, with clergymen in charge. The clergymen who undertake this work are missionaries in a very real sense and, consequently, very much devoted to the care and guardianship of their pupils. I have been assured that the complaint registered with you on behalf of this boy is the only complaint that has reached the Department in the memory of the officials.\n\nShould you require the Department to take any action, other than that already taken, I want you to feel perfectly free to communicate with us again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, September 3, 1937.\n\nRe - Ross Chrysler -\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department has secured two reports from the Reverend H. W. Snell, Principal of the Mohawk Institute, Brantford, Ont., relating to the punishment of the above named pupil. The Principal has also sent forward the belt with which the punishment was administered and a statement, signed by Cyril E. Lager, a copy of which is enclosed herewith for your information.\n\nThe statement signed by Mr. Lager appears to the officials here to be a rather straightforward summary of the events which prompted him to punish Ross Chrysler. The belt sent forward is a light summer belt, much lighter than the regulation strap ordinarily used, and is a belt that might form part of a boy's wearing apparel during the summer months. I am, personally, convinced that no serious injury could be inflicted upon a pupil by the use of this belt.\n\nThe reports before us are not wholly satisfactory in that they do not explain how Ross Chrysler received the injuries. Is it possible that the reports of this boy's injury received by you were somewhat exaggerated?\n\nI have failed to discover, in the records here, a single complaint that has reached the Department, with respect to harsh treatment, from any pupil in attendance at the Mohawk Institute or from any individual who might have written on behalf of such pupils. The impression received by the officials who have visited the Institute was that both the Principal and Mr. Lager were exceedingly popular with the boys and girls in attendance at the school. These facts, I feel, should be given due consideration in reviewing the complaint of Ross Chrysler and should be kept in mind.\n\nH. H. Craig, Esq.,\nBarrister,\n610 Star Bldg., Toronto, Ont.\nof the Department in the past, nor is it our practice now, to provide educational facilities for Indian pupils other than those whose parents are actually residing on reserves. In respect to Indian welfare, a decision was reached a few months ago, whereby the Department definitely disclaims any responsibility for the welfare of Indians who are not actually residents on reserves. If the mother of Ross Chrysler is living at 101 Euclid Avenue, Toronto, she is probably a municipal taxpayer and, consequently, entitled to send her child or children to public schools of that city. You can readily appreciate how difficult it would be to keep the costs of Indian education and welfare within reasonable bounds if Indians throughout the country were permitted to move at will into the cities, towns and villages of the Dominion. We must insist, therefore, that the mother of Ross Chrysler return to the reserve before his claim for re-admission to the school can be considered by the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP.S.- I am unable, at the moment, to discover the circular to which I refer, but I shall be glad to send it forward just as soon as it is recovered.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, September 3, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Snell:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the first instant and also letters signed by Cyril H. Lager, a member of your staff; and A. P. Kappela of Hamilton, attached thereto.\n\nThe reports submitted by you on the punishment of Ross Chrysler are not wholly satisfactory in that they do not explain how the boy obtained certain bruises on his body. It is just possible, of course, that the alleged injuries have been greatly exaggerated by the mother of this pupil when discussing the matter with Mr. Craig. Despite this fact, it does seem strange that the boy should receive even minor bruises without some members of the staff or the pupils associated with him being aware of the fact.\n\nI am, personally, of the opinion that corporal punishment should only be administered by a member of the staff, in the presence of the Principal. I am not familiar with the practice followed in the public schools of Ontario, but I do know that, in the larger schools in western Canada corporal punishment is always administered in the presence of the school Principal. This practice over a period of years has proved eminently satisfactory. I have just learned from the officials that a circular making provision for this was sent out to the principals of all residential schools a few years ago.

Sunday services have been conducted regularly during\nthe year, in His Majesty's Chapel during the warm months and in\nthe school at other times. We also have daily chapel services\nin the school at which Biblical instruction is given. In addition\na period of religious instruction is given to each class during\nschool hours and Sunday School is held each Sunday. Confirmation\nclasses in preparation for that rite, attended by all the senior\npupils, were carried on for three months and thirty-eight pupils\nwere confirmed. Three of these came to the school from Iagen homes.\nNo attempt is made to proselytise children of other denominations\nbut occasionally they ask for Confirmation and, with the consent o\ntheir parents, are presented. There can be no doubt that the em-\nphasis placed upon Religious instruction has much to do with the\nmarked improvement in the character of the pupils.\n\nDISCIPLINE. The conduct of the pupils has been most gratifyingly\nexemplary. Truancy has almost entirely ceased and there is evident\na steadily growing desire on the part of the pupils to follow right\nbecause it is right and to co-operate with the staff in maintaining\na high standard of behaviour and industry. This is so much the cas\nthat I have to resort to corporal punishment only on very rare oc-\ncasions.\n\nSTAFF. Too much credit cannot be given to the very efficient and\nsympathetic staff of teachers and officers. I feel that it would\nbe very difficult to improve its personnel. We have now thirteen\nmembers: Principal, Matron, Nurse, Senior teacher, Junior teacher,\nSewing teacher, Manual Training teacher, Senior dietitian, Junior\ndietitian, Boys' Master, Farm Superintendent, Gardener and Teamster.\n\nIt is worthy of special mention that, through the kindness of the\nSuperintendent of Training and Welfare, we have been able to add a\nteacher specially qualified for Manual Training. About $1100.00\nhas been spent in equipping the shop for teaching carpentry, forging,\nwoodwork, farm mechanics etc., and our pupils will now have the opp-\nortunity of a much better practical training than heretofore.\n\nPUPILS. The enrolment has been slightly under our quota of 150.\nWe had 64 boys and 81 girls. The progress was normal. Eight pupi\npassed the Entrance examination for a mission to Collegiate Insti\nand the other classes advanced steadily. Five pupils are attend\nCollege from here and are doing a uniformly high standing.\n\nImprovements have been made\nin the plumbing and\nother matters.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of September 28 I enclose a copy of a report submitted by the Principal of the Mohawk Institute regarding the activities at that school during the past year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Mr. Paxton who has had one year's experience in this work and comes highly recommended has been appointed to fill the vacancy.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S. I have been paying the salary for this teacher from regular grant for a year now. It would greatly relieve the strain on finances if I could have the thousand dollars from appropriation as suggested in your letter of January 10th 1938.\nOttawa,\nAugust 24, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant in which you state that Mr. Frure has resigned from the position of manual training instructor at the Mohawk Institute and that Mr. Paxton has been appointed as his successor.\n\nI was very favourably impressed by Mr. Frure during my visit to the institution and I learned with regret of his resignation. It is my hope that Mr. Paxton will be equally successful in carrying forward the vocational programme.\n\nI note with interest the suggestion contained in the postscript attached to your letter. At the time the vocational instructor was first appointed it was my hope that he would be able to work out a programme whereby he would spend a certain amount of time on the Six Nations Reserve. The limited staff, however, at my disposal has not enabled me to give the matter the thought or attention to which it is entitled. In the meantime the unusual expenditures at the Mohawk Institute have simply prevented me from even considering the payment of the salary from appropriation. The last repairs undertaken at the school will mean that even the New England account will be substantially overdrawn.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. H. W. Snell,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 12, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Snell:\n\nOn the occasion of my recent visit to the Mohawk Institute Indian Superintendent Randle and myself went over the whole school with a view to examining the work that has been recently done.\n\nOn entering the wash rooms used by the girls in the basement I was extremely disappointed to notice papers scattered over the floor and in spite of the newly decorated walls and ceilings the rooms appeared as if no supervision was being given to the girls.\n\nI feel it is almost unnecessary for me to point out that the Department expects the staff of the Mohawk Institute to see that all rooms in the building are kept in a cleanly condition.\n\nThe Indian Superintendent, Major H.F. Randle, is being requested to visit the Mohawk Institute within the next month and to report to the Department any room that is not in the condition in which it should be.\n\nI was especially sorry to see the condition of these rooms in the basement on the day on which I was there because I understand that later in the afternoon a member of your staff accompanied one of the leading members of the American Delegation through the basement. Certainly this gentleman could not have obtained a very good opinion of the training given the girls in the matter of cleanliness of the rooms which they are occupying.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. H. J. Snell,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nNovember 6, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of an anonymous letter from Brantford in connection with the Mohawk Institute. While we do not usually pay any attention to such communications at the same time there is one paragraph which I thought advisable to bring to your attention. It reads as follows:\n\n\"It is a topic of general comment in Brantford that the children are not sufficiently clothed for this weather. It is now November and the boys are still without any underwear. They only received stockings one month ago. Light cotton clothes are worn summer and winter. Even the poor clothes they have are often dirty and ragged.\"\n\nPlease let me have any comments that you wish to offer in regard to the above statement.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor E. P. Randle,\nSupt. Six Nations,\nBrantford, Ont.\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nsir:\n\nThis will acknowledge your 32-1-1\nof the 6th instant with reference to an an-\nonymous letter in connection with the children's\nclothing at the Mohawk Institute.\n\nAt the time the letter was written the\nweather was still mild and in fact continued so\nuntil just the last few days. Consequently warmer\nclothing was only being issued at the time the\nanonymous complaint was written.\n\nHowever, it is my opinion from what\ncan be seen that the children generally are com-\nfortably clad and look healthy and cheerful.\n\nThe boys have both working clothes and\nbetter ones, but clad in the former often visit\na little store a short distance from the institute.\nIn these farm working clothes, being boys, they may\noften look untidy and dirty, no matter how clean\nthey started out earlier in the day, and this may\nbe the reason for some of the comments made.\n\nOtherwise clothes are clean and neat\nand all the children are watched for cleanliness.\n\nyours truly,\n\nE.

H. W. Snell, B.A., as Principal of the Mohawk Institute, with power to sign against the Bank account operated in the name of the Institute. We were asked to extend \"the usual overdraft courtesies, if necessary, up to $3,000.\"\n\nOn a subsequent occasion we were told that arrangements were being made whereby overdrafts should not be necessary, but from time to time we have been requested by Mr. Snell to allow some special overdrafts pending the receipt of delayed funds from Ottawa, and to some extent we have complied.\n\nOn May 7th, 1940, the account was placed in funds with a deposit of $4,805, but we notice today that cheques since paid have created an overdraft, which amounts this evening to $697.50. We have hesitated to refuse payment of cheques issued for the expenses of the School, when requested to do so by the Rev. Mr. Snell.\n\nOur relations with the Principal in the operation of the account have been entirely pleasant, but at the same time we are desirous of carrying out the wishes of the Department. If it is your wish that we allow overdrafts we shall do so, and we shall not hesitate to permit them from time to time to such amount as you may set. If, however, we are expected to refuse any cheques which, if paid, would create an overdraft, perhaps you will be good enough to so inform us.\nThe Deputy Superintendent General (2)\n\nThe purpose of this letter is to let you know that there is at this writing an overdraft of $879.50, and to ask for instructions for our future guidance. We think you might consider it convenient to authorize some overdraft privilege, but perhaps less than $3,000.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nManager,\nA. S.

I have arranged with him to continue the Manual Training after four each day so that we shall still have the benefit of part of the training given in the shop.

I have been ordered at once to enter the hospital in London for an operation which it is hoped will save the sight of my left eye which has suddenly gone partially blind.\n\nAll the business matters in connection with the school are in order and, with Mrs. Shell in charge, there should be no difficulty in the conduct of the Institute during my absence.\n\nWith best wishes for a Happy New Year to you,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHorace W.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent, Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir:\n\nAs you are aware, the Principal of the Mohawk Institute, the Rev. H.W. Snell, is in London in hospital for an operation upon an eye, and during his absence Mr. Snell has been in charge.\n\nThis office regrets however, to report that while motoring to London to see Mr. Snell last Sunday, Mrs. Snell was involved in a serious motor accident and is now in the Woodstock Hospital with a broken leg and arm.\n\nMr. Ramsay, the gardener at the Mohawk Institute, was driving Mr. Snell's car at the time, and is in Brantford General Hospital with as far as is known, only slight injuries.\n\nMr. Snell has not been informed, as the Hospital authorities in London felt that his condition was such that it was advisable for him to remain in ignorance of the accident.\n\nMrs. Smith, the housekeeper, is now in charge of the Institute, and everything appears to be running smoothly - and the gardener's work and hot-houses are being taken care of by the farm manager.\n\nThis office instructed the M.C.M. Police to enquire into the causes of the accident etc., as the Department have some interest in Mr. Snell's car, and he being an official under Departmental authority.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMajor E. P. Standle,\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 26, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI was extremely sorry to learn from your letter of the 22nd instant of the accident sustained by Mrs. Snell.\n\nAt the same time the Department is very much concerned regarding the management of this school during the enforced absence of both Mr. and Mrs. Snell. I doubt if Mrs. Smith is the proper person to be even nominally in charge of this institution. I believe that you should consider appointing Mr. Lager as temporarily in charge of the school. He is the male officer on the inside staff with the longest service. In appointing him I do not see any necessity for issuing him authority to sign cheques. I hesitate to impose additional duties on you, but I believe it would be more satisfactory if you would handle the financial business of the school for the time being. No doubt if you explain the situation to the manager of the Bank of Montreal he will honour cheques drawn against the school account and signed by yourself. In addition I feel that if you can possibly do so you should arrange to visit the school at least once a day for the next few weeks.\n\nAs previously advised, Mr. Doucet will be in your Agency next week and you will be able to consult him regarding the management of the building until such time as either Mr. or Mrs. Snell returns to duty.\n\nI wish you would keep me in close touch with the condition of both of them as it is evident\n\nMajor R.P. Randle,\nSupt. Six Nations,\nBrantford, Ont.\nfrom the second paragraph of your letter that Mrs. Snell will be absent for several weeks and the inference from the fourth paragraph of your letter is that Mr. Snell's condition is not improving quickly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nJanuary 30, 1942.\n\nwould prefer the matter to be left in my hands and for Mrs. Smith to remain in charge. Mrs. Smith is practical, cool and calm, quite familiar with the inside management and duties, and held in respect by the staff in general.\n\nMr. Lager is capable and energetic but inclined to be erratic and might upset the even keel on which the school affairs are running.\n\nThe Bank of Montreal are satisfied with the authority your letter contains for my signature on cheques, and as now it is sure Mr. Snell will not be back for a while I will arrange for the payment of staff salaries and any merchants' accounts which it would appear it is best to pay.\n\nAs far as the Institute monthly financial statement goes, it would be best possibly to hold it up for Mr. Snell's return in the middle of the month. If he should not come back then, this office will prepare one.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMajor E. P. Randle,\nEPR/MH\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nR. A.

H. W. and Mrs. Snell.\n\nIn accordance with your wishes I have kept in touch with their condition and both are progressing favourably. However, the Victoria Hospital authorities at London informed me today that while Mr. Snell's condition is satisfactory, it is hardly likely that he will return to his duties for about a fortnight. Today, he was expected to be up for the first time for a short period.\n\nMrs. Snell is cheerful and doing well but it will be five or six weeks before she can leave the hospital.\n\nAs far as the School goes, everything is satisfactory, and as you requested I am keeping in close touch with the situation there and will continue to make frequent visits.\n\nMr. Ramsay the gardener, came back yesterday from hospital and is again at his duties, which is a help, as naturally the running of the hot-houses and the care of the plants etc. was some anxiety, with their ordinary duties, to the farm manager and Mr. Lager.\n\nWith reference to your suggestion that Mr. Lager be temporarily placed in charge of the school, it is my opinion that this would not be the best thing to do and I\nOttawa,\nFebruary 8, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo with reference to the Mohawk Institute.

It is wiser to let things as they are until further circumstances may demand further action.\n\nThe work is going satisfactorily, and the new experiences are quite interesting.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

The Principal of the school, the Reverend H.W. Snell, was absent, making certain purchases from wholesale houses in Hamilton. Despite the substantial sums spent from year to year on the upkeep and repair of this building, the structure is by no means in first-class shape. The whole atmosphere in the school appears to be somewhat depressing and the rooms, particularly the bedrooms, rather bleak and unattractive. We were particularly interested, however, in his farming operations and in his live stock, he appears to have a good farming instructor, Mr. Arnell and I questioned him closely in respect of his dairy herd, which appears to be somewhat depleted, and to the number of Yorkshire hogs that he is feeding this winter. When we expressed surprise at the small number of hogs in the piggery, he intimated that it was exceedingly difficult to secure the funds necessary to multiply the number of hogs at the school. I did not question him closely but came away with the impression that the cattle and hogs produced at this school during the last two or three years have not been equal to the number consumed at the premises. Mr. Snell is an old man and has never been a good administrator at any time. He never appears to have a good grip on his finances.

On the other hand the Company have every wish to facilitate the general scheme which you have proposed. The Company must, however, stipulate that the teachings of the Church of England should continue to be available for those pupils whose parents desire it.\n\nWith the purpose in view of continuing the objects of the Company within the terms of their Charter the Company wish to suggest to you the following alternative arrangement:\n\nThe Company would be willing to grant a Lease of the Mohawk Institute, apart from the Mohawk Chapel, for a nominal rent, for a term of 21 years, your Department being responsible for maintenance and repairs and for the insurance of the property. The Company would retain the freehold of the Chapel and would be responsible for its upkeep.\n\nIn the altered circumstances the Company would not propose to maintain their annual grant of \u00a31000 beyond the end of the current year, but they would pay a salary to a Church of England clergyman nominated by the Bishop of the Diocese and appointed by the Company, to give religious instruction in the school and to serve the Chapel. The Company would wish to consider\nThe Minister of Mines & Resources,\n\n10.0.43.\n\nany scheme for giving small grants to deserving Indian pupils to enable them to continue their education on leaving the school.\n\nThe Company hope that these proposals will be acceptable to you and would be much obliged if you would cable giving your views in principle on their suggestions. If you concur generally the Company would then have a draft Lease prepared and sent to you for detailed examination.\n\nI am dealing in a separate letter with the question of the pensions for Miss Hardie and Mr Snell, which was raised in a letter to the Treasurer of the Company from Mr Phelan.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) ARTHUR COCHRANE.\n\nGovernor,\nNEW ENGLAND COMPANY.\n26, Bloomsbury Square,\nLondon, W.C.\n\n16th June 1943.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nWelfare & Training Service,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Mr Phelan,\n\nI have sent a separate letter to your Minister about the general question of the future of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nIn this letter I am dealing with the question of the pensions to Miss Hardie and Mr Snell which you raised in your letter to the Treasurer of December 24th 1942.\n\nThe Court of the Company have considered the matter in the light of legal advice and a letter from the Charity Commission. They are advised that they are justified in continuing Miss Hardie's pension. They will be willing, therefore, to continue her existing pension of \u00a3170 per year for her lifetime.\n\nIn regard to Mr Snell, however, the Company are advised that as he was appointed by the Canadian Government without reference to the Company, they would not be entitled to grant any pension to him. I regret, therefore, that it is not possible to concur in this part of your proposal.\n\nI should add that the proposal to pay Miss Hardie's pension is subject to the Department of Mines & Resources accepting the alternative proposals in regard to the future of the Mohawk Institute which I have set out in my letter to your Minister.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) ARTHUR COCHRANE.\nGovernor.\nNEW ENGLAND COMPANY.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 1, 1943.\n\nEX'D\n\nDear Mr. Snell:\n\nThere are certain matters affecting the future of the Mohawk Institute which I wish to discuss with you.

In this draft it was proposed that the Indian Department should covenant with the Company that the pupils of the Mohawk Institute whose parents so desired should be trained in the teachings and doctrines of the Church of England in Canada under the supervision of the Chaplain of the Mohawk Chapel. The Company proposed further to keep the Chapel of the Institute in good repair, to maintain and pay the salary of the Chaplain to supervise the Chapel and to give religious instruction in the Institute, the Chaplain being appointed by the Company on the nomination of the Bishop of Huron. It was not proposed to continue the annual grant of \u00a31000. It was proposed that the freehold of the Chapel should be retained until by the Company.\n\nSubject to the foregoing safeguards it was proposed that the rest of the Mohawk Institute property should be let to the Indian Department for a period determinable by a year's notice on either side, with the intention that it should be maintained by said Department as a Government School for non-Catholic Indian children. The Company is of opinion that these provisions meet the suggestions contained in your letter under reply and are hope...\nThe Secretary,\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada.\n\nthat \"we meet with the wishes of the Indian Department.

Randle,\nEnc.\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nSept. 9, 1944.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Gasoline - Special Category Applications.\n\nOn February 14, 1944 instructions were received in this branch from our Deputy Minister's office that all applications for special categories for gasoline for the operation of motor cars should be submitted to the Administrative Branch for approval and the signature required of Certificate Number 1 on Page 2 of the application form. It would appear that arrangements were made with your office that these applications would bear the signature of Mr. C. W. Jackson, Chief Executive Assistant.\n\nIt was not the intention, when this arrangement was made, that this should apply to the Principals of Indian Schools, who, although engaged in what might be described as government business are definitely not Civil Servants or employees of the Dominion Government. It would appear that when Principals of Indian Schools apply, from time to time, for special category gasoline they are informed by the Regional Oil Controllers that their applications must be sent to Ottawa for the signature of the official above mentioned. The official, Mr. C. W. Jackson, however, is not prepared to sign these applications as he is not sufficiently informed as to the work these gentlemen are engaged in, and consequently is not in a position to pass judgment as to the amount of gasoline they should be authorized to use.\n\nAs an example of what has been occurring I give you the following information:\n\nRev. H. B. Small, Principal, Mohawk Institute, Brantford, Ontario, applied early in the year (about May, 1944) for a Special Category for gasoline for the operation of the Mohawk Institute car. The Regional Oil Controller returned the application to Mr. Small with the notation - \"Must be certified by Ottawa Department\". The application was forwarded to Mr. Jackson with the advice received from the Regional Oil Controller. Mr. Jackson returned it to this branch with the notation - \"Unless Mr. Small is engaged and paid by the Department, I have no authority to certify this application\".\n\nFrom the above you will see that under the present arrangements Principals of Indian Schools cannot secure additional gasoline to carry on the school operations. The Regional Oil Controllers will not grant it claiming that the applications must be signed by the department at Ottawa, and the department at Ottawa will not sign as they are not in our employ.\nThe particular case cited is not an isolated one, as many such instances have occurred. It would be appreciated if you would issue instructions to your Regional Oil Controllers to deal directly with applications presented to them by persons conducting semi-government business for this department, but who are not paid by this department nor receive from this department any allowance for travelling.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDirector.\n\nG.E.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. H.W. Snell,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nMemorandum:\n\nI inspected the Mohawk Institute on Thursday, October 12. Accompanied by the Principal, I visited all parts of the building and I found everything in good condition, with the possible exception of the boys' playroom. Although the conditions in this room are not perfect, they are much better than I have seen them on former occasions.\n\nTwo qualified teachers are employed. This is the second year during which these teachers have been at Mohawk. While the girls are given considerable training in housework, sewing etc., the boys evidently receive little vocational training. The Principal stated that it was impossible for him to secure a qualified vocational teacher this year. At the present time he is employing a man by the name of Bricker. This gentleman is 67 years of age, but appears quite vigorous.\n\nThe Principal brought to my attention the necessity for the supplying of a new gas stove in the kitchen at an early date. New tables are also necessary in the children's dining room. Neither of these requires immediate attention, but as soon as such articles are available after the war they should be supplied.\n\nAt the time of my visit there were 110 pupils enrolled. The authorised pupilage at this school is 130. The Principal stated that he expected to obtain another 10 or 15 pupils within the next month.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Snell introduced the question of whether the Department would insist on Mr. Snell's retiring at the end of June, 1945. I pointed out to them that by this time Mr. Snell would be over 65 years of age and that the original decision of the Department to retire him at that time was still in effect. Mrs. Snell expressed the opinion that other members of the staff were doubtful regarding their future. I pointed out to her that, as far as we were concerned at the present time, we had no intention of dispensing with the services of any other members of the staff.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nREPORT ON SASKATCHEWAN INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER, 1944.\n\nSeveral applications were received from parents who wish to put their children in Residential School. Most of these were deserving cases and their applications were forwarded to the Department for approval.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nBISHOPTORPE.\nQUEBEC.\n\nNovember 6th, 1944.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to you with regard to the Mohawk Institute at Brantford, Ontario.\n\nI am informed that the Department is considering the idea of radically changing the whole character of the School by putting it under a layman as Principal and merely allowing the services of a Chaplain for our own children.\n\nI was very much shocked when I heard of this proposal to bring to an end a religious and educational tradition which had been established for so long, and I am sure that Anglicans generally throughout Canada would hear of this decision with regret and amazement.\n\nI trust that those in charge of Indian affairs will take over this school on the same terms as it takes over other Indian residential Schools. In fact there seems to be no reason why an exception should be made in the case of our oldest school.\n\nI am, yours faithfully,\n\n+ Philip Quebec\nArchbishop of Quebec and Metropolitan of Canada.\n\nPQ/eb\nOttawa, November 6, 1944.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Carrington:\n\nI have for acknowledgment Your Grace's letter of November 6, in which you express surprise that this Department is considering the idea of radically changing the whole character of the Mohawk Indian Residential School, by putting it under a layman as Principal and merely allowing the services of a Chaplain for the Anglican children.\n\nI may state briefly that this expression of opinion is based either on a misunderstanding of the actual facts or a misinterpretation by someone of the negotiations that have taken place and are still taking place between the representative of the Bishop of Huron, the General Secretary of the M.S.C.C., and this Department, with respect to the future of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nIn September, 1942, the Governor of the New England Company informed the Chief of our Training Division that it was not the intention of the New England Company to continue its annual grant of $5,000.00 for the operation of the Mohawk Institute. The Governor did suggest, however, at that time, that the Company would be glad to lease the property to the Government, should the members of the Government feel that the school should be kept open and in operation. A great deal of consideration was given to the remarks of the Governor of the New England Company, by the Minister of this Department and the officials of this Branch. It was finally decided that a representative commission should thoroughly\n\nMost Reverend P. Carrington, K.A., P.C.L., Litt. D., D.D.,\nArchbishop of Quebec and Metropolitan of Canada,\nBishopsthorpe, 69 D'Autueil Street,\nQuebec, P. Q.\ninvestigate the educational needs of the Indian population of southwestern Ontario. This commission reported to the Minister in due course.\n\nIn the meantime, however, the Governor of the New England Company sent forward, for our consideration, a draft 21 year lease. This lease, with certain minor adjustments, was returned to the Governor of the Company with a covering letter dated August 1, 1944. The lease has not been executed, nor have we been in communication with the Company at any time since the afore-mentioned date. A number of conferences have been held, however, between representatives of the M.S.C.C. and this Branch, and arrangements have been made whereby I shall interview Canon Dixon on Friday, November 24, and interview Canon Dixon and Canon Townshend on November 30. It will thus be seen that we are putting forth a sincere and earnest attempt to adjust what appears to us to be a very delicate and somewhat complicated matter. In all fairness to the Government and to this Department, it should be stated, however, that the proposals now under consideration are the proposals, not of this Government, but of the New England Company. In this connection I am sending forward, for Your Grace's information, copy of a letter dated April 22, 1944, received by the Secretary of the M.S.C.C. from the Governor of the New England Company. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory. I am personally disposed to think that the delay on the part of the New England Company in sending forward the lease, duly executed, is due, in part at least, to the hope that the Department, the Bishop of Huron and the M.S.C.C. will in the interval come to an agreement that will be measurably satisfactory to all parties concerned.\n\nYour courtesy in bringing this matter to my personal attention is very much appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Director.\nThe Diocese of the Arctic\n\nTHE CHURCH HOUSE\n604 JARVIS STREET\nTORONTO 5, CANADA\n\n7th November, 1944.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs one of the Bishops of the Church of England in Canada, I am deeply interested in the welfare of our native peoples and have given the best part of my life in order to help them towards the time when they shall take their full and proper place in this great Canada of ours, of which they are first citizens.\n\nI write to express my deep concern regarding the proposal to change the whole character of the ancient and historic Residential School for Indians on the Reserve at Brantford, known as the Mohawk Institute and it is not clear to me what lies behind the recent government proposal.\n\nMay I point out that no one who has any intimate knowledge of our native people could fail to realize that it is of first rate importance that the children shall not only be taught those things which are important so that they may have such knowledge as will fit them for the life they will be called upon to live but also they should be trained in a religious atmosphere. This is necessary in order that they may have that moral stamina without which they would go down to defeat.\n\nIn the past the Indian Affairs Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources, hitherto known as the Department of Indian Affairs, has done a most valuable work in connection with the education of our native people.\nand I trust that there will be no weakening on the part of the Department now. Greater efforts should be put forward to see that, in the face of the present pressure being brought upon these people by our civilization, more help and not less should be given for their mental and spiritual upbuilding.\n\nAs I understand the situation in connection with the Mohawk Institute, the government is being asked by the Church simply to put this Institute on the same basis as other Indian Residential Schools. Surely this is a very simple and natural proposal void of any grounds for controversy.\n\nI would like to hear from you, Sir, if I understand the situation properly or not. I would also hope to have an assurance from you that the rumour of a proposal to turn it into a home for orphans and perhaps delinquent children is inaccurate. It seems to me this second idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the Mohawk Institute as such. I should be entirely in favour of establishing an Orphanage or a Home for delinquent Indian children if that be deemed necessary but I deplore very much any suggestion that either of these should take the place of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nAwaiting your reply, believe me, dear Sir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of the Arctic.\nOttawa, November 9, 1944.\n\nRe: Operation of Mohawk Institute.\n\nMy dear Bishop Fleming:\n\nI have for acknowledgment Your Lordship's letter of November 7, in which you discuss the marginally-noted subject.\n\nYour letter, I may state, is one of a number of letters that this Department has received recently, with respect to negotiations now pending between the Government and the New England Company.

I am informed that if the proposed changes are carried out it will have the practical effect of secularizing the Institute.\n\nI would ask you to give this matter most serious consideration before this step is carried out.\n\nThe Most Reverend Dr. Seager, Archbishop of Toronto and Metropolitan of Ontario, as well as other Church Officials would be willing to discuss the matter fully and I am sure they would be able to persuade the Department that the proposed change is unadvisable.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRO/IA\nOttawa, November 10, 1944.\n\nRe: Operation Mohawk Institute.\n\nMy dear Bishop Jefferson:\n\nI have for acknowledgment Your Lordship's letter of November 8, in which you discuss the marginally noted subject.\n\nYour letter, I may state, is one of a number of somewhat similar letters received recently by the Department, with respect to negotiations now pending between the Government and the New England Company.

I trust that this may not be done. The whole history of this splendid Mohawk Institute and its tradition clearly manifest that throughout all of these many years it has been efficiently operated under the Synod of the Diocese of Huron. The work has been well done,\u2014a fact which anyone conversant with conditions would immediately acknowledge.\n\nMoreover, we feel that the best work in relation to the all-round education of the children can be done by a continuance of the plans which heretofore have been found quite satisfactory. More and more both in Church and State, education is including, and rightly so, not only the academic training but the spiritual development of the child. This can be best furthered through an Anglican Residential School.\n\nMoreover, the Synod of the Diocese of Huron has contributed very largely to this educational work not only in operating costs but also in capital expenditures. Records clearly manifest the truth of this statement.\n\nThe Executive Committee of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada has unanimously recommended that our Indian and Eskimo School Commission should take over this School according to the same plans and terms as those of our present Residential Schools.\n\n(OVER)\nOttawa, November 15, 1944.\n\nRe: Operation of Mohawk Institute.\n\nMy dear Bishop Sovereign:\n\nI have for acknowledgment Your Lordship's letter of November 7, in which you discuss the marginally-noted subject.\n\nYour letter, I may state, is one of a number of somewhat similar letters received recently by the Department, with respect to negotiations now pending between the Government and the New England Company.

First, I am thankful to know that a representative commission will thoroughly investigate the educational needs of the Indian population in southwestern Ontario. That is a real comfort to me and I have every confidence in you regarding this matter.\n\nI would just like to add a second thing, that this matter has been much in the minds of those of our people who are interested in the welfare of the Indians and as far as I am concerned, no one connected with the Mohawk Institute is indulging in the old time practice of axe-grinding.

It appears the truck has not been in operation during the current rationing year but on September 6 one hundred and fifty-six coupons were missing from the books issued for the truck. The Reverend Mr. Snell was questioned regarding these coupons and at first stated they had been used to obtain gasoline which had been used in the truck. Later he made a statement admitting that gasoline had been used in a Plymouth passenger car owned by the Institute. Order Oii 12-1944 provides that gasoline acquired on surrender of coupons issued for one vehicle shall not be used in another vehicle. Although the facts as reported indicate a violation of the applicable order we are not recommending prosecution for it appears the gasoline has been used for purposes connected with the operation of the Institute.\n\n(over)\nHowever, we thought you might be interested in knowing of the irregularity which has occurred.\n\nIf you wish additional information on this matter please let us know.\n\nI.

I understand that owing to a loss of revenue due to the inability of the New England Company to continue its grant, that your Government is thinking of taking over this School and changing its character so that it will no longer be a Church of England School, such as Allert Bay and St. George's Lytton. Would you be kind enough to explain to me on what grounds this change is being made.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of New Westminster.\nNovember 13, 1944\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is with great concern that members of the Church of England hear that proposals are being seriously considered to sever the close connection that has existed for 114 years between the Anglican Church in the Diocese of Huron and the Mohawk Institute; and to practically secularize the education given to the Indian children.\n\nI understand from those competent to judge of the past usefulness of the Institute and its present service, that a distinct loss would be suffered by the Indians on the Reserve if the character and relationship of the Institute were changed.\n\nIn view of the offer of the Church of England in Canada to take over the management of the Institute on the same terms as our other Indian and Residential schools, I earnestly trust that the Government will accept this proposal, in view of the support of 114 years that the Church of England has given the Indians.\n\nAs I understand the reasons offered by the Government for the proposed change of management are entirely unsatisfactory and do not relate themselves to the facts and conditions as they really are, I trust the Department will seriously reconsider their present proposals.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWN/LC\nOttawa, November 18, 1944.\n\nRe: Operation of Mohawk Institute.\n\nDear Bishop Heathcote:\n\nI have for acknowledgment Your Lordship's letter of November 10, in which you discuss the marginally-noted subject.\n\nYour letter, I may state, is one of a number of somewhat similar letters received recently by this Department, with respect to negotiations now pending between the Government and the New England Company.

For sometime past dissatisfaction has been steadily growing in Anglican circles over many aspects of our Indian work, and I have no hesitation in saying that the whole Church of England in Canada will be seriously disturbed if the proposed changes are carried out. Personally I have felt for sometime that the Anglican Church should be more militant, and the proposals that have been made regarding the Mohawk Institute will certainly have the effect of making us more aggressive.\n\nLet me express the sincere hope that wiser and happier counsels may prevail.\n\nI am,\nYours very truly,\n\nHarold E.

Hoey, Esq.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario,\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nCanon Townshend and I greatly appreciated our interview with you this morning and your courtesy and frankness in discussing with us, as you did, the future of the Mohawk Institute. We were sorry that Dr. Alderwood was unable to be with us.\n\nI am writing now to record our understanding of the matter discussed and the agreement reached.\n\nIn my letter to you of May 29th I summarized our interview of that date. A copy of that letter, together with your reply of June 3rd are before me as I write. Since my letter of May 29th I have written you on August 21st and October 19th telling of cables received from the New England Company enquiring as to the progress of negotiations and my replies, and again on November 8th stating, as already reported to you, that our Board of Management at its annual meeting had agreed to take over the administration of the Mohawk Institute. Your letters of August 23rd, October 19th, and October 23rd relating to these subjects were duly received.\n\nOur conference this morning helped greatly to clear away misunderstandings and enable us to see the real issue more clearly. This would seem now to narrow down to an alternative which you stated and which, at our request, you kindly agreed to put in writing. Our understanding of that alternative is:\n\n1. That Government, by the terms of the new agreement with the New England Company, continue the Institute under its direct administration; that the appointment of a Principal, acceptable to the Bishop of Huron, and a Chaplain nominated by him and the setting up of an Advisory Committee be provided for as outlined in my letter of May 29th and yours of June 3rd; and that this be regarded as an experiment for three - or possibly four - years, at the end of which time the whole matter would be reconsidered.\n2. That the Institute be placed under the administration of the Church of England through either the M.S.C.C. or the Diocese of Huron. In that case it was your opinion\n\na. That the agreement now under consideration between the New England Company and Government would need to be replaced by an agreement between the Company and M.S.C.C. or the Diocese of Huron.\n\nb. That Government would continue its per capita grants as paid in 1944.\n\nc. That with the discontinuance of the New England Company's annual grant, this would likely involve additional expenditure for M.S.C.C. - or the Diocese - of from $5,000 to $12,000 per annum.\n\nI feel sure it will help greatly in arriving at a definite decision to have the issue thus defined in the form of an alternative. I hope that such a decision may be reached when our Executive Committee next meets, which will be in February.\n\nMeanwhile, as agreed, I shall write to the New England Company telling them that the negotiations are proceeding, and that we hope to arrive at a definite and amicable agreement before the end of February.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLAD K.\nNovember 20, 1944\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has recently been brought to my attention that your department has under consideration a proposition by the New England Company that the Mohawk Institute on the Brantford Reserve be placed under the management of your department and that it is your policy to practically secularize the teaching of the Institute, having only a chaplain to visit occasionally and minister to the children of his own denomination. This after 150 years of faithful service on the part of the Church of England, which service has resulted in the Brantford Reserve being the outstanding Indian community in Canada. The plea is not \"Let well enough alone\" but let a magnificent work alone and allow it not only to carry on in the same successful way as in the past but give it the opportunity to still further develop its beneficent policies for our natives in that Reserve. Even in far off B.C., it has always been the privilege of the denomination which carries on the religious work in a native village to nominate the teacher for the day school and it has worked well, and it would be a tragedy to discontinue this policy. It would certainly be a still greater tragedy to take away this privilege from the church which has for so many years so successfully carried on the work of the Mohawk Institute on the Brantford Reserve.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nG.

While such policy does not bear immediately upon this Diocese, in my opinion its very nature may jeopardize the whole educational work of our Church in Canada among the scattered Indian population and may be considered the thin edge of the wedge in its relationship to future policy.\n\nThe work of our Church through the Indian Schools requires no words of mine to commend it. The influence upon the Indian population and the Schools' contribution to sound citizenship are well known to all interested people.\n\nThis letter is written with the hope that your Department may reconsider its proposed policy of secularization of this particular institute. The fact that our Church would be deprived of Governmental assistance is secondary. The future of our Indian population and their place in Canadian citizenship do weigh heavily with us.\n\nThat this communication may be received in the spirit in which it is written and that the Department and the Church may continue to co-operate fully in doing the best we can for our Indian population is our fervent wish.

Hoey, Esq.,\nActing Director of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Sir:\n\nThe matter of the Mohawk Institute, Brantford, being taken over by our Missionary Society was discussed on Tuesday of this week in Toronto by the Executive of our Society.\n\nI may say that the definite and authoritative step to the above end was taken last September by the parent body of our missionary work which we call the Board of Management. The Committee which met on Tuesday last in Toronto was only the Executive of this parent body and is therefore charged only with the carrying out of the directions of the Board of Management.\n\nIn undertaking this task the Executive Committee found itself in need of some further information on certain points with regard to the Mohawk Institution management, and it therefore deferred taking the necessary steps until its meeting next May.\n\nIf I understand the situation correctly there is a desire on the part of your Department to clear up the matter of the Principalship of the School. I may say that I see no obstacle to your Department taking whatever action you may think necessary in this important matter whenever it seems advisable to you. Any delay which has been caused on our part by deferring action until next May will not, in my opinion, seriously affect the question of the Principalship.\n\nI thought I should write to you and tell you what the situation is, and also express my opinion on the question of the Principalship.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nArchbishop of Huron\n\nCH/CJ\nFebruary 26th, 1945.\n\nThe Governor of the New England Company,\n26 Bloomsbury Square,\nLondon, W.C.,\nEngland.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wrote to you on December 2nd last, stating that I hoped that an agreement with the Department of Indian Affairs regarding the Mohawk Institute might be reached before the end of February. The matter came before the quarterly meeting of our Executive Committee last week. Although it was given full and careful consideration, it was not found possible to reach a final conclusion. I regret therefore that it has been found necessary to have the matter held over till our next quarterly meeting which will be in May.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I had hoped to be able to write and report definite action regarding the Mohawk Institute. Unfortunately I cannot. The two alternatives, as set out in my letter to you of November 30th last, were presented and given most careful consideration. But as it was not possible for the Committee to reach a definite decision, it was necessary to have the matter laid over till the next meeting, which will be in May.\n\nI am sorry that this will be a disappointment to you, as indeed it has been to me.\n\nI am writing to the New England Company and enclose a copy of my letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEvo.\nLAD K.\nOttawa, March 1, 1945.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Seager:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 23rd instant and have noted with interest the information contained therein.\n\nIn view of the fact that we have not yet received from the New England Company for execution by the Crown, the lease forwarded to them in July of last year, it is difficult for me to see how we can keep the Mohawk Institute open and in operation after the close of the present school year. I have not had an opportunity to give the matter the study to which it is, undoubtedly, entitled, but I doubt very much if we could use Parliamentary appropriations for the repair of a building that is not owned by the Government and is not under lease by the Government. I am definitely of the opinion also that we are not likely to receive this lease of which I speak from the New England Company until the Governor of that Company has an assurance from the Church of England authorities in Canada that the differences between them and the Government on the operating of the school have been amicably settled.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMost Reverend Charles Seager, M.A., D.D., LL.D.,\nArchbishop of Huron,\nBishop Croaya Hall,\nLONDON, Ontario.\n\nActing Director.\nMarch 21-45.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWill you please forward funds for Miss Susan Hardie's pension account.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nREQUISITION FOR CHEQUE\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\nDEPARTMENT: MINES & RESOURCES\nBRANCH: INDIAN AFFAIRS\nDATE: March 24, 1945\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE NO. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | Reverend M.

As His Grace was informed, the Acting Director has appointed a committee, consisting of the Superintendent of the Six Nations Agency, the Inspector of Indian Agencies for the province of Ontario and myself, to interview the applicants. It would be appreciated if you would meet this committee at the Indian Affairs Post Office Building, Brantford, Ont., on Monday, May 7, at 2 P.M. I trust I shall have the pleasure of meeting you at that time. Railway fare and maintenance at Brantford will be paid by this Branch.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J.

Hoey, Esq.,\nActing Director,\nIndian Affairs Department,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYour letter of the 18th received. I suggest for appointment to the Principalship of the Mohawk Institute the names of the Rev. J. Billingsley, now Rector of Holy Trinity Church, Chatham, and the Rev. J. R. Thompson, now Rector of Trinity Church, St. Thomas. I note your intention to select three of our officials to investigate the men suggested. It should be borne in mind that while Mr. Billingsley has no personal experience of farming he has served in country parishes where farming was the almost exclusive industry. Mr. Thompson was a farmer's son.\n\nWe have, of course, no intention of setting up any Administrative Board unless and until the administration of the Mohawk Institute passes over to the Church. Certainly as long as the School remains under the sole control of the Indian Affairs Branch your officials will be all that is necessary.\n\nI note that the salary for the Principal is at the rate of $125.00 a month together with provision for living quarters and free food. May I trouble you to inform me of this in Chaste at which Mr. Snell has been paid and whether he has the free use of a car and gasoline supply. Any Clergyman of ours with sufficient equipment for the task of Principal of the Mohawk Institute is already in receipt of a larger income, together with a house, than $125.00.\n\nI am, Yours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCH/CJ\nOttawa, April 16, 1945.\n\nDear Archbishop Seager:\n\nI am in receipt of Your Grace's letter of the 13th instant, in which you advise that you hope to be in a position to suggest the names of two or three Anglican Clergymen, who could be interviewed with a view to ascertaining if any of them would be suitable as Principal of the Mohawk Institute. When you let me have this information, it is my intention to select three of our officials to interview the gentlemen you suggest.\n\nAs you are aware, a new agreement with the New England Company has not yet been signed, and consequently, until this is done and the future management definitely settled, I feel it will not be necessary to set up the administrative Board suggested in the fourth paragraph of your letter. We have an experienced superintendent in charge of the Six Nations Agency and departmental officials are able to visit the institution frequently. Consequently, as long as the school remains under the sole control of the Indian Affairs Branch, I believe that our officials will be able to give the new principal any assistance or guidance that he may require.\n\nThe salary for the Principal is at the rate of $125.00 per month. Mrs. Snell has been acting as matron at a salary of $50.00 per month. Living quarters are provided in the institution. The Principal and his family have received free food.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMost Rev. C. A.

Snell of the Mohawk School.\n\nCanon Dixon informs me that you wish me to suggest to you the names of two or three Anglican Clergymen whom you, or members of your staff, might interview with a view to ascertaining if any of them would be suitable for carrying on the work of the Institute. He informs me that your idea is that the new Principal should be between thirty and forty years of age with some teaching experience and also reasonably good knowledge of farming.\n\nI have now that I have carefully considered the matter and find that I have at least three men here in the Diocese of whom, so far as can be expected, fit in with the qualifications here mentioned. I think before sending you their names I should interview them as to whether they would be interested in such a proposal. This I can do in the next day or two. I will then be in a position to write you definitely.\n\nIn considering the whole situation of the administration of the Mohawk Institute, particularly in view of the possibility of the Church taking it over, it has occurred to us that it might be very helpful if we set up a kind of administrative Board consisting of able and experienced men, particularly in farming and in business. This body, say three or four in number, could look after the administration of the business interests of the concern, and would likely be of great assistance to the Principal. I thought you might be interested to know of such an arrangement.\n\nIf you can give me any information as to the amount of salary to be paid the new Principal together with any other financial advantages the position carries with it, it would assist me in placing the matter before the men I have in mind. At present I can of course only go upon present arrangements. I understand that Mrs. Snell has acted as Matron of the Institution and has received\ncompensation for this service. I suppose the same would apply in the future.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nArchbishop of Huron.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nApril 11th, 1945.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nActing Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nFollowing receipt of your letter of April 6th and our conversation by telephone on April 9th, I telephoned Archbishop Seager and asked that he send to you the names of three Anglican clergymen, as indicated in the second paragraph of your letter. This he has promised to do, sending them direct.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLAD K.\nOttawa, April 10, 1945.\n\nDear Colonel Randles:\n\nOn my return to Ottawa I discussed with Mr. Hoey our interview on April 8. Following this, we communicated with Canon Dixon advising him that it was our intention to dispense with the services of the Reverend Mr. Snell at the end of the current academic year. We further advised him that we felt the Archbishop of Huron should be consulted with a view to having the latter suggest two or three Anglican clergymen whom we could interview with a view to ascertaining if any of them possess what we consider are the necessary qualifications to act as principal of this school. On receipt of our letter, Canon Dixon phoned Mr. Hoey on Monday of this week and stated that he was taking up the matter with the Archbishop of Huron and would advise us later. As soon as he does so, I shall communicate with you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division\n\nLt.-Col. E. F. Randles,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\ndefinite promise regarding the future, but, as intimated above, we feel it is essential that a new principal should be appointed for the next academic year.\n\nIt occurred to me that it would be of great advantage for us to again discuss the matter with you, and, as we would like to write to Archbishop Seager in the very near future, it would be appreciated if you could find it possible to visit Ottawa on April 9, 10 or 11. I trust your many other duties will permit you to visit this office on any of the dates just mentioned.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa, April 30, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Thompson,\n\nWe have been informed by His Grace the Archbishop of Huron that you are interested in the principalship of the Mohawk Institute at Brantford, Ont. As His Grace was informed, the Acting Director has appointed a committee, consisting of the Superintendent of the Six Nations Agency, the Inspector of Indian Agencies for the province of Ontario and myself, to interview the applicants. It would be appreciated if you would meet this committee at the Indian office, Post Office Building, Brantford, Ont., on Monday May 7 at 10 A.M. I trust I shall have the pleasure of meeting you at that time. Railway fare and maintenance at Brantford will be paid by this Branch.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J. R. Thompson,\nTrinity Church,\nSt. Thomas, Ont.\nOttawa, May 1, 1945.\n\nDear Archbishop Seager:\n\nI have Your Grace's letter of the 24th ultimo, suggesting the names of Rev. J. Billingsley, Chatham, Ont., and Rev. J.R. Thompson, St. Thomas, Ont., for consideration as Principal of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nI am writing both the above named gentlemen, requesting them to be at the Indian office in Brantford on Monday, May 7, at which time they will be interviewed by the Chief of the Training Division, the Inspector of Indian Agencies for Ontario and the Indian Superintendent for Six Nations.\n\nI regret that there was a slight mistake made in the last paragraph of my letter of the 18th ultimo. Mr. Snell is being paid $140.00 a month and, of course, we will allow the same amount to the new Principal. This salary, together with the perquisites such as living quarters, food, car and gasoline supply, etc., makes the position attractive from a financial standpoint.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nActing Director.\n\nMost Rev.

Snell was appointed Principal of the Mohawk Institute effective August 1, 1929.\n\nIn a letter dated June 29, 1929, on File 32-0-1, addressed to Ernest Mathews, Governor of the New England Company, Dr. D. C. Scott, who was then Deputy Minister, wrote in part as follows:\n\n\"I have had an interview with Mr. Snell. He is 49 years of age, was born in Canada and brought up on a farm\".\n\nIt will be noted from the above that Rev. Mr. Snell reaches his 65th birthday in 1945.\nOttawa, May 4, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Snell:\n\nSeveral months ago the Chief of the Training Division intimated to you that it had been decided to make a change in the principalship of the Mohawk Institute, effective July 1, 1945, and consequently that your services would not be required after that date.\n\nThis decision was again discussed with you and Mrs. Snell on October 12, 1944, on the occasion of one of Mr. Phelan's visits to the Mohawk Institute.\n\nAt this time I desire to confirm the decision already made, and it is expected that you will be prepared to vacate the position on the date mentioned above.\n\nWhile there is no regular provision for payment of retiring allowance or superannuation to Principals of Indian residential schools, it has been decided in your case to grant both you and Mrs. Snell an allowance equal to three months' salary.\n\nAt the present time the Department is making enquiries with a view to securing the services of another Principal.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

If an interview is desired, you will be advised later.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J. Billingsley,\nHoly Trinity Church,\nChatham, Ont.\nOttawa, May 9, 1945.\n\nDear Archbishop Seager:\n\nI desire to refer to my letter of May 1.\n\nOn April 30 Rev. J. Billingsley, of Chatham, and Rev. J. R. Thompson, of St. Thomas, were requested to meet three of our senior officials in Brantford on May 7. Our officers were in the Brantford office on that day, and a letter dated May 5 was received on Monday morning, in Brantford, from Rev. J. R. Thompson, stating that he had given the matter further consideration and had decided not to apply for the position of Principal of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nAt 11 o'clock in the morning, Rev. Mr. Billingsley phoned from Chatham to say that in view of the announcement made, regarding the conclusion of hostilities in Europe, he felt it undesirable to leave home.\n\nThe action taken by the two gentlemen mentioned above places us in a rather awkward position, as we have already notified Rev. Mr. Snell that his services will not be required after the end of June, and unless we have chosen, by that time, a principal whose qualifications appear suitable, there appears to be no other course than to close the school.\n\nIn arranging to have our officials in Brantford on Monday to interview the two gentlemen\n\nMost Rev. C. A. Seager, M.A., D.D., LL.D.,\nArchbishop of Huron,\nBishop Cronyn Hall,\nLondon, Ont.\nsuggested by you, it was felt it would be inferred that this Branch was doing everything possible to co-operate with you. I think you will agree that it is unreasonable to expect our officials to make another trip to interview applicants for this position. Is it your desire to make any further suggestion regarding persons who might be capable of accepting the appointment?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nActing Director.\nApril 7, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI received your letter informing me that we are to vacate this place on June 30th. I had heard rumours to that effect before but the last mention of the date was September last at which time Mr. Phelan said the new plan was to go into effect. When the new plan was discarded, I thought perhaps you would leave the matter of my continuing to the Church when they take over. In any case, I had in mind your very kind and understanding attitude when we were discussing the difficulty of a senior clergyman obtaining a suitable parish and your saying, \"You need not worry. We shall not set you out on the road.\" I observe the same kindness in your decision to grant us three months' salary after June 30th. I thank you very much for your consideration. I have no doubt that by God's blessing everything will work out satisfactorily.\n\nAgain thanking you for your kindness, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n11th May, 1945.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nIndian Affairs Department\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYour letter of the 9th received. I deeply regret the fact that the Rev. J. R. Thompson has withdrawn his name from nomination as Principal of the Mohawk Institute, and I further regret that Mr. Billingsley failed to meet your officials in Brantford as arranged.\n\nThe fact is that our Clergy were all under orders to stand by for any proclamation of German surrender so that they might hold Services on that day and I have no doubt that this was the reason for Mr. Billingsley's telephone call to say that he was unable to leave home.\n\nIt was also impossible to inform you as of course we had no means of knowing when the announcement would be made.\n\nWe greatly appreciate the full co-operation which your Department has given us in this matter, and I will write you tomorrow when I have had time to look into it further with regard to nominations. I have no doubt that we can have the matter settled before Mr. Snell's retirement becomes effective at the end of June.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCH/CJ\nPARLIAMENT BLDGS OTTAWA ONT:\n\nREGRET BILLINGSLEY COULD NOT GO TO BRANTFORD MONDAY BUT CLERGY HERE ORDERED TO STAND BY THAT DAY FOR ANNOUNCEMENT GERMAN SURRENDER AND TO HOLD SPECIAL THANKSGIVING SERVICE.

Randle, Superintendent of the Six Nations Agency, a number of matters relating to the operation of the Mohawk Institute and particularly the selection of a Principal to take charge immediately following Mr. Snell's resignation, which takes place on June 30th.\n\nThe officials here and Colonel Randle, after due deliberation, have decided on a course of action which we earnestly trust will meet with your approval. To avoid delay and unnecessary correspondence, I have asked Colonel Randle to arrange an interview with you at the earliest convenient date. Colonel Randle has been instructed to report the results of this interview to me immediately following his return to Brantford.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Director.\n\nThe Most Reverend Charles Seager, M.A., D.D., LL.D.,\nArchbishop of Huron,\nBishop Cronyn Hall,\nLONDON, Ontario.\nJune 1, 1945.\n\nDear Colonel Randle:\n\nThis will confirm the decision reached at a conference held in my office this morning (June 1, 1945) that Joseph C. Hill, new Principal of the two-room Indian Day School (No. II) in the Six Nations Agency, be offered the Principalship of the Mohawk Institute at Brantford. It was decided that Mr. Hill should be paid a salary at the rate of $1500.00 per annum, and that his wife, who has the qualifications necessary to act as Matron, be paid at the rate of $50.00 per month.\n\nIt is the feeling of the officials here that, while Mr. Hill is a capable, fully qualified and experienced teacher, he may nevertheless feel the additional administrative duties and responsibilities at the Institute somewhat exacting. This position is, as you know, an important one. The Mohawk Institute has always occupied a prominent place in the educational program of this Department. It has been decided, therefore, that Mr. Hill should be assisted in his work by the creation of an advisory board, the members of which board should meet at least quarterly - this board to consist of yourself as Chairman, the Public School Inspector of the district, the Clergyman in charge of the Mohawk Chapel and responsible for religious instruction at the school, the Chief of the Six Nations Band and the Principal of the School, Mr. Hill, as Secretary. It is our intention that this advisory committee should have general supervision of the work of the school and of the farming operations carried on as part of the regular school program. We are anxious that no radical change in the school program or in the operation of the farm or in the work of general administration should be undertaken without first being submitted for review to the advisory committee. While the Principal will be responsible for the employment and dismissal of the members of the staff, nevertheless staff matters might, with advantage to all parties concerned, also be reviewed by the members of the advisory board.\n\n......This school\nThis school, as you are no doubt aware, has been operated since its inception, with two exceptions, under the direction and guidance of Clergymen of the Anglican Church in Canada. The appointment of Mr. Hill, therefore, constitutes a somewhat radical change in policy, but one for which provision is made in the lease sent forward for execution to the New England Company. We do feel, however, that before the offer of the Principalship is made to Mr. Hill, the matter should be discussed with the Archbishop of Huron, and his consent, if at all possible, to the arrangement obtained. While we are under no legal obligation to consult the Archbishop in this regard, it is, in our judgment, of the utmost importance for the success of the school that he should sanction this change in policy, and that the closest possible cooperation should exist between the Archbishop and the Anglican Church authorities in the operation of this Residential School. Indeed, it would appear to us that under the new arrangement cooperation in the future should be as close, or perhaps closer, than it has been at any time in the past. Provision has been made in the new lease, copy of which is no doubt in the possession of the Archbishop, whereby an Anglican Clergyman will be employed to take charge of the Mohawk Chapel and this Clergyman also be responsible for providing religious instruction to the pupils enrolled at the school. This point should be emphasized by you in your interview with Archbishop Seager.\n\nIn view of these facts, it would be appreciated if you could make arrangements to interview Archbishop Seager at the earliest possible date. It would be appreciated also if you would let us have a report on the interview in due course.\n\nWe are asking Mr. Phelan to visit Brantford at a suitable date in the immediate future. Mr. Phelan will be in a position to supply you and Mr. Hill with full and complete information on the history of the school and the financial obligations assumed by this Department with respect to the maintenance and operation of the Institute. It will be highly desirable also, at the time of Mr. Phelan's visit, that the task of preparing a complete inventory of the assets of the school and the farm be undertaken.\n\nI have referred to the creation of an advisory board which, in our judgment, should be organized prior to the opening of the school on September 1st. In this connection, it is unnecessary to add that the decisions reached by the\n\n......school\nschool management and by the members of this board from time to time, must, of necessity, be subject to Departmental sanction and approval.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Director.\n\nLt.-Col.

Hoey,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe the Mohawk Institute. Under date of 12th May I telegraphed you, followed by a letter, explaining why none of my nominees for the position of Principal were able to meet your officials in Brantford regarding the appointment, asking whether you wished to make another.\n\nNot having heard from you in reply the matter was discussed by our committee in charge of the matter and it appeared obvious that you are awaiting fresh nominations, you having asked for three and only one proving available, namely the Rev. J. Billingsley. I am therefore now filling up the nominations to three as you request, all men between thirty and forty years of age.\n\nThe Rev. L. J. Patterson. He was born in Alvinston, Ontario in April, 1914. He is the son of a farmer and was brought up on the farm. He is a B.A. of Western Ontario and a graduate of Huron Theological College of this City. He was ordained to the Priesthood in 1940. He has served as a Clergyman in a rural parish and is now Rector of one of our newer Churches in the City of Sarnia. Mr. Patterson has therefore a background of farming experience and has exhibited in his work a definite administrative ability. It was for this reason he was placed in charge of the Church in Sarnia which at the time was in financial difficulties. Under his management the Church has been virtually cleared of debt and made marked progress. I have interviewed Mr. Patterson personally in the matter and I find that he is definitely drawn toward a very serious consideration of the work of the Mohawk Institute in case he should be selected. I have no hesitation whatever in recommending him. He is married with two young children, and his wife is a highly capable person. She came from the village of Thamesford and is therefore also acquainted with the farm element of our population.\n\nMy second nomination is the Rev. W. J. Zimmerman. He was born in 1905 and ordained to the Priesthood in 1936. He is an exceptionally able and experienced young man who is a specialist in education, particularly Religious Education. He is a Bachelor of Arts of Toronto University and has taken post graduate courses in Education since, working toward his M.A. He was born near the village of New\non a farm\nHamburg in Ontario and has therefore a background of rural experience,\nincreased greatly by having served in entirely rural areas, first\nin the Canadian Middle West and for the last few years in this\nDiocese. He has exhibited definite business and administrative\nability, and would be, we feel sure, very successful as Principal\nof the Institute. Mr. Zimmerman's wife is an extremely capable\nyoung woman and has made a specialty of work among children and\nyoung people and is possessed with definite administrative ability.\nShe also possesses the wisdom and temperament necessary to deal with\na staff of teachers and workers.\n\nI repeat the nomination of the Rev. J. Billingsley as to whom\nI think you have information. I have contacted Mr. and Mrs.\nZimmerman and am in a position to say that they are very definitely\ninterested in such work as that of the Mohawk Institute and are\nprepared very definitely to consider it.\n\nIn the meantime Colonel Randle had suggested the appointment of\nMr. and Mrs. Hill, who have certain qualifications for this work\nundoubtedly. Our committee, however, felt that as you were probably\nawaiting the completion of three nominations, we should take this\nstep before considering anything else.\n\nUnder date of 24th May, as I have said in a former letter to\nyou, I cabled the New England Company informing them of the readiness\nof the Synod of this Diocese to assume financial and administrative\nresponsibility for the Institute under the arrangement with the\nIndian Department to pay per capita grants. I have not heard from\nthem on the subject and have followed the cable with an Air Mail\nletter. The time is drawing on and I hope to hear from the Company\nat an early date.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCH/CJ\n\nP. S. If I may take the liberty of making a suggestion with a view\nto saving any trouble and expense to your Department, I think it\nwould be quite safe to leave the interviewing of these people to\nMr. Randle, the Indian Agent in Brantford. I have had a talk with\nMr. Randle recently and in view of my personal knowledge of the people\nI recommend and Mr. Randle's knowledge of the situation in the Institute\nas well as wisdom, I should think that the issue would be quite safe\nin our joint hands.\nOttawa, June 16, 1945.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Seager:\n\nI have received your letter of June 15th, and have noted with interest the suggestions contained therein.\n\nI found myself unable to reply to your telegram of May 15th for several reasons. First of all, I had no officials here with the time at their disposal necessary to return to Brantford with the object of interviewing the Clergymen nominated by you for the Principalship of the Mohawk Institute. Inspector Arnell is at present engaged in field work at Port Arthur. The Chief of the Training Division is, for the time being, responsible not only for his own work, but responsible also for the work of the Superintendent, and could not possibly leave Ottawa.\n\nI have found it difficult to reply also for the reason that we have not, in my judgment, the legal or indeed any authority to administer the Mohawk Institute in the absence of a duly executed lease. The revised lease was sent forward to the New England Company almost a year ago, but has not been returned. I did feel, however, and still feel that rather than close the school an attempt should be made to carry on until the Governor of the New England Company either returns the lease or until he informs us definitely that the Company is not prepared to renew it.\n\nIn the interval, the suggestion has been made that Joseph C. Hill, an experienced teacher, should be placed for the time being at least in charge of\n\n......the school,\nthe school, under the direction of an advisory committee. In view of all the circumstances and the uncertainty surrounding the appointment, the suggestion appeared to me to be a reasonable one; but before taking definite action, or indeed action of any kind, I asked Lt.-Col. Randle to discuss the matter with you personally. I feel sure the Government would not be prepared to proceed with this appointment even on a temporary basis unless Mr. Hill could have the active cooperation of the Anglican Church authorities.\n\nI might add that Mr. Hill has an outstanding record as a teacher. It is my understanding that he has had two attractive offers within the last couple of months - one from the City of Hamilton and the other from the City of Kingston. It is not at all likely, in view of these offers, that we shall be able to retain him in the two-room Indian Day School on the Reserve, of which he has been Principal for a number of years. In addition to Mr. Hill's qualifications, his wife seems particularly well qualified for the position of Matron. She is a graduate of Home Economics and has no family obligations. The fact that Mr. Hill has been suggested for this position is in itself a great tribute to the work undertaken and accomplished by the Church on the Reserve over a long period of years. I feel confident the selection of Mr. Hill would prove popular not only on the Six Nations Reserve, but would prove popular with the Indians throughout the country. You might, therefore, just as soon as you can conveniently do so, communicate either with Lt.-Col. Randle or myself with respect to this latest suggestion. The time, as you state, is short and action should be taken immediately if the school is to be kept open and in operation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Most Reverend Charles Seager, M.A., D.D., LL.D.,\nArchbishop of Huron,\nLONDON, Ontario.\nBRANTFORD 13th June, 1945.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq., Acting Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWith reference to the suggested appointment of Mr. Joseph C. Hill for the Principalship of the Mohawk Institute, I thought as the decision was being delayed by the Archbishop of Huron, that it would be well to advise you of what has happened to date.\n\nAs instructed on my return to Brantford from Ottawa, I visited the Archbishop at his office in London on the Monday after my return. While he seemed favourably inclined to the suggested appointment, he would not commit himself to any decision without an opportunity of meeting personally Mr. Hill. Consequently as he was visiting Brantford on the following Wednesday, I arranged a meeting between the Archbishop and Mr. and Mrs. Hill, naturally advising the latter that the whole matter was strictly confidential and on no account was to be mentioned in outside circles.\n\nSince that interview, nothing further was heard from the Archbishop until today when a letter was received and which unfortunately leaves things very indecisive.\n\nAs you will certainly appreciate fully an early decision on this matter is in the best interests of everyone, so for your information I am enclosing a copy of the Archbishop's letter, and perhaps you will take any steps you see fit to hasten up matters so that a final decision may be arrived at.\n\nYours truly,\n\nLt.-Col. E. P. Randle,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nEnc.\nBishop Cronyn Hall,\nLondon, Canada.\n9th June, 1945.\n\nColonel Randle,\nIndian Agent,\nBrant Reserve,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nDear Major Randle:\n\nFollowing the conversation I had with you and Mr. and Mrs. Hill on Wednesday, the suggestion made by you of the appointment of the latter as principal of the school with his wife as matron was fully discussed at a meeting of our Executive Sub-Committee yesterday.\n\nSomehow I omitted to refer in conversation with you to the fact that I had not had a reply from Mr. Hoey or his department to my telegram and letter of 8th May. You will, of course, recall the circumstances. Mr. Hoey had asked for three nominations of clergy of the Church of England. As it turned out, only one of them decided to meet the officials of the department in Brantford on Monday, 7th May. This was, however, the day when all were expecting the German surrender. The clergy were told to stand by their parishes awaiting the news. The man concerned telephoned Brantford, as you know, to say that he could not attend. As a consequence I received a letter from Mr. Hoey which contained, not unnaturally, a tone of criticism for our failure to co-operate. I therefore telegraphed him explaining the circumstances and followed it with a letter asking for another appointment. It is these messages to which I have received no reply.\n\nOur Committee yesterday felt that the probable reason for this is that Mr. Hoey was waiting for further nominations from me, since he had asked for three. This possibility had not occurred to me and I am therefore writing Mr. Hoey again at the request of the Committee making further nominations. As he had asked for the names of three clergy between thirty and forty years of age I feel that, if the above interpretation of the situation is correct, I should comply with his original request and I am doing so. It appeared to our Committee that this was the proper action to take at this stage rather than to decide upon the nomination of Mr. Hill. When I hear from the department I will of course communicate with you at once.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n(signed) Charles Huron\n21st June, 1945.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nFollowing your letter of 18th June, I called a meeting of our Committee to discuss the matter. The Committee asked me to state first how this matter stands, particularly as to the revised lease to which you refer as having been forwarded to the Company \"almost a year ago, but has not been returned\".\n\nWe had not been informed by the New England Company of this revised lease, the fact of which was brought to our attention accidentally. To the terms of this revised lease we offered strong objection, as the effect of them was to radically alter the whole religious character, atmosphere and purpose of the School. For this reason I cabled the New England Company under date of April 15th, 1944 to delay signature as it appeared altogether probable that the Church of England in Canada would be willing to assume responsibility for the School.\n\nThe fact is that the proposal stirred practically the whole Church of England in Canada into disapproval which was clearly expressed, and your Department withdrew it, substituting a second and much more favourable one. I am under the impression that this latter understanding was not communicated to the New England Company but awaited action here. I need not refer to its details which are, of course, known to you.\n\nUnder this new proposal the Bishop of Huron was to nominate a Priest of the Church of England properly qualified as Principal of the School, and the Department undertook to continue to pay the per capita grants. In the meantime, the assumption of the administrative responsibility for the School by the Church of England in Canada was still under consideration.\n\nPursuant to this new proposal I was asked to nominate three Priests of the Church of England to your Department from whom, after an interview by your officials, you might appoint a Principal. I complied with this, your own request, as soon as I could contact three such men. Unfortunately none was able to meet your officials on May 7th as arranged because the Clergy were all directed to be in their parishes awaiting the German surrender. Toward the end of May or the beginning of June Colonel Randle interviewed me with the proposal that Mr. and Mrs.\nAs per your instructions, please forward Institute Manual, Course Handbook, Institute Manual, and Letter Re: Institute Manual immediately. Government accepts responsibility for organization & school after June 30.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nHill should be appointed as Principal and Matron respectively, and on 6th June I met these persons in Colonel Randle's office. Following this interview I called our committee to discuss the matter again. The result was my letter to you of 15th June, in which I continue to comply with your request for the nomination of three Clergy. Any of those I nominated has every qualification for the position, particularly two of them, the Rev. L. J. Patterson and the Rev. W. J. Zimmerman, full information about whom I included in my letter. It will thus be seen that we here have been endeavouring to comply with your requests.\n\nOur committee further asks me to say that it is at a loss to know why your Department finds itself unable to make an appointment from one of these nominations, particularly in view of the fact that you yourself suggest the appointment of Mr. Hill. It is true, of course, that the lease forwarded to the New England Company \"almost a year ago\" has not been returned, but some understanding will ultimately be arrived at and in the meantime our committee realizes, as of course you do, the necessity of carrying on the School. There must be a Principal of the Institution and, our committee feels that my nominations should be acted upon.\n\nAfter careful discussion our committee is of the opinion that the appointment of an Indian as head of the Institution is definitely undesirable. This involves no criticism whatever of Mr. Hill whose qualifications as a teacher, and those of his wife as Matron, are appreciated. The committee believes, however, that the supervision of a staff of teachers and other officers in the School, always a difficult matter as experience has shown, is likely to be much more successful in hands other than those of an Indian, however well qualified he might be. In any case I have been but endeavouring to comply with your own request.\n\nAs the end of June is at hand, and Mr. Snell's retirement is presumably arranged for the end of that month, the committee suggests that, in order to have time to hear from the New England Company, Mr. Snell be continued temporarily in the position until September. Otherwise a disastrous situation must arise.\n\nThe Church of England in this Diocese represented by the official body, the Synod of Huron, is willing and well able to carry on the administration of this Institution in accordance with the undertaking of your Department to pay the per capita grants. We are convinced that it can be so managed to pay its way.\n\nI am today sending another Air Mail letter to the New England\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nCompany explaining to them the situation again and asking that they agree to lease the property to the Synod of Huron. There would appear to be no real reason why they should not comply.\n\nI am also sending a copy of this letter to the New England Company.\n\nI am,\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCH/CJ\n\nP.S. Enclosed herewith please find copy of my letter to the New England Company.\nIN ACCOUNT WITH\n\nJASPER, ALTA.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\n\nLOT RENTAL AS FOLLOWS\n\n| LOT | BLOCK | ARREARS | TOTAL |\n|-----|-------|---------|-------|\n|     |       |         |       |\n|     |       |         |       |\n\nTOTAL\n\nInterest at seven per cent is charged on rental not paid within six months of the due date, from the due date to date of payment.\n\nWhen remittance is made by cheque, such cheque must be marked \"Accepted\" by the Bank on which it is drawn and be payable at par at Banff.\n\nPLEASE BRING BILL WHEN MAKING PAYMENT\n\nSuperintendent\nCANADIAN NATIONAL TELEGRAPHIC\n\nCABLEGRAM\n\nHEAD OFFICE, TORONTO, ONT.\n\nSend the following Cablegram subject to the terms on the back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nDoctor Isaac Jones\nSecretary New England Company\n26 Bloomsbury Square\nLondon W C England\n\nOttawa June 28 1945\n\nNIGHT CABLEGRAM\n\nIs it your intention to renew Lease Mohawk Institute -stop- Unless assurance in this matter is received immediately Dominion Government cannot accept responsibility for operation of school after June thirty nineteen hundred and forty five\n\nCharge Indian Affairs Branch\nMines and Resources\nOttawa, June 28, 1945.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Seager:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of June 28th and have carefully noted the information contained therein.\n\nIn this connection, I am sending forward herewith copy of a telegram dated June 26, 1945, sent forward by me to the Secretary of the New England Company. The subject matter of this telegram, you will note, is self-explanatory. In the absence of a regularly executed lease, I find it difficult to understand how the Government could assume responsibility for the operation of the Mohawk Institute or for extending the service of the Principal now in charge. In view of the fact that this lease was sent forward to the Company about a year ago, one might reasonably expect a decision from them at an early date. I have asked the Chief of the Training Division to proceed to Brantford early next week to make an inventory of the stock on the school farm and the equipment at the school itself. This official will also attempt to reach an agreement with Superintendent Randle, whereby the latter will give nominal supervision to the farming and other operations at the school until we have an opinion from the New England Company with respect to the future of the Institution.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMost Reverend Charles Seager, M.A., D.D., LL.D.,\nArchbishop of Huron,\nBishop Cronyn Hall,\nLONDON, Ontario.\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa, June 29, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Snell:\n\nI understand from Colonel Randle that you have not been successful in obtaining a residence, and on his recommendation it has been decided to allow you to remain as Principal of the Mohawk Institute until July 31, 1945. It should be definitely understood that we will expect you to vacate your position by that date.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nActing Director.\n\nRev. H. W. Snell, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\n\nCOPY SENT TO COL. RANDLE\n21st June, 1945.\n\nThe secretary,\nThe New England Company,\n26 Bloomsbury Square,\nW.C.I., LONDON, England.\n\nMy dear Sirs,\n\nUnder date of June 8th I wrote you an Air Mail letter further explaining my cable of May 24th. In it I had stated that the Synod of Huron is prepared to assume full administrative and financial responsibility of the Mohawk Institute, the Department continuing to pay per capita grants. Having had no reply yet from you, though I know that the cable lines are heavily loaded with military and political messages just now, I think perhaps I had better write again to say to you that the situation in the Institute is acute.\n\nA revised lease was sent to you by the Indian Department over a year ago, the terms of which came to our attention only accidentally. They were, in our opinion, of a highly objectionable character, tending to a complete secularization of the School though the religious purposes of the School have been foremost throughout its history. I therefore cabled you under date of 15th April, 1944, asking you not to sign the lease as it was likely that the Church here would take over the administration of the School if you agreed.\n\nAs a result of negotiations with the Department the original terms of the above lease were altered and the Government undertook to accept my nominations for Principal and to continue the per capita grants. I do not know whether you have been informed of this change. We felt, however, that the control of the Church over the Institution should be quite definite as its influence is profound in its effects upon our mission work, particularly in the Mohawk reserve.\n\nMeanwhile negotiations were under way with the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada with a view to that body taking over the School with our assistance. These negotiations were somewhat prolonged and finally we came to the conclusion that\nThe Secretary,\nThe New England Company,\nLondon, England.\n\nIt would be better for the Synod of Huron itself to become responsible for administering the School. This was agreed to by the Synod of Huron last month and awaits only the assent of your Company to lease us the property for the above purpose. Arrangements had been made by the Department for the retirement of the present Principal, who has reached the age of retirement, at the end of this month, and in the meantime the Department had asked for nominations from me which I have given them.\n\nThe Department is fully aware of the extreme desirability of carrying on the work of the School but legally can not do so unless some form of agreement or lease is assented to by your Company. I have written the Department asking them to postpone the retirement of the present Principal until September to give us time to negotiate with your Company. I have no assurance however that this is to be the case. The situation therefore is critical, unless the Department agrees to a temporary arrangement such as I have proposed, the School will be closed and the staff and students dispersed. This would be a calamity of the first order and I am now writing to press the hope that we will be able to hear from your Company favourably to our suggestion at an early date.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nArchbishop of Huron.\n\nCH/CJ\nAS LANDLORDS MUST KNOW NEW FORM BEFORE AGREEING/IF YOU AND SYNOD ARE NOT AGREED AS TO VARIATION WE ARE PREPARED TO GRANT LEASE TO YOUR DEPARTMENT IN ORIGINAL FORM\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nLONDON 29 1920\n\nHOEY DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOTTAWA\n\nREFERENCE YOUR CABLE OF 27 JUNE NEW ENGLAND COMPANY INTENDS GRANT\nLEASE OF MOHAWK INSTITUTE.

I note the steps you propose to take this week with regard to the Mohawk Institute.\n\nSince your letter was written, however, the following cable has been received by me from the Company, and I understand one was by you received to a similar effect, your letter being dated 28th June and the cable 29th June:\n\n\"Reference your letter of 21 June. New England Company intends grant lease of Mohawk Institute. Only form of lease known to us is that sent to Hoey a year ago. If you and Hoey have agreed together and suggest new form of lease we as landlords must know new form before agreeing. If you and Hoey are not agreed as to variation we are prepared to grant lease to Canadian Government in original form. We have cabled Hoey today to this effect.\n\nCochrane Governor.\"\n\nSince receiving your letter and the cable, our Committee here has discussed the matter of the Mohawk Institute, and to facilitate the settlement of it makes the following suggestion. That the proposals suggested as amendments to the original ones made by your Department be the basis of a new lease between the New England Company and your Department.\n\nThe terms of the revised proposal in outline are:\n\n1. That the Principal of the Mohawk Institute be a Clergyman of the Church of England nominated by the Bishop of Huron and appointed by your Department.\n\n2. That an advisory committee be set up consisting of the Principal, the Indian Agent and a nominee of the Bishop of the Diocese.\n\n3. That this arrangement be tried out for three years and if any adjustments are found to be advisable they should be made at\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nthe end of that time.\n\nThe main reason for this suggestion by our committee is that The New England Company was informed about a year ago of this revised proposal and is therefore in a position to draft a form of lease in accordance with it without delay.\n\nOur Committee had felt when these proposals were first made that there are drawbacks to them, namely two in number. First that the period of three years is hardly long enough for a successful experiment. Secondly that it might be difficult to secure the right man as Principal if he should feel that his position should be in question after so short a period. Our Committee feels that a period of five years might be better.\n\nI took the opportunity yesterday of meeting Colonel Randle and informed him of the action of our Committee, merely with a view of his knowing what is in mind, particularly as your representative was to meet him in Brantford sometime this week.\n\nI very earnestly hope that this suggestion will meet with your approval so that this somewhat vexatious matter may be satisfactorily settled.\n\nI am, with kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nArchbishop of Huron\n\nP.S. In view of the suggestion put into this letter, which of course I believe that the New England Company will issue a letter to your Inspector of the Huron Institute, for the terms referred to, I see no reason why I should not add the name of the Rev. Gilbert Ironspon to my list of nominees.

This money was placed in a special Trust Account and was expended from time to time, as required.\nOttawa, July 9, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nIn accordance with your instructions,\nMr. W. S. Arneil, Inspector of Indian Agencies for Ontario;\nLt.-Colonel E. P. Nandle, Superintendent of the Six Nations Agency; and myself interviewed the under-mentioned gentlemen, recommended by His Grace the Archbishop of Huron as suitable candidates for the position of Principal of the Mohawk Institute, Brantford, Ont.:\n\n1. Rev. W. J. Zimmerman:\n\nMr. Zimmerman is 39 years of age and was ordained to the Priesthood of the Church of England in 1936. Since that date he has held two or three parishes and, in addition, has spent some months with Canon Paul, who is the Anglican Missionary on the Big Island Lake Indian Reserve, Onion Lake Agency, Saskatchewan. Mr. Zimmerman possesses a B.A. Degree from Toronto University and an M.A. Degree from Columbia.\n\nMr. Zimmerman has conducted Children's Camps for three years during the summer months and has always had very close connection with the Young People's Organizations of the Church of England. He was born on a farm and has a background of rural experience, which he claims to have increased by serving entirely in rural areas. He has one child and it is stated that his wife would be capable of carrying out the duties of Matron.\n\n2. Rev. J. Billingsley:\n\nMr. Billingsley has served in four different parishes for the past 15 years. He is 56 years of age and has one child. He holds a B.A. Degree from Western University. He has a pleasing personality and made a good impression. He is reasonably familiar with farming conditions, as he has served almost exclusively in country parishes.\n\n3. L. J. Patterson:\n\nMr. Patterson is at present Rector of Church of England in Sarnia. He served for the past six years in rural parishes. He is 31 years of age and has two children.\n\nMr. Patterson holds a B.A. Degree from Western University. His wife is 26 years of age and before her\nmarriage she taught school, being a Normal-trained teacher. Mr. Patterson has considerable knowledge of farming, as he was born and raised on a farm and during his university course spent his summers at farm work.\n\nAll three of the above-named gentlemen made a very excellent impression on the Committee, and while none of them can be said to have any actual knowledge of Indian work or the work in an Indian residential school, at the same time their educational qualifications and general knowledge appear sufficient to justify the belief that any one of them would probably make a reasonably good principal. However, if a choice was being made, the Committee was unanimous in agreeing that Rev. Mr. Zimmerman should receive first consideration as, while the other two had some advantages, he appeared to be the best qualified.\n\nBefore making a decision on the principalship of this school, the committee felt that we should again bring to your attention the suggestion to appoint Mr. J. C. Hill, a member of the Six Nations Band, as principal. Mr. Hill, as you know, has given several years of splendid service on the Six Nations Reserve, as teacher at two or three of the Indian day schools. Mr. Hill is a Normal-trained teacher, 31 years of age. In addition to his Normal training, he possesses the following special certificates: Manual Training; Agriculture and Horticulture, Physical Training; Recreational Leadership and Religious Instruction. Obtaining the agricultural and horticultural certificates necessitated his attending Ontario Agricultural College, Guelph, for 2 years. He also spent two years at the Teachers' Training College at Hamilton. While attending O. A. C. and college, he devoted a great deal of his spare time and the holiday periods in working for a large grocery firm in the vicinity. For the last three years he did all the purchasing. This work necessarily gave him considerable business experience. Mr. Hill's wife is 26 years of age and spent two years at Macdonald College, where she took the Home Economics course. Later, and previous to her marriage, she was employed by the Department for some time at the Lady Willingdon Hospital.\n\nAs you are aware, we have approved Mr. Hill's conducting social gatherings for the younger people on the Six Nations Reserve during the past three years. These gatherings were both recreational and educational and Mr. Hill has always had a very large attendance of Indian youth, both male and female. It is reasonable to infer, from their interest in Mr. Hill's courses, that he has the sympathy of his own people, and, if he were appointed principal, the committee believe that he would be strongly supported by the members of the Six Nations Band.\n\nThe committee feel, from their knowledge of Mr. and Mrs. Hill, that they are capable of carrying out the duties of Principal and Matron of the Mohawk Institute. In addition, such an appointment would definitely indicate\nthat the Department is prepared to recognize Indians who have ability and training for positions.\n\nSince 1929, Rev. Mr. Snell, who is just retiring as Principal, has been in charge of this school. He, of course, is an Anglican Minister. Previous to his appointment, however, the principalship of this school had been in charge of lay people for many years.\n\nIn brief, the conclusions of the committee comprising Mr. Arneil, Colonel Randle and myself, are:\n\n(1) If the Department feels that the recommendation of His Grace, the Bishop of Huron is to be accepted, we recommend the appointment of Rev. Mr. Zimmerman, effective August 1, 1948; (2) for the reasons stated above, we feel that it would be preferable to give favourable consideration to the appointment of Mr. J. C. Hill.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n26, Bloomsbury Square,\nLondon, W.C.\n\n26th June 1945.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMOHAWK INSTITUTE.\n\nAt a meeting of the Court of the New England Company held on the 13th June 1945 the Court had before it the following telegram from the Archbishop of Huron dated 25th May 1945:\n\n\"Huron Synod prepared assume full administrative and financial responsibility Mohawk Institute Department agree continue capita grants advise me acceptance such agreement\".\n\nYou will remember that the lease of the Mohawk Institute granted by the Company to your Department expired on the 1st January 1943 and on its expiry the Company's obligation to pay \u00a31000 p.a. towards the stipend of the Principal of the Institute and its maintenance ceased. In these circumstances it was our intention at first to grant your Department a new lease of the Institute (excepting the Chapel) for a period of 21 years, under the terms of which your Department would be responsible for maintenance, repairs and insurance, and our Company would be responsible for the upkeep of the Chapel and the payment of the Chaplain's stipend.\n\nAt this stage the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada (hereinafter called \"the Missionary Society\") intervened and requested that the Institute instead of being under the supervision of the Diocese of Huron (as heretofore) should be placed under the supervision of the Missionary Society, adding that the Diocese of Huron favoured this change. In view of the Missionary Society's intervention we decided not to execute the proposed lease in your favour at that time, but to await the outcome of negotiations which we understood were progressing between your Department and the Missionary Society. We have now heard from the Missionary Society that in their opinion the historic connection of the Church of England with the Mohawk Institute is sufficiently safeguarded by the draft agreement between your Department and our Company.\n\nThe Archbishop of Huron, on the other hand, writes in confirmation of his telegram urging that the Synod of his Diocese should assume responsibility for the administration of the School.\nAs our negotiations were originally conducted with you we would be glad to hear from you as to whether the Archbishop's proposals meet with your approval. If they do, we assume that we should grant a lease of the Institute in favour of the Diocese of Huron rather than in favour of your Department. If the lease is to be in favour of the Diocese of Huron, we should require to be informed of the name of the trustees or of the trust corporation which holds their property.\n\nPresumably, the Chapel should be included in such a lease. In this connection we wish to set on record that we are still willing and desire to pay the stipend of the Chaplain and to pay for the upkeep of the Chapel, but that we are unable to make further financial provision towards the Institute.\n\nWe assume that it will not be necessary for your Department to be parties to a lease in favour of the Diocese of Huron, and that any arrangements reached between that Diocese and your Department (such as for example those relating to per capita grants) will be dealt with separately in some document to which our Company need not be a party. If, however, this assumption is wrong, perhaps you would be good enough to inform us of any terms you would like included in the lease.\n\nWe shall be very grateful for any assistance you can give us in this matter, which we should like to see settled at an early date on terms satisfactory to all parties. We are sending a copy of this letter to the Archbishop of Huron, who will no doubt answer our query as to the name of the body or persons who normally hold as trustees the property of the Diocese.\n\nWe are, dear Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGovernor,\nNEW ENGLAND COMPANY.\n\nThe Minister of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 10, 1948.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Bourne:\n\nI have received your letter of July 3rd and have noted with interest the suggestions contained therein.\n\nIn this connection, I am sending forward for your personal information copy of a memorandum received by me from the Chief of the Training Division immediately following Mr. Phelan's return from Brantford. It occurred to me that it was only fair to Your Grace and to the members of your committee that you should have, before making a final decision, these recommendations before you.\n\nI still find the proposals now before me for the operation and management of the Mohawk Institute somewhat disturbing and I am anxious to do everything humanly possible to make the position of the Minister and the Government clear and unassailable, in case this matter becomes a subject of public discussion. Indications at present are that the Minister will be called upon to defend his position in the House of Commons, regardless of what action we are likely to take at this time.\n\nThe agreements reached between the Government and the New England Company have been over a long period of years amicably satisfactory. The financial burden, however, of maintaining this institution has been borne almost wholly by the Canadian taxpayers. The records indicate that during the last twenty-year period we have spent approximately $50,000.00 on the repair and upkeep of the school. These figures do not include the $5,000.00 received annually from the\n\n...New England Company.\nNew England Company. In addition to this, our per capita grants have amounted to approximately $4,000.00 annually. It will thus be seen that the Government is deeply interested in the school from the standpoint of public expenditure.\n\nThe Government too must assume a measure of responsibility for the administration of the school farm. This land is, as you are no doubt aware, the property of the Six Nations Indians and is steadily increasing in value from year to year. Just what position the school would be in if the Six Nations Council decided to have this land subdivided and sold for the construction of houses, I am not, of course, in a position to state. Am I correct in assuming that the Diocese of Huron has never at any time contributed to the upkeep or operation of this particular school?\n\nThe proposal that came to me first from Lt.-Colonel Mandle, that Mr. J. C. Hill be appointed principal of the school with the cooperation of an advisory committee\u2014one member of which would be nominated by you\u2014seemed at the time it was made, a rather happy solution to a somewhat involved and perplexing problem. I make this statement remembering that the members of the Six Nations Council, at an interview with me a couple of months ago, were very critical of the institution and particularly of the training in farming and agricultural operations provided for the senior boys. Indeed, one member of the Council expressed the view that the time had come when serious consideration should be given by the Council to the withdrawal of the farm lands, which were not, in his judgment, being used to the advantage of the Indians. It is significant that no formal agreement appears to exist between the New England Company and the Six Nations Council, or between the Six Nations Council and the Government, with respect to the use of the school farm.\n\nI am personally disposed to think that our failure to appoint Mr. Hill to the principalship, in view of his outstanding qualifications and the offers he has received from other schools, will create an unfavourable reaction on the part of the Indians and one that is not likely to contribute to the success of the Institute. Indeed, I feel so strongly on this that I consider at the moment that the matter is one that\n\n........might well\nmight well be discussed with the Council before the appointment is announced.\n\nWhile I have no desire to comment upon the action of the Missionary Society of the Church of England, nevertheless in fairness to the Government the position taken by them, namely, that the original lease sent forward to the New England Company for execution sufficiently safeguarded the historic connection of the Church of England in Canada with the Mohawk Institute - will, I feel sure, make the position somewhat embarrassing for the Government when this fact becomes known to the Six Nations Councils. In addition to this, the records disclose that for a period of years the principalship of this school was occupied by a layman, and the Indians are likely to interpret the appointment of a clergyman at this time as discrimination against a man who is exceedingly popular on the Reserve and who has displayed rare gifts of leadership.\n\nThe final decision must, of course, rest with the Minister; but before submitting the matter to him for his consideration, I am anxious that conditions at the school and the future of the Institution and its relationship to the Indian population - particularly the Six Nations Indians, with whom the Church of England has been associated in missionary effort for a century or more, should be carefully reviewed by your committee, and a reply sent forward which I can, in due course, submit to the Minister of this Department for consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMost Reverend Charles Cesar, M.A., D.D., LL.D.,\nArchbishop of Huron,\nBishop Cronyn Hall,\nDirector.\nLON.-N., Ontario.\nStatement of Expenditures, with the exception of Per Capita Allowance Payments, at The Mohawk Institute.\n\n| Fiscal Year | Amount   | Fiscal Year | Amount   |\n|-------------|----------|-------------|----------|\n| 1920-21     | $1,700.00| 1932-33     | $8,000.00|\n| 1921-22     | $4,600.00| 1933-34     | $1,200.00|\n| 1922-23     | $10,000.00| 1934-35     | $3,000.00|\n| 1923-24     | $14,200.00| 1935-36     | $55.00   |\n| 1924-25     | $1,000.00 | 1936-37     | $13.00   |\n| 1925-26     | $2,000.00 | 1937-38     | $40.00   |\n| 1926-27     | $2,654.00 | 1938-39     | $89.00   |\n| 1927-28     | $9,800.00 | 1939-40     | $261.00  |\n| 1928-29     | $5,100.00 | 1940-41     | $100.00  |\n| 1929-30     | $5,100.00 | 1941-42     | $80.00   |\n| 1930-31     | $8,500.00 | 1942-43     | $80.00   |\n| 1931-32     | $1,800.00 | 1943-44     | $97.00   |\n\nNotes:\n\nSince 1935-36 practically all repairs, etc., have been paid from the funds provided by the New England Company during the term of the old lease. During the period the lease was in operation the New England Company allowed the payments of $15,000.00 a year towards current expenses. This money was placed in a special Trust Account and was expended from time to time, as required.\nGROUND FLOOR\n\nFront Verandah:\n2 oak benches\n6 chairs\n8 rugs and 1 mat\n6 cushions\n\nEntrance Hall:\n3 chairs\n1 bench\n\nOfficers' Sitting Room (Left of Entrance Hall)\n5 chairs (4 leather seated and 1 desk chair)\n1 sofa\n13 cushions\n1 card table\n1 library table\n1 stool\n5 rugs - also 1 winter rug in storage\n1 coal scuttle and set of steel fire irons\n1 record table\n\nIndian Visiting Room (to Right of Entrance Hall)\n1 piano\n1 piano stool\n1 rug\n5 chairs\n1 library desk\n1 collection box\n1 cup presented to Indian Cadets\nseveral pictures\n\nMain Hall:\n1 bookcase (4 section)\n1 hall stand\n1 medicine chest\n2 broom cupboards with contents\n2 fire gong and bell boxes on electric system\n\nOfficers' Dining Room:\n6 dining chairs\n2 arm chairs & 1 rocker\n1 side table\n1 buffet\n27 table napkins\n7 cloths\n1 dinner set (part, & new one)\n2 round casseroles\n1 pie dish\nGROUND FLOOR (Cont'd.)\n\nOfficers' Dining Room (Cont'd.)\n\n6 stainless steel knives - large\n12 \" \" \" \" small\n10 small dinner forks\n15 large \" \"\n10 tea spoons\n10 dessert spoons plated\n5 table spoons\n8 butter knives\n6 extra tea spoons\n\nOfficers' Kitchenette:\n\nCupboard, electric stove, table, sink & drain board\n1 marble pastry shelf\nkitchen utensils\n1 electric toaster\n\nOffice:\n\n2 office desks\n1 typewriter desk\n3 letterhead and bottles\nrulers\nscissors } small quantity\nstationery }\n1 typewriter chair\n2 office chairs\n1 filing cabinet (4 sections)\n1 steel filing cabinet\n1 typewriter (Underwood No. 5)\n1 bookcase\n\nStock Cupboard:\n\nStationery\nSchool books - fair supply on hand\nMedicines - fair supply\n\nBack Vestibule:\n\n1 broom cupboard\n1 refrigerator for officers\n\nBoys' Master's Bedroom:\n\n1 bed and mattress\n1 chiffonier\n1 rug\n2 chairs\n1 table\n\nHousekeeper's Room:\n\n1 \" \"\n1 dresser\n2 chairs\n1 table\n1 rug\n1 waste paper basket\nGROUND FLOOR (Cont'd.)\n\nNote for each Officer's Bed:\n3 sheets\n1 counterpane 2 governesses\n3 blankets 2 housekeepers\n2 pillows 1 man\n4 pillow cases 1 sewing teacher\n1 bed rug\n\nCattleman's Bedroom:\n1 dresser\n2 rugs\n5 chairs\n1 library table\n1 bed, complete\n\nSewing Teacher's Room:\n1 bed\n1 dresser\n2 chairs\n1 table\n2 rugs\n1 desk\n1 wardrobe\n\nAssistant Housekeeper's Room:\n1 bed\n2 chairs\n1 dresser\n2 rugs\n1 table\n1 small wardrobe\n\nSenior Teacher's Room:\n1 bed\n1 table\n1 chair\n1 wardrobe\n1 dresser\n1 bookcase\n1 desk table\n1 waste paper basket\n\nOfficers' Bath Rooms:\n8 stock cupboards & linen shelves\n11 smooth towels 2 for each\n20 rough towels\n1 chair\n1 soiled clothes basket\nGROUND FLOOR (Cont'd.)\n\nSewing Stock Cupboard:\n\n24 boxes thread, in use\nAssortment of needles - hook eyes - darning & mending cotton.\n1 bolt factory cotton\n1\u00bd bolts blue uniform\n22 boys' towels (1 issue) new\n13 new sheets\n4 bolts sheeting\nstockings - most of them have been used & are now mended.\n24 girls' towels (1 issue) new\n98 kitchen aprons\n120 new shirts (boys')\n16 bloomers\n1 ruffle of overalls to be mended\n5 bolts towelling\n246 pairs new stockings - girls' & boys'\n9 pairs socks\n45 suits boys' underwear\n24 drawers - boys'\n\nJunior Teacher's Room:\n\n1 bed, complete\n1 bureau\n2 chairs\n2 rugs\n\nSenior Classroom:\n\n35 old double desks\n8 benches\n1 piano\n2 book cupboards\n1 pupils' book cupboard\n1 teacher's desk\n1 church desk\n1 teacher's chair\nmap case, with maps\n1 clock\n\nSewing Room:\n\n6 sewing machines - all in reasonable condition\n1 large table\n1 work table\n1 organ\n1 book cupboard\nracks for pupils' clothing & supply cupboards\n2 benches\n2 chairs\n1 high step ladder\n2 clothes racks\nGROUND FLOOR (Cont'd.)\n\nSewing Room: (Cont'd.)\n\nClothing for each girl:\n\n1 heavy coat - in stock cupboard\n1 best winter uniform\n1 school winter uniform\n2 aprons for school\n1 best cotton dress\n1 school uniform\n1 set of work dresses for summer\n1 = = = aprons =\n2 sets of underwear\n1 pr. low shoes (best)\n1 pr. school shoes\n1 old set of high shoes to start next winter\n1 new hat (recently issued)\n1 esp (1 yr. old - in good condition)\n\n1 heavy tan\n\nIn addition to above, there is in stock for girls requiring them:\n\nset of kitchen aprons\n= = dining hall aprons\n= = laundry aprons\n= = scullery =\n= = kitchenette aprons\n= = aprons for girls in Principal's quarters.\n\nBoys' Clothing:\n\nThere is on hand a considerable quantity of clothing that has been used by the boys.

While visiting the school I was accompanied by Indian Superintendent Randle and we had several discussions, both with the Principal, Mr. Snell, and with the Matron, Mrs. Snell.\n\nAttached to this memorandum is an inventory of the government property on hand at the Mohawk Institute on July 7, 1945. I wish to bring the following matters to your attention:\n\n1. All the farm machinery is in serviceable condition and has received careful attention by the farmer; when not in use, it is stored at all times in sheds for the purpose.\n\n2. We found that while there is a reasonably adequate quantity of clothing on hand for the girls, the supply of clothing for the boys for the coming academic year, including shoes and rubbers, is very limited, and a considerable quantity of the articles mentioned will have to be purchased before September 1.\n\n3. Generally speaking, the school is in reasonably good condition, although some of the rooms require painting. The Principal assured us that the plumbing and heating were now perfectly satisfactory and there should not be any heavy expenditure required in the immediate future.\n\nThe south side of the roof of the main barn requires immediate repairs in order to prevent future possible damage. The repairs required should not involve any heavy expenditure.\n\n4. When Mr. Snell became Principal he brought his own car. Later this car was turned in when purchasing a new car. At that time the turn-in value of the car owned by Mr. Snell was $1,000.00. The car at present in use has only a turn-in value of $89.00. Mr. Snell felt that he should be allowed to take this old car, in view of the fact that he had supplied the first car. I thought this was reasonable and approved of such action. As a matter of fact, he has always carried the licence of the car in his own name. When the new Principal is appointed the question will arise about\nthe purchase of a car for him and I feel that we should purchase the car outright and have it licensed in the name of the School.\n\n6. The truck that we purchased several years ago was completely worn out about 8 or 9 months ago and was sold by the Principal for $150.00, which amount Indian Superintendent Randle considered reasonable. The school actually needs a small truck for carrying garden produce and the greenhouse plants, etc., to the Brantford market. Early consideration should be given to the purchase of this vehicle.\n\n7. I also attach to this report a statement prepared by Mr. Bertho, Departmental Auditor, with reference to the farming operations for the fiscal years 1943-44 and 1944-45. Colonel Randle and I reviewed these and the former considered them reasonably satisfactory, but he feels that a new principal could make a better showing by keeping a stricter supervision on the operations of the farm and greenhouse. The farmer, Mr. Haworth, has been in our employ for several years and has an excellent knowledge of farming. He is a splendid worker. As stated above, the machinery is kept in excellent condition and the farming operations are carried out efficiently. However, there is no doubt that if the Principal gave more personal attention to this phase of the school's work, it would be an encouragement both to the farmer and the gardener to put forth extra effort.\n\n8. In visiting the dormitories it was found that practically all the mattresses are in very poor condition, and I strongly recommend that before the school reopens in September new mattresses be purchased. There is approximately $4,500.00 still remaining in the Trust Fund where we deposited the payments made by the New England Company, and when the new principal is appointed, I suggest that we allow him funds from this account to purchase the new clothing and also use part of this fund for the purchase of mattresses and for other repairs and purchases previously mentioned.\n\n9. Staff: On July 7, 1945, the staff of the School was as follows:\n\n| Name               | Position                  | Salary |\n|--------------------|---------------------------|--------|\n| Rev. H.

Ramsay     | Dietitian (Jr.)           | 420.00 |\n| Mrs. Bennett       | Seamstress                | 480.00 |\n| Mr. G. Haworth     | Farmer                    | 1,080.00 |\n| Mr. W.A. Ramsay    | Gardener                  | 960.00 |\n| Mr. Thorpe         | Boys' Master & Poultryman | 900.00 |\n| Mr. H. Barton      | Teamster                  | 720.00 |\nAs you are aware, Reverend Mr. Snell and Mrs. Snell have been instructed to vacate the building on July 31, 1945.\n\nMrs. Smith, who has been acting as assistant matron, is willing to stay until September 1, at which time she will have to be replaced, as she does not wish to return to the school.\n\nMrs. Thorpe is only acting temporarily as senior dietitian and another appointment will have to be made to this position by September 1.\n\nWith the exception of the positions mentioned above, all other members of the staff have intimated that they are willing to remain.\n\n10. By an old agreement between the New England Company and Dr. R. F. Palmer, of Brantford, the latter has been the medical officer for the school for a great many years. He has been allowed only $100.00 a year\u2014which amount has been paid from school funds\u2014for his services. In case of serious illness, pupils are either sent to the Lady Willingdon Hospital on the Reserve or placed in the Brantford City Hospital. In the latter case, accounts are rendered to this Branch for payment. Dr. Palmer is advancing in age and has not enjoyed good health and, when illness occurs, it is frequently impossible to obtain his services. I feel that the medical services at this school should be handled by our Medical Division and the cost of doctor's services should be paid from the Medical Appropriation, in the same manner as at other Indian residential schools. It may not be possible to effect this change immediately, as, from the information I received, it is evident that Dr. Palmer regards the Mohawk Institute as one of his special duties and when he was in good health he visited the school at every possible opportunity.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nRA25643 DL=LONDON ONT 17 1158A\nR A HUEY DEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS=\nPARLIAMENT BLDGS OTTAWA ONT=\n\nYOU ARE AWARE BY LETTER JULY THIRD APPOINTMENT REVEREND GILBERT THOMPSON TO HONHAWK INSTITUTE ACCEPTABLE TO US IF NOT ACCEPTABLE TO YOU PLEASE GIVE EARLY DATE FOR DEPUTATION TO MEET YOU=\n\nC'A SEAGER ARCHBISHOP OF HURON.\n\nFORM 6122\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to:\n\nMost Reverend Charles Seager,\nArchbishop of Huron,\nBishop Croyn Hall,\nLONDON, Ontario.\n\nOttawa, July 18, 1945.\n\nGILBERT THOMPSON NOT INTERVIEWED BY OUR OFFICIALS AT BRANTFORD STOP SUGGEST DEPUTATION REPRESENTING YOUR DIOCESE MEET ME AT OTTAWA TUESDAY JULY TWENTY-FOUR\n\nCharge to Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\n26, Bloomsbury Square,\nLondon, W.C.\n\n29th June 1945.\n\nThe Acting Director,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMohawk Institute,\n\nWe hereby acknowledge receipt of your cable reading as follows:\n\n\"Is it your intention to renew lease Mohawk Institute stop\nUnless assurance in this matter is received immediately\nDominion Government cannot accept responsibility for operation\nof school after June thirty nineteen hundred and forty-five -\nR.

A. Hoey,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of 10th July re the Mohawk Institute. When it arrived I hopefully assumed that it would contain your appointment of one of my nominees as Principal. It was therefore a matter of deep regret that such was not the case.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to recall the fact that as a result of a conference between yourself, Canon Townshend and Canon Dixon, and of subsequent negotiation with the latter, the \"original lease\" proposed between the New England Company and your Department was amended. The main amendment was that the Bishop of Huron should nominate Clergy of the Church of England from whom your Department might make a selection of Principal.\n\nPursuant upon this understanding, you wrote asking me to nominate such Clergy between thirty and forty years of age. The Archbishop made up yourself, I believe, in accord with the above understanding. I followed literally, even to the ages of the men nominated. We here fail to see why this clear arrangement has been followed by a suggestion that a Mr. Hill, whom I did not nominate, should be appointed, which we regard as not in accord with the terms of our understanding. We have, of course, no criticism to make of Mr. Hill who has certain qualifications which I nominated; however, particularly the Rev. W. J. Zimmerman, are as well qualified academically as Mr. Hill, and in other vitally important respects have qualifications which he cannot be expected to possess.\n\nFrankly the reason alleged in favour of Mr. Hill, namely that it would please the Six Nations Council but that failure might result in hostile feeling on the part of the latter, while of course reasonably strong, does not begin to weigh with another fact of which we are thoroughly aware. It is that among the Church of England people in this Diocese, and in\nproportionate measure throughout the Dominion of Canada at large, is a rising tide of concern over this matter which at any moment might turn into resentment which without doubt would express itself actively. I beg you to accept this assurance as a matter of fact. Only prompt action along the lines of our understanding will allay this. We are deeply concerned about this aspect of the matter. We should greatly regret if any embarrassment were caused the Minister through this business but if it drags on we are of the opinion that it is likely to be inevitable in any case.\n\nWe are surprised that the Resolution of the Executive Committee of our Missionary Society sent you by Canon Dixon should have been interpreted as referring to the \"original lease\" as \"sufficiently safeguarding the historic connection of the Church of England with the Mohawk Institute.\" The reference in the Resolution is to the \"original lease\" as amended at the conference above referred to. It was precisely because the \"original lease\" was wholly unsatisfactory that Canons Townshend and Dixon interviewed you with the result that it was amended. We telephoned Canon Dixon Friday morning asking him to make this clear to you.\n\nIt is not surprising that the Six Nations Council should have been concerned over the management of the farm. It is exactly because we recognized this fact and believe that the farm can be made to pay that the Synod of Huron was prepared to assume financial responsibility. Under any of the men I nominated, assisted by the advisory committee, undoubtedly this would be the result.\n\nMay I again point out that we have endeavoured to assist you and your Department in every way in this matter. The cable recently received from the New England Company we interpreted as implying a preference for a lease between that body and the Government. We therefore dropped our suggestion that the Synod of Huron should assume responsibility, doing so in the hope that it would facilitate matters.\n\nWe also understood that your Department had in mind the name of the Rev. Gilbert Thompson as Principal, until recently head of the Moose Factory School. Assuming this to be true, I conceded this point as well in a postscript to my letter to you dated 3rd July, 1945.

A.

I suggest that if you do not see your way clear to take this action that you receive a deputation from the Synod of Huron to discuss the matter further for which we shall be glad to be informed as to the date and time. The appointment of the Rev. G.

Isaac Jones\nTreasurer.\nOttawa, July 25, 1945.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Benson:\n\nI am sending forward herewith for your information copy of a telegram sent under date of July 24, 1945, by the Minister to Doctor Isaac Jones, Secretary of the New England Company. The subject matter of this telegram, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nIn view of the decision reached by the Government and assuming that the New England Company will lease the Mohawk Institute to the Diocese of Huron, as suggested by the Minister, it will be necessary for you to take immediate steps to select a Principal to take charge of the Institute immediately following the resignation of Mr. Small on July 31st. In case, however, you find this task impossible, we shall be glad to have Lt.-Col. Hurdle, with the assistance of the staff now employed at the school, carry on for a month. In this connection, it is unnecessary to state that we shall be glad to do everything humanly possible to cooperate with you in a manner that will enable the classroom work and the farm operations to proceed without interruption.\n\nMay we embrace this opportunity to express regret that your representatives and the representatives of the department, including the Minister himself, failed to reach an amicable agreement at the conference held at Ottawa yesterday. There seemed to be throughout the course of the discussions honest differences of opinion that were simply irreconcilable.\n\nWe are anxious also to clear up one or two misunderstandings that have arisen during the course of these negotiations, which have been conducted over a period of two or three years. These misunderstandings were inevitable,\n\n......in view\nIn view of the fact that the limited time at my disposal prevented me from discussing the matter with you personally, in your letter of July 16, 1948, you state:\n\n\"It is hardly necessary to recall the fact that as a result of a conference between yourself, Canon Townshend and Canon Dixon, and of subsequent negotiation with the latter, the \"original lease\" proposed between the New England Company and your Department was amended. The main amendment was that the Bishop of Huron should nominate clergy of the Church of England from whom your Department might make a selection of Principal.\"\n\nI have already discussed this particular paragraph of your letter with the members of the delegation and intimated to them that the view expressed was completely at variance with the facts. There was no such understanding at any time, nor was the lease ever before the New England Company for execution amended, either by the Government or the New England Company. Such amendments, of course, could only be introduced by the Governors of the Company. The position of the Government from the outset was made clear and we felt, unmistakable. The position was that the Principal of the school should be an agricultural college graduate with pedagogical training and experience both in classroom work and farm management. We did intimate, however, that no such man would be appointed to the position unless he was acceptable to you. A number of tentative proposals were discussed and reviewed from time to time, such as the operation of the school by the M.S.C.C., the operation of the school by the Archbishop of Huron, the creation of an advisory board, etc. These proposals were in their initial stages, not introduced by the Government but by the Church representatives. They were accepted for discussion with the feeling that it was our duty and responsibility to explore every alternative in the hope that a satisfactory agreement might be reached. At the end of our second last conference, Canon Dixon suggested to me that you would appreciate the opportunity of nominating three or four men for the Principalship - any one of whom might be selected. He may have had, in making that suggestion, clergymen in mind, though he did not say so, and inasmuch as the name of Mr. Middleton has been mentioned by Canon Townshend, I concluded that there was a possibility that he might be nominated. I deeply regret that this misunderstanding has arisen. I particularly regret that it has caused you annoyance.\n\n.......The second\nThe second misunderstanding that appears to have existed from the outset centered around the impression entertained by the Church representatives, that the Government somehow was responsible for this change of policy; whereas, as a matter of fact, such is not the case. The proposal with respect to the new lease came from the New England Company. While, strictly speaking, I have no authority to release copies of correspondence of an official character, I am nevertheless sending forward a copy of the first letter written on the subject received by the Minister from the Company, for your personal information. You will, I feel sure, in the light of later negotiations be deeply interested in the subject matter of this communication. It would be, in my judgment, unfair to the Minister then in charge of the department, the Honourable T. A. Orser, to suggest that he, of his own initiative, at any time advocated a change of policy with respect to the operation of this particular school. Here again, I accept full responsibility. The time at the disposal of the Minister and the senior officials was so limited, the whole responsibility for the negotiations fell upon me. It is just possible that I had neither the experience nor the tact to carry them through successfully, although I made a sincere and conscientious attempt to do so.\n\nAn additional misunderstanding arose toward the close of the negotiations. A number of the individuals interested in the matter and, it is just possible the Church representatives - though they did not say so - had a feeling that the department was anxious to appoint Mr. Hill to this position. Mr. Hill, I may state, is unknown to the senior officials of this department and no attempt was made by the Government at any time, directly or indirectly, to place him at the head of the school. In view of his record, however, as a teacher and leader amongst his people, we felt it was only fair that his case should be very carefully and very sympathetically reviewed and his claims discussed with you by Lt.-Col. Handley. It was pointed out that our failure to appoint Mr. Hill without valid reasons would create unfavourable reactions on the part of the Indian population. Our attitude with respect to Mr. Hill was made clear at our last conference, during the course of which I suggested to Canon Townshend that he communicate by phone with Mr. Middleton, with the object of securing, if at all possible, his services for the school. The officials of this branch and particularly myself, have been given a perfectly free\nhand in the conduct of the negotiations. No pressure of any kind has been exercised upon us and no attempt was made at any time to build up a case on behalf of any particular individual. The success of the Institution and the welfare of the Indian population was at all times uppermost in our minds.\n\nApart from these misunderstandings, however, it was a real pleasure to conduct these negotiations with men who seem to be eminently fair, whose courtesy was always in evidence at our meetings, and whose patience appeared inexhaustible. It would be deeply appreciated if you conveyed to Canon Dixon and Canon Townsend, insofar as a sense of appreciation can be conveyed, our gratitude and appreciation for all the help they have rendered us in handling a somewhat difficult and involved problem.\n\nShould the lease be granted, the management and control of the Institution will pass into your hands, whether an advisory board should or should not be created is a matter you, in your wisdom, will decide. The school will, of course, be subject in the future as in the past to an annual audit by an auditor appointed by the Treasury Division of this department and will be subject also to inspection by the Indian Superintendent, Lt.-Col. Randle, and by other departmental officials who may have occasion to visit Brantford in the transaction of departmental business. This is exactly the procedure followed in the schools operated under the auspices of the M.S.O.C., and will, I feel sure, be acceptable to Your Grace.\n\nI must apologize to you for the length of this letter, but I did feel, in fairness to all parties concerned, that these views should be expressed.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nMost Reverend Charles Seeger, M.A., D.D., LL.D.,\nArchbishop of Huron,\nBishop Grosvenor Hall,\nLondon, Ontario.\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDirector.\nTo be returned to Indian Affairs when signed -\n\nNIGHT CABINERON\n\nOttawa July 24 1945\n\nDoctor Isaac Jones\nSecretary New England Company\n26 Bloomsbury Square\nLondon WC England\n\nImpossible for Government to reach agreement with Archbishop of Baron with respect to Principalship and operation of Mohawk Institute stop suggest you enter into agreement with the Diocese of Baron for operation of school on understanding Government will continue to pay the regular per capita grants but will assume no additional financial responsibility.\n\nJ.

A. Glen\nMinister of Mines and Resources\nApril 10th, 1945,\n\nThe Most Reverend C. A. Seager, D.D.,\nBishop Cronyn Hall,\nLondon,\nOntario.\n\nYour Grace:\n\nI have telephoned you this morning at the request of Mr. Hoey of the Indian Affairs Branch in Ottawa. He was speaking to me by long distance yesterday afternoon. He said that the Department had already notified Mr. Snell of the Mohawk School that his services would not be required after the end of the current academic year. By that time he would have reached the age of retirement which is 65. I believe you have already been in communication with Mr. Hoey on this subject.\n\nMr. Hoey asked that I ask you if you would be good enough to suggest to him the names of two or three Anglican clergymen whom he, or members of his staff, might interview with a view to ascertaining if any of them would be suitable to carry on the work of the Mohawk Institute. It is his thought that the new principal should be between 30 and 40 years of age, with some business experience and also a reasonably good knowledge of farming. He feels sure that the latter qualification is important, as he has been given to understand by the Six Nations Council that in their opinion the agricultural possibilities at the Mohawk Institute have not been used to the utmost extent.\n\nMr. Hoey would be very grateful if you would send the two or three names to him direct.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(SGD.) L. A. DIXON.\nThe Archbishop's Room\nBishop George Hall\nLondon, Canada.\n\n27th July, 1945.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nActing Director of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThank you for your letter of the 25th following\nthe conference with you of Archdeacon Townshend, Canon Dixon\nand Mr. A. B. Lucas. I and they appreciate deeply your kind\nreference to them in your letter, which I conveyed to them.\n\nMay I refer first to the misunderstandings men-\ntioned in your letter. I regret if the expression \"original lease\"\nwhich occurs in a quotation from my letter to you of 16th July,\nshould have misled you. Perhaps I should not have used the\nexpression.\n\nWhat I referred to was the draft lease sent\nto you by the New England Company over a year ago but which has\nnot been executed. This draft lease was amended or changed, what-\never the right word is, following a conference of Canons Dixon\nand Townshend with you in November, 1944. The particular points\nchanged or added to it were; first, that any Principal appointed\nto the Mohawk Institute should be acceptable to the Bishop of\nHuron; secondly that there should be an advisory committee; and\nthirdly that the situation should be reviewed at the end of three\nyears. As a result, however, of negotiation later with Canon\nDixon, the first alteration was again changed to the effect that\nthe appointment of a Principal should be made out of nominations\nof one or more Clergy of the Church of England by the Bishop of\nHuron.\n\nThis information was conveyed to me by a letter\ndated 10th April, 1945 from Canon Dixon in which the following\noccurs:\n\n\"I have telephoned you this morning at the request of Mr.\nHoey of the Indian Affairs Branch in Ottawa.----------Mr.\nHoey asked that I ask you if you would be good enough to\nsuggest to him the names of two or three Anglican clergymen\nwhom he, or members of his staff, might interview with a\nview to ascertaining if any of them would be suitable to\ncarry on the work of the Mohawk Institute.----------Mr.\nHoey would be very grateful if you would send the two or\nthree names to him direct.\"\n\nI enclose a full copy of Canon Dixon's letter.\nI responded by nominating men who were to meet your officials in Brantford on May 7th, which, however, turned out to be V.E.Day, and the men could not attend. In response to your telegram, however, of 5th July, I arranged again to have three of my nominees meet your officials in Brantford. Your telegram reads as follows:\n\n\"Please arrange to have Reverend W. J. Zimmerman, Reverend L. J. Patterson and Reverend J. Billingsley at Indian Office, Brantford, on Saturday, 7th July at 10.00 a.m. where they will be interviewed by Departmental officials in connection with principalship of Mohawk Institute.\"\n\nIt was regrettable that we could not make any contact with the Rev. Gilbert Thompson so as to have him, as your other telegram of 5th July requested, present with the others. The report of the interviewing committee was most favourable, particularly as to the Rev. W. J. Zimmerman. I trust this clears up any misunderstanding under this head.\n\nAs to any misunderstanding that the Department was desirous to appoint Mr. Hill, the only information that I possess on the point is that in your letter to me of 16th July, in which the following occurs:\n\n\"In the interval the suggestion has been made that Joseph C. Hill, an experienced teacher, should be placed, for the time being at least, in charge of the School, under the direction of an advisory committee.\"\n\nMy impression is that Lt.Col. Randle, not anyone in Ottawa, was anxious for Mr. Hill's appointment. I take it therefore that there is no serious misunderstanding on this point.\n\nI note the reversion in your letter to the offer of the Synod of Huron to assume financial and administrative responsibility for the Mohawk Institute, provided that the Government continue the per capita grants, and your cable in this connection to the New England Company, a copy of which you kindly enclosed. The outcome of this cable to the Company we shall await of course with interest. It is necessary, however, to state that when the New England Company, in a cable dated 29th June, 1945, to me virtually declined the offer of the Synod of Huron, the matter, so far as we are concerned, was closed, and without further authority from our Synod can not now be re-opened. I am, however, perfectly willing to refer consideration of any communication from the New England Company to the Executive Committee of our Synod which meets in September. What action that body may take I cannot of course predict.\n\nIn the meantime I am perfectly willing and able, as suggested in your letter, to select a competent Clergyman to\nbe appointed Principal, and I nominate the Rev. W. J. Zimmerman, in accordance with the unanimous recommendation of your officials who interviewed my nominees in Brantford on 7th July. They unanimously placed Mr. Zimmerman's name first in their recommendation. Mr. Zimmerman can in all probability take charge of the Institute in a fort-night.\n\nIt will be clearly understood by you, however, that obviously the Synod of Huron can not be responsible for his salary or any other financial obligations of the Institute, as we are necessarily unaware of the mind of the New England Company in the matter, particularly as our offer to them was virtually declined, and as in addition to this I have no authority now from the Synod to assume such financial responsibility.\n\nFurther, if a competent man is to be offered the Principalship it is only reasonable that he should be assured of the security of his position for at least the three year period mentioned above.\n\nWill you kindly accept my expression of regret that you and we also should be put to so much trouble about this matter, but we are all acting, needless to say, in perfect good faith and with the sole desire for the educational and spiritual advantage of the pupils of the School.\n\nFor your information I should add that under date of 28th July I wrote to the Minister of Mines and Resources, expressing appreciation of the considerate reception of my representatives on Tuesday last.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nCharles Shiron\n\nCH/CJ\nOttawa, August 1, 1945.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Seager:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 27th and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nIt is my intention to deal in this letter only with the problems confronting us with respect to the operation of the Mohawk Institute during the period immediately ahead of us. In this connection, it is our hope that Mr. Zimmerman will be free to take charge at the earliest possible date. The Chief of the Training Division will be prepared to go to Brantford on August 10th and 11th to discuss with him, in a general way, the whole administrative set-up, the enrolment of the pupils for the coming academic year, the operation of the farm, the payment of per capita grants, etc. It is my hope that Mr. Zimmerman will be able to visit Brantford for this purpose on the dates suggested.\n\nAs I see matters at the moment, neither the Diocese of Huron nor the Government has a legal right to operate the school and certainly no right to incur financial obligations. In view of all the circumstances, however, we would be prepared to continue the payment of the per capita grants, which payment would enable Mr. Zimmerman to draw his monthly salary until a final settlement is reached.\n\nThe Minister, with whom this matter has been discussed, is definitely of the opinion that the school should be administered either by the Diocese of Huron or by the Government and has issued instructions to this effect. He is opposed to dual responsibility and dual control and feels that the newly-appointed\n\n.........Principal\nPrincipal should be under the immediate direction of either the Government, on the one hand, or the Diocese, on the other. It is not at all likely that the New England Company will refuse to lease the property to the Diocese. Should they do so, however, or should the Diocese refuse to assume this responsibility, the Minister will then be called upon to decide what action, if any, the Government should take. I am particularly anxious that the classroom work should proceed without interruption and that a final settlement should be reached at the earliest possible date.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\n\nMost Reverend Charles Seager, M.A., D.D., LL.D.,\nArchbishop of Huron,\nBishop Grey Hall,\nLONDON, Ontario.\nThe Honourable\nThe Minister of Mines and Resources,\nThe Indian Department,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nHonourable and Dear Sir:\n\nRe The Mohawk Institute\n\nThis is to express my great appreciation of your kind and considerate reception of the deputation, consisting of the Venerable Archdeacon W. A. Townshend, the Reverend Canon L. A. Dixon and Mr. A. B. Lucas, the former and latter of whom represented me at their conference with you on Tuesday last. We are grateful particularly for the time and attention you gave personally to their representations.\n\nIt is regrettable that this matter has been unavoidably prolonged, but you will readily understand our deep concern regarding it. This you will the more readily do since the affairs of its Indian wards in Canada have always elicited an equal and active concern on the part of the Government of this Dominion.\n\nOur delegation made it amply clear no doubt to you and your officials that the Mohawk Institute has always been a religious foundation under the auspices of the Church of England, though not administered by that Church here.\n\nThe teaching and influence of the School upon the pupils have been of enormous value in our Missionary work on the Mohawk Reserve which, as in the case of the Institute, has been carried on for more than one hundred years. While the School has always held an open door to pupils of all religious denominations, yet the fact that last school year 75% of the pupils were members of the Church of England is significant showing as it does the successful character on the whole of the Church's work upon parents and forbears of the children. Under such circumstances you will understand fully our deep desire that the School shall be continued as heretofore. Should parents of any children who are not members of the Church of England wish it, we are always willing to set upon what may be called a \"conscience clause\".\nIt was therefore a matter of great satisfaction to us when we understood that a proposal which, as we interpreted it, would radically alter the character of the School, was altered in the following particulars briefly stated. First, that the Principal of the Institute shall be one acceptable to the Bishop of Huron. Secondly that the Principal should be assisted by an advisory committee, and thirdly that the arrangements should be reviewed at the end of three years.\n\nAs a result, however, of a conference in Nov., 1944 with the Acting Director of Indian Affairs by the Reverend Canon Dixon, General Secretary of our Missionary Society, and the Reverend Canon W. A. Townshend from this Diocese, this proposal was further altered in respect with the first provision. Instead of the Principal being \"one acceptable to the Bishop of Huron\" it was agreed that the Principal should be appointed by the Department from nominations made by the Bishop of Huron or ordained Clergy of the Church of England. This alteration was communicated to me by Canon Dixon in a letter dated April 16th, 1945, in which the following occurs:\n\n\"I have telephoned you this morning at the request of Mr. Hoey of the Indian Affairs Branch in Ottawa, .............Mr. Hoey asked that I ask you if you would be good enough to suggest to him the names of two or three Anglican Clergymen whom he or members of his staff might interview with a view to ascertaining if any of them would be suitable to carry on the work of the Mohawk Institute...........Mr. Hoey would be very grateful if you would send the two or three names to him direct.\"\n\nThis information was further corroborated by a request from Mr. Hoey that I arrange to send three Clergy to Brantford to be interviewed by his officials with the above object. This meeting was unfortunately arranged to take place on May 7th. At that moment we were expecting the unconditional surrender of Germany and all Clergy were directed to be in their parishes to meet any announcement of this sort. My three nominees therefore were unable to attend. Later, however, under date of July 8th, 1945, Mr. Hoey telegraphed me to have my nominees meet his officials in Brantford on July 9th. This was done and I have before me the report to the Acting Director of the interviewing officials with regard to my three nominees as follows:\n\n\"All three of the above named gentlemen made a very excellent impression upon the committee and while none of them can be said to have any actual knowledge of Indian work or\n\n......the work\n\"the work in an Indian Residential School, at the same time their educational qualifications and general knowledge appears sufficient to justify the belief that any of them would probably make a reasonably good Principal. However, if a choice was being made the Committee is unanimous in agreeing that the Rev. W. J. Zimmerman should receive the first consideration\".\n\nI may add that Mr. Zimmerman is a specialist in Religious Education with an M.A. degree in that field, and that he was born on a farm and worked as a farmer in his early days. He also possesses outstanding administrative abilities. I am sure you will agree that it was not unreasonable that I should expect one of my nominees to have been appointed at once. This, however, has not yet been done.\n\nAt one point in the lengthy negotiations the Synod of Huron offered to assume financial and administrative responsibility for the Mohawk Institute, on the understanding that the Government should continue the per capita grants. The Synod took this action hoping that the suggestion might facilitate action already long delayed. I need hardly say that such an offer is of a highly generous character as the Synod of Huron was prepared to accept a serious financial risk though we believe that the business side of the Institution can be made to pay. This suggestion, however, did not appear to be acceptable to the New England Company and was therefore dropped, and without further authority of our Synod must remain closed. Our understanding, in consequence, of the present status of the matter is reverent to the three-fold proposal quoted above.\n\nI trust that this somewhat vexatious matter may now very soon be closed satisfactorily.

This suggestion, however, did not appear to be acceptable to the New England Company and was therefore dropped, and without further authority of our Synod must remain closed. Our understanding, in consequence, of the present status of the matter is reversion to the three-fold proposal quoted above.\n\nI trust that this somewhat vexatious matter may now very soon be closed satisfactorily. Again expression appreciation for your great consideration, I am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n(Sgd.) Charles Huron\nArchbishop of Huron.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJuly 28th, 1915\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nAttached is a letter addressed to the Minister under date of July 26th (airmail) by the Archbishop of Huron in reference to the Mohawk Institute.\n\nPlease have draft reply prepared for the Minister's signature, returning Archbishop Seager's letter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrivate Secretary\n\nNOTE: Most Reverend C.A. Seager, D.D., LL.D.,\n(address on letter)\n\nMr. Hoey:\n\nFor draft reply as requested.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, July 31, 1945.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Seager:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 26th, in which you discuss the decision reached at a conference on the Principalship and operation of the Mohawk Institute held at Ottawa on Tuesday, the 24th instant.\n\nFor reasons that will readily occur to Your Grace, I am naturally anxious that no misunderstanding should arise with respect to this decision and the cablegram sent forward by me to the New England Company, copy of which, I understand, is already in your possession.\n\nThe information before me indicates that the Mohawk Institute and a small parcel of land, approximately nine acres, is the property of the New England Company and that the larger farm, usually referred to as the school farm, is the property of the Six Nations Band of Indians. It would appear that this school has been leased by the Government over a long period of years and that the entire costs of operation and maintenance, with the exception of an annual grant made by the New England Company, now discontinued, were borne by the Government. The selection of a suitable Principal with the necessary tact and experience is, therefore, in my judgment, an exceedingly difficult and exacting task. The Principal in this case occupies a unique position, in that he is not only responsible for the operation and management of the farm, but is responsible as well for the employment of the staff, the organization of the classroom work and the religious instruction provided for the pupils.\n\nIt is true\nIt is true, the classroom work is inspected by the Public School Inspector for the County, but the control exercised until now by the Diocese of Huron and by this Department appears to have been more or less nominal. The officials of the Indian Affairs Branch feel that in view of the large annual expenditures involved, and in this regard I am wholly in agreement with them, the administration of the Institution should be more closely knit and that the Principal should be constantly subject to direction either by the Government or by the Diocese.\n\nThe Department would be prepared to undertake this direction immediately, but only on the understanding that an experienced agricultural college graduate with pedagogical training were selected for the Principalship. This proposal, however, did not appear at all acceptable to your representatives. Consideration was then given to the operation of the school under your own immediate direction, extending to you full freedom of choice in the selection of the Principal on the understanding that this Department would continue to pay, in the future as in the past, the regular per capita grants.\n\nIt is altogether likely that the New England Company will be prepared to enter into an agreement with Your Grace for the operation and management of the school. I do feel that in view of all the circumstances the Diocese of Huron should assume this responsibility. The work accomplished at the Institute has not been satisfactory in recent years. The change of policy now suggested, that is, operation either by the Government or by the Diocese would, I feel sure, result in more efficient administrative effort and prove more satisfactory to all parties concerned.\n\nMay I embrace this opportunity to thank you very heartily for your personal interest in this matter and for the appreciation expressed in your communication.\n\nMost Reverend C.

A. Hoey\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYour letter of 1st August received. I at once had Mr. Zimmerman communicated with who is now prepared to meet your Chief of the Training Division on 10th August as you suggest. As you know, I telegraphed you asking for the hour. Mr. Zimmerman can take charge almost at any time. I expect him in to see me today.\n\nCertainly neither the Department nor the Diocese has a legal right to operate the School, but it must be carried on and I appreciate the action of your Department in the matter.\n\nI note your statement that the Minister is of the opinion that the School should be administered either by the Diocese of Huron or the Government, and has issued instructions to this effect, and is opposed to dual responsibility and dual control. Certainly we heartily agree with this opinion. It has been our sole desire from the beginning of this negotiation that the Government should administer the Mohawk Institute under the terms arranged for, the chief of which is that I should nominate Clergy of the Church of England for appointment as Principal but that the appointment should be with your Department.\n\nIt is true that at a certain point of the negotiations the Synod of this Diocese offered to assume responsibility for its administration and financing, but this was done only in the hope that it might facilitate the conclusion of the matter. It was a very generous action on the part of the Synod and the assumption on its part of a very serious responsibility. The reply of the New England Company to this offer was not favourable. Therefore the matter was dropped and it reverts to the original suggestion referred to.\n\nI share your anxiety that the class room work particularly should proceed without interruption. When Mr. Zimmerman is appointed, as no doubt he will be shortly by the Minister, all other details can be happily worked out I am sure. I take it from your letter that the formal appointment of Mr. Zimmerman as Principal of the Mohawk Institute will be received by me and him at an early date.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nCharles Huron\n\nCH/CJ\nOttawa, August 13, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOLT,\n\nAs directed, I again visited the Mohawk Institute on August 10 and 11.\n\nOn the latter date, accompanied by Indian Superintendent Randle, I interviewed Reverend Mr. Zimmerman, who has been nominated by His Grace the Archbishop of Huron as Principal of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nAt the outset of our conversation, I realized that Mr. Zimmerman was not thoroughly aware of the situation as it exists at the present time. Consequently, acting on your approval, I showed him a copy of the letter written by the minister to Archbishop Seager. The purpose of this letter is that the Department is willing to have the Diocese take over the Mohawk Institute, on the understanding that the only financial responsibility on the part of the Department will be the payment of the per capita allowance, and if there are any deficits on management, these will be paid by the Diocese of Huron. Mr. Zimmerman stated that he was not aware of this condition and after considerable discussion he advised Colonel Randle and myself that it was his intention to immediately interview His Grace the Archbishop of Huron with a view to having his own (Mr. Zimmerman's) position fully clarified. He intended to see the Archbishop either Saturday or early this week.\n\nColonel Randle and I discussed the past, present and future situation at the Mohawk Institute with Rev. Mr. Zimmerman in a very complete manner. I feel that if he receives the assurance that he personally desires from His Grace the Archbishop, regarding the financial situation, he should make a capable Principal. He appears to be anxious to come into our work and gave us several very constructive ideas, regarding the improvement of the school management in the interests of the Indian pupils. We agreed with these and offered him certain other suggestions. If he decides to remain it is also his intention to recommend to His Grace the appointment of the advisory committee which has been previously discussed. Mr. Zimmerman stated that in the event of such a committee being appointed by His Grace, he considered that it should include both the Indian Superintendent - Colonel Randle - and the Chief of the Six Nations Council. During the course of the day we visited all parts of the building. Colonel Randle and I believe that before turning over the building to the Diocese of Huron we should redecorate the children's dining room, the boys' playroom and the Principal's living room and dining room. There are also some minor repairs required to the electric wiring in the boys'\nplayroom and the plumbing in the kitchen. We estimate that all this work can be done for an amount not exceeding $1,500.00. At the present time there is approximately $1,400.00 left from the funds provided by the New England Company; consequently, this expenditure can be taken from that amount. This would leave a balance of approximately $1,900.00 on hand, from which we could handle the monthly payments of Miss Hardie's superannuation, until such time as we receive special funds for the purpose from the New England Company, as promised by the Governor of the New England Company in a letter dated June 16, 1943. In view of new instructions this afternoon, I have written to Colonel Randle, authorizing him to proceed immediately with the improvements just mentioned, at a total expenditure not exceeding $2,500.00. It was arranged that the future monthly payments to Miss Hardie would be made through the office of Colonel Randle, instead of through the office of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nPhilip Nolan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, August 13, 1945.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAs directed, I again visited the Mohawk Institute on August 10 and 11.\n\nOn the latter date, accompanied by Indian Superintendent Randle, I interviewed Reverend Mr. Zimmerman, who has been nominated by His Grace the Archbishop of Huron as Principal of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nAt the outset of our conversation, I realized that Mr. Zimmerman was not thoroughly aware of the situation as it exists at the present time.

I have appointed the Ven. Archdeacon Townshend of this office to represent me. Archdeacon Townshend will no doubt be glad to receive and attend to any further communication and arrangements in the matter.\"\n\nThe Archbishop in this letter refers to Mr. Phelan's interview with Mr. Zimmerman at Brantford on August 10, and to an apparent misunderstanding, not the first of course which has arisen with respect to the operation of the Mohawk Institution. Mr. Phelan, I may state, had explicit instructions with regard to the policy of the Government prior to his visit to Brantford and took with him a copy of the Minister's letter to the Archbishop dated July 31, 1945. If you will read this letter, I feel confident you will experience no difficulty in understanding clearly the exact stand the Minister has taken.\n\nIn a strictly legal sense, neither the Government nor the Archbishop has a right to operate the Mohawk Institute in the absence of a duly executed lease. In as much, however, as per capita grants for the operation of this school have already been voted by Parliament, the officials here took the position and the Minister agreed with them the school should reopen on September 1, under the guidance and direction of the\n\n...........\nArchbishop of Huron and on the understanding that the per capita grants would be paid by this Department. This is the only position the Minister could legally or consistently take, and this is the point we have reached as the result of prolonged discussions and negotiations covering a period of two years or more. The present Minister appears to be determined that dual control of the Institution should cease; that the Principal should work under the immediate direction of either the Archbishop on the one hand, or this Department on the other.\n\nIf I have made the position at all clear, would it be possible for you to visit Brantford on Thursday next, August 24, and discuss the matter again with Mr. Phelan and Colonel Randle. If the school is to open on September 1, an attempt should be made to persuade either Mr. Zimmerman or Mr. Hill to take charge of the school on a temporary basis. None of the parties concerned are in a position, at this date, to guarantee permanent employment, and I feel sure the Archbishop appreciates this fact.\n\nYou might ask Mr. Phelan to wire me from Brantford immediately following your negotiations.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n\nVenerable Archdeacon Townshend,\nBishop Cronyn Hall,\nLONDON, Ontario.\nOttawa, August 18, 1945.\n\nDear Colonel Randle:\n\nFollowing our telephone conversation Thursday morning, I saw Mr. Hoey and advised him of the letter that you had received from Rev. Mr. Zimmerman. Mr. Hoey expressed the opinion at that time that before taking further action we should wait and see if the Archbishop intended to write to us. I am writing this letter at 10 o'clock Saturday morning and up to this time we have had no communication from the Archbishop. I will be passing through Brantford on Thursday next and will call at the office. If Mr. Hoey hears from the Archbishop in the meantime, he will communicate with you, so that we can discuss whatever action Mr. Hoey wishes us to take.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nLt.-Col.

Vacation time has made it impossible readily to summon the proper committee to discuss the matter of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nI have taken the liberty of making this letter a personal one in order to speak more freely, particularly as we have shared fully your anxiety that no misunderstanding shall arise as to the Principalship of the School.\n\nAs I wrote in interpreting your letter as conveying a virtual ultimatum in this matter. As it appears, you offer us a choice between running the Institute ourselves or having the Indian Department do so along the lines originally proposed. There can be an ultimatum however only in appearance, as we have no authority from our Synod to accept responsibility as I said in my letter to you of 8th July.\n\nIn any case your letter makes it clear that the information on which you have based any decision in the matter is inadequate and in some respects inaccurate and I am sure you would not wish this to be the case. For example, your statement that\n\n\"the entire costs of operation and maintenance, with the exception of an annual grant made by the New England Company, now discontinued, were borne by the Government\" and later in your letter \"in view of the large annual expenditure involved\"\n\nis not correct. I have the most definite information from the former Principal in a report to me that the fact is the exact opposite of this statement. The following are some extracts from that report:\n\n\"I cannot be definite concerning the first two or three years of my tenure of office but I do know that for the last twelve or thirteen years all repairs, improvements, additional equipment, machinery, and the hambushes and boys' Master's cottage were paid from New England Company grant. All the stoves (heating etc.) and equipment as well as the building behind the schoolhouse included in these repairs is the new boiler which was installed fairly recently as well as the one which it replaced.\"\n\nI am further informed that the Department now has on hand a considerable sum of money contributed by the New England Company for the Mohawk Institute. It is, of course, most important that you should be in possession of this information.\n\nThe second inaccuracy in the information you have received is contained in your statement that\n\n\"The control exercised until now by the Diocese of Huron and by this Department appears to have been more or less nominal. The officials of the Indian Affairs Department feel that \u2014\u2014 the administration of the Institute should be more closely knit and that the Principal should be constantly subject to direction either by the Government or by the Diocese.\"\n\n.....The fact is\nThe fact is that very close knit control over the administration of the School has always existed. The Principal has been constantly subject to the control of the Indian Department. The only power to which the Diocese of Huron has possessed any control, at any rate for the greater part of a quarter of a century, has been the nomination of the Principal. Once appointed, however, the Diocese has had no control over him as Principal whatever; the Government has had complete control. It is precisely this position which we so strongly advocate should be continued. As far as we understand the matter no good reason exists to the contrary. After all, the Indians of this Dominion are wards of the Government, not of the Church.\n\nA third inaccuracy in your information may be stated as follows. The original proposal of the Department (to which I understand the New England Company assented) was that an experienced agriculturist and College graduate with pedagogical training be selected as Principal. We did object to this proposal on the ground that it would have radically and completely altered the whole character of the School, which for one hundred and fourteen years has been on a religious foundation and the system of doctrine and worship of the Church of England. Surely such a proposal is utterly unreasonable and unjust unless the most urgent facts and considerations should compel it. None such exist.\n\nThe inaccuracy in your information in this reference lies in the fact that in your letter you pass immediately from this proposal to refer to the suggestion that the Church of England in Canada become responsible for the School, without any reference to the several conferences and much correspondence which took place in the interim.\n\nThe proposal was made that the Church of England in Canada, through its Missionary Society, should undertake this responsibility. The Society, however, through its Executive Committee, refused to do this. Upon this fresh negotiations were opened with the Department, the last of which was on 26th July when Mr. Zimmerman met myself and the officials of your Department and yourself. As reported to you, the result of this consultation was a complete understanding in the matter, with the sole exception of the question of the appointment of the Principal. Since then, however, the Acting Director requested me to send Mr. Zimmerman to Brantford to consult with Colonel Randle and Mr. Phelan with a view to his appointment.\n\nAt one point in previous discussions the Synod of Huron did offer to become responsible for the School, and asked the New England Company to this effect. That body did not accept the offer, and, as I informed you in my letter of 26th July, five days previous to yours of the 31st,\n\n\"This suggestion, however, did not appear to be acceptable to the New England Company and was therefore dropped and without further authority of our Synod must remain closed.\"\n\nI regret the length of this letter but it is necessary to refer to your cable to the New England Company dated 26th July as follows:\n\n\"Impossible for Government to reach agreement with Archbishop of Huron with respect to Principalship and operation of Mohawk Institute. Suggest you enter into agreement with the Diocese of Huron for operation of school on understanding Government will continue to pay the regular per capita grants but will assume no additional financial responsibility.\"\n\nThis message was sent by you after a lengthy conference with my representatives on 26th July. During the conference my representatives made it perfectly clear that the Synod of Huron has given me no authority whatever to assume such responsibility again as I wrote you on 26th July. As no reply to your cable that I know of has been received from the New England Company with regard to the matter, there is nothing for us to consider from that source.\n\nI am afraid I must object to the wording of the cable which states that:\n\n..... \"Impossible for\nImpossible for Government to reach agreement with Archbishop of Huron with respect to Principalship and operation of Mohawk Institute.\n\nThe first part of this statement with respect to the Principalship is substantially correct; the reference to \"operation of Mohawk Institute\" is surely inaccurate. As stated above, a complete understanding appeared to be arrived at in the course of the conference on 24th July as to this aspect of the matter, the only question left being the appointment of the Principal.\n\nWith the exception of the original radical proposals already referred to and to which we objected we have followed every direction of the officials of the Department literally and faithfully. Delays and changes have been caused solely by the officials of the Department.\n\nAs an instance of this I enclose a copy of a letter written by me to the Acting Director of Indian Affairs under date of 17th July which I trust you will be good enough to peruse. It is but one instance of several. The latest instance of this sort of thing occurred last Thursday when two representatives of myself were asked to go to Brantford to consult with Mr. Phelan. They did so and spent the day in vain in that City since Mr. Phelan did not put in an appearance.\n\nIn conclusion I earnestly urge, though I know, from my own experience, how great the claims must be upon your time and energy, that you take occasion to possess yourself of the actual facts of the case.\n\nAll we ask is that the School be continued as heretofore, the Principal being appointed by the Department out of whatever number of nominees by the Bishop of this Diocese the Department may desire. We ask, and have a right to ask, that we receive at least the same consideration in respect of the Mohawk Institute as is accorded to the United Church of Canada in its Indian Institute at Mount Elgin and to the Roman Catholic School in Nova Scotia. I again respectfully urge that you give this matter some close attention and that it be settled along reasonable lines at once.\n\nI am apprehensive that it may become an issue, not only between the Synod of Huron and the Department, but between the whole Canadian Protestant organization and the Department. Such a prospect is to me utterly distasteful to say the least of it, and the last thing to be allowed to develop.\n\nI appreciate the attention you have given to this matter and trust that it may soon be settled along reasonable lines.\n\nI am, with kind regards,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Sgd.)

Phelan, reading as follows:\n\n\"Please have Rev. Mr. Zimmerman report at Indian Office, Brantford, at 2 p.m., August 10.\"\n\nMr. Zimmerman was there as requested.\n\nOn that day, Friday, the 10th, Mr. Zimmerman met Colonel Randall and discussed with him the matter of the Principalship of the Mohawk Institute. According to Mr. Zimmerman's report to me, the discussion was held on the basis and assumptions of previous discussions at which a general understanding was arrived at. At the interview it was assumed that Mr. Zimmerman was to be appointed Principal by the Government on the basis of previous discussions.\n\nThe next day, August 11th, Mr. Zimmerman interviewed Mr. P. Phelan in Brantford on the same subject. The discussions took place on the same assumptions as with Colonel Randall on the previous day, and included those involved in the management of the School by Mr. Zimmerman as Principal. He was given the keys of the place, introduced to members of the Staff as the new Principal and the matter was apparently finally settled.\n\nAt the close of the interview, Mr. Zimmerman naturally inquired as to his position in the matter, for example, by whom was he to be appointed, from what source would he get his salary, who was to be responsible for expenditures, etc., etc. Much to his astonishment, he was told by Mr. Phelan that he was to look to the Archbishop of Huron for all these things since the Synod of Huron was taking over the responsibility of financing and managing the School. To my amazement, Mr. Zimmerman so reported to me later.\n\nIt will at once be perceived by you that the above statement was made in the face of the facts set forth in my letter to you dated July 27th in which I stated, in the clearest possible terms, that we have no authority from the Synod of Huron to assume any financial responsibility whatever. Similar statements were made in my letter to the Minister on other matters dated July 26th.\n\nIt may well be, of course, that Mr. Phelan was unaware of the facts of the case, for example that no communication has been received from the New England Company regarding the Lease to us, and that, even if this had been the case, we have no authority from our Synod to negotiate with them.\n\nYou will at once perceive that it is absolutely impossible for me to transact business in the face of a contradiction such as the above.\n\nI am bound to add also, that I consider that both Mr. Zimmerman and myself have been placed, as a result, in an entirely false position, and, in addition, the former has been put to considerable expense and personal anxiety.\n\nAs Chief Executive Officer of the Diocese of Huron, I therefore find it impossible to continue direct communication with the Department in this matter. I have appointed the Ven. Archdeacon Townshend of this office to represent me. Archdeacon Townshend will no doubt be glad to receive and attend to any further communication and arrangements in the\nThe Honorable\nThe Minister of Mines and Resources,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nHonorable and Dear Sir:\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter of 31st July in reply to mine of the 26th.

This, Mr. Phelan did, using his holiday period for this purpose and without cost to the Department, and later proceeded to London, where he discussed the matter with Canon Townshend. I am particularly anxious that no misunderstanding should arise with respect to Mr. Phelan's action on this occasion. In view of the fact that he was under no obligation during his holiday period to undertake this work, his action was, in my judgment, commendable in every sense.\n\nMay I state that I have little to add to the views expressed by me in my letter to you dated July 31st.

Mr. Zimmerman taking immediate charge of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nIt is further understood that:\n\n(1) At the regular meeting of the Synod of the Diocese of Huron, to be held at the end of September, a proposal would be made that the said Diocese will assume the administrative and financial responsibility of the Mohawk Institute, other than the per capita grant.\n\n(2) That, if the Synod does not agree to assume the financial and administrative responsibility of the Mohawk Institute, or if the Diocese is unable to reach agreement with the New England Company, the Indian Affairs Branch will assume full control of the said school.\n\n(3) Until we receive your decision regarding paragraph one, the School will be carried on as formerly by the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd) Philip Phelan\n\nChief Training Division,  \nIndian Affairs Branch.\n31st August, 1945.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Hoey:\n\nBy this time doubtless you have been informed of the conference between my representatives, Archdeacon Townshend and Canon Bice with Colonel Randle and Mr. Phelan on Friday, 24th August.\n\nThe outcome was the attached understanding embodied in a memorandum signed by Mr. Phelan. In pursuance of this decision the Rev. W. J. Zimmerman is now in charge of the Mohawk Institute, and a good beginning has been made to straighten things out in readiness for the school year. He began his work on Monday, 27th August.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCH/CJ\nMr. Hargrove,\nNew England Co.,\nTelegram, Sherrard & Co.,\netc.\nOttawa, September 11, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Osburn:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your catalogue of August 27th and have noted with interest the information contained therein.\n\nIn view of the lengthy negotiations that have taken place between this department and His Grace, the Archishop of Burma, with respect to the operation of the Burma Institute, it is gratifying to learn that a representative of the New England Company is likely to visit Canada toward the end of the present year. At the time of his visit, the future of the Institute and the relationship of the Diocese of Burma and the Government thereto, can be carefully reviewed. I shall be glad to have an interview with your representative immediately following his arrival at Ottawa.\n\nIt occurred to me that you should have before you a copy of my last letter, dated July 31, 1945, addressed to Archbishop Songar. In this letter, I outlined briefly the position I have taken with respect to the operation of the schools. I am sure you will find the subject matter of the communication self-explanatory.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Arthur Osburne,\nGovernor,\nNew England Company,\n66 Bloomsbury Square,\nLondon, W.C.S.,\nEngland.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\n\"Sent 11/9/45.\"\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nJ. A. Glen Esq.,\nMinister of Mines & Resources,\nCanadian Government,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMohawk Institute\n\nI write to confirm the despatch on the 25th August 1945 of a cable which we sent to you in the following terms:\n\n\"Your cable received and considered by our Company. Position still obscure since you suggest lease in favour of Huron Diocese and Archbishop suggests lease in your favour. Would be grateful if status quo could be continued for interim period till end of year when we hope to send out representative of Company to interview all parties and settle matter.\"\n\nThis cable was sent after a meeting of the Court of the New England Company at which your cable and a letter from the Archbishop of Huron dated the 11th July 1945 had been considered. It was in this letter that the Archbishop had suggested that the lease of the Mohawk Institute should be in favour of the Dominion Government. He considered that this course would be satisfactory to him because the Dominion Government, the Missionary Society and he had agreed to certain proposals one of which was that the Principal of the Institute would be appointed by your Government on his recommendation. We gather from your cable that the proposals particularly on this point have broken down in practice.\n\nThis matter has now been proceeding for a very long time and we are anxious that it should be settled at an early date, if possible to the complete satisfaction of your Government, the Missionary Society, the Archbishop and our Company. At present, however, the matter does not appear to be approaching a solution rapidly, and we think that the best way to overcome the delays caused by the slow post and the difficulty caused by our lack of knowledge of the problems which have so far prevented your Government, the Missionary Society, and the Archbishop from reaching agreement is by personal action. In particular, we feel insufficiently instructed as to the various advantages and disadvantages and the financial consequences which would result from the lease being granted (a) to the Dominion Government or (b) to the Diocese of Huron.\n\nIn these circumstances we consider that our best course would be to send out a representative of the Company to interview all parties and settle the matter. This we hope to do at Christmas.\n\np.t.o.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nSept. 11, 1945\n\nThe attached further letter is received from the Governor of the New England Company, London, dated Aug. 31st, confirming their cable despatch of Aug. 25th.\n\nI quote, in part:\n\n\"At present... the matter does not appear to be approaching a solution rapidly, and we think the best way to overcome the delays caused by the slow post and the difficulty caused by our lack of knowledge of the problems which have so far prevented your Government, the Missionary Society, and the Archbishop from reaching agreement is by personal action.\n\n\"In these circumstances we consider that our best course would be to send out a representative of the Company to interview all parties and settle the matter.

E.P. Randle, Indian Superintendent at Brantford, Ontario, was acting Principal of Mohawk Institute.\n\nRecently Reverend W.J. Zimmerman has assumed duties as Principal of this school and this will authorize you to honour cheques drawn against the Mohawk Institute Account and signed by Reverend W.J.

At the time of his visit, the future of the Institute and the relationship of the Diocese of Burma and the Government thereto, can be carefully reviewed. I shall be glad to have an interview with your representative immediately following his arrival at Ottawa.\n\nIt occurred to me that you should have before you a copy of my last letter, dated July 31, 1945, addressed to Archbishop Seager. In this letter, I outlined briefly the position I have taken with respect to the operation of the school. I am sure you will find the subject matter of the communication self-explanatory.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Arthur Cochrane,\nGovernor,\nNew England Company,\n84 Bloomsbury Square,\nLondon, W.C.2.,\nEngland.\nOttawa, July 31, 1948.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Beager:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 26th, in which you discuss the decision reached at a conference on the Principalship and operation of the Mohawk Institute held at Ottawa on Tuesday, the 24th instant.\n\nFor reasons that will readily occur to Your Grace, I am naturally anxious that no misunderstanding should arise with respect to this decision and the telegram sent forward by me to the New England Company, copy of which, I understand, is already in your possession.\n\nThe information before me indicates that the Mohawk Institute and a small parcel of land, approximately nine acres, is the property of the New England Company and that the larger farm, usually referred to as the school farm, is the property of the Six Nations Band of Indians. It would appear that this school has been leased by the Government over a long period of years and that the entire costs of operation and maintenance, with the exception of an annual grant made by the New England Company, now discontinued, were borne by the Government. The selection of a suitable Principal with the necessary tact and experience is, therefore, in my judgment, an exceedingly difficult and exacting task. The Principal in this case occupies a unique position, in that he is not only responsible for the operation and management of the farm, but is responsible as well for the employment of the staff, the organization of the classroom work and the religious instruction provided for the pupils. It is true, the classroom work is inspected by the Public School Inspector for the County, but the control exercised until now by the Diocese of Huron and by this Department appears to have been more or less nominal. The officials of the Indian Affairs Branch feel that in view of the large annual expenditures involved, and in this regard I am wholly in agreement with them, the administration of the Institution should be more closely knit and that the\n\n......Principal should\nPrincipal should be constantly subject to direction either by the Government or by the Diocese.\n\nThe Department would be prepared to undertake this direction immediately, but only on the understanding that an experienced agricultural college graduate with pedagogical training were selected for the Principalship. This proposal, however, did not appear at all acceptable to your representatives. Consideration was then given to the operation of the school under your own immediate direction, extending to you full freedom of choice in the selection of the Principal on the understanding that this Department would continue to pay, in the future as in the past, the regular per capita grants.\n\nIt is altogether likely that the New England Company will be prepared to enter into an agreement with Your Grace for the operation and management of the school. I do feel that in view of all the circumstances the Diocese of Huron should assume this responsibility. The work accomplished at the Institute has not been satisfactory in recent years. The change of policy now suggested, that is, operation either by the Government or by the Diocese would, I feel sure, result in more efficient administrative effort and prove more satisfactory to all parties.\n\nMay I embrace this opportunity to thank you very heartily for your personal interest in this matter and for the appreciation expressed in your communication.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMost Reverend C. A. Seager, D.D., LL.D.,\nArchbishop of Huron,\nBishop Croxen Hall,\nLONDON, Ontario.\n\n(Sgd.) J. Allison Glen -\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nSeptember 25th, 1945.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYou will recall I wrote to you on May 23rd giving the action of our Executive Committee on May 22nd, regarding the Mohawk Institute. When the Minutes were read at our meeting on September 21st, it was decided, in the interests of clearness, to point out that the action, quoted in my letter to you, was influenced by the assurances you had given us, namely:\n\n1. That the Principal of the Institute would be a person acceptable to the Bishop of the Diocese.\n\n2. That an Advisory Committee be set up consisting of the Indian Agent, a nominee of the Bishop of the Diocese and the Principal; and\n\n3. That there be an experimental period of from three to five years.\n\nI am not familiar with the negotiations regarding the Institute since we visited you in July, but I trust a satisfactory settlement will soon be reached.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL. A. Dixon\n\nL.D.K.\nAugust 14th, 1945,\n\nMost Reverend,\nC.A. Seager, M.A., D.D.,\nBishopstowe, London, Ont.\n\nYour Grace:\n\nArchbishop Townshend has asked me to send you a statement re the source from which the money for repairs came.\n\nI cannot be definite concerning the first two or three years of my tenure of office but I do know that for the last twelve or thirteen years all repairs, improvements, additional equipment, machinery, and the henhouse and boys' Master's cottage were paid from New England Company grant. All the stock, (cattle, etc.) and equipment as well as the buildings belong to the Company. Included in these repairs is the new boiler which was installed fairly recently as well as the one which it replaced.\n\nI am of the opinion that the addition to the main building and the new cattle barn were built in lieu of the rental the Department were to pay for the use of the property but I am not sure of this. I was told by Mr. Worrier, who was Superintendent of Indian Education until his death, that no money was paid to New England Company as it was covered by expenditures on the buildings.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. Money sent to me for repairs was usually designated \"Current expenses.\"\nwould appreciate Mr. Zimmerman taking immediate charge of the Mohawk Institute.\" By every reasonable consideration therefore this means that he is appointed Principal, not merely \"temporarily placed in charge\" as stated in your letter. No man of his high ability and equipment would of course accept such an uncertain position, nor would I nominate any such man. Mr. Zimmerman is one of the ablest of our younger men and eminently fitted, academically and otherwise for the position. He is equally competent for other positions in the Church which he has occupied with great success in the past. Indeed it was a hardship for his recent parishioners to lose his services. I think therefore some assurance should be given him by the Department that his position is reasonably secure, so long of course as he renders efficient service. Otherwise he can hardly be expected to continue to occupy it.\n\nParagraph three of the Memorandum refers to the Department carrying on the School as formerly until a decision is arrived at. This, however, has nothing to do with Mr. Zimmerman's position as Principal.\n\nThe other reference is to the highly important comment in your letter that the \"entire costs of operation and maintenance, with the exception of an annual grant made by The New England Co. Ltd., new discipline,\" were borne by the Government,\" a statement which I question in view of information afforded me by the former Principal. To my assist you in forming a right judgment in the matter I enclose a copy of a letter written to me by the former Principal.\n\nA further letter from him, written to me since I received your letter, confirms these statements and I feel quite sure that you will wish to be quite clear on this important matter. Should therefore you wish any further information we shall of course be glad to give it.\n\nWith kind regards, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) Charles Burton.\n\nCK/CJ\n\nEnclosures 2.\nTHE BISHOP'S ROOM\nBishop Cronyn Hall\nLondon, Canada, 13th September, 1945.\n\nThe Honourable,\nThe Minister of Mines and Resources,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nHonourable and Dear Sir:\n\nThis letter is an acknowledgement of yours of August 30th. Since then I have received a letter from The New England Company under date of August 31st to say that they propose sending out a representative to Canada (to which fact you refer in your letter) to have the matter of the Mohawk Institute administration finally straightened out.\n\nMeantime the Executive Committee of the Synod of Huron, which meets tomorrow, will consider the contents of the Memorandum signed by Mr. Phelan representing the Department of Indian Affairs. In view of this I shall refer only to two matters about which we feel concerned.\n\nThe first is the position of the Rev. W.J. Zimmerman, now very busily engaged in getting the School under way for the season's work. I understand that he now has over 100 pupils enrolled. I cannot refer too highly to his deep interest and efficiency as shown so far, and also to the active co-operation he is receiving from Colonel Randle, the Indian Agent on the Reserve. Your letter to me, however, gives me some concern. It is as follows:\n\n\"It is my understanding that a Clergyman, Rev. Mr. Zimmerman, nominated by you, has been temporarily placed in charge of the School and will, no doubt, act as principal until a representative of the New England Company visits Canada toward the end of the present calendar year.\"\n\nIt is necessary to draw your attention to the fact that Mr. Zimmerman was appointed Principal before word was received as to the visit of the representative of The New England Company. Indeed his appointment was actually made and became effective on August 10th last.\n\nFinding, however, upon inquiry that it was the intention of Mr. Phelan, representing the Department, that the Synod of Huron had assumed responsibility for the administration of the School, and knowing that such was not the case, he naturally declined to act until that matter was settled. He resumed the office of Principal, however, under the terms of a Memorandum signed by Mr. Phelan, a copy of which I enclose the decisive phrase in which is \"The Indian Affairs Branch...\"\nOttawa, September 29, 1945.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Seager:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of September 16, which I have considered very carefully.\n\nWith regard to the first part of your letter, I do not feel that any further decision is required in connection with Reverend Mr. Zimmerman's status, until the visit of the representatives of the New England Company.\n\nI note particularly that you again refer to the statement made in my previous communication, regarding the financial arrangements at the Mohawk Institute, and that you enclose a copy of a letter which you received from the former Principal. This gentleman had no definite knowledge regarding our agreement with the New England Company. There was never any question of the Department paying rent for the Mohawk Institute, and when I assure you that we have spent, from Parliamentary Appropriation, upwards of $65,000.00 in repairs and improvements on the Mohawk Institute since the Department took over the school in 1938, I believe you will realize that the statement made in my previous communication is correct.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMost Reverend C.

I think there must be some misunderstanding on your part because the letter you enclosed bears out the statement I previously made which was that the entire cost of operation and maintenance, with the exception of an annual grant made by the New England Company, now discontinued, were borne by the Government. There is nothing in the Reverend Mr. Snell's letter which would indicate that funds from other sources were used to assist in the operation of the School. As you know, the Government paid the per capita grant and this with the annual grant made by the New England Company usually carried the operations of the School. There were times, however, when it was necessary to provide other funds from Parliamentary appropriations. Since 1922 the sum of $50,000 of funds from this source was used in repairs and improvements to the Institute.\n\nThe Most Reverend C.A. Seager, D.D., LL.D.,\nArchbishop of Huron,\nBishop Cronyn Hall,\nLONDON, Ontario.\nI thought it only proper that I should explain the matter to you. There never has been any question in reference to the grant that was made by the New England Company, which, of course, was used to assist in operating the School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten date: Oct. 5.]\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nNov. 12, 1945\n\nRe: Mohawk Institute\n\nA letter is received this morning from Mr. Arthur Cochrane, Governor, New England Company, London, dated Oct. 29th, acknowledging the Minister's letter of the 11th ult., with its enclosure.\n\nMr. Cochrane says - quotes: \"As soon as definite arrangements have been made regarding the visit of our representative to Canada we will again communicate with you\".\n\nThis for your information.\n\n[Signature]\n\n- Prime Secretary.\n\nMr. Hoey:\nTo note.\n\n[Signature]\n\nNOV 13 1945\nVice-Regal Couple Sign Historic Queen Anne Bible\n\nThe signatures of the Earl of Athlone, soon to end his term as governor-general of Canada, and Princess Alice have been affixed to the historic Queen Anne Bible belonging to the Six Nations Indians of the Grand River Reserve near Brantford, Ont.\n\nThe Bible, printed in England in 1709 during the reign of William of Orange, bears the signatures of all the governors-general since 1867 and those of all members of the royal family who have visited Canada.\n\nDue to the war, the Governor-General and Princess Alice were unable to visit the reserve, and Lt.-Col. E. F. Randle, superintendent of the Six Nations Indians, brought the Bible to the capital on behalf of the Iroquois tribes which form the Six Nations.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, the Six Nations remained loyal to the Crown and fought with the British. For safety, the Bible and plate were buried in the woods.\n\nWhen American independence was recognized, the Iroquois joined the \"Empire Loyalists\" in the exodus to Canada and were given title to the lands which make up the Grand River Reserve as compensation for the loss of their territories in New York.\n\nChapel Replaced.\n\nKing George III decided to replace the chapel Queen Anne had given the Indians. Shortly after the revolution, a party of the Indians returned to the forest cache, retrieved the Bible and plate and smuggled it across the border for the new chapel known as \"His Majesty's Chapel of the Mohawks.\"\n\nAmong the signatures are those of King Edward VII, then Prince of Wales, 1860; the Duke of Connaught, 1887; King George V and Queen Mary, 1931; Princess Patricia of Connaught, 1944; Prince Albert, Duke of Windsor, then Prince of Wales, 1919; Prince George, later Duke of Kent, whose signature is undated, and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, during the royal tour of 1939.\nOttawa, February 23, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Macdonald:\n\nI have arranged with Mr. Philip Phelan, Chief of the Training Division, to proceed to Brantford and undertake an investigation of conditions at the Mohawk Institute. Mr. Phelan has assured me that he will arrive there Tuesday, February 26th, and will report to you immediately following his arrival in the city.\n\nIt is unnecessary for me to state that conditions at the Mohawk Institute have not been satisfactory to this department for a number of years. An attempt was made a year or so ago to secure the services of a thoroughly qualified and experienced teacher to take charge of the school. This proposal, however, was vigorously opposed by the Archbishop of Huron, with the result that no definite action has yet been taken, although Mr. Zimmerman has been placed temporarily in charge. The building is the property of the New England Company of London, England. This missionary society has promised the Minister that they would send out a representative to discuss the future of the Institute with him and with the Archbishop of Huron, just as soon as transportation facilities would permit of such a visit. In the meantime, and until this representative of the missionary society arrives, it is my hope that Mr. Phelan will be able to adjust matters to the satisfaction of the group on whose behalf you have written.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.

It was announced today by Mr. R. A. Harvey, director of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Brantford Women's Council, in a report following an inspection of the school, stated that a \"division of authority\" in administration caused conditions that required immediate investigation at the boys' school.\n\nThe report, urging increased Federal grants, was presented at a meeting last night attended by Mr. MacDonald and Archdeacon A. G. Clarke of Grace Anglican Church.\n\nMr. MacDonald said today he had telephoned the information to R. A. Harvey, director of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, and requested immediate action. Mr. Harvey told him an Inspector would make a full investigation and consult with members of the Women's Council who had made the report.\n\nIt was pointed out that grants from the New England Missionary Society in Great Britain, which owns the school lands and buildings, were suspended following the outbreak of war.\n\nThe local Women's Council recommended in their report that more teachers be provided, classroom equipment be increased, and a recreation room, gymnasium and library be added, and that Government grants for upkeep of both children and school be increased.\n\nOttawa, Feb. 22 (CP) \u2014 R. A. Harvey, director of Indian Affairs, said today administrative readjustments were being made at the Mohawk Institute at Brantford, following withdrawal of an annual contribution from its agency by the New England Missionary Society.\n\nHe did not elaborate, but said a representative of his department would go to Brantford to inquire into alleged lack of proper clothing and educational facilities for Indian children attending the institute.\nRA55 19=BRANTFORD ONT 25 1002A\nR A HOEY ESQ, DEPT OF MINES AND RESOURCES=\n0096 :DEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA ONT=\nWILL YOU KINDLY ADVISE BY WIRE HOUR OF MR PHELANS ARRIVAL\nAND HOW LONG HE WILL REMAIN IN CITY=\nW ROSS MACDONALD DEPUTY SPEAKER.\n\nFEB 25 1946\nOTTAWA February 25 1946\n\nHONOURABLE ROUS MACDONALD M.P.\nBRAMFORD ONTARIO\n\nARRIVING BRAMFORD TEN RIGHT TUESDAY MORNING\nHERE WE CAN SETTLE MATTER SATISFACTORILY BY WEDNESDAY\nAFTERNOON\n\nPhilip Phelan\n\nCharge Indian Affairs\nmines and resources\nDenies Anglicans Are Responsible\n\nBrantford, Feb. 24 (Special) \u2014 Ven. Archdeacon A. L. G. Clarke said here Saturday the Anglican Church has not nor ever has been responsible for the upkeep and repairs of the buildings at the Mohawk Institute, where conditions described as \"terrible\" by the disbanded Council of Women are to be investigated. The administration of the Institute is an Anglican concern, by arrangement with the Indian Affairs Department and the New York State Board of Control. The Women's Council has charged the buildings are in a bad state and the children don't get enough food or proper clothing.\n\nThe Indian Department is responsible for the buildings, upkeep and repairs and makes a grant annually, Archdeacon Clarke said. The administration \"remains in the hands of the Anglican Concern,\" he said. The New England Company which has leased the buildings to the department, and had been making a grant of \u00a31,000 pounds a year to the department, had not been able to pay the grant in the past year or more because its real estate in London had been reduced to rubble from bombing.\n\nHe pointed out that negotiations have been going on for some time between the company, the Indian Department and the Anglican Diocese of Huron to put the administration of the school in the hands of the Church of England.\n\n\"A representative of the company coming to Canada to complete negotiations will come as soon as he obtains passage from England,\" Archdeacon Clarke said.\n\n[Signature]\nFeb. 25/76\nChurch Not Responsible For Upkeep of Institute\n\n\"While the Principal of the Mohawk Institute is an Anglican clergyman by arrangement with the Indian Affairs Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources, and with the New England Company, the Anglican Church is not now, nor has ever been responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the Institute,\" declared Ven.

Clarke, Rector of Grace Anglican Church, in an address given at the Executive meeting this morning regarding the request of the Local Council of Women for immediate action to be taken in which the Indian children were living at the Mohawk Institute.\n\nAt the meeting held here last Thursday recommendations were made, following the inspection of the school by the Council Executive, advocating more clothing for the youngest and most vulnerable children, additional and recreational facilities and general building improvements.\n\nThe recommendation was placed in the hands of Mr. Macdonald, K.C., M.P., who immediately contacted authorities in Ottawa, and as a result, Mr. R. A. Hoey, Director of Indian Affairs, arranged that the representative of his Department would come to Brantford to inquire into the affairs of the Institute, clothing and educational facilities for the children attending the Institute. He said that arrangements were being made following the withdrawal of the assistance for its upkeep by the New England Company, London, England.\n\nArchdeacon Clarke continued:\n\n\"The usual arrangement for Indian residential schools of all kinds is that the Department is responsible for buildings, upkeep, and repairs and the school is charged annually to the cost of keeping the students of the school, while the maintenance of the school is in the hands of the denomination concerned.\"\n\nArchdeacon Clarke concluded:\n\n\"The usual arrangement for Indian residential schools of all kinds is that the Department is responsible for buildings, upkeep, and repairs and the school is charged annually to the cost of keeping the students of the school, while the maintenance of the school is in the hands of the denomination concerned.\"\n\nArchdeacon Clarke concluded:\n\n\"The usual arrangement for Indian residential schools of all kinds is that the Department is responsible for buildings, upkeep, and repairs and the school is charged annually to the cost of keeping the students of the school, while the maintenance of the school is in the hands of the denomination concerned.\"\n\nArchdeacon Clarke concluded:\n\n\"The usual arrangement for Indian residential schools of all kinds is that the Department is responsible for buildings, upkeep, and repairs and the school is charged annually to the cost of keeping the students of the school, while the maintenance of the school is in the hands of the denomination concerned.\"\nChurch Not Responsible For Upkeep of Institute\n\nWhile the Principal of the Mohawk Institute is an Anglican clergyman, by arrangement with the Indian Affairs Branch of the Government, he is not responsible, and with the New England Company, the Anglican Church has never been responsible for the upkeep and repairs of the buildings.\n\nArchdeacon A. G. Clarke, Rectory of Craig Anglican Church, in an interview with the Globe and Mail, regarding the request of the Local Council of Women for improvements on the grounds in which the Indian children were living at the Mohawk Institute last Thursday, recommendations were made following an inspection of the institute by the Council Executive, advising more clothing for the youngest students, more recreational facilities and general building improvements.\n\nThe recommendations were placed in the hands of Robert Macdonald, K.C., M.P., who immediately contacted authorities in Ottawa, and as a result, Mr. A. H. Hay, Director of Indian Affairs, arranged for a representative of his Department to come to Bradford to inquire into the alleged lack of sufficient clothing and educational facilities for the children attending the school. It was stated that administrative readjustments were being made following the recommendations, but no annual grant for its upkeep by the New England Company, London, Ontario.\n\nArchdeacon Clarke continued:\n\n\"The usual arrangement for Indian residential schools of all denominations is that the government pays for buildings, upkeep, and repairs and makes a per capita grant on behalf of the parents of the students of the school, while the administration remains in the hands of the denomination concerned.\"\n\nUntil recent times the school was maintained entirely by the New England Company, which erected the present buildings.\nCHURCH NOT RESPONSIBLE\n\n(Continued from page 1)\n\ngreat many years ago. These buildings have been leased by the Department by the New England Company, with a grant being made to the Department by the Company of $1,000 per month.\n\nSince the revenues of the New England Company largely were derived from real estate in Old London and since this real estate was reduced to half its former size by the war, the Company has been unable, in the past year, to pay the rent. But they do not wish to give up entirely their interest in the school.\n\nIn these circumstances negotiations have been going on for some time between the New England Company, the Indian Affairs Branch, and the Anglican Diocese of Huron, looking to the taking over of the administration of the school by the Church of England. A representative of the Company is to come to Canada to complete the negotiations so that he can obtain passage from England.\n\nLT.-COL. E. P. HANCOCK\n\nLt.-Col. E. P. Hancock, Superintendent of the Six Nations and Mississaugas of the Credit Reservations here, described the current situation. In view of the fact that a representative of the Indian Affairs Branch of the Department will arrive and that he was scheduled to come to Brantford in the near future.\nThe Expositor\n\nPublished by\nPRESTON & SONS, Limited\nBrantford, Canada\n\nMEMBER OF THE CANADIAN PRESS\n\nThe Canadian Press is exclusively devoted to the use of journalism in every province, territory, and city in The Associated Press, the world's largest news agency.\n\nA list of typical headlines of several newspapers has been included in this issue of The Expositor.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION RATES\n\n$1.00 per year\n$2.00 per two years\n$3.00 per three years\n\nAuthorized as Second Class Mail Post Office Department.\n\nEDITORIAL AS FEB. 1946\n\nMohawk Institute\n\nThe Local Council of Women has recently made a worthwhile community service by drawing public attention to conditions at the Mohawk Institute here and obtaining constructive recommendations for their improvement.\n\nThe school for Indian children is housed in an old building which for many years has been in need of some renovation. The present state of affairs has been good and there has been considerable need for modernization among several lines.\n\nThis proposal to add home economics and manual training specialists, as well as music and art teachers to the staff is well worth consideration. Not least among the other suggestions, particularly those calling for better physical culture and recreational provisions, library, study, and required classroom equipment. It would appear, in addition, that the question of health supervision should receive more attention.\n\nNone of the advice offered by the Local Council of Women reflects adversely upon any particular upon the competence of the Principal of the Institute or her staff, but as a whole the situation is described as making good bricks without straw, making it possible to run a good school without essential physical plant, equipment, and educational accommodation.\n\nIt is to be observed, also, that the so-called religious and parochial feeling in the Church of England in Canada has been superseded in recent years by the Federal Department. Upon the latter, therefore, must fall the main responsibility for correction. It should not have been tacitly admitted by the local Member of Parliament, Mr. Macdonald, who, unfortunately, has directed attention to the matter and has taken it to the proper offices.\n\nThe results in this connection have been immediate and gratifying, and Mr. Macdonald has been able to announce that an official of the Indian Affairs Department will be here early next week to make an inquiry into the matter.\n\nParticular care of the youngsters attending the Institute is a matter of prime concern, and it is to be anticipated that the Ottawa authorities, once the case has been fully reviewed, will proceed to remedy any deficiencies as promptly and completely as possible.\nL.C.W. Urges Action To Better Conditions At Mohawk Institute\n\nRecommendations for improvement and better educational and recreation building improvements at the Mohawk Institute's school for Indians aged 14 and under were approved by members of the L.C.W., M.P.A., at the meeting held Thursday afternoon in the Canadian Red Cross, William St.\n\nA report was read out of reports which were presented by members of the L.C.W. Executive Committee. They had made an inspection tour of the institute and had been conveyed to the general meeting the conditions under which the Indians lived, including insufficient clothing and other facilities.\n\nNO BLAME PLACED\n\nIt was made abundantly clear, however, through the reports presented by the members and through the clarifying addresses of Ven. Archdeacon A.J. Clarke, Bishop of the Anglican Church, and Mr. Macdonald, that the conditions did not lay upon the shoulders of the Anglican Church, but had surrounded the religious aspects of the school for many other ways for years; nor of the New England Company in providing land and buildings and which has been foreclosed, and would cease to exist for a time, pending annual grants from the Department of Indian Affairs of the Dominion Government.\n\nThe Council seemed to agree, as it was stated, from the condition of the school and from the entirely insufficient grants which were given by the Government, for the upkeep of the school.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe recommendations made by the Council were as follows:\n\n(1) The addition of highly trained instructors so that boys might be taught woodworking, mechanics, and other trades, and the basic principles of trades.\n\n(2) The addition of music staff.\n\n(3) The installation of physical education facilities, a recreation room, and a library.\n\n(4) The addition of a well-equipped library.\n\n(5) The addition of a quiet, supervised study room.\n\n(6) The addition of proper equipment for the school.\n\nThe above recommendations were made by Mrs. George Williams, the Education Convenor, who inspected the school and presented a detailed report.\n\nMiss M. Milne, R.N., Health Convenor, also reported on the conditions at the school. She pointed out that though there were no regular clinics conducted among the young Indians, sufficient dental and medical care would be soon inaugurated.\n\nFOREIGN PRESSMENT\n\nMembers of the present staff of the Mohawk Institute and the past staff members were highly commended for their fine efforts despite the dire conditions under which they had to work and it was emphasized that in no way were they being criticized for the situation.\n\nArchdeacon Clarke told the L.C.W. on the manner in which the investigation had been made and the importance for taking such keen interest in a matter which appeared to have been overlooked because it was so close, and apparently unimportant.\n\nHe stated that he would take up the affair with the proper authorities in Ottawa. But, he pointed out, to improve the situation, funds would be required from the Government, and months would be needed before such a request could be granted.\n\nMr. Macdonald asked that the findings be put in a detailed report and, if possible, an estimate of cost be included.\n\n\"NOBODY'S BABY\"\n\nArchdeacon Clarke said he wished to make it plain to members of the Council that the situation was definitely not the responsibility of the Church. He named the three responsible parties who were responsible for the care of the school, but stated the main responsibility for the situation \"seemed to be nobody's baby.\"\n\nMrs. Willoughby told the members that there was dire need for bedsteads, blankets, towels and wash cloths, tablecloths, furniture and various other things.\n\n\"To bring the situation before the proper authorities,\" she said, Mrs. Cogswell, who stated she realized obtaining sufficient funds to give the school an overhaul the school from the basement up, would take considerable time.\n\nThe matter was left in the hands of Miss Macdonald to confer with the Department of Indian Affairs and the Anglican Church, and that drastic measures were necessary to alleviate conditions in the shortest possible time.\n\nMeanwhile, it was stated, contributions would be gratefully received by Miss W. Macdonald Works Convenor, and her committee.\n\nMohawk Institute Conditions Are To Be Investigated\n\nQuick action has followed the meeting of the Local Council of the L.C.W., M.P.A., to investigate prevailing at the Mohawk Institute and a plan was brought to light. This morning Mr. Macdonald, President of the Board and Honorary Speaker of the Mohawk Assembly, presented the matter to the government. The question was to be put before the Board of Directors at its next meeting to Mr. A. Hovey, Director of Indian Affairs, and requested his cooperation.\n\nMr. Hovey stated that Mr. Macdonald's plans for the school would be sent to Brantford the early part of next week. Plans will be made and the Inspector will consult with members of the Executive of the L.C.W. and others concerned,\" he stated.\nR. A. Hoey, Esq., Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThere are attached for your information, local press reports and comment in connection with the Local Council of Women's action over the Mohawk Institute, - which from press reports you are already advised of.\n\nIn case you feel something has recently gone wrong, this office would assure you that everything is in normal good order at the Institute. The Principal and his staff have been attending to their duties, and the care, comfort and well being of the children has received first consideration, as far as circumstances and facilities permit. In fact the energy and interest shown by the Principal has resulted in probably the children receiving the best all-round feeding and care in years.\n\nSo this office can only express regret that it is not possible to advise you what is behind this added interest by an organization who have never previously shown the slightest interest - or why they should have placed the spotlight on the Mohawk Institute in rather an unfair manner.\n\nWhat is known is that members of the Local Council of Women made a very cursory visit to the school a few weeks ago on the pretence they wished to supply some recreational equipment for the children - but instead spent the brief period of their visit questioning Mrs. Zimmerman on various matters and features concerning the school's administration.\n\nOne member also visited this office in my absence and asked for Mr. Moses - and there was a long discussion over the school - but what was said is not known, though Mr. Moses states he said little, as Mr. Hilton Hill, the former Chief Clerk, happened in at that time and did the talking.\nOn hearing of this incident I informed the Local Council of Women that they wanted any information from my office it would be preferable if they consulted the responsible person - and they did apologize.\n\nThe President also called here, but I was on the reserve, so finally we only had an unsatisfactory telephone conversation from which it was obvious they had a wrong picture, but were determined to make it public. I suggested they send a written report and recommendation to the Department direct, and see what resulted, - but I was informed that the local Member was attending their meeting and they would accept his advice.\n\nYou might also wish to know, Mr. Zimmerman was in the hospital on the occasion of their brief visit to the Institute - but the Local Council of Women never had the courtesy to discuss the matter at any time since with him.\n\nThe recommendations made by the Local Council of Women are highly desirable and commendable, and are all likely to have been discussed among us and planned to some degree, but are dependent largely on increased grants by Parliament - and by all-round good management by the Principal.\n\nHad the Local Council of Women taken this action in past years it would have been more understandable, as the then Principal was sadly lacking in every quality to make the Institute a happy home for children,- but to do it at this time when it should be obvious to everyone that the Department is changing; the Principal was intent on an all-round improvement, seems rather like an attempt to be sensational and gain publicity rather than be helpful and just, with their case built up on a somewhat limited knowledge and one-sided viewpoint of the Institution.\n\nYours truly,\n\nLt.-Col. E.F. Handle,\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, February 26, 1946.\n\nDear Colonel Randle:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of February 23rd, together with certain newspaper clippings sent forward therewith.\n\nI do not know that any good purpose would be served by entering into a discussion with respect to the operation of the Mohawk Institute at this particular time. Conditions at this school have never been satisfactory at any time in recent years, and the Local Council must have been aware of this fact. They should be aware also that the government, more than a year ago, offered to assume full responsibility for the administration of this school and were prepared to appoint as principal an agricultural college graduate with full professional and academic standing. This proposal, however, was not acceptable to the Archbishop of Huron, with the result that a clergyman was temporarily placed in charge. It is my earnest hope that the representative of the New England Company will visit Canada at an early date. At the time of his visit, the future of this school and those responsible for its operation can be reviewed.\n\nIn response to a telephone call received by me from Mr. Macdonald, I have sent Mr. Phelan to Brantford. He will, no doubt, get in touch with you immediately following his arrival in the city.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nLt.-Col. S. P. Randle,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBRANTFORD,\nOntario.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nMohawk Institute Investigated By Division Chief\n\nBrantford, Feb. 26 (Special) \u2014 Philip Phalen, chief of the Training Division of the Department of Indian Affairs, has arrived here to investigate conditions at the Mohawk Institute, where members of the Local Council of Women have charged Indian children are living under unsatisfactory conditions.\n\nRecommendations for improvements in physical and academic lines were made by the Local Council of Women following a report by J. M. Anguish, secretary of the Council for Social Agencies, on his report on conditions at the Indian children's school. Mr. Anguish said children eat off \"sadly battered and filthy\" enamelware, have no decent room for recreation nor enough clothing to give them a change of underwear each week.\n\n\"Wastefully Inadequate\"\n\nMrs. George T. Cockshutt, president of the women's council, read the report to Mr. Phalen at a meeting here today. The report said the building, as a whole, is sound, but dingy and drab. Facilities are woefully inadequate, and tables and benches in the dining hall are unpainted.\n\n\"The sleeping quarters at the time when Anguish visited the Institute consisted of large narrow rooms into which cats were crowded,\" the report said. \"Toilet facilities, which were inadequate for the number in each dormitory, were situated in one corner and surrounded only by cats. The rooms were devoid of lockers or shelves for keeping personal belongings.\"\n\nThe report added that recreation rooms were almost unfurnished and were damp, cold and cheerless. All rooms, it said, were spotlessly clean, but the staff was inadequate. As a result no manual training is given here and there is no capable housemaid, according to the report. There is no provision for a medical checkup of the children.\n\nNo Blame Attached\n\nNo blame was attached in the report to Rev. Mr. Zimmerman, principal, or his wife. Appeals have been made to Brantford churches for clothing and bedding for the children.\n\nNeed for health protection for Six Nations Indians was stressed by Dr. W. L. Hutton, M.O.H., head of Brant County health unit, in a letter to Miss Cockshutt.\n\n\"The Brant County Health Unit,\" the letter said, \"was set up within the Township of Tuscarora, in which the reservation is located. For the protection of the rest of the county the reservation should receive the same kind of treatment as the rest of the county. However, local authorities on the reservation are in favor of it. The consent, cooperation and financial aid of the Dominion Government is necessary.\"\n\nThe city and county pay $1.50 per head for such treatment. Coal on the reservation would be perhaps $2 per head, $3 if dental treatment was included, because of conditions there now.\nPHILIP PHALEN OPENS PROBE AT INSTITUTE\n\nPhilip Phalen, chief of the training division of the Indian Affairs Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, arrived here this morning to begin his investigation into conditions at the Mohawk Institute, Indian School for boys.\n\nHe was expected at the Institute this morning and at 2 o'clock this afternoon will confer with members of the Executive of the local Council of Women, which was responsible for the inquiry being made. The Council completed an investigation of its own and presented its findings at a meeting previously reported in The Expositor.\n\nMr. Phalen hopes to conclude his investigations here by tomorrow afternoon, but will stay longer if necessary.\n\nNOTHING TO SAY\n\nMr. Phalen told The Expositor at noon that he was here to investigate the \"whole matter\" (referring to Mohawk Institute) and that he had nothing to say for publication.\n\n\"Any information will have to come from R. A. Hoey, Director of Indian Affairs, to whom I will make my report,\" Mr. Phalen said.\nRecommendations\n\n1. The addition of highly trained domestic science teachers to the staff so that young girls might receive instruction in homemaking, child training, home nursing, and kindred subjects... or other words.\n\n2. The addition of highly trained instructors so that boys might be taught woodworking, housekeeping, and farming methods and the basic principles of building.\n\n3.

The addition of a well-grounded library.\n\n6. The addition of a quiet...\nThe addition of proper classroom equipment\n\nThe addition of the above named staff would provide the proper supervision which is badly lacking at work, play, classes, meals and in the dormitories.\nAs the Junior Health convenor of the local Council of Women, I visited the hospital in October.\n\nI found there a graduate nurse but no infirmary to take sick people when they are too weak and nothing.\n\nI would recommend the following:\n\n1. Infirmaries to be set up in the hospital when sick and weak people need treatment for minor ailments.\n2. Urgent request from the doctor to assist with daily care.\n3. Additional wards to the hospital.\n4. Need for increased nutrition and to plan the patient's meals.\n5.

Ross Macdonald, M.P., and you informed him, in reply, that I would go to Brantford.\n\nImmediately on arrival in Brantford on Tuesday morning, I phoned Mr. Macdonald, and he stated that the Local Council of Women had arranged a meeting for 2:30 P.M. on Tuesday in the Red Cross Room. He further advised me that it was their intention to have a newspaper reporter present at the meeting. Following our conversation, I discussed the situation with Mr. Macdonald, and he agreed to communicate with the President, pointing out my position. Mr. Macdonald and I arrived at the meeting at 2:30 and a reporter from the Brantford Reporter was present. I told him that I would not agree to make any statement to him or to the members of the Women's Council who were present. He said that under these circumstances he would withdraw, and he did so. The only publicity that the meeting obtained was an account of the charges the Local Council of Women consider should be made in the conduct of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nThe President of the Brantford Local Council of Women is Mrs. George T. Doakshutt and she called on the chairmen of the various committees to report their findings.\n\nIt appears that the Acting Principal, Reverend J. J. Zimmerman, was ill in the hospital for a period of approximately 3 weeks in the month of January. During that period a group of members of the Brantford Local Council of Women went to the Mohawk Institute and interviewed Mrs. Zimmerman. They told her that they had approximately $1,000.00 to spend and expressed a desire to assist the Mohawk Institute. In order to do so, they asked Mrs. Zimmerman what was required. It is evident from what later newspapers wrote, that Mrs. Zimmerman considered the ladies were friendly towards the Institute and consequently she pointed out to them several things that could be improved. However, in subsequent newspaper articles they either accidentally or deliberately changed the tenor of her remarks. For instance, she evidently told the ladies that the school was short of clothing and blankets. This statement was apparently reported by the\nLadies to the effect that the children had no clothing and no blankets. These latter statements are certainly incorrect. It is true that the school has no large surplus stock of either clothing or blankets, but from personal observations of Colonel Randle and myself, I can assure you that the children are comfortably clad and that sufficient blankets are available for all the children in residence.\n\nDuring the course of the meeting I pointed out to the members of the Local Council of Women that the observations contained in newspaper reports and which apparently emanated from them did not convey a true picture of conditions at the Mohawk Institute, but it was practically impossible to have them recede from the position they had taken.\n\nThe Council of Women expressed the definite opinion that the children were not receiving sufficient medical and dental care. One of the members stated that in her opinion the school should be visited by a doctor daily. I pointed out to them that a doctor is on call at all times, that there is a trained nurse on the staff of the school and that in the event of any child becoming ill outside side such child is removed either to Lady Williston Hospital, or to the Sir Robert McLaughlin Hospital in Brantford. I also mentioned that we hold dental clinics at regular intervals and in the event of any child developing sudden dental trouble such child is immediately taken to one of the local dentists in Brantford.\n\nIn spite of the very definite statement that I made in this regard, they still expressed the opinion that additional medical care was necessary.\n\nThe statement was also made that a member of the staff should sleep close to the dormitories. I pointed out to the Local Council of Women that the bedroom of one of the male members of the staff is directly beside the boys' dormitory and that the sleeping quarters occupied by the Principal and his wife are immediately outside the girls' dormitory. It would appear, from the statements they made in this particular regard, that they did not inspect the building very carefully.\n\nThe Local Council of Women consider that the following additions should be made to the staff (a) a highly trained domestic science teacher, so that young girls might receive training in home-making, child-training, house nursing and kindred subjects; (b) a manual training instructor; and (c) a music and art teacher. In regard to these recommendations I pointed out to them that all the girls are taught cooking and sewing under the direction of a member of the staff. It is true that this staff member is not always a trained domestic science teacher but is a person well qualified to teach cooking. We had a manual training teacher at this school two years ago. Since then we have been unable to engage a qualified manual training teacher, owing to circumstances beyond our control. The appointment of music and art teachers to the staff is a matter of opinion. Certainly, such teachers are engaged at few, if any, of our schools.\n\nThe Council of Women complained regarding the general condition of the school. It is true that the building was erected\nmany years ago, but it was rebuilt in 1923. The playrooms available for the children are not as spacious as they might be. The complaint of the Council of Women regarding the size of the dormitories is unfounded, as these are sufficiently large to provide the necessary air space for the number of children enrolled.\n\nAs you are aware, the 21-year lease of the Mohawk Institute, given to the Department by the New England Company, expired in 1943. One provision of that lease was that the Principal should be a Minister of the Anglican Church. When that lease expired in 1943, the New England Company agreed to re-lease the building, but in their new lease made no mention of the necessity of appointing a Minister as Principal. You will recall that His Grace the Archbishop of Huron took exception to this clause and stated that in his opinion an Anglican Minister should be appointed in view of the long association of the Anglican Church with the Mohawk Institute. As a result of the stand taken by His Grace, the lease has not been renewed by the New England Company, either with the Department or with the Diocese of Huron. In view of this position, I pointed out to the Council of Women that in my opinion the Department could not legally spend any money on the Mohawk Institute. I further pointed out that if the lease was eventually concluded between the Department and the New England Company, the Department would then be responsible for repairs and improvements required to the building. On the other hand, if the lease was concluded between the New England Company and the Diocese of Huron, this Department would only be responsible for payment of the per capita grant. Archdeacon Clarke, of Brantford, had given an interview to the paper, pointing out that the Church of England was in no way responsible for any situation that might arise at the Mohawk Institute. In view of his statement I thought it advisable to have an interview with him, and the Indian Superintendent, Colonel Randle, and I called on Archdeacon Clarke at 11.30 on Wednesday, February 27th. We discussed the whole matter and pointed out to him the situation and expressed regret that he had seen fit to express the position of the Anglican Church. I told him politely that I thought it would have been preferable to make no statement to the press on the matter unless it was made by either Archdeacon Townshend or Mr. Lucas, who were the gentlemen originally appointed by His Grace the Archbishop of Huron to conduct negotiations with the Department. I pointed out to Archdeacon Clarke the amount which we have expended on the building since the beginning of the lease in 1922 and reminded him that general conditions at the Mohawk Institute had deteriorated, due to the neglect of the former Principal, Reverend H. E. Small, whose services were dispensed with in July last year. Archdeacon Clarke agreed with me that Mr. Small's services had not been satisfactory. I also reminded the Archdeacon that the present Principal, Rev. S. J. Zimmerman, had been acting Principal, nominated by His Grace Archbishop Leger. In view of this, it is hardly fair for the Church to divest itself of all responsibility.\n\nColonel Randle accompanied me on a complete tour of all sections of the Mohawk Institute. As stated previously in this report, the building is not modern but is comfortable. It is kept in a very cleanly manner. Probably the worst fault is that the recreation rooms for both boys and girls are in the basement, and while an effort is being made to do so, it is difficult to make these rooms as attractive as all concerned would like to have them. However, Mr. Zimmerman is making an earnest endeavour to improve conditions in this regard. The toilet facilities adjacent to the\ndormitories are not as extensive as they should be, but owing to the construction of the building, improvements in this particular regard could not be made without very heavy expenditure. Adequate toilet and bathroom facilities are provided in the basement for the girls and adequate toilets and shower baths are provided in the basement for the boys.\n\nIn going over the building, we found that the doors to the fire escapes were closed with panic bolts, which could be easily opened. The fire escapes are iron steps, protected by iron railings, and were free from snow and ice.\n\nColonel Handley and myself suggested to the Principal certain improvements that could be made at once in the playrooms in order to make them more attractive. The Principal promised to have this matter receive immediate attention.\n\nThe public school inspector was interviewed but he did not know any qualified vocational teacher whose services could be obtained at present. It may be impossible to secure such a teacher before September 1st. I instructed both Colonel Handley and the Principal to continue their efforts to secure a manual training teacher, there is a building suitable for manual training and we have sufficient supply of tools in it. When I told the Local Council of Women that the school was equipped in this manner, they expressed surprise as they had not been shown this particular building. It is a separate building from the main building.\n\nConditions generally at the Mohawk Institute have improved since Nov. 8th, Zimmerman took charge. Many of the complaints made by the Local Council of Women are the result of the unsatisfactory services of Rev. H. W. Bell during the last two or three years of his term as principal.\n\nA peculiar feature of the whole affair is that Mrs. Cookshutt, President of the Local Council of Women, has never interviewed Mrs. Zimmerman at any time. She visited the school during the Principal's absence in hospital owing to illness and interviewed Mrs. Zimmerman who happens to be new to the work and probably said more than she should have done. She did not interview our Indian Superintendent but instead rushed into print and had the opinions of the Local Council of Women broadcast over the local radio station. Mrs. Cookshutt is a very determined lady and will probably keep up the agitation if she can continue to obtain the support of the other members of the Council. At the conclusion of the meeting, since the ladies met Cookshutt's request and that a committee (presumably including herself) should be allowed to visit the Mohawk Institute at periodic intervals in order to ascertain if the improvements they had suggested are being put into effect, I told her very definitely that we were not prepared to give her any such privilege. I pointed out that the school is visited two or three times a week by Indian Superintendent Handley and that other government officials inspected at regular intervals. I trust my decision in this regard meets with your approval.\n\nPhilip [signature]\nChief, Training Division.\nNIGHT CABLEGRAM\n\nMr Arthur Cochrane\nGovernor New England Company\n26 Bloomsbury Square\nLondon W C England\n\nREFERENCE YOUR CABLEGRAM AUGUST TWENTY SEVEN DEPARTMENT\n\nANXIOUS TO KNOW WHEN YOUR REPRESENTATIVE WILL REACH CANADA \u2014stop\u2014 EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT SITUATION AT MOHAWK INSTITUTE SHOULD BE FINALIZED\n\nCharge Indian Affairs\nMines and Resources\n\nR A HOLT\nDirector\nMarch 15, 1946.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nMrs. Zimmerman this morning received a phone call from one of the ladies in the city regarding a sum of $10.00 which was voted to assist the children at the Mohawk Institute. This money has been voted by one of the organizations in the United Church. Mrs. Zimmerman said she would refer the matter to the Principal. As the matter stands the money will be sent to the school. Some decision must be reached respecting this most urgent problem. I have been told that there are few groups responding to the appeal of the Local Council of Women.\n\nAs I remember our conversation respecting this very matter I believe that the Department has a policy. I understood that in a few days I was to receive in writing a ruling which was to guide me in these problems. To-date I have received no such direction. When asked by the local Council of Women if I would approve a city wide appeal on behalf of the children I said that I could not. I do not believe it is my duty or right to authorize anything of that character. This school is administered by the Department.\n\nOne lady who belongs to this United Church group and who knows the children at the Mohawk Institute was furious at the stories related. The report brought from the Local Council was that the children are starving. She told me that she has seen the children and she knows that it is untrue. No one has denied these stories in the Press and hence there is much gossip.\nIf this money is refused I cannot predict what the result will be as long as the stories now current are not either affirmed or denied. I do feel that you should know about this and I shall be very happy to follow your directions. My experience is limited and I would appreciate written directions. Possibly this money can be accepted since it is coming from the United Church and not from the Local Council of Women. I understand that it is being sent directly from the church. In the past I understood that I could accept help from any group that wished to help and do it quietly. We have on the staff people who belong to the United Church and the Presbyterian. This money has been voted as the result of the appeal from the Local Council of Women. There is a clear cut distinction between wishing to help the school and the habit of trying to run it.\n\nHave you any copies of the Department's Regulations regarding fire control? I cannot find anything in the files.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nW.J. [Last Name]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, March 21, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Zimmerman:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to a donation to the Mohawk Institute from one of the organizations in the city of Brantford.\n\nThis gesture on their part is a very kindly one, but, as I intimated to you when I was in Brantford, it is felt that you should decline it, with thanks.\n\nI definitely feel that it would be in the best interests of all parties concerned if you did not accept donations from any source except the Diocese of Huron. If the latter felt disposed to make any grant to you, there would be no publicity because they would be assisting you in view of the long association of the Church of England with the Mohawk Institute.\n\nThe Director again reminded me about the peculiar situation that exists at the Mohawk Institute at the present time. I refer to the fact that the building and approximately 10 acres is owned by the New England Company and the lease that was in effect for many years has now expired and has not been renewed. The greater portion of the land surrounding the school is the property of the Six Nations band. Actually the Department is not in a position to make any financial contribution to the school until the situation is fully clarified. We are still hopeful that a representative of the New England Company will visit Canada shortly, at which time we hope to adjust matters on a permanent basis.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Mr. Justice Urquhart, noted that \"considerable criticism has been made against this institution. In our opinion, we did not find any evidence to warrant such criticism.\"\n\nThe report also referred to the present Principal, Rev. W. J. Zahniser, saying, \"The Principal showed us through the building and appears to have everything in smooth running order. We wish to commend him on his capable management.\"\n\nThe report recommended, however, that \"the playroom floor be repaired and that chairs be provided for use in the girls' and boys' dormitories. It would be a nice feature if some public-spirited organization supplied the chairs.\"\n\nThe Grand Jury visited the County jail and found everything in first-class condition. The report recommended that a new defecator be purchased for the jail kitchen and that a toilet be installed in a more convenient place for use of jail guards and staff. New caving throughout was recommended for the jail house and that a new porch be placed over the outside entrance to the jail kitchen to prevent formation of ice and other hindrances.\n\nCHILDREN'S SHELTER\n\nThe Children's Aid Society building was visited and the jurymen were escorted through the building by Superintendent J. P. Temple. Everything was found to be in \"excellent shape,\" but the heating system in the children's sleeping quarters was recommended. In view of the fact that recent Grand Juries had examined or visited the hospital and Home for the Aged and Indians, no visit was made today to these institutions. The report was presented under signature of the Foreman, Clark Merritt. His Lordship lauded the sentiment.\nL.C.W. REPLY\nRE FINDINGS OF GRAND JURY\n\nIn view of the press report Wednesday of the resignation of the Supreme Court Grand Jury of Mohawk Institute and the report that it was said that \"considerable criticism has been directed against the School but in our opinion we did not find it necessary to justify such criticism,\" Mrs. George Cockburn, Chairman of the Investigating Committee of the Local Council of Women who previously submitted the criticisms and recommendations, told The Star.\n\n\"The L.C.W. Investigation Committee reported conditions as found at the Mohawk Institute, having in mind the welfare of the children and bringing the School up to present standards. Some two months of consideration preceded the drawing up of the recommendations now before the Indian Branch of the League of Women Voters' sources in Ottawa.\n\n\"Members of the Committee appointed by the L.C.W. to make the report on the Institute included the following investigators: Three former school teachers; a woman who is a specialist in child psychology; two nurses from the Mohawk Institute and who specialized in dormitory management and family welfare workers; a member of the Children's Aid Society for 29 years; a member of the Board of the Victorian Order of Nurses; and a woman of the Institute who is a registered nurse.\"\n\nThe recommendations made were as follows:\n\n1. The addition of trained domestic science teachers in homemaking, cooking, home nursing, dietetics and sanitation.\n2. The addition of trained instructors in sewing so that they might learn woodworking, hand crafts, knitting and crochet.\n3. The teaching of music and art.\n4. The installation of a well-equipped library.\n5. The addition of a quiet, supervised study room.\n6. Providing of adequate room equipment and laundry facilities for the boys and girls.\n7. The addition of a supervised recreation room for boys and girls.\n8. The installation of better lighting facilities for all children.\n9. The addition of more accommodation and teacher supervision in the dormitories.\n10. A trained dietician to plan and supervise balanced diets for the children.\n\nThe committee also pointed out that the lack of regular dental and regular medical check ups, especially for tuberculosis, typhoid and diphtheria were extremely hazardous. They suggested that the Institution be brought under the Canadian Health unit so that these services could be more effectively provided.\n\nIt was stated that an infirmary to segregate the children who were ill from the others, was also needed. Clothing for all children, bedding, dishes and cutlery were found to be in need. They suggested that the Indian Affairs Department be asked to turn over to the Institute the surplus blankets and mattresses to remedy the bedding situation.\n\nBarber shops were installed in two of the dormitory factories to save workers' time.\nJury Foreman Defends Stand on Institute\n\nThe inspection of the Mor- eau Institute by a Grand Jury selected some weeks ago by the bar of the Spring Ad- visors of the Supreme Court of Ontario was not in any way a \"pre-arranged affair\" and there was no politics in it at all, said Jury Foreman, interviewed by The Expositor at the Institute Thursday night. He said he had been told to make a report on the institution made.\n\nIn his presentation to the presiding Judge, Hon. Justice Murray, the Grand Jury noted there had been considerable criticism of the Mor- eau Institute in view of the publicity recently given to the welfare of the children in the Institute and the children in the Children's Shelter, and you won't find much criti- cism,\" he concluded.\n\nMr. Merritt stated that the classroom work was conducted in the forenoon, and practical work in the afternoon. The boys work in the outside and the girls helped in the business end whenever they were needed. \"The teaching being best when I am doing best,\" he added.\n\nThe boys are expected to do their work and furniture is a con- stant threat. A large amount of redecor- ation needs to be done and that action needs to be taken so that the building will be fit to do its job from basement to roof.\n\nMEDICAL SERVICES\n\nHe also stated that the hospital is run by a jury that will stand to medical service a great deal.\n\nRHEUMATIC SWOLLEN JOINTS\n\nDR.

Company passed on the day of one thousand nine hundred and forty-five, affixed hereto in the presence of:\n24th August, 1946.\n\nMy dear Archbishop,\n\nI am much obliged for your letter of the 31st August, which sets out fully your point of view regarding the Mohawk Institute.\n\nThe Institute has certain special features which differentiate it from the other residential schools for Indians in that the Institute itself and some ten acres of land together with the Chapel are the property of the New England Company and have been leased to the Canadian Government, while the farm, which has been worked with the Institute, is the property of the Six Nations Band of Indians.\n\nThe New England Company has felt, therefore, that the Indian Department is the proper authority to be responsible for the administration of the Institute, provided that the historic connection of the Church of England with the Institute is sufficiently safeguarded.\n\nIt appears, however, that difficulties have arisen in recent years in that Mr. Snell regarded himself as primarily responsible to the Bishop, who had appointed him to the Principalship; and that he was disinclined to act on the instructions of the Indian department, who felt that his administration of the Institute was far from satisfactory.\n\nIt was in view of this situation that the Minister expressed the view stated in his letter of 31st July, 1945, which you quote, that the administration of the Institute should be more closely knit and that the Principal should be constantly subject to direction either by the Government or by the Diocese, so as to avoid any danger of a dual control.\n\nI am\n\nMost Reverend\nThe Archbishop of Huron,\nBishop Cronyn Hall,\nLondon, Ontario.\nassistance in securing a satisfactory settlement of these long drawn out negotiations.\n\nI should be glad also if you would express to Mr. and Mrs. Weldon my cordial thanks for their kind hospitality to me.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nMy dear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI am much obliged for your letter of the 23rd August sending a revised draft of the Lease between the Canadian Government and the New England Company. I think that it embodies the agreement at which we arrived yesterday and that it will be entirely satisfactory to the New England Company and also to the Archbishop of Huron. There is only one amendment which I suggest and that is that the words \"under the supervision of the Chaplain of the Mohawk Chapel\" might be omitted from paragraph 3 of Clause II, in view of the fact that the Principal of the Institute is a clergyman and accordingly it is unnecessary to provide for the separate appointment of a Chaplain. I agree also with the deletion of the final paragraph of the draft Lease which provided for the appointment and payment of a Chaplain.\n\nI propose, therefore, to recommend the New England Company to conclude the Lease in accordance with your revised draft, and I am greatly obliged to you for your sympathetic consideration of the problem and for enabling us to arrive at a settlement of these long drawn out negotiations. Would you also be good enough to express my thanks to your Minister for his co-operation in the matter.\n\nI feel sure that the New England Company will be very glad to continue its long association with the Mohawk Institute by providing funds for the grant of scholarships to deserving Indian pupils to enable them to proceed with high school studies, and I have no doubt that the Company will wish your Department to undertake the administration of such funds as we can provide. The Company will also be glad to continue the payment\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Building,\nSparks Street, Ottawa.\nThe Archbishop's Room\nBishop Creighton Hall\nLondon, Canada.\n7th October, 1946.\n\nColonel Neary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Sir:\n\nMay I trouble you with a letter as brief as possible with regard to our Mohawk Institute School for children on the Reserve at Brantford.\n\nIt has been a deep satisfaction to note the great improvement of conditions which is going on there, but which is not by any means yet complete. We are particularly gratified and grateful for the active co-operation of your Department in building up this School. We see no reason why it should not be an example to all such institutions in the course of the next year or two.\n\nMay I, however, draw your attention to the fact that when the School at Muncey under the United Church was closed, forty children were sent to the Mohawk and are now there. No extra provision, however, appears to have been made for them except of course in regard to per capita grants. No provision was made for example for extra blankets, sheets and towels, the provision of which is quite beyond the present finances of the institution. With the Autumn and Winter drawing on the matter is of great importance.\n\nMay I also draw your attention to another fact; that until the Agreement between The New England Company and the Indian Department has been executed, and so far we have no word that this is the case, it is impossible for us to apply to our Women's Missionary Society to provide their share of the children's clothing as we have undertaken to do. This aspect of the matter is, of course, obvious. In the meantime we are informed that there is immediate need for one hundred suits of underwear for boys and seventy-five assorted sweaters on account of the approaching cold weather. There is, of course, urgency in this matter therefore and we should be grateful for some financial assistance in this connection. Once the Agreement, however, is executed, I will be in a position to write to the President of our Women's Missionary Organization with regard to clothing for the children.\n\nI am, with kind regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nC.A. Frager\nArchbishop of Huron.\nOttawa, 12 October 1946.\n\nDear Archbishop Seager:\n\nWe have received your letter of the 7th instant with reference to the Mohawk Institute.\n\nCareful consideration has been given to the contents of your letter and we have noted particularly the last paragraph of your communication.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMost Reverend C.A.

Cory,\nDepartmental Solicitor,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nLangevin Block,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 6, 1945.\n\nDear Canon Dixon:\n\nFollowing my instructions, the Chief of the Training Division went to Brantford yesterday, in order to interview Superintendent Randle with further reference to the future of the Mohawk Institute. The situation regarding this school has already been outlined to you fully, but, as I have previously intimated to you, it is felt that one of the matters requiring immediate attention is the principalship of the school. We have already notified the Reverend Mr. Snell that his services will not be required after the end of the current academic year. By that time Mr. Snell will have reached the age of 65 which, as you are aware, is the retiring age.\n\nWe are now considering the possibility of communicating with His Grace, Most Reverend C. A. Heagney, Archbishop of Huron, requesting him to suggest the names of two or three Anglican clergymen whom we could interview with a view to ascertaining if any of them would be suitable to carry on the work at the Mohawk Institute. We have in mind that the new principal should be between 30 and 40 years of age, with some business experience and also a reasonably good knowledge of farming. The latter qualification is very important, as we are under the impression that the agricultural possibilities at the Mohawk Institute have not been used to the utmost extent. By so doing, the cost of operation could be materially reduced. Our only difficulty in selecting a new principal at the present time is the fact that we cannot make him any\n\nRev. Canon L. A.

The Department feels that it would be better to have this arrangement so that Mr. Hayworth will be in full charge of all farming operations.\n\nUnder separate cover you will be written regarding the greenhouse.\n\n-2-\nOttawa, November 22, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Mohawk Institute.\n\nOn the occasion of my recent visit to this school, Indian Superintendent Randle and myself discussed with Rev. Mr. Zimmerman, the application that he has received from a number of the members of the staff for increased salary. We went over the finances of the school very carefully and at the present time it appears that the school is in a reasonably satisfactory financial condition.\n\nFor instance, all disbursements incurred during the quarter ended September 30th, 1947 were paid and when the principal received his per capita allowance for that quarter, it meant he had funds on hand to pay his expenses during the December quarter. In other words, he was practically working on the basis of one quarter ahead.\n\nMr. Zimmerman appeared to be very satisfied with his present staff with the exception of Mr. Coates who was being let out. In view of the increases in wages which is general throughout the country, I feel that it is necessary for him to make some increases at least and I, therefore, prepared the letter appearing on this file authorizing certain increases. At the present time these increases will not affect the financial condition of the school to any great extent as Mr. Coates, who has been the gardener, will not be replaced until March or April, 1948.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\nFinancial Statement\nMonth Ending October 31/47\n\nReceipts:\nBalance 426.99\nDepartment Grant 3,000.00\nFarm (Sold) 724.99\n(Courta) 270.11\nGarden (Courta) 85.75\nOther Sources 65.00 4,872.84\n\nExpenditures:\nSalaries 1,276.55\nClothing 29.72\nFuel 1,277.53\nPhone, Light, Fuel 150.46\nBuildings & Repairs 247.14\nHouse Equipment 194.05\nFarm & Garden 360.68\nTravel 17.31\nExtra Labour 24.37\nMisc. 48.77 3,626.58\n\nAssets:\nCash on Hand 174.91\nCash in Bank 3,248.37\nStock on Hand 1,600.00\nGrant earned (Remainder of Sept. 2,405.00)\nGrant) 4,115.55 11,543.83\n\nLiabilities:\nCheques O/S 2,477.02\nAccounts Payable 1,250.00 3,727.02\n\nCurrent Surplus 7,816.81\n\nCertified Correct.\n\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept.

Miss Milliken is 70 years of age and with a serious cardiac condition she will not be able to take full duty.\n\nI do not know if Mr. Phelan has discussed the matter with you. The problem seemed to center about the necessity of a graduate or practical nurse. I can report this that something will have to be done. Mrs. Fry and Miss Hamper however willing cannot bear too long the extra duties of nursing and all that those in that office have done. Mrs. Smith and Miss Milliken cared for the sick plus many other duties. One must not lose sight of that fact.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, December 6, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Zimmerman:\n\nWe have your letter of the 2nd instant and it is noted that owing to ill health, Miss Milliken is not able to resume duties at the Mohawk Institute.\n\nIn view of the fact that the medical officer's services are readily available and that children seriously ill are placed in the Lady Willindon Hospital, the Department feels that it should be satisfactory to engage a practical nurse.\n\nAs you are aware, the selection of staff is in your hands.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard E. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. W.J. Zimmerman,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nPP/MCD\nDecember 6, 1947.\n\nColonel B.F. Neary,\nSupt. Welfare & Trainig,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nMy dear Colonel Neary:\n\nMay I take this opportunity of thanking you for the rental from Cockshutt's and the remainder of the money from the New England Company. I do appreciate your kindly interest and help at this time.\n\nI am enclosing the forms for the grant towards Mr. Anderson's salary. I have enclosed the form for December and I hope that you do not feel that this date is too early. I am trying to clear up all our obligations at the end of the quarter. I am trying to avoid a deficit. Could these grants come along shortly?\n\nLast year a special grant was authorized for those going to Collegiate. I have not received the last half of the special grant for Dorothy Jamieson. The amount left over is $37.50.\n\nThis year Pauline Commandant and Lois Claus are attending the Collegiate. Will there be any special grant for them? They are residing at the Institute.\n\nWith this matter of food I am running into real difficulty. To maintain the present type of meals being served I cannot remain within the budget. Mrs. Davies is trying to give the children a balanced diet. One of the boys said the other day that one of the things which keeps him at the school is the good food. He plainly stated that if there was a return to the former meals as served a number of years ago he would not stay.\nHe is the type of boy who would take to the road. I am concerned about whether if we could make any savings whether we would run into more truancy or not. I am spending a great deal of time on this matter of food.\n\nLast year I bought a number of bags of potatoes at 50 cents per bag. The other day Mr. Haworth was offered $3.00 for all the potatoes per bag. We did not sell any since I do not know what we shall have left over. The bread cost us $50.00 per month alone extra. We use about 1 bag of potatoes alone each day. When you add the extra cost for these few items alone you can see what a difference it makes.\n\nTo illustrate again our problem. According to the Mohawk creamery butter sold to customers cost on March 25/46 39 cents per pound. On November 25/47 butter cost 64 cents per pound. That same month we used 100 pounds of butter and it cost $2.68 as against $29.00 for 100 pounds in March of 46. The school used the same amount 100 pounds but the cost had risen $25.68 while the amount used shows no change. My records illustrate this rise in connection with one item after another.\n\nI understand that the churches have interviewed the Minister in connection with the matter of grants. Is there any information available?\n\nThe other night the Maintenance Man went into the Upper Dormitory and discovered what we have suspected but could not actually discover in the act. Two boys were caught in the act of homo-sex. One lad was holding a younger lad and the third was caught in the act while stripped to the skin. The remainder of the boys in the dormitory were watching these disgraceful proceedings. According to the I.Q test made by Mr. Webster the lad caught in the act is 16 with an I.Q rating of 7-11 (Mental Age). What form of punishment will you permit for boys who persist in this filthy business? I have tried to reason with them and employ various approaches. For the lad who will not respond to the normal decencies of life through the normal approaches is there any other way than to resort to the pleasure pain principle?\nDuring this past month we have had some outbreaks of stealing. Colonel Randle sent in one boy during my time here for tampering with the mail on the Reserve. The other week he went up to the store and stole two guns. (Toy). He also went through Mr. Barton's home and stole a watch and used a 22 rifle. Another lad went up to the store and stole a purse. He said he wanted money to buy bread. The rule now in force is that they can go uptown provided they are trustworthy. Needless to say these boys will not be able to go uptown without supervision. I do not want to see this one boy go to some jail eventually. I may belong to the old school but I believe that if we were permitted in these extreme cases to spank their posterior ends it might do some good. If you strap them on the hands they go down to the playroom and say they were not strapped hard. What do you think of it?\n\nAll the officers are quite agreed that the type of children coming here has altered. That is the ones who have been here sometime.\n\nI do not hope that I have wearied you with too many details but some on these matters have given me great concern.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nRev. W.J. Zimmerman, M.A., B.D.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, December 15, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Zimmerman:\n\nI have for answer your letter of December 6. Some of the points have already been dealt with. I appreciate your frankness in broaching this matter of corporal punishment. We have corporal punishment regulations which we recommend to principals who are having difficulty with this matter. This often applies to new principals taking over a school and who wish to ascertain a sound policy to be followed in this regard. These regulations are as follows:\n\n1. That corporal punishment will be used only where all other methods of disciplining a pupil have failed.\n\n2. That corporal punishment will be administered only on the hands with a proper school strap (regulation 15\" rubber).\n\n3. That the maximum number of strokes on each hand in no instance exceed four in number for male pupils of over fourteen years of age and in proportion for boys under that age.\n\n4. That all such corporal punishment be administered in the presence of the principal or by the principal.\n\n5. That a Corporal Punishment Register be maintained at the school containing the following headings:\n\n   (a) Date,\n   (b) Reason for Punishment,\n   (c) By whom administered,\n   (d) Witness,\n   (e) Signature of pupil punished.\n6. That this Register be made available for inspection by all Indian Affairs Branch officials visiting the above.\n\nYou will find in the long run that it does not pay to strap pupils anywhere but on the hands. The above regulations \"systematize the administration of corporal punishment and the very form which the pupil has to go through is in itself a deterrent. In other words it is the application of somewhat the same principle as used in British Courts or in the \"Orderly Room\" in the Army.\n\nI hope that this will assist you in the solution of your problem.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

With regard to the new register, you will be pleased to know that your suggestions, or similar ones, are being provided for in our new register.\n\nYour lighting survey is very helpful and we hope that steps can be taken to remedy the serious defects evident in certain of our schools.\n\nJ.

Healy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nLONDON, Canada,\n10th February, 1948.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Minister of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Administration Department,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nHonourable and Dear Sir:\n\nAs Bishop of the Diocese of Huron in which the\nLahawk Institute, a school for Indian Children is situated,\nI naturally feel a certain responsibility for its welfare.\nI am therefore taking the liberty of drawing your atten-\ntion to its present situation and needs.\n\nI should say that I have asked certain men,\nincluding the Principal of the School, to advise me in\nthe matter. That they are competent persons will appear\nfrom the fact that one of them is the Assistant Super-\nintendent of Schools in the City of London, another a\nmember of the Ontario Government's Royal Commission on\nEducation, and a third the Principal of a school in one\nof our larger towns.\n\nLet me say at the outset that I am happy to note\nthat conditions in the School have notably improved in the\npast two or three years, both as to the personal welfare\nof the children and as to farm productiveness and adminis-\ntration generally. This has been due largely to the work\nof the Principal, Mr. Zimmerman, to the active co-operation\nof the Department and the material assistance of the Church.\nThis latter has been very substantial.\n\nThe recently developed policy of the Department\nto strengthen the Day School System on the Reserves, a\npolicy which we cordially welcome, has however, as of\ncourse your Department is fully aware, almost completely\nchanged the character of the School in Brantford. As a\nresult, a new situation now exists which would appear to\ncall for very definite developments in both policy and\naction.\nUntil recently the School has served almost exclusively the families on the Mohawk Reserve, whether members of the Church of England or not, many of whose children were trained in the School in the ordinary way and not in the Day Schools. Now, however, the Institute has become a School mainly for underprivileged children, either as a result of broken homes or because of antisocial tendencies in the children themselves. Moreover, they are now drawn from a far wider field than the Mohawk Reserve. Such children require quite different treatment from those under normal conditions such as have prevailed until recent years.\n\nIn view of this fact, we regard certain changes as urgent. Even a casual study of the ages of the children and their academic progress, and a study of the School entrance results would indicate that there are very few children who are far below the achievement of normal children of the same age. No doubt this is due to emotional instability, immature mental ability or perhaps in some cases, definite mental defectiveness. These children cannot make satisfactory progress in a regular classroom. Might I suggest that a survey of the mental ability of these children might be made and if found necessary, special \"opportunity classes,\" similar to those established in the public schools in Ontario towns and cities, be organized. This, of course, would require specially trained teachers, special equipment and above all, an enrollment of no more than twenty for each teacher. This, of course, would increase the cost of tuition, but it is clear that these special children cannot be educated for good citizens in ordinary classrooms.\n\nWith respect to the rest of the children, they appear to have far too much time on their hands owing to the fact that in certain grades they are only taught for part of the day. These include those five or six, whose instruction should be, in our opinion, continued throughout the day.\n\nAs is to be expected under the circumstances, as already mentioned, the average intelligence of the pupils in the School is much lower than it was a few years ago. A few, however, with high intelligence might be trained as \"student leaders\" to assist in discipline, in games, promotion, etc.\nThe Honourable\nThe Minister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n10th February, 1948.\n\nIn the general supervision of the work of the pupils in the house and on the farm, there is a number of \"social or profile pupils\" who do not fit into the routine. For example, a boy of sixteen years old, suffering from mental and physical defects apparently uncontrollable by medical treatment should not, in our opinion, be in the school. It is obvious that for such a situation as this, it would be desirable to have staff members who are experienced in dealing with such cases. We believe that the social worker attached to the school should be able to deal effectively with such cases.\n\nIn this connection, reference to the salaries of teachers is necessary. For example, in the case of some teachers of the staff, even though they retire it will be impossible to secure someone to take their place. In our opinion, it would be advisable also that the school should include among its other teachers on the regular reserves with regard to the staff assigned to the teachers in Ontario's public schools. We are aware, of course, that an order-in-council has been issued. However, we believe that school teachers are entitled to positions as to status and position. We regard it as necessary that teachers in such positions be given the opportunity to participate in the plan, if they desire.\n\nA further factor in the altered situation is the vastly increased expenditure of approximately $1,000,000, including food, clothing, supplies and upkeep of pupils. As far as we can see, a large part of this departmental increase is due to the fact that the school is located in a rural area. The increase, however, will be offset by the elimination of the current out-of-pocket expenses mentioned in this letter. As an instance of increased costs, the church's missionary organization of the Church of England found it necessary to spend over $1,000 to equip the children in school. It is, of course, obvious that assistance in this respect on any scale cannot be continued. The school of which we are speaking which has been allotted to $1,000 for the past year or so. As the school has administrative authority in the school it is fairly reasonable to expect that God to continue such extensive help. In addition, the local church's missionary organiza-\n10th February, 1948.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Minister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nThe Diocese of Huron and numbers of interested people individually have already made very considerable contributions to the needs of the school.\n\nWhile there is, I am sure, a very definite and practical interest in the school among the members of the Church in this Diocese, it is obvious that if the school is to be maintained efficiently, and particularly if such developments as outlined above are to be realized, it will be necessary for the Department to very considerably increase the per capita grants.\n\nI am encouraged to write you in this matter as I have done in view of the very favourable reception given by your Department to deputations of our Missionary Society and those of other Churches, including the Roman Catholics, who met with the head of the Department and your officials in connection with this matter. Our deeply interested reception of these deputations, as well as of certain correspondence, was so favourable that I am encouraged to write you as I have now done, and I shall be under obligation if some assurance can come from the Department that the Mohawk Institute, Brantford, will share equally in any plans which the Department is now developing for the Indian Schools.\n\nI assure you of our strong desire to co-operate in every possible way for the benefit of these Indian children.\n\nI am, with kind regards,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nArchbishop of Huron.\n\nCAS/SA.\nOttawa, February 13, 1946.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Seager:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of February 10th in which you submit for departmental consideration a number of proposals with respect to the operation of the Mohawk Institute at Brantford.\n\nYou are no doubt aware that a Special Parliamentary Committee is at present engaged in a review of Indian administration in Canada. It is my hope that the members of this Committee will undertake a complete revision of the Indian Act during the course of the present session and submit its final report to Parliament. In view of this fact, I naturally hesitate at this time to express an opinion with respect to the status of teachers employed at residential schools. I may state, however, that the advisability of increasing the per capita grants is now under consideration and I am hopeful that the amount necessary to increase the grants to an extent that will enable the Principals of residential schools to meet their financial obligations and operate the schools more efficiently will be approved by Parliament in due course. In addition to this, I am asking the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch, in cooperation with the Ontario Department of Education, to undertake a survey of the pupils enrolled at the Mohawk Institute. When the results of this survey are before us, an attempt will be made to have one or two specially qualified teachers undertake the task of providing remedial and vocational programs that will meet the needs of the pupils to whom you refer.\n\nI am disposed to agree with you that the Institute is destined to become increasingly a school for children from disrupted homes. There appears to be\nwe escape from this conclusion in view of the day school building program the department has in mind for Southwestern Ontario. It is reasonable to expect also that a great many of the pupils, in the period that lies ahead of us, will be backward and in the low intelligence quotient class. It has been to me, however, very gratifying to learn recently that approximately fifty-three Indian pupils in the Brantford area are at this time proceeding with high school courses of study and that many of these pupils have already expressed the desire to proceed to normal schools.\n\nIt is indeed a source of pleasure to me to note the amount of thought you appear to have given the school at Brantford. I can assure you that the suggestions you have submitted will be very carefully and sympathetically reviewed by the officers of the department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMost Reverend Charles Seager, D.D., LL.D.,\nArchbishop of Huron,\nBishop Cronyn Hall,\nLondon, Ontario.\n\nRAH/CN\nThe Honourable\nThe Minister of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Administration Department,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear Mr. Glen:\n\nI appreciate your kind letter of 13th February in reply to mine regarding the Mohawk Institute.

Neary -\nWelfare and Training\n\nMohawk Institute - Health Conditions\n\nLast week Dr. Palmer phoned me from Montreal. He had intended to visit Ottawa to discuss various points concerning the Mohawk Institute with officials here, but his wife took sick which changed his plans and he decided to return directly home. He, therefore, called me before leaving Montreal.\n\nHe stated that in the past few months they have had three epidemics; chickenpox - 21 patients; mumps - 80 and measles - 20. Concerning facilities at the school, he does not like the way the milk is handled. There is no means of cooling milk and the Brant County Inspector of Health has done bacterial counts on the milk and has found them high and there is apparently a threat that the health authorities may make a definite move on discontinuing this milk service until improvements in the handling of it are made. He further states that the children get the skim milk and that the butter fat, 700 lbs. a month, is sold, and he feels that the children should have the benefit of this.\n\nHe also states that the ice for use at the school is obtained from the canal which has been condemned for use as drinking water.\n\nThe third complaint is with reference to the dishes that are used in the dining room. They were originally white enamel but apparently are so chipped and deteriorated that he feels it is somewhat of a health menace.\n\nI advised Dr. Palmer that this school was administered by the Welfare and Training Division of Indian Affairs and that we had no financial responsibility in making any alterations in the school. Dr. Palmer impresses this office as a very efficient medical man. He is very conscientious in his work and I am sure that it was for no other motive than to improve health conditions of the school that he has made these complaints. I told him that I would let you know about this and I think we have previously discussed the same items. If you feel this should be discussed further, please give me a call.\n\nW.L.

Original on file 32-0-5.\n\nI do not know what your policy will be but when speaking to Mr. Webster he said that he was going to recommend more teachers to the Department. The old boards can be used for supervised study or if there is another teacher should there be any change in your plans.\nSeptember 2, 1946.\n\nDear Mrs. Dean:\n\nI have for answer your letter of August 27, addressed to our Director.\n\nThere are two types of Indian schools in\n\n(a) Day Schools, operated by this Department,\n\n(b) Residential Schools, operated by the various denominations and for which our Department pays a per capita grant.\n\nFor our day schools, we make every endeavor to find teachers who have proper qualifications and certificates. You do not state in your letter whether you have an English certificate. However, I have attached hereto, a copy of our application form, which I would like very much to have you complete and return here.\n\nIt would seem from your letter that you are more interested in a position as matron in one of our residential schools. If such is the case, I would also ask you to write to the Reverend W. J. Zimmerman, Principal, Mohawk Residential School, Brantford, Ontario, concerning such a position. I understand that he has a vacancy on his staff for such a position. I am sending him a copy of this letter and you may hear directly from him in this regard.\n\nI note that you have a certificate as a dental nurse, experience as a midwife, have worked 18 months with a district nurse and have served as a matron in a boarding school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMrs. D. Dean,\nElsmere, Allanford, Ont.\ns/o Barrons Store,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent of Education.\na crowd who by the very environment they have lived in and grown up in, have an inferiority complex often never overcome.\n\nThe staff should be the best obtainable, whereas by reason of the salaries paid that is not now the case. And the salaries should be paid from Indian Administration funds, not from per capita grant.\n\nAlso there should be a regular fund provided as for our Day Schools, to permit yearly improvements and repairs to the school building, instead of the hit and miss policy of today.\n\nThen perhaps with the per capita grant plus the farm produce grown and consumed, with some cash revenue, the children could be clothed, fed, housed, in a fitting manner, and instead of being half ashamed of the school and all it represents, we could be proud of it.\n\nFinally, it would also play some part in achieving the purpose of the powers that be, - that is to make the Indians entirely a self-supporting and self-reliant people on equality with other Canadians. This can never be possible if we continue to educate many of them in institutions far below standard, as it will never give them the will or desire, or the training, to overcome such a lowly and inferior start.\n\nLt.-Col. E.F. Randle,\nIndian Superintendent.\nThe complaint about the cream being sold and the children getting only skim milk, - is an old one, and perfectly true.\n\nActually, the Principal is like all previous ones; he finds it hard to make ends meet with constantly increasing costs in all directions, - food - salaries - maintenance, - so he endeavours to increase revenue by selling the cream taking part of the value back in butter for the use at the school.\n\nPersonally, the writer has always objected to this practice, and so have Departmental officials, - but as it was never insisted that it be discontinued, it goes on; - and then in recent years some authorities have stated that skim milk has considerable food value.\n\nThe third complaint with reference to the dishes is a troublesome one, and has been given considerable attention, but it always comes back to the same age-long question - lack of funds.\n\nMr. Zimmerman has consistently bought new enamelyare, but in a month or two it looks as if it has been in use for years, as it quickly chips. He is now experimenting in some plastic ware.\n\nNo-one knowing well the conditions of the Mohawk Institute can be happy or satisfied, or feel it is a credit to Indian Administration, or a place you could at any time show people over.\n\nPersonally, it is my opinion, - as it is now almost purely a Departmental responsibility, and the only Residential School serving a large number of populous Reserves, and must be maintained, the sooner to recognize this, the better.\n\nIt should be a model of what a Residential School can be, - a pleasure to see and go into, and a place which turns out happy healthy Indian children ready to face the world, instead of a\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nWith reference to your File 32-0-1(E.1) of the 8th of June concerning a memorandum received from Dr. Falconer with reference to the Mohawk Institute, - the following comment is made.\n\nThe writer interviewed the Principal and gave him assistance and direction as to the manner in which the milk could be better cooled and lower the bacterial count to satisfactory dimensions.\n\nActually, the final and only remedy which will satisfy the local health authorities is the installation of a modern milk cooling plant, such as farmers are installing everywhere.\n\nThe secret of fresh flavoured milk, free from odours, sourness and high bacterial count, is the taking off within about 20 minutes of milking, of the animal or natural heat, so the temperature is reduced to about 50\u00b0. In addition it must be poured into a covered can through a special type of paper strainer disc, which prevents even small particles of dust and dirt getting into the milk can and assisting in raising the bacterial count.\n\nCold water surrounding the cans with frequent stirring while the milking is being done, with what is known as plungers, - breaks up the cream crust which holds in the animal heat, and quickly reduces the temperature.\n\nThis was all explained to the Principal and he was to obtain the plunger, discs, etc., and see that the men kept cool fresh water around the cans throughout milking. This is now being done, and should reduce complaints, - if done as efficiently as it is possible to do, - until such time as we can install a proper cooling system.\nLONDON, Canada,\n10th February, 1948.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Minister of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Administration Department,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nHonourable and Dear Sir:\n\nAs Bishop of the Diocese of Huron in which the Mohawk Institute, a school for Indian Children is situated, I naturally feel a certain responsibility for its welfare. I am therefore taking the liberty of drawing your attention to its present situation and needs.\n\nI should say that I have asked certain men, including the Principal of the School, to advise me in the matter. That they are competent persons will appear from the fact that one of them is the Assistant Superintendent of Schools in the City of London, another a member of the Ontario Government's Royal Commission on Education, and a third the Principal of a school in one of our larger towns.\n\nMay I say at the outset that I am happy to note that conditions in the School have notably improved in the past two or three years, both as to the personal welfare of the children and as to farm productiveness and administration generally. This has been due largely to the work of the Principal, Mr. Zimmerman, to the active co-operation of the Department and the material assistance of the Church. This latter has been very substantial.\n\nThe recently developed policy of the Department to strengthen the Day School System on the Reserves, a policy which we cordially welcome, has however, as of course your Department is fully aware, almost completely changed the character of the School in Brantford. As a result, a new situation now exists which would appear to call for very definite developments in both policy and action.\nUntil recently the School has served almost exclusively the families on the Mohawk Reserve, whether members of the Church of England or not, many of whose children were trained in the School in the ordinary way and not in the Day Schools. Now, however, the Institute has become a School mainly for underprivileged children, either as a result of broken homes or because of antisocial tendencies in the children themselves. Moreover, they are now drawn from a far wider field than the Mohawk Reserve. Such children require quite different treatment from those under normal conditions such as have prevailed until recent years.\n\nIn view of this fact, we regard certain changes as urgent. Even a casual study of the ages of the children and their academic progress, and a study of High School Entrance results would indicate that there are very many children who are far below the achievement of normal children of the same age. No doubt this is due to emotional instability, immature mental ability or perhaps in some cases, definite mental defectiveness. These children cannot make satisfactory progress in a regular classroom. Might I suggest that a survey of the mental ability of these children might be made and if found necessary, special \"opportunity classes,\" similar to those established in the public schools in Ontario towns and cities, be organized. This, of course, would require specially trained teachers, special equipment and above all, an enrolment of not more than twenty for each teacher. This, of course, would increase the cost of tuition, but it is clear that these special children cannot be educated for good citizenship in ordinary classrooms.\n\nWith respect to the rest of the children, many appear to have far too much time on their hands owing to the fact that in certain grades they are only taught for part of the day. These include Grades five and six, whose instruction should be, in our opinion, continued throughout the day.\n\nAs is to be expected under such circumstances, and already mentioned, the average intelligence of the pupils in the School is much lower than it was a few years ago. A few, however, with high intelligence might be trained as \"student leaders\" to assist in discipline, in games programmes, and\n10th February, 1948.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Minister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIn the general supervision of the work of the pupils in the house and on the farm. There is a number of \"special or problem pupils\" who should not be in the Institute. For example, a boy of sixteen years with a mental age of eight, and children with apparently uncontrollable anti-social tendencies should not, in our opinion, be in the School. It is obvious that for such developments as have been outlined the teaching staff would have to be increased to five or six in number and made up of persons competent for the special needs arising out of the special character of the School as it now exists.\n\nIn this connection, reference to the salaries of teachers is necessary. These, in the case of some members of the staff, are very low, and when they retire it will be impossible to secure successors at their present salaries. In our opinion, it would be advisable also that they should be included among the other teachers on the Indian Reserves with regard to benefits afforded to the teachers in Ontario's public schools. We are aware, of course, that an Order-in-Council has been passed giving the Indian Day School teachers permanent positions as to status and pensions. We regard it as necessary that teachers in such schools as the Mohawk Institute should be included in this plan, if this has not already been contemplated.\n\nA leading factor in the altered situation is the vastly increased overhead costs of everything, including food, clothing, salaries and upkeep generally. We are, of course, aware that in 1947 the Department increased the per capita grants in the School by $20.00 per pupil. This increase, however, would of course not be sufficient for the carrying out of any such plan as is outlined in this letter. As an instance of increased costs, the women's missionary organization of the Church of England found it necessary to spend over $5,000.00 to equip the children in clothing. It is, of course, obvious that assistance in this respect on any such scale cannot be continued. The Synod of Huron has also made grants which have now amounted to $1,000.00 during the past year or so. As the Synod has no administrative authority in the School it is hardly reasonable to expect that body to continue such extensive help. In addition, the local women's missionary organiza-\n10th February, 1948.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Minister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\ntion of the Diocese of Huron and numbers of interested people individually have also made very considerable contributions to the needs of the School.\n\nWhile there is, therefore, a very definite and practical interest in the School among the members of the Church in this Diocese, it is obvious that if the School is to be maintained efficiently, and particularly if such developments as outlined above are to be brought about, it will be necessary for the Department to very considerably increase the per capita grants.\n\nI am encouraged to write you in this matter as I have done in view of the very favourable reception given by your Department to deputations of our Missionary Society and those of other Churches, including the Roman Catholics, who met with the head of the Department and your officials in connection with this matter. Your deeply interested reception of these deputations, as well as of certain correspondence, was so favourable that I am encouraged to write you as I have now done, and I shall be under obligation if some assurance can come from the Department that the Mohawk Institute, Brantford, will share equally in any plans which the Department is now developing for the Indian Schools. We assure you of our strong desire to co-operate in every possible way for the benefit of these Indian children.\n\nI am, with kind regards,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nSgd. C. A. Seagers.\n\nArchbishop of Huron.\n\nCAB/SA.\nOttawa, February 19, 1948.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Seager:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of February 10th in which you submit for departmental consideration a number of proposals with respect to the operation of the Mohawk Institute at Brantford.\n\nYou are no doubt aware that a Special Parliamentary Committee is at present engaged in a review of Indian administration in Canada. It is my hope that the members of this Committee will undertake a complete revision of the Indian Act during the course of the present Session and submit its final report to Parliament. In view of this fact, I naturally hesitate at this time to express an opinion with respect to the status of teachers employed at residential schools. I may state, however, that the advisability of increasing the per capita grants is now under consideration and I am hopeful that the amount necessary to increase the grants to an extent that will enable the Principals of residential schools to meet their financial obligations and operate the schools more efficiently will be approved by Parliament in due course. In addition to this, I am asking the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch, in cooperation with the Ontario Department of Education, to undertake a survey of the pupils enrolled at the Mohawk Institute. When the results of this survey are before us, an attempt will be made to have one or two specially qualified teachers undertake the task of providing academic and vocational programs that will meet the needs of the pupils to whom you refer.\n\nI am disposed to agree with you that the Institute is destined to become increasingly a school for children from disrupted homes. There appears to be\nno escape from this conclusion in view of the day school building program the department has in mind for Southwestern Ontario. It is reasonable to expect also that a great many of the pupils, in the period that lies ahead of us, will be backward and in the low intelligence quotient class. It has been to me, however, very gratifying to learn recently that approximately fifty-three Indian pupils in the Brantford area are at this time proceeding with high school courses of study and that many of these pupils have already expressed the desire to proceed to normal schools.\n\nIt is indeed a source of pleasure to me to note the amount of thought you appear to have given the school at Brantford. I can assure you that the suggestions you have submitted will be very carefully and sympathetically reviewed by the officers of the department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMost Reverend Charles Seager, M.A., D.D., LL.D.,\nArchbishop of Huron,\nBishop Grenyn Hall,\nLondon, Ontario.\n\nRAM/CH\n1.

We were to meet the Principal in the afternoon but as he had not arrived yet we took a glance through the school while waiting.\n\nThe new classroom block is quite an improvement over the former classroom. I am satisfied that this will contribute greatly to the efficiency of the education at this institute provided the proper type of teacher is secured.\n\nMy first impression especially when going through the dormitories and the playroom was a sense of depression. It is the old story of noticing children wandering without any purpose whatsoever during their free time. This can have a very baneful effect on their character and on their immediate conduct.\n\nTwo of the dormitories are rather badly served by two dormer windows and a fire escape door. I believe these dormitories handle as many pupils as wisdom will allow. There has been a question of double decker beds in some of the dormitories. We have placed some of these beds in some schools and have been satisfied with them, where the supervision is adequate. Where the supervision is somewhat lax, probably due to the lack of personnel, I would be reluctant to recommend this type of bedding. It might be wise to attempt a trial period before going all out for this system. There is a great deal of space lost in the middle of this school. This is due, I\nbelieve to the fact that the Principal would be reluctant to have dormitories above his own living quarters. I think it would be wise to have other quarters for the Principal and to use the school to full advantage. There would be adequate space for bathroom facilities for the boys and girls dormitories if use were made of this space.\n\nI would recommend that Mr. Buck be asked to have this surveyed to ascertain the cost of making these changes. I do not see any possibility with the present set-up of improving the toilet facilities in the dormitories. The present system has nothing in it that is recommendable especially in the boys dormitory. The toilet is open and very close to the beds. This should be eliminated and it could be done by a re-arrangement of the beds. Any change, however, would be of a temporary nature and would not rectify the faults that exist in the set-up. As mentioned above, a thorough survey should be made by the Engineering Branch.\n\nMr. Hundle is expected to make a report also on this condition and also to secure prices for temporary changes that would seem imperative.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nA.J.

Matheson) Insp.,\nI/C C.I.B.\n\nA.R.V. No.\n\nDiary Date\n\nSet For\nFebruary 10th, 1949.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nLast November I was consecrated to succeed the late Archbishop Seager as Bishop of Huron. Previous to that time as Dean of the Diocese I had the privilege of visiting the Mohawk Institute and seeing the work in progress there under the Principal, the Reverend W.J. Zimmerman. As Bishop I have again visited the School, spoken to the teachers and children in their class rooms and inspected the farm buildings in company with the Principal and the Indian Agent of the Reserve. I have also had three long interviews with the Principal during which we discussed every phase of the work in great detail. I believe that I am coming to understand some of the problems that press upon us in this School, and I hope I am also beginning to see some light on an horizon that has not been in recent years very bright.\n\nTogether with Mr. Zimmerman I have gone over carefully the financial records, his records of the pupils and his teaching problems in the School. I have also studied the reports of the District Inspector regarding the I.Q. of the present students and the opportunities of education and development which they now enjoy at the Mohawk Institute. Also I have discussed with Mr. Zimmerman his own future as Principal of the School. He and his wife are among the most effective and devoted members of our Diocesan family and I am deeply interested in his continuation as Principal of the Institute. The progress I have seen myself during the last four years has been very remarkable, and I believe that if we can keep Mr. Zimmerman contented and happy in his work at the Institute, in another four years this School can become a shining example of the concern of the Government, the Community and the Church for the welfare of our Indian wards.\n\nMy reason in writing to you is twofold. First I should greatly appreciate the privilege of an interview with you when next you are in our vicinity. I hear that you are coming down to the opening of the school in Munsey. I am hoping that this will take place in March because I shall be able to make myself available throughout that month for a conference with you. I am to be away from the Diocese for ten days between the 13th and 24th of February. I mention this just to let you know that apart from the ten days I shall make any\nColonel F.B. Neary\n\nFebruary 10th, 1949.\n\nre-arrangements possible in order to meet your convenience.\n\nMy second purpose in writing is to say that I have been studying the change in the type of boy and girl now being sent to the Institute, together with the urgent needs this change has brought before the Principal of the School. Most of the children whom we receive at the Institute are from broken homes or difficult home environment. In going over the list of pupils and their I.Q. ratings I find that only about 25 out of the whole school have normal I.Q. rating. The average mental age of the whole school is about two years below their chronological age. The School Inspector states that forty of the children should be placed in Auxiliary Classes under the care of teachers specially trained for this difficult and exacting work. At present we have three teachers struggling as effectively as possible with an impossible task. One will be retiring shortly. Her present stipend is $55.00 a month, plus her board, and there seems little likelihood of replacing her except at a stipend equal to that which a teacher would receive from outside schools. Our needs in the teaching end, therefore, are as follows:\n\n5 teachers instead of the present 3 - 2 of the 5 to be specially qualified for the work and the other 3 all of them to be fully qualified teachers and to be paid at a rate at least equal to that received by teachers in Provincial schools.\n\nAfter school hours we have two supervisors, - one woman in charge of 75 girls and one man in charge of 60 boys. These children need double the supervision and two of the supervisors should be qualified for leadership in sports and games. Also there should be equipment for arts and games and greatly increased equipment for Manual and Domestic Training for boys and girls incapable of sustained academic work.\n\nThe Church is profoundly interested in making the Mohawk Institute an important asset in our varied Indian problem. We lack the means to make any sizable financial contribution to this work. Our contribution must be made through interest, the recruiting of a staff, the loaning of one of our best clergymen for the principalship and the yearly gift of a small amount of money as well as a considerable gift in clothing and other supplies. The Government grant for teaching staff and expenses must be greatly increased without delay or else we must seriously consider withdrawing completely from the field of Indian work. We have been carrying it on, as you know, in many parts of Canada at the expense of our Indian Mission work and the shepherding of the older Indian Community. With the increase of day schools for Indians our Mission work on the Reserves becomes of front rank importance.\n\nSince the Mohawk Institute has become almost a centre for the difficult and sometimes incorrigible Indian children its nature has changed radically from\nColonel F.B. Neary\n\nFebruary 10th, 1949.\n\nthe early days of its foundation when it ministered educationally to the boys and girls of the Six Nations. To-day our Church responsibility is greatly lessened. Only a small minority of the children are Church of England. Of 11 admitted in the December quarter of last year only 1 was Church of England. The others were Protestants of various groups, including the Lutheran, Baptist, United Church, Plymouth Brethren and Church of Jesus Christ. Now, we are glad to share in the partnership of the Mohawk Institute through the years ahead and I shall be delighted to take a continuous interest in its welfare in close and friendly co-operation with the Government officials at Ottawa and your local representatives on the spot; but unless we have early assurance of increasing aid from the Government in this special sphere of the difficult, subnormal and incorrigible children we cannot continue in the partnership.\n\nThe Principal offered his resignation to me yesterday and I have promised to receive him back into his regular ministerial work in the near future unless together with you we can find a solution to the problems of staff, off-time supervision, sports activities and occupational training which I have endeavoured to outline in this regretably long letter.\n\nI trust that I may soon have the privilege of discussing these matters with you and I assure you that I shall meet you in full appreciation of your helpfulness and fairness which Mr. Zimmerman has emphasized to me on every occasion.\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Huron.\nFebruary 15, 1949.\n\nThe Right Reverend George N.

We are only too well aware of the changing conditions which have resulted in the different type of school population now at this school. Many of the matters contained in your letter are points which I would like to discuss with our new Director. Therefore I am referring your letter to him so that we will have an opportunity in the near future of discussing its contents and replying to you then at some length.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBertrand F.

As a result, the Director has agreed that a recommendation be forwarded again to the Deputy Minister that the Department assume the responsibility for appointing and paying the teachers at this residential school. This would mean that these teachers would be on the same basis as those in our day schools and thus eligible for superannuation benefits. It is our intention, if this recommendation is accepted, to incorporate the auxiliary classes recommended by the Public School Inspector.\n\nI regret sincerely that the opening of the school at Nanticoke took place on February 10, which was in the middle of the period when you mentioned that you would be absent from your diocese. However, I will be indeed pleased to advise you on the occasion of my next trip to southern Ontario and to seek then the honour of an interview with you as suggested. Both the Director and myself realise only too well the changing situation at the Mohawk Institute and the radically different\ntype of Indian child now being sent for institutional care there. We share your concern that it should not develop into a reform institution and are pleased to receive from you an assurance as to your continued interest in its welfare.\n\nYou can rest assured that I will write to you immediately I have heard the results of the representations which we are making to our Deputy Minister concerning the payment of teachers at this school.\n\nI am,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

I have also had an opportunity of discussing this situation with the Director and we are now placing before the Deputy Minister a recommendation that auxiliary education classes be established at this school, as previously suggested by Inspector Webster.\n\nAs previously discussed with you, we are also recommending that the teachers in this school be appointed and paid for by the Department, in the same way as the teachers in our Indian day schools. While it is realized that this is a radical departure from the normal method of operating residential schools, we have suggested that the Mohawk Institute would be an ideal school in which to experiment with such a practice.\n\nI was pleased to note, after discussing this situation with you the other night, that charges will be brought under the Juvenile Delinquents' Act against the parents or other Indians who have been responsible for these acts of truancy, particularly on the part of the older girls.\n\nPlease find attached a self-explanatory letter sent today to the Bishop of Huron, in response to correspondence from him dealing with matters previously discussed with you.\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nMrs. C. Fry informs me that she will not be remaining on the teaching staff of the Mohawk Institute after June 30, 1949. I feel that after many years of loyal and devoted service to the Canadian Indian she has become discouraged because of the reaction of our Senior Girls. I have offered her the Matronship but she has declined. We do need badly a full time Matron. Mrs. Zimmerman can only give part of her time due to Teddy and Jean. The interest of the school demands a full time Matron.\n\nIn view of the departure of Mrs. Fry I shall be confronted with the problem of a replacement. Mr. Webster strongly recommends the increasing of the teaching staff. I wish to place on record the endorsement of this recommendation. Owing to low I.Q.'s, irregular previous school attendance, lack of self-discipline, maladjusted home relations etc., many of our students present difficult educational problems. Small classes are a necessity. We have been delighted with the response of the boys to manual training. I should like to see in the school a corresponding program worked out for the girls. The girls I am certain would reveal more interest in the school if there was instruction in cooking, dress-making, hand craft etc. The routine of the school leaves too little time for many of these things. I believe the time has come when we require 5 teachers. Our teachers must be placed on an equal standing with those in other branches of the service. One must pay a decent salary if we are going to secure adequate teaching. Now that the school is administered by the Department I do not see how we can escape.\n\nSince coming to the Institute one of the greatest disappointments has been the lack of time which I have been able to give to religious education. My time has been taken up with administration and other details. If the Church and State could work out some way whereby help was given in the office I feel that my time would be well spent in studying many matters which receive scant attention. I do not wish to take any child from the religious faith of its parents. The Province of Ontario offers certain materials which could well be used. A secretary when not needed in the office could pinch hit in other areas.\nFor example Mr. Pedbisky has begun Cadet training. When he is training the boys up at the Armouries there is no one to be with the little boys. If the boys are to attend the theatre and not pick up things in the stores they must be escorted. This leaves me with no one with the boys at the school.\n\nThe Brantford Council of Local Women are purchasing a movie sound projector for use in the Institute. This machine will mean much since we do not possess a gymnasium. I have accepted this offer since this group represents many organizations in the City of Brantford. I told them of many advances which had been made during the present few years and what the Department had done. I do not feel that one can go on indefinitely ignoring the recommendations of such a group. The Mohawk Institute is too closely situated to the city of Brantford to escape public observation and criticism. They asked me point blank if I would speak to them on the work of the school and I did.\n\nLast week I spent two days on the Muncey Reserve regarding Marie Deleary. This girl had presented a problem for Mr. Joblin. She ran away from this school. When I interviewed her Father I saw where the problem lay. Her lack of school attendance Mr. Joblin feels has affected the Mount Elgin Day School. Girls say 'If Marie does not attend we do not have to'. Many excuses were given by Mr. Deleary. When Mr. Hall handed her school attendance record for the last 6 years the problem was evident. This is the record of days attended each year:\n\n| Year   | Days |\n|--------|------|\n| 1940-1 River Settlement | 8\u00bd |\n| 1941-2 | 8    |\n| 1942-3 | 27   |\n| 1943-4 | 53   |\n| 1944-5 | 69   |\n| 1945-6 M.E.R.S. I year | 105 |\n| 1946-7 River Settlement | 105 |\n| 1947-8 Mount Elgin Day School | 139 |\n| 1948-9 | 9    |\n\nI am certain when you read this record you will understand why this office requires help if we are going to do case work and give the children the kind of care they need. This record bear eloquent testimony to the kind of pupil we are receiving. The plan, and the only one that seemed feasible to Mr. Joblin and Mr. Hall after we met in conference, was that if Marie behaves till the end of June she can remain at home and go to school next year. This seemed the only way to handle Mr. Deleary without too much ill will. This kind of decision affects the Mohawk Institute.\n\nI do feel that there is important work to be done at this school but our staff will have to be increased if we are to deal with the current problems in a modern way.\n\nIs there any word regarding the electric wiring?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nMarch 1, 1949.\n\nColonel B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will find enclosed the Report from J.M. McDeugall, M.D., to Dr. Palmer re-Rose Atkinson. Dr. McDeugall is from the Brant San.\n\nDr. Palmer has just examined Miss Atkinson who is now confined to bed with a second attack of influenza again complicated by discharging ears. Dr. Palmer advises me that it will be sometime, if ever, before Miss Atkinson will be of value as a staff Member. I regret to inform you of this since Miss Atkinson has proven herself to be very fine. There is no doubt in my mind but what she will require a long time to regain her strength if ever.\n\nI have been giving Miss Atkinson $25.00 per month since I felt that Indian Affairs would not wish to see one of their people in unnecessary distress. This Sum is over and above her room and board.\n\nI shall be glad to hear what you wish us to do.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nRev. W.J. Zimmerman, M.A., B.D.\nPrincipal.\nRe: Rose Atkinson,\n\nDear Doctor Talmer:\n\nI understand that this girl was discharged from the Hamilton Sanatorium as recently as December 1948. It is my opinion that her activities should be restricted and that these should include bathroom privileges, being up for meals and about one hour additional exercise per day. I feel that it is important that these suggestions be fairly strictly adhered to in view of her recent illness.\n\nAfter her next x-ray in April 1949, we will probably be fit to advise some increase in her activities.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\nJ. M. McDougall, M.D.\nSuperintendent.\nMarch 22, 1949.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nMohawk Residential School.\n\nWe have been making representations again with regard to the payment of the teachers at your school and I am advised that approval in principle has been given to this procedure. We expect to obtain the formal approval necessary when I will write you again.\n\nAt that time, I will probably arrange for you to come here or I will go to Brantford so that we can discuss the details with regard to how this experiment can best be effected.\n\nI fully realize the amount of time which will have to be spent on case work if we are to make your school really of service to the Indians.\n\nI am very sorry to hear about Mrs. Fry and I hope that she might be interested in staying on after a re-check. I note that you are paying Miss Atkinson an amount of $25 per month due to her illness. Is there any hope of her recovering her strength before the end of the academic year?\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard W. Henry,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. W.

Zimmerman,\nPrincipal,\nSchool Residential School,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nRe: Admissions and Discharges - Residential Schools.\n\nDear Mr. Zimmerman:\n\nI have been informed by the Supervisor of Family Allowances that since the introduction of Form I.A. 1049, the administration of Family Allowances has become more efficient due to the prompt reporting of all admissions and discharges from residential schools to the Regional Director of Family Allowances.\n\nThis increase of efficiency in administration has been brought about largely by the cooperation of the various principals of residential schools.\n\nThere is one part of the administration which I am informed is not functioning too well, and that is where a residential school draws its pupils from all over the province and from many agencies. In cases such as this, the principal of the school does not know the Family Allowance number of the child concerned, neither does the Indian Superintendent in whose agency the child is situated, consequently the Regional Director is unable to identify the child or the agency from the report, as presently submitted.\n\nThe only way this difficulty can be successfully overcome is by the school principal completing in duplicate each Form I.A. 1049 for the various agencies. This means that new children from several agencies are affected in any month.\nforms will be prepared in duplicate for each Agency concerned and sent to the various Indian Superintendents, who in turn will complete the last three columns and forward to the Regional Director for action.\n\nAt the top of the form, where Agency appears, would you in future fill in the Agency from which the child originates, instead of the Agency in which your school is situated, and mail at the end of each month duplicate copies to the Indian Superintendent concerned. The practice of sending copies directly to Mr. F. G. Jenkins, Regional Director of Family Allowances, Toronto, should be discontinued.\n\nYour cooperation in attending to the details mentioned above would be very much appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBernard P. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education.\nApril 28, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCOLONEL AGLAND\n\nI have been asked by Mrs. Baird of Information Services to prepare an outline of suggested pictures which could be featured by the Montreal Standard in a story which they intend to do on Indian Education in Southern Ontario. She is very anxious to get this material today and I would ask you please to check it over and forward it on to her after the Director has seen it.\n\nYou will note that I have suggested they concentrate on two reserves, Massawa and Six Nations.\n\nEnc.\n\nBernard F.

F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI am wondering if you are coming to Brantford in connection with the events at Chawaken in connection with May 29. Mr. Webster would like to have a conference with you in connection with the Institute. Mr. Webster feels that a great deal more could be accomplished than through the usual reports. He states that in his report of last year he recommended the use of five teachers here at the Institute. In his visit to the school a short time ago he stated that we were doing all that we could but to make real progress we must have at least five teachers. I do hope that we do not lose his interest. Mr. Webster will be in Brantford on May 28/49 and May 29/49.\n\nMany thanks for the new desks. They do improve so much the appearance of the rooms.\n\nIf we are to use more teachers I do hope that the matter is not left over so long that the best teachers are picked up.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. Zimmerman\nMay 26, 1949.\n\nReverend W.J. Zimmerman,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Residential School,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nMohawk Residential School\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have for answer your letter of May 13 and regret to advise you that I will not be attending the ceremonies at Chsweken on May 29. However, the Director will be present. You may have an opportunity of speaking to him.\n\nWe are quite prepared to consider the hiring of five teachers at the Institute. The necessary approval has been obtained from the Deputy Minister and I have received instructions to submit this matter to the Governor in Council for a necessary Order in Council to pay these teachers.\n\nI am glad you like your new desks and will do everything possible to advertise for teachers for you in the near future.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJune 11, 1949.\n\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa,\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nMrs. C. Fry has reported her final decision regarding her work next Autumn. She does not feel that she will be able to carry on, I am afraid, that her health is not good. Mrs. Fry finds the stairs rather heavy.\n\nI presume that it is your wish that Mrs. Fry shall be replaced. What is the salary scale for the teacher to take her place? I will hold up the advertisement pending word from you. Mr. Webster has visited the class-room recently.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. W. J. Zimmerman, M.A., B.D.\nPrincipal.\nJune 8, 1949.\n\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nMy dear Colonel:\n\nIn reply to your letter re-Rose Atkinson may I say that I do not know of any place where she can go. The unfortunate part of the situation is that she does not wish to comply with the rules set up by Dr. Palmer and the Brant Sanatorium. Miss Atkinson feels that they are unfair to her. Miss Atkinson does not realize the importance of Post Hospital care. She wishes to keep engagements late at night. With this attitude I do not see how we can be responsible for her at the Institute. If she has not been reimbursed for her keep. If Miss Atkinson would show some faith in what we are trying to do for her I should be happy to see her remain.\n\nLeisa Claus and Orpha Silver have finished a year at High School. Leisa Claus missed her year and hence repeated. She has been given credit for 8 subjects out of 12. She headed her class in typing. Her parents have shown no interest in her at all. High School is her one chance. I do feel that she has justified our faith in her repeating her year. Orpha Silver has finished her first effort. I do hope that both girls are eligible for their High School grant.\n\nThe fleer polisher has come and we are more than pleased with the work it is doing.\n\nThe Mohawk Club of Buffalo has given two prizes for grade 8. They have judged the Essays and were pleased with them.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. I hope your Son is well. Sorry to learn of his illness.\nJune 22, 1965\n\nRev. J.J. Smith,\n\nI have heard about the situation at the Indian Residential School in [redacted].\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have been informed by the Indian Health Services concerning the situation at the school. I feel she is, in their opinion, in need of assistance.\n\nI am writing to express my concern regarding the welfare of the students attending the school. It is evident that the conditions there are not conducive to a healthy environment for the children.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Name]\nIndian Affairs Officer\nYesterday I had a phone call from Mrs. Johnson in Bradford Ont., regarding a teacher practitioner in the Indian School there. She said disturbances here were so bad that it was impossible to carry on an intelligent conversation. Will you please see that this letter reaches her?

If out of the city there are good, well-known teachers, is there a special need especially for the teachers? If so, please describe the accommodations, find the price of board, and these important information with the school? Would it be possible to have accommodation at any time? Should be free? How large are the classes? Are they mixed or not? Are there any extra curricular activities?\n\nRegarding the great shortage of teachers, I am pleased that those who will be appointed as hospital nurses by Dr. H. L. could be very helpful. She is a very intelligent and hardworking woman, and I am grateful for her help.\n\nI hope you could give me an estimate of what a large family would receive. It was so hard to hear, but did you imagine anything about supplying work in this place before?

These teachers would be Mr. G.E. Anderson, Mrs. M.R. Anderson and the third new teacher.\n\nMr. Zimmerman felt that this would give him time to endeavour to obtain a qualified fourth teacher.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nOttawa, August 31, 1949.\n\nLt.-Col.

It was a pleasure to see how they responded to my really earnest efforts to help them.\n\nMay I, out of the experience I had, venture to make one or two suggestions for your consideration.\n\nOne suggestion, and I make this earnestly, is that the rule be established and enforced that Indian children attend school a full day and not a half day as at present.\nA second suggestion is that an efficient\nIndian Affairs Office be appointed on each reserve.\n\nMay I say further that I think Indian children\nshould not be isolated, so to speak, as they are at\npresent. I realize that with the present \"Reserve\"\nsystem it is difficult to arrange that Indian children\nattend school with white children. Nevertheless I\nfeel strongly that this companionship would benefit\nIndian children greatly and help them to overcome their\nlanguage handicap and other disadvantages.\n\nI make the final suggestion that a greater\neffort should be made to see that the more intelligent\nIndian children go on to High School. Lots of these\ncould readily be obtained.\n\nI trust you will not think me presumptuous\nto have written as frankly as I have. I am\ndeeply interested in the welfare of Indian pupils\nas a result of my close contact with some of them.\nI shall always be glad to suggest an Indian\nschool. Most of the children are very much in\nfavour of going to such a school.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nAlexander Macdonald.\nSeptember 21st, 1949.\n\nRev. W.J. Zimmerman,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Residential School,\nBrantford, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Zimmerman:\n\nAttached is a letter and application form received from Mrs. Irene Parlano. Colonel Neary suggested that I forward them to you for your comments. It is noted that Mrs. Parlano requires suitable living quarters. I realize that these are not available, but the application is being sent to you anyway.\n\nI have received all the forms from Mrs. Henderson with the exception of her T.D. 1 form. We simply must have this form before we can place her name on the pay list. As she may have mislaid the forms previously given to her, I enclose two copies which she should complete and return at once.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPhilip Phelen,\nChief, Education Division\n\nPP/ST\nAttach.\nHespeler, Ont.\nSept. 29, 1949.\n\nCol. J.F. Neary,\nDept. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLast night I was talking by phone to Mr. Zimmerman of the Mohawk Institute. He explained that I should write to you, since my formal application, sent to Ottawa about Sept. 9, had received attention in your office, but hadn't reached you personally.\n\nI visited Mohawk Institute on Labour Day following Mr. Zimmerman's invitation not to do so, re the matter of your desire to have Auxiliary Education begun in the Institute. I think Auxiliary Classes there would be a great advantage to the entire set-up. I also talked to Mr. Webster, the Inspector, and found him willing to cooperate in your plans. I felt that Mr. Webster and Mr. Zimmerman were men with whom I could work to improve conditions in the present educational arrangement there.\n\nI have a permanent First Class Certificate no. 53883 issued in 1939 - Permanent Auxiliary Certificate for Opportunity and Handicrafts. It is no. 12647, issued in 1947 - Elementary Agriculture also permanent. I am a graduate of Stratford Normal 1923-24. I have completed twenty-five years experience in three Ontario schools. My first two in a rural school in Bruce County under Inspector McCool of Walkerton, now retired. Sixteen in Stratford Public School mostly senior trade work under Mr. J. Wilson. I've found and since then I have been regularly employed here in Hespeler. I came here in 1942 to teach\nScience and Social Studies in Grs. 6-10. During\nthe past few years we experienced such need for\nAuxiliary Education in our school that in 1945 I\norganized a class under direction of Dr. Stothers\nof Toronto. Auxiliary Classes Inspector. My room has\nbeen inspected regularly by some one of the\nthree Departmental Inspectors; Dr. Stothers, Miss\nDelaporte or Mr. Kendall and our local Inspector\nhere is Mr. A.F. Hansuld of Salt. I am prepared\nto organize a class or classes under your\ndirection at the Mohawk Institute or elsewhere.\n\nI am forty-four years of age, married. My\nhusband is a partially disabled war veteran, receiving\na small pension. We have no children. We are\nProtestants, Presbyterians to be exact, but willing to\nfit into any Protestant Religious arrangement.\n\nI have a wide experience in handicrafts. I've taken\nadvantage of many courses and have tried almost\nevery ordinary domestic craft. In our school here I\nteach the girls to make their own pajamas, slips,\nskirts, blouses and we have turned out several rather\nwell-made wool suits \u2014 to knit, socks, socks and\nsimple sweaters. I do leatherwork, feltwork\nand woodwork, although I do try to push the\nacademic work as far as possible. Classes\nare greatly, but as I see the situation at the\nMohawk Institute, there's a place for a very\npractical course, and a place for every\nuseful article made.\n\nI would like, if accepted, to live at the institute\nif suitable accommodation could be provided on\nthe grounds.\n\nCol. Neary, I still haven't found out what the\nsalary would be, and I am very anxious to know\nwhat arrangements could be made regarding\nsuperannuation with my twenty-five years\nin the Ontario Service, I can't afford to lose out in a transfer. Would you please outline as simply as possible what arrangements could be made.\n\nI realize that this proposed experiment is going to present difficulties, and no doubt there'll be mistakes made along the way, but I find myself most enthusiastic about it, and I'd like to see it a success.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPoveshell Carlaw\nMohawk Institute\nBrantford, Ont.\n\nOctober 8, 1949.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI know you have many facts to remember after you make your visits to one institution after another and in case you happened to forget would you kindly see that an advance on the quarterly grant was sent to the Mohawk Institute.\n\nI did appreciate your coming to the Chapel last week-end.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nMr. W.J.

Later, I received your telegram Nov. 9 advising me that your visit was being cancelled. I was sorry to learn this, as I had hoped to meet you and work out the details re the auxiliary position there.\n\nI obtained complete details of the amount of superannuation I have contributed in Ontario and asked the Superannuation Branch of Department of Finance to explain what amount I would have to contribute to establish full credit with Dominion Government, should I become employed by your Department. I was advised to get all the information on the matter from a personnel officer in Dept. of Mines and Resources, so it would appear that, should we come to a satisfactory agreement re the position, and I receive your final appointment, the entire transfer could be effected through your department.\n\nCol. Neary, does the school year for this position include the ten months September - June, or would the services\nbefore twelve months with specified holidays?\n\nYour telegram stated that a letter would follow but since I have received no further word, I have concluded that at least it was not your intention to make any changes for January. However, if you still intend to have an Auxiliary Department started in Mohawk Institute, and you are still interested in my services, I would appreciate hearing from you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIrene Parlange\n\nMrs J S Parlange\nDecember 12, 1949.\n\nDear Mrs. Parlano:\n\nI must apologize for not writing to you previously but I have been rather worried about the provision of proper living accommodation for yourself and your family at the Mohawk Institute.\n\nI have been absent from my office but as I previously advised you I was not able to go to Brantford as planned. However, Mr. Phelan will be going down immediately after Christmas to discuss with Mr. Zimmerman the use of the former Army building as a teacher's residence. It will be necessary to do some repair and renovating work on the building before we can approach you as to its suitability as a residence.\n\nI am pleased that you have made inquiries about the problem of superannuation and I would say that we will probably require your services by the first of September 1950 by which time we should have suitable living accommodation for you at the Mohawk Institute. Please rest assured that we most definitely are interested in your service as teacher at this school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMrs. S.J.
