A good student who is often absent to help at home.\n\nGreene, Phyllis was promoted to Grade 12 with a condition in Algebra. She is a hard working student and regular in attendance.\n\nGreene, Eugene Left school in May and is working in Kingston. He was doing fair work in Grade 10.\n\nBrant, Betty Left school in June as her mother was ill. She may return in the month of September if her mother's health improves. Grade 9.\n\nGreen, Smith An excellent student. Promoted to Grade 10.\n\nHennon, Freda An excellent student promoted to Grade 10.\n\nMaracle, Cedrick Left school early to work on the farm. He may return in September. A clever boy who should be kept in school.\n\nThe above reports are of our principal, A.C. Reid, a copy of which we have on our files.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.C. Reynolds.\nVice-Chairman\nBoard of Education.\nOttawa, August 12, 1946.\n\nMr. J. H. McVicker, In charge, Indian Agency Office,\nDeseronto, Ontario.\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing report from the Principal of Deseronto High School regarding the seven Indian children who were in attendance at that school during the academic year 1945-46.\n\nIn view of the fact that they were promoted to a higher grade, the Department will allow, for the academic year 1946-47, the same amount as previously, for the following:\n\n1. Lorraine Brant;\n2. Phyllis Greene;\n3. Edith Green;\n4. Freda Hannon.\n\nWith regard to Lorraine Brant, the Principal states that she is a good student but is often absent to help at home. I feel that you should interview her parents and request their full co-operation. If this girl is going to be successful in her school work, the parents should assist by having her attend school regularly.\n\nGedrick Maracle is stated to be a clever boy but is reported to have left school early to work on farm. Was he promoted to a higher form? Was it absolutely necessary for him to leave school early? It would appear that this is another case where the parents should be interviewed and urged to co-operate in the education of their son.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR TUITION GRANT\n\n1.

It is recommended that the Department grant the necessary authority for this girl to attend Deseronto High School for this coming term, and, if her attendance and marks do not warrant continuance, that the grant be discontinued.\n\nJ.H. McVicker,\nActing Indian Agent.\nDeseronto, Ontario, September 13th, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nThis office is in receipt of an enquiry from Mrs. Frank Claus, No. 784 of the Mohawk Band of Tyendinaga Reserve, regarding tuition fees for her daughter Joan who wishes to attend the Ontario Business College at Belleville this term. Mrs. Claus states that she is not able financially to pay for this course, and would like to know if the Department would assume the cost. This family own a home on the reserve, which is rented, and have been resident in the City of Belleville for the past two years. I would wish to be advised if authority can be granted for the Department to assume this responsibility.\n\nJ.H. McVicker,\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa, 17 September 1946.\n\nMr. J.H. McVicker, Acting Indian Agent,\nDEBERONTO, Ontario.\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 13th instant with reference to an application that you have received for payment of the tuition fees of Joan Claus. It is noted from your letter that this family has resided off the Reserve for the past two years. Under these circumstances the Department does not consider itself liable for payment of tuition fees and you should so inform the mother.\n\nWith reference to your second letter of September 13th, the Department will pay the usual tuition fees of the Deseronto High School to enable Eva Green to attend that school during the academic year 1946-47. It is understood that if her attendance and marks do not warrant the continuance of the grant after the end of the present term it will be discontinued.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Department\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFor the past two years I have been teaching in Shannonville Public School, and I find a situation there (since it promises to be no better this term) that I feel, in duty bound to report to you.\n\nWe have on our attendance roll a number of pupils from the Indian Reserve near by, under the agency of Mr. A.D. Moore. Some of these are regular in attendance and prove to be delightful pupils. Others due to home conditions, and parental neglect, have a most deplorable attendance record. There are three on our roll who have not even reported yet this term.\n\nEach year I have reported this at regular intervals to the agent. I have contacted the doctor in charge. This fall I have even appealed to the Reserve Council, all to very little effect.\n\nIn all due justice to these\nchildren themselves, and to the unfairness of the condition to our school grants. I feel that steps should be taken to correct matters as far as possible.\n\nShould the department wish names and particulars I shall be glad to supply them. Perhaps if a representative of the Mounted Police would call at the school for details, and visit the homes it might have some result.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Mrs) Hazel A. Holden.\n\n167 Dundas W.\nBelleville, Ont.\nOttawa, 26 October 1946.\n\nMr. J.H. McVicker, Acting Indian Agent,\nDESERONTO, Ontario.\n\nIndian Students attending Shannonville Public School, Belleville, Ont.\n\nThe attached letter has been received from Mrs. Hazel A. Holden, 167 Dundas West, Belleville, concerning the attendance of certain Indian children at this school.\n\nCould you please ascertain the names of the children whose attendance has been irregular and take what action concerning them that you deem necessary under the circumstances?\n\nWe wish a report submitted on the attendance for September and October of all children at this school for whom the Department is paying the tuition fees. As you are aware, family allowances to Indian parents are stopped where children are absent from school without sufficient cause for five days in any academic month.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, October 28, 1946.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Mrs. Holden:\n\nI have for answer your letter of October 23 concerning the poor attendance of certain Indian children at the Shannonville Public School. I have written to Mr. J. H. McVicker, Acting Indian Agent at Deseronto, asking for a report on the attendance of these children. You will no doubt be hearing from him further in this regard.\n\nMr. Moore has been seriously ill and Mr. McVicker has been acting in his stead. He is probably unaware of the situation as revealed in your letter and it is hoped that the attendance of these children can be improved as soon as possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMrs. Hazel Holden,\n167 Dundas Street,\nBelleville, Ontario.\nOct. 30, 1946.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nThe Dept. of Education for Ontario requires that you give an approval for the Education of Joan Brant a resident of Tyendinaga Indian Reserve as a student at the Belleville Collegiate Institute before they give any consideration to payment of the cost of Education of this child as a Non-Resident pupil.\n\nWhile the amount involved is trivial, we would be glad to have the matter cleared and would appreciate having such a statement of approval.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL. A. Kelso\nSecretary.\nOttawa, 4 November 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have your letter of the 30th ultimo with reference to Joan Brant. It is presumed that you refer to an account of $6.87 which was forwarded to Mr. A.D. Moore, Indian Agent, Deseronto, Ontario.\n\nJoan Brant was sent to the Belleville Collegiate by her parents without any authority either from the Indian office at Deseronto or from this Department.\n\nWe are informed that she only attended for a period of one month.\n\nIf the Indian Affairs Branch is required to pay tuition fees for Indian children at High Schools and Collegiate Institutes, it is understood by both Indian parents and officials in the field that the approval of this office must first be obtained. Joan Brant's parents did not request the necessary authority and consequently we do not consider that we are responsible for payment of her fees.\n\nIt is felt that you will realize that unless we first approve of any expenditure, it is simply impossible for us to control our appropriation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F.

You wrote us regarding this woman's daughter under cover of your letter of Sept. 13 and we replied on Sept. 17.\n\nIn view of the contents of the enclosed letter, you may consider it advisable to make a further recommendation. When replying, you might let us know what rent the family obtains for the house they own on the reserve. Is this woman's husband in a Mental Hospital and if so, is the Department paying for his maintenance?\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir,\n\nI wrote the Indian Agent of Orono asking if the Department of Mines and Resources would pay for my daughter's education at business college, and came back saying we have lived off the Indian Reserve too long.\n\nI would like to remind you, my husband is mentally ill, in hospital at Kingston, and has been for some time. When my husband went to the hospital I had to\ngo to work. It was necessary that I move to the city as I had no way of getting to and from work. I did not move from the Reserve because I wanted to and my daughter is still a member of the Mohawk Indians therefore I am not asking for something that she has no right to. I know there is money set aside for the education of every Indian child. I am asking for something that belongs to my child, her right to get an education. I have no income, only\nwhat I earn, working myself\nand that is not enough to\nsend my daughter to school.\nHer fees were paid at\nHigh school and we were\nnot living on the Indian\nReserve. I want my daughter\nto have an education and\nis it possible to have her\nfees paid, for the eight months\nat Bemus College.\n\nYours Truly\n\nMrs. Frank L.

I would advise you that this woman has a house and fifty acres of land on the Tyendinaga Reserve for which she receives a yearly rental of $125.00. Her husband is in a Mental Hospital and is maintained there by payment from Band Funds. Mrs. Claus, in order to maintain her home, was forced to secure employment, and for that reason did take up residence in the city of Belleville. The tuition fee for her daughter at High School was paid by the Department.\n\nThe daughter Joan, who is 17 years of age, is an exceptionally smart girl and has completed her High School Course and is now very desirous of taking the Secretarial Course at the Ontario Business College. The total cost of this course, including the cost of books, is $130.00., and I would recommend that the Department assume this cost as the Mother is dependant on her own earnings to maintain her home and child.\n\nThe Letter received by you from Mrs. Frank Claus, is enclosed.\n\nJ.H.

She visited this office with the view of obtaining the position as teacher of one of the Reserve schools but as we could not give her any guarantee of the minimum salary as set out by the Teachers' Federation we advised her to write direct to the Department. This office is of the opinion that her initial efforts as teacher would meet with better success if she were teaching at a school on another reserve and not where she would have so many relatives and so forth.\n\nJ. H. McVicker,\nClerk in Charge.\nOttawa, April 24th, 1947.\n\nDear Miss Maracle:-\n\nWe have your letter of the 8th instant applying for appointment as teacher in an Indian day school. It is noted that you are attending Peterborough Normal School and we hope that you will be successful.\n\nEnclosed is one of our regular application forms which you should complete and return. A new salary schedule goes into effect on September 1st, 1947 and is based on the experience and qualifications of the applicant. More detailed information regarding this salary schedule will be forwarded to you shortly.\n\nAt the present time I am not in a position to state what school you could be assigned, but I feel certain that we will be able to use your services.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard P.

Box 267,\nDeseronto, Ontario.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Western Day School (closed).\n\nFor the past two academic years the Western School on the Tyendinaga Reserve has been closed and the pupils who formerly attended that school have been going to the white schools at Shannonville and Milltown which are in close proximity to the Reserve.\n\nA survey has been made of the parents who send their children to the white schools and with one exception they favour the idea to continue sending their children to these schools in preference to the Indian school, the exception being one family who live on the adjoining farm to the Western School property. The center of population of school children remains close to the white schools which is much less in distance to attend than the Indian school and I favour the idea to let Western school remain closed for another year at least and pay the Tyendinaga Township school board $2.00 a pupil per month for the Indian children attending Shannonville and Milltown schools.\n\nThis procedure is recommended for your approval and from the present enrollment it would mean paying for 25 pupils, a cost of $50.00 a month or $500.00 for the academic year which would be much less cost than re-opening Western School for the very few pupils that would attend there on account of distance and also the uncertainty of getting a fully qualified teacher for Western school which school is badly located for accommodation for a teacher and also for the Indian population of the Western end of the Reserve.\n\nADM/JMcV\n\nA.

Moore, Indian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ontario.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to the Tyendinaga Western School.\n\nIn view of the contents of your letter, the Department agrees that it would not be advisable to re-open this school for the academic year 1946-47. The Indian children who should attend this school may continue at the white school at which they were present during the past academic year. Payment will be allowed at the rate of $2.00 per pupil per month.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nShannonville\nJuly 1/47\n\nMr. A.D.

Dimmell,\nfor Indian Agent,\n\nEnclosure\nExtract from report of Mr. F. Matters, Regional Supervisor,\ndated June 6, 1948, on TIERDINAGA SCHOOLS\n\nOriginal on 77-34\n\nIt has been suggested that a building be secured at Deseronto Airport if and when they are declared surplus, and that a two-room school be erected to replace the present Central and Mission Schools. I am of the opinion there are sufficient children between the ages of six - sixteen to warrant a three-room school. Inasmuch as at the present time no children under seven can be admitted to the Mission School, which is the most heavily populated in the District, there will be children starting in September, who are almost eight years of age. The inauguration of a two or three-room school will involve some arrangements for transportation and it would be an easy matter to absorb some of the children who are at present time attending Eastern School, and bring the potential number up to between one hundred and one hundred and ten. There are also besides this, a number of non-Indian children residing on leased land and who have to go to Deseronto Public School. I think these could be included on the same basis of payment as we have with Indian children attending Public Schools.\nAPPLICATION FOR TUITION GRANT\n\n1.

Are their families living on the Reserve or do they live in Belleville?\n\nNo decision will be made until we hear further from you.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n| Item                          | Quantity | Price |\n|------------------------------|----------|-------|\n| Health Book                  | 1        | $1.25 |\n| Science Book                 | 1        | $.75  |\n| Mathematic Book              | 1        | $.70  |\n| Merchant of Venice           | 1        | $.45  |\n| Classical Mythology          | 1        | $.60  |\n| Living English               | 1        | $.95  |\n| Gun for Treason              | 1        | $.60  |\n| Art Portfolio                | 1        | $1.75 |\n| Three Ring Note Book         | 2        | $1.50 |\n| Music Book                   | 1        | $.35  |\n| Colored Pencils              | 1        | $.35  |\n| British Story                | 1        | $.80  |\n| Canadian Prose & Verse Book II| 1       | $.90  |\n|                              |          | $10.95|\n| Geography                    | 1        | $1.00 |\n|                              |          | $11.95|\n\nIndian Affairs (rg 10 Volume 6485, file 42034-3, part 5)\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| June 14/49 | To books and school supplies for Clarence William Brant, student attending Belleville Collegiate & Vocational School, as per accounts attached |        |\n|            | The James Texts Limited                                                 | $11.95 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

If it occurs that you must contact the authorities of the Ontario School for the Deaf, Belleville, Ontario, in order to obtain this information, it would be appreciated if you would, at the same time, ascertain from them the grade in school of Robert Guy Lazor\u00e9, a child from St. Regis Agency. We are, of course, aware that he is not your responsibility, and we do not expect you to make a special enquiry about him.\n\nWhen you have completed your list, would you be kind enough to return it to us as previously requested. We have today received the list of names of children attending Tyendinaga S.S. No. 1 and S.S. No.5 but also require the additional data indicated in the headings of our list.\n\nBernard F.

These boys are the sons of James Loft, who has been residing in Marysville, Michigan. Loft has now moved his family to this Reserve, where they intend to reside in future.\n\nYour early attention will be appreciated.\n\nDRC.R\n\nD.R.CASSIE,\nSupt. Tyendinaga Agency.\n\nP.S. You will note the yearly amount $120.00, quoted on advice of Business Administrator of Belleville Board of Education, who expects the fees will be slightly higher this year.\n14th February, 1949.\n\nMr. D.R. Cassie,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nDeseronto, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 7th instant requesting tuition grants for James Gordon Loft and Arthur Edwin Loft.\n\nAre you satisfied that these boys are sufficiently advanced to attend high school? The present academic year is well advanced, and I am under the impression that it will be difficult for any pupil to take up the work and hope to be successful at the end of the current academic year, especially when they have presumably been in attendance at an American school, where the curriculum is probably considerably different from our own.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nDeseronto, Ont.\nFebruary 18th, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAtt'n Bernard F. Neary, Esq.\nSupt. Indian Education\n\nRe-Tuition Grants-2 ft boys, Tyendinaga\n\nIn reply to yours of February 14th, file 42054-3 (E.1) it is my opinion that these two boys are quite capable of handling the courses they have undertaken. Arthur is carrying on with his Commercial Course and James with his Industrial Course. I understand from their father that they are both succeeding in their endeavours and have fitted into the new school program. He was telling me that the older boy is on the School Basket Ball Team and quite well satisfied in his new surroundings.\n\nD.R.CASSIE,\nSupt. Tyendinaga Agency.\n23rd February, 1949.\n\nMr. D.R. Cassie,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nDeseronto, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant, we are prepared to allow an amount of $10.00 a month for each of the two Loft boys who are attending Belleville Collegiate. You do not state the date they began to attend Belleville Collegiate, but I presume it was recently, as you state in your letter of 7th February, 1949, that the family had returned from living in Michigan. It is understood that this amount will be used to pay their fees at the Collegiate.\n\nAt the end of June you should have the Principal forward us a report regarding the progress of these two boys during their period of attendance.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nDeseronto, Ont.\nFeb. 21st, 1949.\n\nBernard F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nReference your letter, file 42034-3 (H) of February 1st, requesting age and grade reports of children attending the Ontario School for the Deaf and Dumb, Belleville. According to the Principal their course does not correspond with the Ontario Provincial Course. They have several preparatory courses before the Academic or Vocational grading commences. You were enquiring about Robert Guy Lazore from the St. Regis Agency. He is 6 years old, at present in the second year at school and reportedly graded in \"Preparatory 2\".\n\nMolly Brant from our Reserve, left this school June 1948. The Delbert Green from our Reserve, is 12 years old, has attended 7 years and is graded in \"Vocational 2\", which I understand corresponds to grade 3 in the Provincial System. Also a Sarah Brant from our Reserve, 11 years of age, 5th year in School and rated grade 2.\n\nI trust this information is satisfactory to your requirements.\n\nD.R.Cassie,\nSupt. Tyendinaga Agency.\nDeseronto, Ont.\nFebruary 22nd, 1949.\n\nBernard F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nTyendinaga Agency - Tuition Grants\n\nEnclosed please find copy of report of Indian Children attending Provincial or Private Schools, as requested in your letter, file 42034-3 (E) of January 22nd, 1949. In reply to your request for information, I submit the following:\n\n(1) The address of Milltown School is Shannonville, P.O. This school is a rural school serving School Section No.5, Tyendinaga Township. The Teacher, however, lives in Belleville and the Secretary is Wm. McMechan, Shannonville.\n\n(2) The Shannonville School is a rural school, serving School Section #17, Tyendinaga Township. Post Office address is Shannonville, but the teacher lives in Belleville and the Secretary is Wm. McMechan, Shannonville.\n\n(3) I trust the enclosed list contains the names of all children attending Schools off the reserve, but I cannot be sure of this, as I have not been here long enough to know all the families.\n\nI note there is no indication of pupils nos. 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 having applied for tuition grants. I shall attend to this matter on your advice, particularly relating to the pupils attending the Belleville School for the Deaf and Dumb and the Ontario Hospital School at Orillia.\n\nD.R.Cassie\nSupt.

B.F. Henry\n\nReference your letter of February 23rd, file 32-34-3(E.1) in which you allow the amount of $10.00 per month for tuition for each of the two Loft boys attending Belleville Collegiate Institute.\n\nI note that according to the Statement of Claim (see our Voucher No. 101, for cost of Education submitted by the Belleville Board of Education to our Department, for the year 1948) the amount charged for tuition is based on the ratio of attendance to the total cost, less any Provincial Grant. While the amount of $10.00 per month which you have allowed would be sufficient for 1948, there is a little doubt as to whether it will cover the cost during the year 1949 (According to the Administrator of the Belleville Board of Education, who informed me in a telephone conversation that the $10.00 would not be sufficient).\n\nAs I see it this leaves several alternatives; first, when the Belleville Board of Education bills us, we request the Department to authorize a supplementary amount; or second, that we assess the parents of the pupils with the difference between the cost and your authorized allowance of $10.00 per month; third, that you amend your instructions to cover this exigency.\n\nI respectfully submit that this problem will arise also with our pupils attending Deseronto High School, and that to be fair to all concerned we should allow a tuition grant based on the cost of Education.\n\nD.R.Cassie\nSuperintendent\nTyendinaga Agency\n16th March, 1949.\n\nMr. D.R. Cassie,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nDeseronto, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 2nd instant regarding the tuition grant which we promised to allow for each of the two Loft boys who are attending Belleville Collegiate Institute.\n\nIf the amount of the fees at the Collegiate should exceed $10.00 per month, during the period 1st January to 30th June, 1949, the Department will pay the extra amount.\n\nAt the end of June you should obtain a report from Belleville Collegiate regarding the progress of these boys and submit same to this office. We will require such a report before consideration can be given to allowing a tuition grant for these boys for the academic year 1949-50.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nIndian Affairs (rg 10 Volume 6485, file 42034-3, part 5)\nDeseronto, Ont.\nMarch 19th, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAtt'n Col. B.F. Neary\n\nEnclosed please find our Voucher No. 106 covering transportation for six pupils from the edge of the Reserve to Belleville Collegiate Institute. Only recently was I informed of these services being rendered. I understand this bus service commenced on the 1st of February 1949, and our pupils have been taking advantage of it without permission of this Office. These pupils formerly were going to Belleville in private cars with factory workers leaving before 7 A.M. and returning about 6 P.M.\n\nIf you see fit to authorize payment of this transportation, I think that for the present charge of 50\u00a2 per pupil per day, the Driver should pick these pupils up on the Reserve as near their homes as possible. At the present time the parents of the children concerned are driving to Shannonville, which is at the edge of the reserve.\n\nFurther if transportation is provided for the six children, there is one other boy going to Belleville who should be provided with the same services.\n\nD.R.Cassie,\nSupt. Tyendinaga Agency.\n28th March, 1949.\n\nMr. D.R. Cassie,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nDeseronto, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 19th instant with reference to transportation of children from the Tyendinaga Reserve who are attending Belleville Collegiate Institute.\n\nThe parents made this arrangement without consulting the Department, and we feel that if we allowed half of the amount of the transportation it should be sufficient. As you are aware, we have already agreed to pay the tuition fees and the cost of books.\n\nYou should, therefore, amend your Voucher by requesting $30.00 a month instead of $60.00, from 1st February to 30th June, 1949. The bus driver should be fully informed that the parents concerned are responsible for the balance.\n\nBernard F.

As you are probably aware the Ontario Schools work on a Calendar year basis as far as finances are concerned. The cost per pupil is therefore not determined until the next calendar year. According to my present information, see our Voucher No. 101, Feb. 24/49, the cost of education for the year 1949 at Belleville School will be approximately .55\u00a2 per day. As I do not know yet what the cost will be in 1950, I have put in the same figure in item 9.\n\nItem 10, the parents will provide board for the child and half the transportation cost if the bus is used, or all the transportation cost if no bus is available.\n\nItem 11 Indian Affairs Branch should therefore be requested to provide tuition grant plus half the cost of bus transportation if available.\n\nD.R.CASSIE,\nSupt.

The clerk of Lambton County informs me that the Indian Dept. is responsible for the cost of his education. The county rate paid for the other outside pupils was $0.870796 per day. This figure multiplied by 60\u00bd equals $52.88.\n\nI shall be obliged if you will forward me your cheque for this amount.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) H.A. Tanser,\nInspector-Administrator,\nSupt. of Schools.\nOttawa,\nOctober 19, 1944.\n\nMr. J.W. Daley, Indian Agent, Walpole Island, Ont.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Board of Education, Chatham, Ontario, stating that Pinnance Parker, an Indian, attended the Chatham Vocational School for a period of 60\u00bd days during the calendar year 1943. A review of our files does not indicate any correspondence regarding this boy attending the school mentioned. Please let me know on whose authority he attended the school. The Chatham Board of Education is now requesting us to pay an amount of $52.68 for his tuition.\n\nR.A.

We do not appear to have authorized the attendance of this boy at the Chatham Vocational School. However, I am communicating with Mr. J.W. Daley, Indian Agent, Walpole Island, Ontario, with a view to ascertaining on whose authority Parker attended the school mentioned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nH.A.

Mines & Resources Indian Affairs Branch Ottawa\n\nRe your letter dated Oct. 19/44 No 103-40.\n\nUn officially I knew that the boy in question had attended Chatham Vocational School but certainly not on any authority of this office. I am positive that it never was the intention of Finnance that your Dept. pay this fee as his family are well aware of the fact that your Dept. cut off these Secondary school grants.\n\nIt is rumoured that Finnance has lately joined the U.S. armed services.\n\nJames W. Daley\nJAMES W. DALEY INDIAN AGENT\nOttawa,\nOctober 26, 1944.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 11th instant and my reply of the 19th instant, with reference to the amount due for the tuition of Pinnance Parker, who attended the Chatham Vocational School for a period of 60\u00bd days during the calendar year 1943.\n\nOn communicating with the Indian Agent I find that neither he nor this Department gave any authority for this boy to attend vocational school. I think you will realize that it would be impossible for us to consider payment of expenditures which we have not previously authorized. Under the circumstances I regret that we cannot see our way clear to pay the amount mentioned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nH.A. Tanser, Esq., M.A., D.Paed.,\nSuperintendent of Schools,\nThe Board of Education,\nChatham, Ont.\nOctober 31, 1944.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIn connection with your letter dated October 26 regarding Parker Pinmanse, this question has been referred to the Board of Education. The members have asked me to write you accordingly as follows:\n\nThe principal of the Chatham Vocational School accepted this pupil in good faith believing that Lambton County would pay for the cost of his education as for the other pupils. This Indian pupil has received the school services and someone has to pay for the cost.\n\nIt would certainly not be equitable to expect the taxpayers of the City of Chatham to pay the cost of education of an Indian boy from Walpole Island. It is on a par with a child buying groceries from the store, the groceries being consumed at home, and the parents declining to pay the bill. Furthermore, it would appear that the non-payment of such a bill would indicate the Indian child as being discriminated against.\n\nSurely when an Indian boy wants to obtain secondary education he should be afforded the same facilities as his white brothers. It is quite possible that the principal of the Vocational School overlooked the technical detail in not obtaining authorization for this boy to attend from the Indian Agent. I think, on further consideration, that you will see the matter in this light and I would request payment of the bill.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.A.

Otherwise we would have no control over our expenditures.\n\nIt can also be inferred from your letter that you do not accept white children from the County of Lambton without the approval of that county. It only seems reasonable that similar approval should be obtained from this Branch in regard to any Indian pupil for whom it is expected that we should provide fees. However, it has been decided to pay the amount of $52.68, but in future no payment for the tuition of Indian children at your school will be made unless our approval has been granted before the child enters the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.A.

The address of this boy is R.R. #3, Wallaceburg, Walpole Island. You will remember that last time we submitted to you the account for his attendance during the calendar year 1943.\n\nThe account for the attendance of county pupils is always calculated on the basis of the calendar year.

All persuasion from her teachers at the girls school here is of no avail and since the child is not over strong and has one of her parents in a mental home, it seems unwise to force her. She has a position which she arranged for in the General Hospital at Sault Ste Marie in the diet kitchen. She has, it seems always been a sort of problem child, although not difficult to manage.

Furthermore the pupils from Walpole Island will be able to use the High School Bus from the highway at the lower ferry. The only problem will be transporting these children from the Front to the ferry, approximately 4-5 miles. It may be possible to obtain local cars owned by Indians to do this.\n\nIt is understood that some assistance from the Department may be forthcoming in this respect. May we be advised please how this may be handled. It would appear advisable to have more than one car available for this work. The pupil from No. 2 School intends to bicycle to the ferry each day. However a car should be arranged to take this pupil during the winter months. It is expected that there will be four Indian pupils from No. 1 School and 1 pupil from No. 2 School. In addition there are 2 white pupils residents of Walpole who will be attending high school.\n\nIt is suggested that each driver submit an account each month on a mileage basis at a stipulated mileage cost. I believe car hire hireage is ten cents, and the approximate daily mileage for one car would be 25 miles.\n\nThe alternative would be for them to submit tenders for a contract to do this.\n\nPlease advise how much the Department is prepared to pay in this respect.\n\nRobert J. Stallwood, Supt.\nIndian Agency.\nAugust 12, 1948.\n\nMr. Robert J. Stallwood,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nWalpole Island, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant, we enclose the usual application forms for tuition grant. One of these should be completed and returned to us, for each pupil who wishes to attend Wallaceburg High School.\n\nWe are prepared to pay for the tuition of these pupils at the high school, provided that in submitting their account the school board uses the form prescribed by the Ontario Department of Education, namely form No. 93.\n\nBernard F. Heary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter of August 12th, enclosing application forms for tuition grant. As soon as Miss McMeans, principal of No. 1 Indian Day School returns I shall have her complete item 12 in each case and then I shall forward the completed forms to the Department.\n\nHowever as indicated in our letter of August 6th I have been informed that there will not be any tuition fees to pay at the Wallaceburg High School. Our problem then is whether or not the Indian pupils will be given any assistance in the matter of transportation and if so what procedure will be followed.\n\nThe parents of one of the Indian pupils who will be attending High School have a satisfactory car and are prepared to transport children to the Ferry where they can catch the High School Bus. They have quoted a price of 50 cents per pupil per day. This would not include the pupil from No. 2 School unless he could meet the car at the Main Road. At present this pupil intends to bicycle to the ferry.\n\nIn the vicinity of the Lower Ferry there are about 16 children who could attend our No. 1 School if transportation were provided. At present 13 of these children attended Shingwauk and there are 3 who did not attend any school last year. The car mentioned above could bring some of these children to No. 1 School on its return from meeting the High School Bus. However there is a definite need for a small school bus on the Island.\n\nMay we be advised please if any assistance may be given to the High School pupils in lieu of tuition grant?\n\nR.J. Stallwood, Supt.\nIndian Agency\nOttawa, August 20, 1948.\n\nMr. R.J. Stallwood, Supt., Indian Agent, Walpole Island, Ont.,\n\nTuition Grant - Walpole Island High School Students.\n\nIt is understood that the Wallaceburg High School will not be requesting tuition fees for Indian students attending there during the 1948-49 academic year. However, I understand from your letter that an Indian is prepared to run these children to the ferry daily.\n\nI note that the rate of .50\u00a2 per day is mentioned. You do not say whether all these children can be transported in this way but we presume that this is so. We concur in your recommendation of August 6th that each driver submit an account each month on a mileage basis at a suitable mileage cost. This rate would be 10 cents per mile.\n\nHowever, if the driver prefers, a set rate of 50 cents per pupil per day, this could be arranged if you concur in it.\n\nPlease advise as to the cost of transporting children of No. 1 school daily by using this same driver.\n\nOur regulations on the transportation of day school pupils is that a child under ten years of age can be expected to walk two miles to school and a child over the age of ten can be expected to walk three miles to school.\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/HM.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nRe: Walpole Island High School Students\n\nIn reply to your letter of August 20th, I may say that the driver we have in mind, H.B. Williams, is prepared to take all the above students whom we believe will be attending at the present time. They are as follows:\n\nGarry Williams\nJack Sands\nConnie Wrightman\n\nWellington Shipman (still doubtful)\nWilma Lalean (still doubtful)\n\nHe is also prepared to bring on his return trip at least six pupils from the Wallaceburg ferry district. Because of the condition of the roads at times of the year and other factors in regularly transporting children he prefers a set rate per pupil per day. At times he may have to hire a substitute car.\n\nAt a fixed rate of 50\u00a2 per day for high school pupils and 20\u00a2 per day for No. 1 School pupils he would earn from $2.70 to $3.70 per day. I would concur in this arrangement.\n\nIt is suggested that we commence on this basis for the month of September and make any changes necessary thereafter.\n\nWill the Department consider giving any grant to the High School pupils for the purchase of textbooks. Wilma Lalean, Connie Wrightman and Wellington Shipman will have some difficulty in obtaining money for this purpose. If any money is provided, would it be in the form of an accountable advance to this office.\n\nRobert J. Stallwood\nSuperintendent\nIndian Agency\nSeptember 3, 1948.\n\nMr. Robert J. Stallwood,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nWalpole Island, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 30th ultimo with reference to transportation of children from the Walpole Island Reserve who are attending high school in Wallaceburg, and also transportation of pupils to the No. 1 school who are living a considerable distance from the school.\n\n[You may arrange to have the transportation along the lines outlined in your letter for the month of September] and at the end of the month you should write us again, reporting on the matter so that we can decide what further action should be taken during the balance of the academic year.\n\nIf the parents are unable to supply the high school books you may purchase the same and forward us an account in duplicate for payment.\n\nBernard F.

Seven of those students attended last year and were successful in all their subjects. The remainder are pupils who passed their Entrance examinations last June.\n\nI have arranged to have two cars take ten of these pupils to the High School Bus on the Mainland and one of the cars to bring distant Public School pupils on the return trip to our No. 1 School. This can be arranged on a mileage basis at ten cents per mile, which will cost a total of $4.50 per day. I propose to have the remainder of the pupils taken in my car to Wallaceburg. My wife will drive unless I have business which will require me to go. I may say that since we wish to have our son continue at the Wallaceburg Public School, this trip will be made twice daily anyway. The High School bus was badly overcrowded last year.\n\nMay I be advised please if you wish me to submit a separate account for transportation of High School pupils in my car or may it be included in my monthly mileage account?\n\nPlease advise if the above arrangements are satisfactory.\n\nRobert J. Stallwood,\nSuperintendent of Indian Agency.\nSeptember 10, 1949.\n\nMr. R.J. Stallwood,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nWalpole Island, Ont.,\n\nReferring to your letter of August 31st, file 11-40, it is not clear to me how the arrangements are carried out.\n\nAs I understand it, the two cars will pick up the children on the Reserve and take them to the ferry from where the bus takes them to the school. The cost of picking up the ten children will be $4.50 a day or 45\u00a2 a pupil. Is there any charge for the bus?\n\nIn reference to the rest of the children you propose to take four of them direct to Wallaceburg.\n\nCould I please be advised if I am correct in these assumptions and what the transportation costs to Wallaceburg will be for the four children.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nRe: Transportation - High School Pupils.\n\nReference your letter of September 10, 1949.\n\nThe following is a nominal roll of Indian pupils attending the Wallaceburg High School, arranged by car loads.\n\n| Car No. 1          | Car No. 2          | Car No. 3          |\n|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Pat Riley         | Yvonne Sampson    | Marietta Hiley    |\n| Elwood Soney      | Beulah Kicknosway | Jeanita Riley     |\n| Jack Sands        | Loretta Nahdee    | Lorrae Altman     |\n| Garry Williams    | Hilda Aquash      |                   |\n| Morris Fisher     | George Oliver     |                   |\n\nTwo students who attended last year did not continue in September: Barbara Soney, Grade 12 and Connie Wrightman, Grade 10.\n\nHilda Aquash who had applied to attend Shingwauk is attending Wallaceburg High School instead.\n\nCar No. 1 travels 35 miles per day and also picks up pupils for our No. 1 Indian Day School.\n\nCost @ 10\u00a2 per mile $3.50\nCar No. 2 travels 10 miles per day @ 10\u00a2 1.00\nCar No. 3 travels 25 miles per day @ 10\u00a2 2.50\nFerry transportation 20\u00a2 return (Indian Cars) @ 3 cars @ 40\u00a2 per day - 1.20\n\nTotal cost per day $8.20\n\nAs mentioned in a previous letter Car No. 3 (my car) proceeds all the way to Wallaceburg with its load, however a charge is only made for mileage on Walpole Island.\nSeptember 19, 1949.\n\nRe: Transportation - High School Pupils, continued.\n\nI have had talks with the Chairman of the High School Board and with the Manager of the Kent Coach Company which carries High School pupils, with the aim of having one of the High School bus routes cover Walpole Island. The Board does not appear disposed to consider this. He states that the Board receive a Provincial Grant of at least 50 cents per pupil per day for transportation. The balance of the cost of transportation is levied in the form of taxes to ratepayers and by tuition fees on a per capita basis to non-ratepayers.\n\nThe Kent Coach Company which operates a bus two days a week on Walpole Island would require a guarantee of $20.00 per day to operate a daily bus at school hours.\n\nIt is suggested that when Mr. Morris visits Walpole Island again that we interview the High School Board to include the Island on the regular bus route. It seems to me that we should be entitled to this. I may say that the Board is trying to keep to 5 routes, although some are over 40 miles long and are crowded. To include Walpole, a new route and bus would have to be established.\n\nRobert J.

Thirty-six (36) are going to public and separate schools in Sturgeon Falls and 14 are attending classes in North Bay. As these Indians live along the lake shore paralleled by the North Bay-Sturgeon Falls highway. It is easy to transport them by bus to either of these two cities. Therefore I would not recommend the re-opening of the Garden Village Day School. Although it is a fairly good building, I feel that it will be to the educational advantage of these Indians to have them continue in attendance at white schools. There is also a possibility that some of these children will be able to go much further in the provincial schools than in our own.\n\nThere are only five of these children at the Spanish Residential School. There are some of these children in Sturgeon Falls, boarding schools. (Their parents are paying for this).\n\nBernard F.

He has bought a twelve passenger bus, and carries the regulation insurance, $50,000.00 with Lloyd's Automobile Insurance, effected through the Provincial Service Agency, Limited, 24 King St. W., Toronto. His licence has been approved by the Department of Highways, and the council of the Town of Sturgeon Falls.\n\nMr. Beaucage will undertake the transportation of approximately 34 Nipissing Band children, attending school at Sturgeon Falls, at a fixed rate of $140.00 per month, $1,400.00 per annum.\n\nIf this arrangement is satisfactory to the Department, will you please advise.\n\nJAM/JNM\n\nP.M.

Before we are\nin a position to advise you in that regard please advise if the Nipissing\nBand resolution of October 10th, 1945, is still in effect.\n\nAs you are aware, by this arrangement the Band consented to pay\none-half the cost of transportation for the school children attending public\nand separate schools in Sturgeon Falls and North Bay. The resolution states\nalso \"It is understood that the parents will assume one-half of the total\ncost of transportation.\" Have they contributed their share and will they\ndo so under the new arrangement? When we have received your report in the\nabove connection further action will be taken.\n\nA.G.

They have been paying transportation at the rate of $2.00 a month for each child, which is approximately half of the transportation, and more children are attending school this year.\n\nAlthough this amount is not always paid monthly, an adjustment is made for any transportation due, when making the interest and royalty distributions.\n\nIn the past, we have paid at so many trips a day. Presently the transportation is being done by bus, with a fixed rate of $140.00 per month.\n\nIf this change is acceptable, I would like the approval of the Department.\n\nJ. A.

Laurence,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nWe have received a copy of Reverend Father Oliver's letter of October 28th with reference to Adam Commanda.\n\nWhile this boy is a member of a band coming under the jurisdiction of Superintendent Marleau, Sturgeon Falls, Ontario, we are writing to you because the boy apparently has been placed as an apprentice at Boston's Garage in your city.\n\nWe would appreciate it very much if you would interview the manager of the garage and also the boy himself and let us know the length of time that he will have to serve as an apprentice and the expenditure that will be required to assist him during his apprenticeship. As soon as we have this information we will decide what we can allow.\n\nAn early reply would be very much appreciated. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to Indian Superintendent Marleau and also to Father Oliver.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6486, file 42043-3, part 3)\nDear Mr Neary...\n\nAdam Commanda, son of Peter Commanda of Bear Island in Mr. J.A. Marlowe's agency left us some time ago to work with a garage man in town here... about three weeks ago. The arrangement was very unsatisfactory since there was very little work to do at the garage, the tourist season being over and Adam ended up by being odd job man. He asked us what we thought he should do and an opportunity presented itself of getting him to Sault Ste Marie Ontario. He went up with Father Bernard Mayhew and was fortunate enough to get accepted as an apprentice at Boston's Garage. I understand they have a fine training school there. Father Mayhew writes that Adam is interested in the work but that he cannot possibly carry on financially with the apprentice's wages.\n\nIt seems a shame to have him quit when it might be possible for him to get help from the Department.

Beaucage claims that delay by the branch in forwarding his monthly cheque was responsible for this failure.\n\nSince that time, Mr. Beaucage has been able to honour his agreement by hiring taxis from different concerns in Sturgeon Falls to carry the children. This arrangement has worked after a fashion, but is in imminent danger of breaking down, due to the fact that different companies in turn have refused the work, because of Beaucage's failure to pay regularly.\n\nMr. Beaucage's present agreement is with the Benoit Taxi. Because of Beaucage's reputation for incurring debts, Benoit is concerned about a small bill of some $12.00 owed to him by Beaucage to date.\n\nMay I recommend that the agreement with Mr. Beaucage be terminated and that a new agreement be made with the Benoit Taxi to transport these children to Sturgeon Falls at the same rate ($140.00 per month) as was paid Mr. Beaucage.\n\ncont'd...2\nMr. Benoit has indicated his willingness to enter into such an agreement.\n\nIn conclusion I should like to record the fact that Mr. Beaucage is industrious and conscientious, but that he seems incapable of carrying on an independent business, particularly as far as responsibilities in money matters are concerned.\n\nJ.

Maclean, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nSTURGEON FALLS,\nOntario.\n\nRe: Transportation - Nipissing School Children.\n\nResolution of October 10th, 1945, by the Nipissing Band, requested an expenditure not exceeding $100.00 in any one month to pay one-half the cost of transportation of the Band children to schools in Sturgeon Falls and North Bay. The parents were to pay one-half such transportation costs.\n\nIn this connection our records are as follows:\n\nFiscal year 1945-46 - expenditure of $314.14 - Collections nil\nFiscal year 1946-47 - expenditure of $874.05 - Collections nil\nFiscal year 1947-48 - expenditure of $229.10 - Collections - $348.00\nFiscal year 1948-49 - expenditure of $815.00 - Collections - $316.00\n\nThis would seem to indicate that until the fiscal year 1948-49, collections were inadequate. It also appears now that the cost of this transportation, according to the tender of Benoit Taxi, is much larger than was originally anticipated. However, if collections as anticipated by the Band when the resolution was adopted, are made, the monthly expenditure will be well within the $100.00 limit. Doubtless you will do everything possible to effect collections. If, however, you encounter difficulty, please report fully on the matter here so that appropriate action may be taken.\n\nVoucher No. 48 dated February 16th, 1949, in favour of J.W. Trusler, I.P.S., in the amount of $129.40 has been passed for payment. Also voucher No. 52 dated February 28th, 1949, for that month, in favour of Benoit Taxi, has been passed for payment.

Gordon's Report dated March 7th.\n\nSuperintendent Marleau has encouraged this trend in recent years to good effect, particularly as far as education is concerned. The Indian day school at the village is closed and all the children attend schools either in North Bay or Sturgeon Falls, depending on their location on the Reserve. The local teachers speak well of their Indian pupils and tell me that in deportment and attainment, with the possible exception of literature, that they are indistinguishable from the White pupils.\n\nUnfortunately the road into the village is such that the dozen or so children living there during the winter months are unable to attend school. This situation should be remedied as soon as possible. The ideal solution would be for the families living in the village to move to locations on the highway for the winter months. Alternately the road to the village could be snow fenced and more efficiently ploughed. The danger in the latter course would be the encouragement it might give to those living on the Highway at present to move back into the village. I do not believe that the small school in the village should be re-opened under any circumstances judging from the remarkably well trained Indian children from the Reserve who are attending the White schools.\nCredit Advice\n\nFile No. 42043-3\n\nMEMO.\n\nApril 1st, 1949.\n\nThe following remittance has been received from\n\nFor Indian Agent Miss J.

A. Marleau,\nIndian Agent,\nSturgeon Falls, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Marleau,\n\nWith reference to my contract for the transporting of school children from the Garden Village Reserve and Mosquito Creek to Sturgeon Falls, I would very much appreciate your considering increasing the amount allowed for this service.\n\nAs you are aware, I transport 36 children twice daily each school day to and from the Garden Village Reserve, I use two cars for this purpose. The return distance is 12 miles, so that in order to service the reserve, my cars travel a total of 48 miles per day. In addition, I send a car to Mosquito Creek twice daily. The return distance is 14 miles, so that my car travels 28 miles each day on this trip. This makes a total of 76 miles per day which my cars travel. I understand that this coming year there will be more children to transport, and it will probably require a third car.\n\nAt present I receive $140.00 per month, or roughly $7.00 per day. I was wondering if you could arrange to increase this to $9.00 per day, or $3.00 per car, which would work out to $130.00 per month. My cars will be travelling about 100 miles per day with the third car, and it appears to me that this would be reasonable.

Is there any special reason why the families mentioned in the Secretary's letter should be living at Peterbell?

B. Leonard\nSec.-Treas.\nSSI Codena\nOttawa,\nFebruary 17, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have a letter from the Secretary-Treasurer of the Peterbell School Board requesting payment of tuition fees for Treaty Indian children who, he states, are in attendance. It is practically the same letter as you forwarded to us under cover of your letter of October 9, 1941.\n\nIn my reply of October 20 I advised you that Mr. Arnell would visit your Agency. However, other important matters have arisen which require Mr. Arnell's services and it will probably be several months before he will have an opportunity of going to your Agency.\n\nThe School Board requests tuition fees for two children of Simon Fans and one child of Jim Kooses. Are these men recognized as Indians and how long have they resided at Peterbell? As you are aware, if these families have resided off the reserve for a period of 18 months the Department cannot accept responsibility either for their welfare or the education of their children. As pointed out in my letter of October 20, I am under the impression that if we continue allowing payments for the education of children at places along the railway lines the majority of the Indians will soon be residing in or close to many of these small towns.\n\nI will not reply to the letter of the Secretary-Treasurer of the Peterbell School Board until your reply is received.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. T.J.

It has been decided to pay for the tuition of these children for the current academic year but the Secretary-Treasurer of the Peterbell School should be definitely informed that no further payments will be made for the education of these children after the end of June, 1942.

Offord, Indian Agent, Moose Factory, Ont.\n\nRe: S.S.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nNovember 11th, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn October 2nd I wrote to the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, requesting forms upon which to apply for a grant for S. S. I., Moose on behalf of Treaty Indian pupils attending this school. I have had no reply and am now advised by the Assistant Chief Inspector to write direct to you stating the facts.\n\nThere are children of Treaty Indians attending the school in Moosonee and as this section is a poor one they are anxious to get all the help from grants which they can. The data for 1941 as based on Section 66 (3) of the Public Schools Act is as follows:\n\n- Gross cost of maintaining school: $1497.62\n- Total of all grants received: $1163.89\n- Net cost to this section of operating school: $333.73\n- Gross pupil-day attendance: 3105\n- Net pupil-day cost: 11 cents\n- Gross pupil-day attendance of Treaty Indian pupils: 605\n- Grant requested: $66.55\n\nThe Secretary's name is Mrs. M.

Hosyi:\n\nThere are 15 Indian pupils attending the Ontario Public School at Moosonee. Do you think it would be possible for the Department to supply biscuits and milk to these pupils and to arrange with the Ontario Department of Health that they do the same thing for the 17 white pupils.\n\nI will be in Ottawa about November 9th and we can discuss this matter further at that time.\n\nDr. T.J. Oxford\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nAttention Mr. R.A. Hoey.\n\nWhile in Ottawa I intended to more thoroughly go into the matter of Indians attending the Public school at Moosonee, but neglected to do so.\n\nOn October 25th, I wrote to you that there are 15 Indians attending the school and 17 white children, and suggested that possibly it could be arranged with the Ontario Dept. of Health that they and our Dept. supply milk and health biscuits for all the children of this school. The school principal has already arranged with a chapter of the I.O.B.E. to supply all the children with Vitamin capsules and I believe they have been taking these daily for some time.\n\nThis particular Public school has had an exceptional type of man for teacher during the past year and a half\u2014peculiarly suited for the mixed community. I call him peculiarly suited in that his humanity, kindness and interest does not draw a color line. His attitude is that he is teaching and directing young intelligence, according to its capacity and that he is trying to shape future Canadian citizens to some useful purpose. He maintains as I do, that intelligence is not limited by skin pigmentation, and is proud of being able to offer Indian children the same opportunity that he gives to children such as mine. The fact that Indian and white children in a community such as this can attend school on an equal footing and mix daily in work and play without even the least tinge of bias on the part of either Teacher or children, is in my opinion a remarkable example of what can be done in future educational outlook for our James Bay Indians. In a way this school serves to point out to us the possibilities of day schools for Indians in Northern localities, which is one of the discussed probable means of bringing education to them.\n\nWe should do everything possible to encourage Indian Attendance at Moosonee Public School, and I think it would be of definite value to introduce the daily use of milk and biscuits for this purpose, aside altogether from the health viewpoint. Will you undertake to contact the Provincial Authorities regarding their share in the proposition.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6486, file 42044-3, part 1)\nOttawa,\nDecember 1, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDr. T.J. Orford, Indian Agent, Moose Factory, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to Indian children attending the public school at Moosonee. When Indian children attend a white school our experience is that it is extremely difficult to grant the assistance that you request, unless the white children are also receiving the same consideration. You do not state the expenditure that would be involved, nor that milk can be obtained. I presume you refer to canned milk, or milk powder. Mr. Hosy has suggested that possibly the Provincial Government would be prepared to supply the milk if we supplied the health biscuits which we have supplied to other schools. You might give this consideration and let me know what possibility there is of the Provincial Government authorities doing their share.\n\nI note from the second paragraph of your letter that there are fifteen Indian children enrolled at the public school. When replying to this letter I should appreciate your advising the average attendance of these children during the months of September, October and November of this year.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nAttention Mr. R.A. Hoey\n\nWhen in Ottawa recently I mentioned that a teacher at the Moose Residential School was impressed with the intelligence of one of the boys\u2014James Sutherland Jr.\u2014and asked me if he could take him to Toronto to continue his education.\n\nThe boy is 13 years of age and has reached Grade 6, in school work. The teacher, Mr. Allan Reesor has left the employ of the local school and has returned to his parents home in Toronto. If the boy were to be sent to Toronto he would live with Mr. & Mrs. C.B. Reesor; 20 Ascot Ave. Mr. Reesor Sr., is an accountant and presumably he has a comfortable home. The nearest public school would be Earlscourt. Mr. Reesor considered the Sutherland boy would be capable of continuing through High School and College if given assistance.\n\nAt the time I mentioned it to you, you stated that the Dept. might be prepared to defray any cost of tuition, books, board and room and clothing. Will you kindly advise me whether or not the Dept. would undertake this expense if the boy's father will consent to his being sent to Toronto and also whether or not there would be any difficulty in connection with his removal from the local C.of E. school where he has been a pupil since 1941.\n\nT.J. Orford\nOttawa, December 13, 1944.\n\nDear Doctor Orford:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of December 7th and have noted with interest that Mr. Allan Reesor, employed for a time as teacher at the Anglican Residential School, is anxious to have one of the pupils, James Sutherland, Jr., proceed with his studies at Toronto.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that a somewhat similar request was received by this Branch from Mr. Reesor about a year ago. He was then in charge of a classroom at the Alberni Residential School, British Columbia, and was deeply impressed with the intelligence of at least one member of his class. Mr. Reesor's request was very sympathetically reviewed at that time and finally rejected. As a matter of fact, during the last year we have had to make provision for two or three Indian pupils that had been taken by teachers and ex-teachers to their homes in Canadian cities. These idealistic teachers, prompted no doubt by sympathy and interest in the pupil, took on an obligation that they simply could not fulfill. Indian pupils removed from their environment and from contact with their relatives invariably become dissatisfied.\n\nYou have probably learned by this time that Mr. Reesor is a very unusual individual, hopelessly idealistic and hopelessly impracticable. It would be interesting to know whether or not he ever discussed this proposal with his parents. Certainly there are thousands of bright boys in Toronto without homes that would be glad of an opportunity to reside with Mr. Reesor.\n\np.t.o.\nand thus proceed with their studies. The opinions I am expressing with respect to Mr. Reesor were gleaned from Church authorities thoroughly familiar with his work and with his temperament.\n\nThis boy, James Sutherland, Jr., should, in my judgment, continue to attend the Residential School at Moose Factory until he has completed Grade 8. At that time, his claims for a tuition grant should be carefully reviewed by you and by the Principal and a recommendation with respect to his future sent forward to the Department. I feel confident that in the interests of the boy himself this is the proper course to pursue.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Director.\n\nDr. T. J. Orford,\nIndian Agent,\nMOOSE FACTORY,\nOntario.\nDecember 16/44\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey;\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that a Mr. R. A. Reesor, of Toronto, is trying to persuade the father of Jimmy Sutherland, #125, (a pupil in this school) to allow this boy to go and live in Toronto with Mr. Reesor, or his parents. He says that the boy will receive the benefit of a better education etc. No doubt you may have heard of the situation. The boy is apparently clever enough to profit from a good education and under ordinary circumstances I would be very happy to have a suitable occasion for this lad to profit from such an opportunity.\n\nMr. Reesor was on the staff here for about three months, and knowing the circumstances as I do, I do not think it would be in the best interests of this boy to allow him to proceed to Toronto to live with this man. Mr. Reesor is a \"Conscientious Objector\". That in itself may not be an objectionable feature. However, I have been given to understand that he is a member of the above group who are instrumental in propagating ideas with regard to loyalty which may be classed as anti British. I would like to suggest that before any decision is made to allow Jimmy Sutherland to go to this man in Toronto that someone from the Indian Dept. investigate this man's standing with the R.C.M.P. in Ottawa. I think you will find that they are keeping rather a close check on him.\n\nI wanted you to have this information so that whatever is done will be according to your wishes in the matter.\n\nDr. Orford has never mentioned the matter to me in any way whatever. I have seen a letter which Dr. Orford wrote to the father of Jimmy Sutherland on the subject in which he recommended that the boy be allowed to leave this school for the purpose of going with Mr. Reesor. Incidentally the father of this boy is a Veteran Guard.\n\nThanking you for your kind interest in this matter. I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGilbert Thompson\nOttawa, December 15, 1944,\n\nDear Doctor Orford:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of December 7th and have noted with interest that Mr. Allan Reesor, employed for a time as teacher at the Anglican Residential School, is anxious to have one of the pupils, James Sutherland, Jr., proceed with his studies at Toronto.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that a somewhat similar request was received by this Branch from Mr. Reesor about a year ago.

Gilbert Thompson,\nIndian Residential School,\nNocose Factory, Ont.\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nRe: File 103-44. Letter Dec. 1/44\n\nI have written to the Deputy Minister of Education in Toronto regarding the supplying of powdered milk for Moosonee School children. When his reply is received I will advise you.\n\nThe Moosonee P.S. in the month of September had 19 Indian children on the register. The aggregate attendance for the 19 School days was 192 with only 5 of the above pupils starting on time. Each of these 5 pupils attended 17 days and were absent 2 days. Eight pupils who started late in the month had perfect attendance records from the time of their beginning.\n\nThe other 6 pupils were all late beginners and had the following attendance records\u2014present 11 absent 3; present 7 absent 2 (3); present 5 absent 1; present 10 absent 2.\n\nOf these 19 pupils four went away at the end of September with their parents and are still on the trap lines; three others attended a few days in October then left for the bush with their parents; one was removed from School to Hospital after seven days; and the other ten who were regular attendants had an aggregate of 196 days in a 21 day School month with an aggregate absence of only 14 days.\n\nIn November there were 22 School days and there were 10 Indian pupils on the register. Six of these had perfect attendance records for 22 days. One child released from Hospital 3 days late had perfect attendance of 19 days. One child was present 20, absent 2; one present 16, absent 6; and the tenth was classed as 3 days present 19 absent but was under my care in Hospital for all of those 19 days.\n\nThe average of attendance is of course brought down by those on the register who go to School only when their parents are at Moosonee and who spend most of the School year in the bush. Those pupils who live at Moosonee all year have an attendance record over 90% which is equal to that of the white children.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDr. T.J. Goddard\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6486, file 42044-3, part 1)\nDear Mr. Hoey;\n\nThank you very much for your letter of Dec. 23rd., together with a copy of your letter of Dec. 13th., relative to Mr. A. Reesor wanting to take one of the pupils of this school to his home in Toronto.\n\nI feel that your decision in this matter is an exceedingly wise one, and am grateful that you are satisfied that the child is better here. Under some circumstances I would have been happy to have seen this lad take advantage of a good opportunity, but I do not consider that it would be to his advantage to have gone to Mr. Reesor. I think Dr. Orford should have realized that too.\n\nWould it be possible for you to drop me a line sometime advising me what is the Government's policy for the Indians. Is it that they should continue indefinitely as Wards of the Government or is it that eventually they should become citizens of the country. To which of these ends should we in the Residential Schools be preparing the Indian children who come to us?\n\nThanking you again for your kindness in advising me re the above pupil and looking forward to hearing from you again.

It is gratifying to note that the action taken by the Branch with respect to Mr. Reesor's request was satisfactory to you.\n\nWith respect to the question contained in the penultimate paragraph of your communication, I can state without hesitation that the policy of the Government for half a century or more has been to so arrange its educational and general welfare program in a manner that will encourage the Indian population to accept increasingly the duties and responsibilities of democratic citizenship, and there are few that would dispute that this must, in the very nature of things, be the Indian's goal.\n\nI am sending forward two or three Branch reports which, I trust, will be of interest to you, and the study of which will give you a fairly clear insight into what the Government is attempting to do. In this connection, I may state that a Seminar Conference was held a few years ago at the University of Toronto. A very full discussion took place between officials from the United States Department of Indian Affairs, Washington, and the officials of this Department with respect to Indian policy and objectives in Indian policy. A report of this Conference was later published by the University of Toronto Press and I feel sure you would find the report interesting and very helpful. It is altogether likely that a copy could be secured for you either by Canon Dixon or Dr. Alderwood.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Director.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6486, file 42044-3, part 1)\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nJanuary 10, 1945\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nJames Bay Indian Agency\n\nVOTE 76\n\nALLOTMENT\n\nSHIP TO Mrs. W.

Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Department,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI would like you to send me a copy of the letter which went from your offices recently to Dr. Orford and the Rev. Gilbert Thompson both of Moose Factory; with reference to my past work among the Indians, and with particular reference to former attempts on my part to remove an Indian boy from the school at Alberni for training and education in a white community. There was also, I understand, information in the letter apparently based on communications from a United Church minister.\n\nIt is not unreasonable for me to ask for a copy of this letter, and therefore I shall expect it in reply at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAllen Raymer Reesor\nCommunity Secretary\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nPURCHASE ORDER\n\nTO Geo.

Toronto, Ont.\n\nQUOTATION OF 27th inst.\n\nQUANTITY DESCRIPTION UNIT TOTAL\n\n250 lbs. Special vitaminized biscuits, prepared in accordance with formula and specifications accompanying previous Purchase Order No. 26180.\n\nSupplied in 10 boxes - 25 lbs. ea. 4.22 $55.00 Net\n\nPAYMENT TO BE MADE AND ATTACH RECEIPT TO INVOICE\n\nCERTIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 29 OF THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUE AND AUDIT ACT\n\nTO BE RETURNED TO HEAD OF BRANCH\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6486, file 42044-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, January 25, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Rossor:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of January 23rd, in which you ask for a copy of the letter sent by this Branch to the Indian Agent at Moose Factory, Dr. Orford, in which we dealt with your request to provide instruction for an Indian boy in Toronto.\n\nI regret to state that I am unable, under existing regulations, to accede to this request. Official letters or letters dealing with Departmental business cannot be released by Departmental officials. In the case of official letters relating to public issues, these can be tabled at any time on motion of a Member of the House of Commons, and when so tabled become accessible to the Press. In the case of inter-departmental correspondence, however, or letters that go to Indian Agents, or Principals in charge of Residential Schools, these have invariably been looked upon as private or confidential communications. Motions from time to time to have them tabled have always been rejected by the House.\n\nI can assure you, however, that in my letter to Dr. Orford dated December 12th, 1945, there was no reference whatever to your past work among the Indians, nor was there any reference to information received by me or by any other official of the Department from a United Church minister. Your request was refused on the grounds that during the past two or three years we were called upon to make provision for two or three Indian pupils who had been taken by teachers and ex-teachers to their homes in Canadian cities. In our letter we stated:\n\n\"Those teachers, prompted no doubt by sympathy and interest in the pupil, took on an obligation\n\n.....that they\nthat they simply could not fulfill. Indian pupils removed from their environment and from contact with their relatives invariably become dissatisfied.\"\n\nWe expressed the view also that James Sutherland should continue to attend the Residential School at Moose Factory until he had completed Grade 8; at which time his claims for a tuition grant would be carefully and sympathetically reviewed by the Department. In this connection, you will be interested to learn that the Appropriation from which tuition grants are paid, which is passed annually by Parliament, has never been exhausted at any time during the eight years that I have occupied a position in this Branch. It has never seemed to me reasonable, therefore, that private citizens should be called upon to make provision for Indian pupils anxious to proceed with high school courses. I have never at any time doubted for a moment your interest for Indian pupils and in their welfare. There was nothing personal in the decision reached with respect to this particular boy. It was based on our experience with other somewhat similar cases and was made in the belief that it was in your own interest and in the interest of the boy himself.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Director.\n\nAllen Rayner Beeson, Esq.,\nY.M.C.A.,\n301 Vaughan Street,\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba.\nOttawa, February 2, 1945.\n\nDr. T.J. Orford, Indian Agent, Moose Factory, Ont.\n\nI desire to refer to your letters of December 19, 1944, and January 10, 1945. The biscuits have been ordered from the George Weston Company, Limited, and a copy of the purchase order is enclosed, for your information.\n\nIn your letter of December 19 you gave specific information regarding the attendance of Indian children at the Moosonee School. I would appreciate it if you would let me know the number enrolled and the number of days each of them attended during the months of December 1944 and January 1945. In future, similar information should be provided at the end of each month.\n\nEncl.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, February 28, 1945.\n\nDr. T. J. Orford, Indian Agent,\nMoose Factory, via Moosonee, Ont.\n\nWe are in receipt of the accounts which you recently submitted, covering the cost of the biscuits purchased from Weston, Limited, to be used at the Moosonee Public School. Please let me know if the provincial authorities have carried out their promise to supply powdered milk.\n\nI would also like a reply, at your earliest convenience, to my letter of February 8, in regard to the attendance of Indian children at the Moosonee Public School for the month of December 1944 and the month of January 1945. As we have now reached the end of February, you might also include the figures for that particular month.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| QUANTITY | TYPE OF PACKAGE | DESCRIPTION OF GOODS | WEIGHT | PRICE |\n|----------|----------------|----------------------|--------|-------|\n|          |                | TO FREIGHT CHARGES -  |        |       |\n|          |                | TORONTO TO MOOSONEE, ONT.|    |       |\n|          |                | SHIPMENT FORWARDED    |        |       |\n|          |                | FEB. 3, 1945          |        |       |\n|          |                | W.

Armstrong.\nRe. Lawrence Cheechoo.\n\nThe above mentioned Indian Youth of Eastmain, Moose Factory, Ont., age 22 years, has been discharged from Weston Sanitorium after having spent about 3 years there. During this time he had worked hard and has made every effort to improve his education, having been under the tuition of resident teacher in the Hospital. He is most anxious to improve his education and has asked if there is anything that the Department can do to advance his education. In order that I may be conversant with his present standing, I sent him over to Moosonee to interview the Principal of the Public School and received the following report:\n\nStanding Grade VIII\nAptitude Good\nReasoning Good\nI.Q. A-plus for Grade VIII.\n\nAs Lawrence is most anxious to further his education, I would suggest a business course, since at his advanced years the General Course would be too costly and he would be too old before it would be completed. With a business course he may make a good Grade 1 or perhaps a grade II Clerk.\n\nAny advice or suggestion that you have have in assisting such cases as this will be appreciated.\n\nJ.

Allan,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nMoose Factory, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 3rd instant regarding Lawrence Cheechoo.\n\nIt is not our usual practice to allow tuition grants to persons as old as the man just mentioned. I note that you state that a Business Course would be suitable for him. I presume that it would be impossible to take this course in your immediate district and if he was sent to an outside centre, it would be rather expensive not only for the course but for his maintenance.\n\nI suggest that you communicate with the Department of Education in Toronto with a view to ascertaining whether they have any correspondence courses that would be of value to Mr. Cheechoo. If so, we would be prepared to pay the cost of the course.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nPP/HH.\nMONTHLY DAY SCHOOL RETURN\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nReport of Morinooe No.1 Morinooe Indian Day School\u2014Month ending 31 Oct 1948\nJames Bay Agency Red Wallam Teacher's P.O.

He was quite interested in his studies while here. If he could receive further education he might be made into a useful Indian. I feel that he should be placed in a school where he could get further education.

J. Morrison, Doherty, Ont., near North Bay, Ont. I arranged transportation for this boy and requested Mrs. Morrison to advise me when he reached Doherty and was in her care. To date, I have heard nothing from Mrs. Morrison and your letter intimating that he has been discharged to the home of his Aunt in Doherty is the first notification received in this office.\n\nThe Superintendent of the Beck Memorial Sanatorium advises that this boy completed his public school work and has been recommended for his Entrance. I believe that this boy has made a request that he continue with his studies at the home of his Aunt and is very anxious to continue with his education.\n\nHe was admitted to the Sanatorium in July 1944, and he may have been hospitalised at Moosonee or Moose Factory for sometime prior to that date, and we cannot find any record in this office as to whether or not he attended school and what grade he had reached prior to his admission.\nIt would be appreciated if you would advise if this boy is enrolled in High School and furnish particulars as to school and location in order that I may follow his progress.\n\nJ.S.Allan\nSuperintendent\nJames Bay Indian Agency\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6486, file 42044-3, part 1)\nOctober 7, 1949.\n\nMr. Wm.

J. Morrison, Doherty, Ontario. I have been unable to locate any post office called Doherty in the 1949 edition of the Canadian Almanac.\n\nWe would appreciate it if you would let us have more definite information regarding the boy's present residence, and also any information you might have regarding the grade he has reached in Elementary School.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

A few days afterwards I wrote to Mr. Coffey of St. Peters, the dealer who supplied coal last year and asked him to supply the above named school. Mr. Coffey was rather slow in informing me that he had discontinued the coal business, while I, in the meantime thought that the fuel was supplied, with the result that it was not until November 21st. that I had our Departmental truck take 3 tons from Sydney and deliver it to the school. More will follow as soon as possible.\n\nRegarding kindling wood, knowing that the supply delivered from local sources last year was not very satisfactory to the teacher, I had our truck deliver a load from our sawmill on November 22nd.\n\n[Signature]\nF.B.

This undoubtedly is the reason why the electricity costs are so much higher in his residence. Mr. McKinnon has had several discussions with Father Ross regarding the excess cost of electricity for his residence. Father Ross now wants to heat his hot water tank from his kitchen oil-burning range. This will mean the moving of the hot water tank from its present location in the cellar up to a place in the kitchen near the range. I informed Father Ross that he must not make any further changes or alterations in his residence without authority from Ottawa.\n\nWhen this house was built provision was made to heat the water for domestic use by a coal-burning jacket heater in the cellar. Father Ross's only excuse for installing this unit was it required a lot of attention. I would suggest that orders be sent to Indian Agent McKinnon advising him to instruct Father Ross not to make any other changes or alterations in his building without first submitting the same through the Indian Agent's office to headquarters for approval.

Christmas Island, N.S.\n\nCopy of your letter of the 24th July listing 1947-48 fuel requirements for your Agency was forwarded to the Purchasing Agent and the quantity requested in that letter has been ordered, also 18 tons for the R.C.M.P. Residence which may not be required.\n\nIn your requisition of the 14th August, you reduced the quantity from 74 to 56 tons for the Agency and increased requirements for the school. This requisition was not forwarded to the Purchasing Agent as it was received too late.\n\nAn accountable advance of $50.00 will be forwarded in the course of a few days to cover freight on the Agency fuel. This advance must be accounted for as soon as possible. Money for freighting the school coal will be taken care of by Schools Branch. Kindly forward separate vouchers for the Agency coal - vote 511 - coal for the schools - 516.\n\nIn making up 1948-49 fuel requirements kindly follow instructions contained in letter of the 23rd July 1947.\n\nDirector\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6486, file 42050-2, part 2)\nCopy for Mr. Phelan\n\nAug. 21/47\n\nAs per instructions of: F.B.

It had no effect.\n\nThe agency clerk, store manager, R.C.M.P., est., Fr. Ross and myself have our water heated more than satisfactorily by our kitchen range at practically no cost. Note the difference in the invoices. The Sisters are not wasteful, but the system is too large (90 gal. domestic water tanks and heated electrically by 3000 watts). Note the difference in the cost of electricity to the Principal's residence since the electric water heater has been removed.\n\nI will make another recommendation the subject of a separate letter shortly.\n\nP.B.

December 30, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Res., Ottawa.\n\nWhen I was making arrangements to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mrs. Elsie Basque who taught school on this reservation, I was asked by the applicant, our present teacher, to furnish her with information re the number of pupils and the highest grade to be taught. I took the matter up with Mrs. Basque and was informed that the highest grade attending school was grade five. On the strength of this she accepted the position and reported for duty. A few weeks later a young girl of this reservation, Annie Marr, aged 16, who had been working in Halifax, returned home and began attending school. She is in Grade 8 and insists on attending school. The teacher claims she is unable to handle this grade due to the change in teaching methods and the new subjects on the present day curriculum. The parents of the child claim that provision should be made for the continuation of her studies. The teacher offered to resign but no successor can be found.\n\nWhile in Halifax this girl worked at St. Mary's Convent and while there arranged with the Sister Superior to allow her to attend the school in the afternoon. Thus she would work in the morning, go to school in the afternoon and work and study in the evenings. The girl and her parents claim she is determined to become a teacher. I asked the Superior for her opinion of her and was told she had both ability and determination. I interviewed Mrs. Basque her former teacher, and was told in confidence that Annie Marr, while attending the day school on the reserve, was just an ordinary student, having no great amount of ability or\n\nP.T.O.\nambition. I have talked to the girl who seems determined to be a teacher, and to continue her studies. I pointed out to her that if her case, beginning grade 8 at the age of 16 would have her in high school at the age of twenty or more which is three or four years older than the average. At the end of our interview she still appeared to be determined to become a teacher.\n\nThe parents claim that provisions should be made by the Department for her continuation in school. They are unable to do so as they have a large family and could not meet the expense of boarding her anywhere to attend another school. Shubenacadie village school is five miles distant and out of the question. The residential school is filled to capacity and would not solve the problem as any students of promise from that institution attend the village school after completing Grade 8.\n\nSt. Mary's convent in Halifax (Sisters of Charity) would board her and allow her to attend the convent school for $4.00 per week. This is what the parents desire and would like the Department to pay for. The school in question is a public school and the curriculum is identical with all public schools of the province. I might add that this girl's sister reached grade ten and was a good student. Her mother, an Indian by birth, was a teacher in Prince Edward Island prior to her marriage.\n\nI am anxious that every Indian boy or girl showing promise should be encouraged to further their studies. They are and will be needed here in the future. Our former teacher Mrs. Basque is a very fine type of woman and quite capable as a teacher. It is unfortunate that this girl could not continue on here until grade ten or so but that appears impossible. In this case I would recommend that this family be assisted until the end of this teaching year, June 1944, by the Department meeting the boarding charges of $4.00 per week. At the end of that time I will interview her teachers in Halifax and ascertain if this pupil shows ability and ambition enough to justify the continuation of the suggested arrangement.\n\nPlease advise.\n\nH. C. Rice,\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs (rg 10 Volume 6486, file 42051-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, January 4, 1944.\n\nMr. H. C. Rice, Indian Agent, Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nRe: Annie Marr.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of December 30, written by you on behalf of the marginally-noted Indian girl.\n\nThe parents of this girl should be told that the Department is under no statutory obligation to provide instruction for Indian pupils who have reached the age of 16 years. Despite this fact, an attempt is made by this Branch from year to year to help a limited number of pupils who have been exceptionally successful in their elementary courses and who have won creditable marks in their Entrance examinations. This girl is, as you say, somewhat old to begin a course of high school study at this time and her fitness to become a teacher at any time should be discussed with a competent educationist, preferably the public school inspector for the district. In view of her anxiousness to succeed, however, the Department is prepared to pay for her tuition at the St. Mary's Convent at Halifax until the end of the present academic year. At that time her case should be very carefully and sympathetically reviewed and a specific recommendation with respect to her sent forward to the Department at that time.\n\nIt is a matter of extreme regret that the teacher now in charge of the day school on the reserve is incapable of providing instruction above Grade 5. It seems scarcely worth while to keep a teacher employed who is so lacking in the necessary qualifications. It would be appreciated, therefore, if you could at the earliest date recommend a qualified teacher for that position.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nExtract from Indian Agent Rice's report on the Shubenacadie Indian Agency for the period October, 1943, to January, 1944, inclusive.\n\nThis year from the Truro Indian Day School there were two pupils sent into the town school doing their last year of Junior High. Their ability warranted more attention than the day school teacher could afford to give them and I arranged for their entrance. One has since been withdrawn and sent to St. Martha's T.B. Unit with moderately active T.B.; the other, because of family conditions, will not likely continue school much longer. The father of this pupil left his wife and six small children to fare for themselves. The boy, who is quite bright, has been offered work with a wood-working factory and has lost interest in school. An older sister of this boy is doing High School work in Truro, making a very good showing and is well thought of by her instructors.\nST.

I would like to recommend them for the Sacred Heart Academy at Meteghan, N.S. where their teacher (Mrs Basque) received her education.\n\nH.C.

As both these girls namely, Violet Mae Paul and Ruby Marie Howe have been very apt, studious and ambitious during their seven years at the Day School, I would like to request that other provisions be made by the Department of Indian Affairs to enable them to complete their education.\n\nOne, Violet Mae Paul began school at the age of nine, (no school was provided in Shubenacadie until 1939), and has proved herself a very studious and ambitious young lady leading her classes throughout. Violet is now interested in stenography.\n\nThe other Ruby Marie Howe began school at the same time. She too has been ambitious and industrious during her attendance at the Day School. She is now interested in nursing.\n\nAs their teacher I am greatly interested in their welfare and would like to have both of them given a chance to have their ambitions realized, but help from the Department is necessary.\n\nAs an Indian graduate of Sacred Heart Academy, Meteghan N.S., may I suggest that both these young ladies be sent there this coming school term of 1947-48, and be allowed to continue attending same until their education is completed?\n\nSacred Heart Academy is under the direction of the Sisters of Charity and I feel certain that these two pupils of mine would be welcome students there.\n\nI am enclosing a record of their examination marks at the half-year with the hope that you will approve of same and deem it worthy to recommend these two girls to the Department for aid in furthering their education.\n\nTrusting to receive a favourable reply at the earliest possible date,\n\nI am,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nElsie Charles Basque\n\nIndian Affairs (rg 10 Volume 6486, file 42051-3, part 1)\nOttawa, March 10th, 1947\n\nMr. H.C.

We are favourably disposed to granting her request but cannot make any definite promise to do so until we are assured that she passes her entrance examinations which, we presume, she will not write until the end of June.\n\nViolet Mae Paul wishes to take a stenography course. Evidently stenography is not taught at Sacred Heart Academy, Meteghan, N.S. If we allowed her a grant, where could she take the stenography course and what would be its cost? What provision would have to be made for her residence in some home or college where she would receive supervision during her spare time?\n\nIn her case too, we cannot make a final decision until we are advised that she has passed her entrance examinations to high school.\n\nBernard F.

S.\nOn Saint Mary's Bay\n\nTHE SACRED HEART ACADEMY on St. Mary's Bay is under the direction of the Sisters of Charity of Halifax, Nova Scotia. It affords to its pupils many advantages as regards healthfulness of situation.\n\nThe rules governing the Academy are simple and practical.\n\nThe Junior Classes embrace the necessary studies preparatory to High School Work.\n\nThe Senior Course embraces the studies of Four Years of High School. The Young Ladies who so desire may write the provincial examination in the Academy, since this is a legal examination station.\n\nBeside French and English which are taught in all the divisions, pupils may take a course in Latin.\n\nTERMS\n\nBoard and Tuition for School Year $250.00\nMusic extra $30.00\nDay Pupils $25.00\nGENERAL REGULATIONS\n\n1. The Academy is not responsible for money, jewelry, etc., unless deposited in the office.\n\n2. Pupils are forbidden to use matches, candles, no other but electric lights to be used.\n\nPupils are not to appropriate or make use of anything belonging to another pupil. Caps, coats, etc., not to be loaned without permission of Sister in charge.\n\nBefore admitting new pupils references from reliable source are requested. The record of the present scholarship of each pupil entering must also be shown.\n\nVisits home will be permitted at Thanksgiving Christmas vacation\u2014two weeks, from Holy Thursday until 7 p.m. Easter Monday. Parents are earnestly requested not to ask to have their children go home at other times nor to take them out for automobile drives. Pupils who do not go home on free days will not be allowed to visit the homes of their friends.\n\nBooks, Stationery and Medicines form extra charges. Pupils are requested to provide, if possible, their own supply of stationery, stamps, etc., also to bring their sewing, crocheting, knitting materials, etc.\n\nThe Scholastic Year is divided into four terms or sessions, each payable in advance.\n\nThe opening dates of each session are as follows:\n\nSeptember 8th. February 1st.\nNovember 15th. April 15th.\n\nUnless a pupil's financial accounts have been satisfactorily settled before the opening of a new scholastic year she will not be received the year following.\n\nWe request the parents not to interfere with the regular work of the school, by withdrawing their children even for a few hours while the Academy is in session. Such interruptions usually lower the pupils in their classes, lessen their interest in school work and render them unhappy, because boarding-school rules appear to them too strict. We expect the parents to co-operate with us in observing the Academy rules which have been formed for the betterment of their children.\nSacred Heart Academy,\nWolfeboro, N.H.\nMarch 17, 1947.\n\nMrs. Elsie Charles Basque\nSt. Johnsbury, N.H.\n\nDear Mrs. Basque,\n\nI just received your letter telling me the ambitions of these two girls. Yes, I'll gladly accept them for Grade IX.\n\nWe do not offer Business Courses here. Before a pupil can take a Business Course, she should have her Grade XI Certificate.\nAny girl who wishes to take typewriting may do so if she wishes to pay $1 extra for the year. Any girl who wishes to take music may do so. The cost is 50 cents per lesson. Some pupils take two lessons a week, others one.\n\nI am enclosing a prospectus which contains all the information you need.\n\nShould the Department agree with these terms and you kindly let me know, so that I can put the names of these two girls on the list for 1947-1948.\n\nAssuming that you are well and are still doing good work with your class, I am\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nSister Juliana\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nApril 23rd, 1947\n\nIndian Affairs Branch;\nOttawa., Ont.\n\nRe: Violet M.

The Sacred Heart Academy at Meteghan, N.S., does not teach Nursing or Stenography. These would have to be taught at special schools. The cost of grades 9, 10 & II with board & tuition for these girls would be much cheaper at the Meteghan School than at any other I know of in this province.\n\nAs soon as their examinations are completed and papers marked I will forward you copies of same.\n\nH.G.

It might be pointed out that they are the only Indian girls in these Institutions and it speaks very highly of their former teacher, Mrs. Elsie Basque, of this Reserve. She deserves much credit for the fine way she prepared these girls for their later studies, for without the proper background they could never attempt to attain the record they have.\n\nIt is learned from correspondence with the respective Superior's in charge of these Institutions, that these girls are upright and ladylike as well as being intelligent and studious. We here are very proud of these girls, and I am sure this pride...\nwill be shared with those at Departmental Headquarters whose interest and foresight made it possible for these girls to further their studies. It appears now that these girls have the honour not to break the trust that was placed in them and it is recommended that when the time comes for these girls to further their education, the same interest and co-operation will be extended.\n\n(H.

S.\n\nMarie HOWE, Viola PAUL, Tuition Grant,\nSacred Heart Academy,\nMETEGHAN, N. S.\n\nApplication is hereby made for tuition grants in the amount of $250.00 each, for the captionally noted Indian girls who have been attending the Convents as above indicated during the past academic year.\n\nMarie Howe and Viola Paul were in Grade IX during the past year and graduated with high standing in the school; Miss Paul leading her class and Miss Howe coming second. Copies of their marks are attached hereto for your information.\n\nIsabel Knockwood was taking her Junior Matriculation at Saint Joseph's Convent, Maboo, N. S. Her marks during the year were highly satisfactory and at the 1st and 2nd quarter examinations, led her class. In view of the fact that she was taking Junior Matriculation, it was necessary for her to write Provincial examinations and the result will not be known before around August 17th or 18th. However, it is felt by her teachers that she will pass these examinations with a high rating. As Miss Knockwood is only 17 years of age and is desirous to enter the nursing profession (minimum age 18) she has requested that she be given the opportunity to return to the Convent to take her Senior Matriculation. Otherwise, she would have to remain idle for one year awaiting the minimum age at which she could be admitted as a trainee in any of the local hospitals.\n\nIndian Affairs (rg 10 Volume 6486, file 42051-3, part 1)\nMiss Paul intends to complete her Junior Matriculation and take a business course. Miss Howe intends to continue her studies with a view to entering the nursing profession.\n\nIn view of the fine record established by all these girls, it is strongly recommended that this application for tuition grants of $250 each be given favourable consideration.\n\nIt is also strongly recommended that the $75.00 for clothing allowance which was allowed these girls last year, be again granted in order that they may be properly clothed for the academic year.\n\n(H.

It is felt the parents should be sufficiently interested to give some assistance in providing clothing for the girls.\n\nBernard F.

Neary, M.B.E.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont., Canada.\n\nRe: Miss Theresa Bradford,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\n\nThe captionally noted Indian girl who resides on the Shubenacadie Indian Reserve, has been attending the High School in the village of Shubenacadie some five miles distance for the last two years. She is at present in Grade eleven and we have been advised by her teacher that if her attendance were more punctual she would experience no difficulty in obtaining her junior matriculation this year.\n\nThis girl walks a distance of ten miles every day in order to attend school and it is felt that if it were possible to have her board at the Indian Residential School, Shubenacadie, N.S. which is only a distance of one mile from the high school, she would devote more time to her studies and would also enable her to be more punctual in her attendance. I might say that this girl has a lot of ambition and intends to enter a Nursing School next year and it is strongly recommended that the Department assist her in every way to help her obtain her junior matriculation which is necessary before entering an accredited school for Nurses.\nMrs. Mary Bradford, mother of this girl, is a widow who receives a pension in the amount of $25.75 a month from her son who is a TB patient at the D.V.A. hospital, Cornwallis, N.S. It is very seldom that Mrs. Bradford requests any assistance from the Indian Affairs Branch and manages her small pension in such a way that she manages to get by, as far as groceries and clothing for herself is concerned. However, in view of the fact that her daughter Theresa is attending school, it is necessary that the girl be presentable at all times. She has requested that a winter coat, two dresses and a sweater be purchased for her daughter the cost to be borne by the Indian Affairs Branch. This amount would entail an expenditure of approximately $50.00, and it is strongly recommended that the necessary authority be granted for local purchase of the articles mentioned herein.\n\nI personally feel, in view of the circumstances and the ambition shown by this girl that we should do everything in our power to assist her in realizing her ambition to become a nurse.\n\nI trust this request will meet favourable consideration.\n\nH.G.

B.\n\nI have a letter from the janitor at the Red Rock School, complaining about the condition of the wood. She states that there is no dry wood and consequently she is having considerable trouble in starting the fire. Is it not possible to secure a small quantity of dry wood for this purpose?\n\nShe also mentions that the amount we allow her for janitor services is too small. Would you recommend an increase and, if so, let me know how much.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, OTTAWA, Ont.\n\nI have for acknowledgement your letter of March 19, 1946, having reference to the wood supply at Red Bank Indian Day School.\n\nFor your information I might say that I have had considerable difficulty with wood both at Red Bank and El Ground during the present year. At Red Bank it so happens there are no saw mills operating during the summer months and consequently we were unable to procure wood until the mills above Red Bank started cutting in the fall with the result that the wood supply was not as dry as it should have been. The high prices prevailing for lumber products has caused those who formerly cut hardwood to abandon this type of wood for the time being.\n\nI hope to visit Red Bank shortly and shall try and have Mrs. Watt provided with enough kindling wood to finish the present term.\n\nIn reference to the second paragraph of your letter I would say that Mrs. Watt is a very good janitor and I would recommend that beginning April 1st., 1946 I would recommend that Mrs. Mary Jane Watt be paid at the rate of $75.00 per year. I would also recommend that Mr. Adelin LeBlanc janitor at Big Cove School and Miss Delphine Murphy janitress at El Ground School be both raised to the same level. This would put all janitors in this Agency on the same basis.\n\nI would also request authority to purchase wood for the four schools in the Agency as shortly after the beginning of the next fiscal year as it is possible to procure same.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 1, 1946.\n\nMr. A.

The Indians don't insist that they surprise me to go to the high school for just three.\nyears now. But when the time comes they say no. Wait till next year so I'll right for going. And again they promise me to go this year. They told me your going start in September. (Apple) Indian staff will pay the expenses. But they didn't send me. They told me to your not going school you not going any farther. So I went to school. And I'm going school yet. Start at Pangford once course. I pay the sum of $2.50. But that course I don't send anything interest.\nBut I thought I'd better write to you. Perhaps you could send me in the convict. I would like to go this time coming in January. I'm in Grade 10 for past three years. I would like to go further. But Indian Affairs say I'm a student finish Grade 8 in Residential School, they usually send them in High School. But they didn't send me in no place. They just promise. Must tell me your going next year.\nI would much appreciate if I could go this year. Because I'm young, quick and clever. I'm very sure. And I am very smart for my studies. I'd like to attend Indian Affairs. I don't know how many times. He just told me I'm going to be admitted. But I suppose he didn't write. Because I'm writing to Department. I think the Department wouldn't refuse the girl like me. I think he just take me like a fool. But if you willingly to send me in the interest and promise that you're\nwillingly to pay the expenses\nyou wrote about to send\nthe remittance to him. Maybe\nhe isn't going and the\nletter will go. If your\nchild all right & could\ngo to court. Just let\nme know immediately.\nI'll be ready by\nJanuary. And I'll let\nyou know which agent\nthat I'm going into.\nDon't forget your\nremittance, send it a little\ntime. You willingly to\nsend me.

Marsereau, Newcastle, N.B., for educational books supplied to Marie Ginish, of the Sel Ground Reserve, and trust that you will be able to pass the account for payment.\n\nWith regard to this matter and how it happened that I ordered those books without your authority, I beg to inform you that when visiting the Sel Ground Reserve, this girl who is just through the Sel Ground day school, asked me if the Dept. would supply her with these books, as she was taking a correspondence course supplied by the N.B. Provincial Board of Education. So after consulting with the teacher of the Sel Ground school who is helping her with the lessons of the course, I decided to order the books without the delay of writing you. I trust that you can pass the account for payment as it is all the extra expense that I will recommend in this case.\n\nWith regard to this matter Marie Ginish had previously asked me to have her sent to the convent or Ladies college for more education, but I never took the matter up with you, as I did not think it advisable.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6486, file 42055-3, part 4)\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th., instant File 105-55 referring to Miss Marie Ginish, North West Bridge, N.B., applying for assistance to enable her to obtain higher education. In reply I wish to inform you that this girl has asked me to have her enter a convent for more education, but I informed her that the Department could not afford to pay for such a course at the present time. She seemed satisfied when I told her this, but asked me if she could have a few books\u2014a Myers History, Effective English, Prose No. 3, as she is taking a correspondence course supplied by the Provincial Dept., of Education at Fredericton, N.B. She is paying for this course herself.\n\nWith regard to these books the cost is $3.65, and I gave her the order to get them and I trust that the Department can pay this small amount, as I am submitting the bill today.\n\nWith further regard to this matter Marie Ginish is 16 years old, has attended the El Ground Indian Day school, and is in the 8th., grade; she is a very bright pupil and anxious, at the present time, to have more education, but I cannot recommend that it is advisable to expend much money to supply Indians with education beyond the 8th. grade. From my experience I find that it is an absolute waste of money, as there are a few Indians belonging to this agency that have taken courses at a university, and they are certainly not any more progressive than the others.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept., of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nDraw cheque in favour of Secretary-Treasurer,\nDorchester Superior School,\nand send to:\nADDRESS: Mrs. J.

She has asked me to write you and let you know that she is graduating. She also spoke of your arranging for her to take a Business Course.\n\nDorothy is a good, conscientious student with considerable ability. Her home atmosphere has not been one conducive to study of the nature required in Grade XI. However she has done good work and deserves much credit and encouragement. Her conduct is always splendid.\n\nI know you will use all your influence to obtain for her a position after she completes her Business Course. If we can obtain good positions for these Indians who are well educated it would be an inspiration for the others to get a higher standard of education. It seems there should be vacancies at Ottawa in the Department dealing with Indian affairs to be opened to Indians.\n\nI shall be glad to give Dorothy a recommendation at any time.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6486, file 42055-3, part 4)\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith attached letter received from Mr. Lawrence Rainesboro, Principal of the Dorchester Superior School re Dorothy Bernard of the Fort Wolly band, and would ask if there would be any chance of the Department paying for a short business course for this girl immediately after she finishes school on June 30th.\n\nI have no recommendation to make in this case other than this is an unusually bright girl and her prospects are very good for a position in one of the railway offices down here if she should get this course. Mr. Rainesboro mentions that the Department might have a vacancy at Ottawa for a girl like this, but I do not expect that at all; she may as I have already said, get a position nearer home now during war time at least.\n\nPlease let me know as to what you think about the matter, in order that I can tell Miss Bernard, as I promised I would write you about her case.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nyour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 30, 1942.\n\nRe: Dorothy Bernard.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 25th instant and also a communication received by you from the Principal of the Dorchester Superior School, sent forward therewith.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could send forward an estimate of the cost of the business course referred to in both these communications.

They entitle our students to receive tuition in any or all departments of our college. These are our rates: 1 month, $16.00; 3 months, $45.00.\n\nOUR GUARANTEE\n\nWe absolutely guarantee that after you have paid us one month's tuition, and have spent the month in attendance at the school, if you are not satisfied with the instruction we are giving you, we will cheerfully and promptly refund your money.\n\nIt is understood that this guarantee is good not only for the first month that a student may be in attendance, but for any succeeding month.\n\nIt is further understood that if a student after spending one month, continues for a second month, this action on his part is to be taken as signifying that the first month was quite satisfactory. This guarantee will then apply to the second month, and so on from month to month the student is entitled to the benefit of this guarantee.\n\nSome guarantees are useless because of the conditions attached. The only condition attached to the above guarantee is that the student gives our school a fair trial by attending a full month. And that is only fair.\n\nWe believe that a school preparing young people for business should be judged by the standards prevailing in the business world. All big business today is done on the \"money-back\" principle.\n\nWe know that our work measures up to the most exacting test. If we cannot satisfy you, we want no money.\n\nIf you are interested in a school which replaces vague promises with an absolute guarantee, you will be interested in the Success Business College.\n\nBOARD\n\nWe shall secure you a comfortable boarding place at a reasonable price. We shall also meet you upon your arrival in the city and direct you to your boarding place if you desire.\n\nBOOKS AND SUPPLIES\n\nThe cost of books and supplies will depend upon the subjects taken. These may be obtained at the College and are furnished to students at reasonable rates.\n\nNIGHT SCHOOL RATES\n\n1 month (payable on entering) ... $7.00\n4 months (payable on entering) ... $25.00\n6 months (payable on entering) ... $35.00\n\nThis cost entitles the student to take any or all subjects.\n\nWe train and place in positions more young people than all other business colleges in New Brunswick combined.\n\nMAIL COURSES\n\nComplete Commercial .................. $90.00\nBookkeeping and Business Practice .... 65.00\nBusiness Letter-writing and Follow-up Systems ......................... 35.00\nArithmetic ....... 25.00 Typewriting .... 30.00\nPenmanship ....... 20.00 Advertising .... 75.00\nShorthand ......... 40.00 Salesmanship .... 75.00\n\nA SUCCESS COURSE\n\nYou are paying for a Success course. Perhaps you didn't know that before, and perhaps you don't believe it even now. \"Impossible!\" you say, without stopping to think; \"I surely can't be paying for something I never bought.\" Yes, you are. You are paying for it in the salary you do not get, in the business you do not build, in the prestige you do not possess.\n\nAnything that you absolutely need you pay for whether you get it or not. You may say you are not paying for a Success course because you did not buy it. If you had bought it and taken it, you would not have to pay for it. It would pay for itself.\n\nA Success Course is not an outlay, not an expenditure. It is an investment. It pays interest in actual money far beyond any other investment you can make. As it is, while not enrolled, you are paying for something you do not get. It is the part of wisdom to get what you pay for.\n\nENROLL NOW!\nOttawa,\nAugust 14, 1942.\n\nE.A.D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to Dorothy Bernard.

I might say that these children all seem to be making good progress and apparently like to attend the white school.\n\nThe reason for these families living near Bathurst, as far as I can find, and by what the Indians themselves say, is for the purpose of sending the children to school. Those families who are living near Bathurst seem to be of rather better type than the ordinary Mic-Mac.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nyour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6486, file 42055-3, part 4)\nOttawa,\nOctober 23, 1942.\n\nEX I.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to the Paul and Prisk children. I note that you state that these two families live on the Pabineau Reserve. On reviewing the 1939 census I note that no mention is made of any Indians living on that reserve. I would like to know at what work the heads of these families are employed. Would it not be possible to have them reside on one of the reserves in your Agency where day schools are located? When we provide day schools on settled reserves it is doubtful if the Department should be asked to pay for education of children at white schools. I also feel that, unless there are some strong reasons to the contrary, these families should be discouraged from living on the Pabineau Reserve. I should appreciate hearing further from you in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Chas. Hudson,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nRichibucto, N.B.\nOct. 23rd,\n1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just received your letter of the 19th instant File 103-55 referring to attendance report of two children named Prisk who have attended the Big River School, East Bathurst, N.B. In reply I beg to inform you that these are Indian children of Joseph Prisk who is a member of the Bathurst band, and resides on the Papineau Reserve. There is only a few members of the Bathurst band and of course there is no school at the reserve, and the nearest school to the part of the reserve on which Prisk resides, is the Big River School, at East Bathurst. I do not believe there is any less expensive way to school these children than to let them attend that school.\n\nWith regard to this being the first time such reports have been submitted, I believe that it is, but there have been Indian children attending schools near Bathurst for some years back, but apparently they did not think about asking for payment before, and as long as they were satisfied I did not say anything about it. However they became aware that the Department does pay for Indian children who attend white schools, and so applied to me for whatever amount the Department paid for such service. I then sent the proper forms for the report and trust that it was the proper thing to do.\n\nRegarding the work Jos. Prisk does, it is any kind of odd jobs he can pick up, such as work in the lumber woods, sometimes with white farmers, and does a little farming of his own on the reserve. He tried to enlist in the armed forces but could not pass the Medical Examination.\n\nP.S.

The cost to the Dept. would be $28.00 per month.

When Marie Ginnish entered the convent, the instructions of the Department, were that Miss Ginnish's tuition fee of $25.00 per month would be paid for a period of 8 months. This is stated in your letter of January 25, 1943, F.103-55.\n\nThe end of December 1943, will be the end of the eight month period for this girl to attend the convent. She is taking stenography and short-hand, and the convent advises me that she will not finish before the end of February, but that she will finish then. I have advised the convent that they must not expect payment of this girl's tuition fee until authority has been obtained from you. I would recommend that Marie Ginnish be allowed to finish her course, and the Department continue to pay the fee of $25.00 per month for board and tuition, until the end of February. The convent states that though Miss Ginnish is not particularly bright, she can successfully complete the course of study by the end of February 1944.\n\n[Signature]\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6486, file 42055-3, part 4)\nOttawa,\nJanuary 4, 1944.\n\nMr. F.J.

This amount is in connection with expenses incurred by Hubert Levi, of Big Cove Reserve when he attended this university. This expense was incurred in 1940, and when the bill was first sent to me, it was dated 1940, which is the year Levi finished his studies there. I returned the account and asked them to itemize it, and send receipt for money advanced Levi. I also informed this university that the account was long overdue, and that the Department may not pay it. I cannot make any recommendation in this case, but would rather refer to the discretion of the Department.\n\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 5, 1944.\n\nEXD.\n\nMr. F.J. Hudson, Acting Indian Agent, Richibucto, N.B.\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, enclosing an account in connection with the expenditures for the tuition of Hubert Levi. This account amounts to $11.25, of which $3.25 is for the transportation of the boy to his home and $8.00 for books, stationery etc.\n\nThe account for $8.00 was submitted to us under cover of the former Agent's letter dated June 21, 1940, and, in a letter dated June 25, 1940, he was advised that, as the full amount promised for this boy's tuition had already been paid, the Department was not prepared to consider paying an additional $8.00. The statement regarding the payments of this boy's tuition for the last year he attended St. Joseph's University was contained in our letter to the former Agent dated June 18, 1940.\n\nHowever, it has been our practice to pay transportation over and above the tuition grant and, if you will submit a voucher showing to what point the boy was returned and the exact railway fare to that point from St. Joseph's University, payment of that amount will be considered.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMarch 11th 1944\n\nTo Mr. Chs Hudson, Indian Agent,\nRichibouctou, Kent Co. N.B.\n\nSir,\n\nAll what I have on my records about that fare is that this money \u00a325 was advanced to Hubert Levi on his way home from St-Joseph to Richibouctou where he lived. If this is not sufficient, please tell me and I won't bother any more about this bill.\n\nTruly Yours,\n\n[Signature]\naccountant.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to: Universit\u00e9 St. Joseph,\n\nAddress: St. Joseph's University, N.B.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Mar 11 | For railway fare paid for Indian student of the Big Cove Reserve, as per statement attached. | 3 25   |\n\n---\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Florence Knockwood, Fort Folly Reserve, N.B.\nEducational Training.\n\nThis Agency office is in receipt of an application from Miss. Florence Knockwood, an Indian girl of the Fort Folly Reservation, for assistance in taking a business course. This girl who is 17 years old, has completed grade VIII and had spent some time in grade IX, when she left school in March 1947.\n\nTwo schools have been contacted for information regarding the business course they offer and both are reluctant to accept pupils with less than grade X training. However, one of them, the Robinson Business College at Moncton, N.B., is willing to take Miss. Knockwood, at any time on trial. This is not recommended because it is not felt that she would be able to master the course nor would it be desirable to send this girl to study where living accommodation would have to be found outside the school. It would be preferable to assist Miss. Knockwood to complete grades IX and X at the Superior School at Dorchester, N.B., which she attended formerly.\n\nMiss. Knockwood, has expressed the wish to attend the Robinson Business College, Moncton, N.B., and a suggestion that she return to the Dorchester Superior School in order to complete grades IX and X will not be well received by herself or by her father and no doubt will result in correspondence directly with the Indian Affairs Branch. Some guidance in the matter would be appreciated.\n\nE.J. Blakey\n(E. J. Blakey,) Supt.,\nN.B.

Box 58,\nRogersville, N.B.\n\nRe: Your File 55/25-6\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of August 11th enclosing applications for tuition grant for George Ginnish, Hubert Patles and John Ward.\n\nIt is noted that in each case the applicant has only obtained Grade 7 standing. It is understood that the 8th Grade is taught at the Nel Ground School, and the boys should continue to attend that school during the academic year 1949-50.\n\nIf they are successful in obtaining Grade 8 standing by the end of June 1950, we will be prepared to consider allowing them a tuition grant for the academic year 1950-51 at some outside college, provided both the teacher and yourself consider that they would take advantage of the opportunity then offered to them. It is not our practice to allow tuition grants at white schools until Grade 8 standing has been obtained.\n\nBernard F.

B.\nAugust 21, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Fuel for the Saint Mary's and Woodstock Indian Schools\n\nEnclosed you will find a tender which I obtained from Edward T. Moran regarding an oil burner for the Saint Mary's Indian School, also one for the Woodstock Indian School. Moran has burners on hand at the present time and the British American Oil Co. stated they will supply oil for these schools at 17\u00bd\u00a2 per gallon (subject to change in price).\n\nConsiderable difficulty has been experienced in the Devon School in getting a janitor, also in the Woodstock School. In the latter place a large quantity of wood has to be piled out of doors as the storing capacity in the basement is very small and the Indians steal a considerable amount of the wood outside.\n\nIf finances would warrant it I would recommend that oil burners be placed in both the Saint Mary's and Woodstock Schools.\n\nI would have requested permission to purchase these oil burners at an earlier date but it was only yesterday that the local dealer of the British American Oil Co. could assure me furnace oil would be available. May I hear from you regarding these at an early date.\n\nWood is available at $20.00 per cord.\n\nEdward J.

Moran regarding an oil burner for the Saint Mary's Indian School, also one for the Woodstock Indian School. Moran has burners on hand at the present time and the British American Oil Co. stated they will supply oil for these schools at 17\u00bd\u00a2 per gallon (subject to change in price).\n\nConsiderable difficulty has been experienced in the Devon School in getting a janitor, also in the Woodstock School. In the latter place a large quantity of wood has to be piled out of doors as the storing capacity in the basement is very small and the Indians steal a considerable amount of the wood outside.\n\nIf finances would warrant it I would recommend that oil burners be placed in both the Saint Mary's and Woodstock Schools.\n\nI would have requested permission to purchase these oil burners at an earlier date but it was only yesterday that the local dealer of the British American Oil Co. could assure me furnace oil would be available. May I hear from you regarding these at an early date.\n\nWood is available at $20.00 per cord.\n\nEdward J. Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nFredericton, N.

Whalen, Indian Agent,\nFredericton, N.B.\n\nWe wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 13th instant.\n\nThe Department approves an expenditure of $10.00 for wood for the Kingsclear Indian Day School. This $10.00 is to be expended in the following manner:\n\nCutting the wood - $5.00\nHauling the wood - $5.00.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRJB/MDG\nOttawa, January 29, 1948.\n\nE. J. Whalen,\nIndian Agent,\nFredericton, N.B.\n\nRe: Cutting of Fuel Wood for Schools and Cutting of Telephone Poles for Eskasoni\n\nI wish to inform you that in the course of the next few days you will receive two cheques, one for $600.00 from Administration Vote, to be used for the cutting of telephone poles which will be shipped to Eskasoni after the break-up next spring, and one for $250.00 to pay for the cutting of hardwood, at $4.00 per cord, for next year's heating of the Woodstock and Kingsclear schools.\n\nNote, the poles and the wood should be cut and yarded so that after the snow disappears the truck can be used to transport the poles to the ear and the wood to the schools concerned.\n\nI am sorry that additional funds are not available in the present fiscal year's estimates to make it possible to authorize you to cut a quantity of cedar for the manufacture of shingles. As soon as our new estimates have been approved, and if money is made available in time, cedar for shingles could be cut during the month of April or early in May.\n\nIf the amount of money sent to you is more than is required for the cutting of poles and wood, then you have authority to use the balance for the cutting of cedar for the shingle mill. While the amount being forwarded to you is not very large, it will give you an opportunity to provide some employment for those able-bodied Indians who are now out of work.\n\nDuring my last visit to your Agency, I discussed with you the advisability of sending in a voucher in favour of the Receiver General, to be credited to Welfare Vote, for\nthe payment of the number of shingles required to shingle the roof of the barn, at $7.00 per 1000. It is suggested that you submit such a voucher for 20,000 or 25,000 shingles, to Miss Walton who is in charge of the Administration Vote for the construction of buildings, and transfer the amount to the Welfare Vote which I hope will be returned to you so that you can cut an additional quantity of cedar for next year's shingle mill operation.\n\nJ.

Scott,\nPrince William, R.R.#2, dated April 13, 1948.\n\nThe above numbered voucher in favour of Walden L. Scott is for 2' furnace wood purchased for the Woodstock Indian Day School.\n\nIt cost about twice as much to heat the Woodstock School this year, as I had planned, and also twice as much as other years. Although Ray Hall appeared to be doing his best to supply this school with wood, the quality and quantity which he purchased locally was everything but satisfactory.\n\nWhen I visited the Woodstock School the first week in March, and saw such a small amount of wood after having been supplied with so much, I immediately told Mr. Hall to discontinue supplying wood to this school.\n\nOn my way from Woodstock I located three cords of nice old growth maple, beech, and yellow birch, which I purchased. I then had Departmental Truck No. 1105 haul this wood to the Woodstock School.\n\nI would recommend that an oil burner be purchased for this school, as the Indians steal the wood from the school. Last year authority was granted to purchase an oil burner, but no supply of oil could be obtained at that time. Recently, while talking to the Imperial Oil dealer in Woodstock, he informed me that he thought he could supply oil for the school another year, and said he would be certain after May 1.\n\nEdward J.

VOLUME .........................\nDear Sir:\n\nBlanche Thomas, daughter of Michael Thomas, age 18, from P.E.I. Reservation, is now living with her grandfather, Isaac Peters at Eureka, about 17 miles from here. The reason she came to this province is as follows: When she was in P.E.I., she had to walk 2 miles to go to school and she was advised by a doctor to stop school because she is crippled and the distance she had to walk would finally hurt her crippled leg. Wishing to continue her studies, she came to live with her grandfather at Eureka whose house is alongside the schoolhouse. She is now in Grade X. Her difficulty is that the books she had in P.E.I. are not those used in this province. She needs the four following books if she is to continue her studies at Eureka:\n\n1. Canadian Book of Prose and Verse - Book IV\n2. History of England by Carrington and Hampden Jackson\n3. French Grammar by Dondo\n4. Essential Latin for Grade X.\n\nAs she is not able to buy them herself, she has asked me to ask the Department if it could procure them for her. If you have not these books in stock, with your permission, I could buy them in New Glasgow. The total cost would probably be around $5.00.\n\nAs this case seems to be a deserving one, I recommend that the Department either lend or buy the above named books for this Indian girl.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. E. Chiasson,\nIndian agent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 21, 1941.\n\nEXD.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant with reference to Blanche Thomas and in view of your recommendation you may expend an amount of $5.00 for the purchase of the books that she requires.\n\nFor your information I may say that this girl has been attending school for several years past at Charlottetown, P.E.I., and the Department has been paying for her tuition and in addition paid the St. Joseph's Convent, Charlottetown, for her midday meal. Last May we found that she was 18 years of age and instructions were issued to the effect that no further grant could be allowed for her after the end of June, 1940.\n\nThe books are now being authorized but it should be distinctly understood by all parties concerned that this is the last amount the Department is prepared to pay for the education of this girl. If there is any charge for tuition at the school which she is now attending this Department will not be responsible for it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. E. Chiasson,\nIndian Agent,\nThorburn, N.S.\n| No. of Copies | Title of Book                                      | Unit Price | Total |\n|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------|-------|\n|              | Can.

They have been attending St. Joseph's Convent prior to my appointment. Their tuition and dinner has been paid for by the Department since that time and in your letter here-to referred to you have cancelled the grant of that of Rachael and Blanche who are past the school age.

He is the son of J.J. Sark of Lennox Island. I have been wondering would the Department give him some assistance in acquiring an education.\n\nThis is a promising young man and if given a chance will make good, there is no possibility of him getting any other help except what his parents can give him, and that as you nodoubt know will be limited.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6486, file 42057-3, part 3)\nOttawa,\nNovember 9, 1943.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMr. J.E. Daly, Indian Agent, Charlottetown, P.E.I.\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to Raymond Sark, who, you state, is attending St. Dunstan's University. We have helped other members of this same family and in addition the Department understands that Mr. Sark is in receipt of a war pension of $74.00 a month, plus his salary as teacher of the Lennox Island Indian Day School. If the Department was expected to allow a grant for the boy's tuition we should have been consulted before he was placed in St. Dunstan's University. However, you might let me know his age when he entered the University and what course he is pursuing. On receipt of your reply the matter will receive further consideration.\n\nR.A. HOFY,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nCharlottetown, P.E.I., November 17th, 1943\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey, Supt., Welfare & Training, Indian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA.\n\nReplying to your letter of the 8th re Raymond Sark, who is attending St. Dunstans University, his age is 17 years, he entered the University September last, he intends to take a B.A. from the University if at all possible.\n\nIt was thought at the time this boy started in college, his sister would be in a position to help him, since then she has joined the Sisters Of Martha, with the intention of training for a nurse, she had been teaching school previous to entering the convent.\n\nI would like to know that this boy was getting some assistance from the Department, even though the amount was not great.\n\nJ.F. Daly\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nNovember 28, 1943.\n\nMr. J.E. Daly, Indian Agent, Charlottetown, P.E.I.\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with further reference to Raymond Sark who is attending St. Dunstans University. As previously stated, the Department should be consulted regarding such matters before a pupil enters an institution of higher learning. We doubt if this boy will be better equipped to secure employment by simply taking a B.A. course. We would have preferred a vocational course. However, in view of your recommendation it has been decided to allow a grant of $125.00 for him for the current academic year only. In making this grant it should be definitely understood by the parents and yourself that it is unlikely that we will be able to make any further grant for him after the present year.\n\nR.A.

October 25th, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department Of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nThere are four pupils from Lennox Island going to Miscouche Convent. I have been wondering if the Department would help to pay their board, as it is difficult for some of the parents to do so.\n\nThe names of the pupils are as follows:\n\nJoan Sark, Daughter of J.J. Sark Age 16\nEva Tuplin \" \" Joseph Tuplin 17\nMarion Knockwood \" Frank P. Knockwood 10\nAlbert Francis Son of Mrs. John P. Francis 14\n\nI would appreciate it very much if the Department would see fit to give this matter some consideration.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6486, file 42057-3, part 3)\nOttawa,\nOctober 31, 1944.\n\nMr. J.E. Daly, Indian Agent, Charlottetown, P.E.I.\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, with reference to tuition grants for four children from Lennox Island.\n\nA review of our files indicates that the Department has been reasonably generous with the family of J.J. Sark. We have helped several of them to obtain higher education and it is felt that the older ones should now be in a position to assist the younger members of the family, if their father is unable to do so. I enclose a form which you should have completed regarding this girl and you should indicate what amount you think we might allow and on receipt of this the matter will have further consideration. However, you cannot expect that we will allow any large amount for this girl.\n\nI also enclose another form which you should have completed for Eva Tuplin. When we have the information required on this form her case will be further considered.\n\nMarrion Knockwood is stated to be 10 years of age and Albert Francis 14. In view of their ages we cannot understand why it is necessary for them to go to Miscouche Convent. Why are they not attending the day school on the Lennox Island Reserve?\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nCharlottetown, P.E.I. November 10th, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department Of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nIn reply to your letter of October 31, file 103-57 may say, in sending in the age of Albert Francis Imde a slight error he was 15 years old on the 11th of August, and it would seem he has made as much progress in the Lennox Island day school as he possibly can. If the Department would consider paying this boy's board which is at present $5.00 per week, I would be very grateful. He is the son of a widow woman and she is unable to help him.\n\nIn regard to the other three children mentioned, I think possibly Joan Sark would be the only one who would require assistance, as the other two Eva Tuplin and Marion Knockwood can be helped by their parents the fathers of whom are in the Service.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6486, file 42057-3, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nNovember 14, 1944.\n\nMr. J.E. Daly, Indian Agent, Charlottetown, P.E.I.\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to a tuition grant for Albert Francis and Joan Sark. As requested in official letter of the 51st ultimo, you should prepare the forms which were sent to you. When these are returned to us the requests will have further consideration.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nCharlottetown, P.E.I., December 14th, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department Of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nIn reply to your letter of December 11th, with reference to your official letter of November 14th, would advise that I have given the Application For Tuition Grant, one to Albert Francis, the other to Joan Sark; they have been waiting to have their T.B. examination, which will be completed on December 21st, as there is a clinic held at Summerside on that date by Dr. Creelman of the Provincial Sanatorium of Charlottetown, when I am in receipt of these forms completed I will forward them to the Department.\n\nYou state \"this whole trouble could have been avoided if the matter had been brought to our attention early in July.\" For your information, I wish to inform you, I was not aware that any of the children mentioned in my letter of October 25th, were going to attend Miscouche Convent, with the exception of Joan Sark whose mother informed me she was thinking of sending her daughter to the Convent, this information she gave me about September 16th.\n\nThe other three children Marrion Knockwood, Eva Tuplin, and Albert Francis, entered the Convent about the same time Joan Sark did, there was no mention of a grant to pay for board, until Mrs. Francis informed me she could not pay Mrs. DesRoches for her son's maintenance, in connection with this I would refer you to my letter of November 17th.\n\nOn my visit to the Lennox Island Reserve last week I found that Albert Francis had not attended the Miscouch Convent since November the 7th, his report shows 18 days in September, 17 days in October, and 7 days in November, Eva Tuplin has left the Convent and is not going to return so her people gave me to understand, it is possible the Francis may go back after the first of the New Year, at present there are only the Sark And Knockwood girls attending, these two have not lost any time.\n\nI have had a letter from Mrs. DesRoches asking payment for the maintenance of the Francis boy, she did not state any price so I have written to her requesting that she send me her account and I shall pass it on to the Department for further consideration.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6486, file 42057-3, part 3)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department Of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nAs stated in my letter of December the 14th, I am enclosing the application for Tuition Grant for Albert Francis which I received today from the Sanatorium.\n\nI am also enclosing the account of Mrs. DesRoches for the time this boy was boarding with her.\n\nThe application of Joan Sark has not been received at this office, when it arrives I shall forward it to the Department.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6486, file 42057-3, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, January 11, 1945.\n\nMr. J. E. Daly, Indian Agent, Charlottetown, P.E.I.\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, enclosing application for tuition grant for Albert Francis.\n\nIt has been decided to pay the account of $42.00 to Mrs. DesRoches, but it is not our intention to pay any similar accounts in future. All Indians must definitely understand that the Department will not be responsible for any tuition grants unless we have first been consulted and our approval given.\n\nI note from your letter that Albert Francis comes from the Lennox Island Reserve. What prevented him from attending the day school on that reserve? From your letter of the 14th ultimo it appears that the boy ceased attending that school at the end of the first week of November. We do not see much advantage in his returning now and consequently no further grant will be allowed for him. As intimated above, if he wishes to attend school, he should go to the Lennox Island Indian Day School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nCharlottetown, Prince Edward Island\n\nJanuary 11, 1945\n\nThe Department of Mines and Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nIn account with\n\nBoard of School Trustees\nCharlottetown, P.

While the reports state that his average has been 55%, it is noted that due to the fact that he obtained only 51.6% during the first term, he would be required to repeat Grade 11 next year. Evidently this boy has not done as good work as in the previous year. In this connection I would refer you to your letter of September 5, 1944. Possibly there is some reason for this, but, as the matter stands now, it will not be possible for the Department to consider allowing any further grant for him.

A certain number of the families are affected, by the fact children went when young to the outside schools, returned home when about 16 or 18 years old and these young Indians, cannot do a share of the trapping to support themselves, and yet they want to live and stay in the bush, this also apply to girls the boys are not as badly affected by their long stay at the outside schools.\n\n16. These Indians have no schools, however they have maintained their own method of education - Indian - fairly well.\n\n17. All the women can knit and do knit nearly all their own socks and mitts, but do not know how to make sweaters or underwear, the girls that went to outside schools, on knitting are the poorest exception for one.\n\nHerve Lariviere\nInd.

There are at least 12 or 15 children who are either not going to school at all, or for only a few weeks a year. As will be noted, part of the time the parents live back in the bush and take the children with them thus making attendance to school impossible. Another point is that the Indian Children are not medically examined for tuberculosis, and the Lowbush School Committee are reluctant to encourage their attendance. It is suggested that this matter be studied by the Indian Affairs Branch, as the situation is deplorable, and should be remedied at the earliest moment.\n\n(V.A.M. Kemp) Asst. Commr.,\nComdg. \"O\" Division\n\nToronto\n5-10-42\nD.\nTimmins\n\nOntario\n\nSept. 27th, 1948.\n\nIndians - Lowbush, Ontario.\n\n25-9-48.\n\nIn summing up the entire report it would seem that the Indian Agent's complaint as regards liquor activities amongst the Lowbush Indians has been explained and that the source of supply is at Cochrane, Ont., and not at Lowbush. This would seem to be substantiated by the fact that all these Indian homes were visited on the 25-9-48 without any trace of intoxicants being found and also by the fact that one Indian was arrested at Cochrane, Ont., the following date when about to leave by train on the return trip to the settlement and in possession of certain liquors which it was definitely ascertained had been purchased in Cochrane, as regards the gasoline regulations, according to Mr. L. Dent, the Game and Fisheries Overseer, certain seizures were made of gasoline from these Indians and it would seem that the seizures were quite justified. The matter of unregistered firearms was very carefully gone into and in the opinion of the writer, they are very few, if any, unregistered weapons amongst these Indians. I might mention that the Game Overseer visits these Indians quite frequently, from Cochrane, Ontario and that he has registered all the Indians' weapons himself. The condition most noticeable amongst these Indians and one which should be remedied is that of the \"Indian children not attending school.\" The matter of the liquor activities is being attended to day by day by the various police forces at Cochrane, Ontario but the matter of the children would not appear to be one for the Indian Affairs Branch at Ottawa to decide.\n\nH. O. T. D. C.\n\nEXPENSES INCURRED.\n\nA/Cpl.\n\nA.H. Langille Reg.#10985\n\n1/c Timmins Detachment.\nTimmins\nOntario.\n\nSept. 27., 1942.\n\nIndians - Lowbush, Ontario.\n\nWhile at Lowbush, Ont. on the 25th inst., there was one condition amongst these Indians which was quite noticeable to the writer and Capt. Cranney and in the opinion of the writer, it is a situation which should be remedied. Namely, it was noticed that there were a large number of Indian children of school age running about the banks of the river and very obviously not attending school regularly. This matter was gone into quite thoroughly when it was ascertained that a number of the Indian children of that settlement do not attend school at all and that the ones who do attend, average possibly six weeks out of the entire season; The balance of the time they are either playing about the bush at Lowbush or away up the river with their parents. There is a school at Lowbush, in close proximity to this Indian settlement and no outward reason why these children should not be attending school and attending regularly.\n\nAt present there are 14 white children attending the Lowbush school and but three Indians. A check in the settlement reveals that the following Indians had children of school age who are not attending:\n\n| NAME          | NUMBER OF SCHOOL AGE |\n|---------------|----------------------|\n| Alec Black    | three children       |\n| Albert Biederman | \"                   |\n| David Black   | two                  |\n| John Charlebois | \"                   |\n| Pete Diamond  | Children of age but number not ascertained |\n\nThere would appear to be no good reason why all of the above mentioned children should not be attending school and attending regularly. However, it would seem that they have never attended regularly and no doubt will as long as they live the life they are living at present. By that it is meant that when the parents are at Lowbush, by enforcing the provisions of Sec. 10 Sub-section 4 of the Indian Act, they could be kept at school a reasonable length of the time they reside at Lowbush. However, the parents spent the majority of their time in some camp up the river and when they move up there they are in the habit of\ntaking the children along with them with the result that the children are taken out of school and at a time like that it would be impossible to attempt to enforce Sec. 10(4) of the Indian Act. In the opinion of the writer, this situation as regards the Indian children at Lowbush in a most unfortunate one and one that should be remedied and that as soon as possible. It is difficult to suggest just how the situation could be remedied except of course, if the Department would step in and place all these Indian Children of school age in one of the various Indian Residential Schools. That is, in the writer's opinion, the only way that these children will ever get an education. To leave them at Lowbush and endeavour to enforce the Indian Act would appear to be out of the question as the parent AS THE PARENTS are away too much of the time.\n\n10. Another complaint, heard while at Lowbush was one received from a member of the Lowbush School Committee and that being that all Indian children, before being admitted to the local School should be medically examined and be able to produce a certificate to that effect. The reason given for this complaint being that Tuberculosis is quite prevalent amongst these Indians and that to protect the other children of the school, each child should be forced to undergo a strict medical examination before being admitted to the school.\n\nH.O.T.D.C.\nEXPENSES INCURRED\n\nA/Cpl.\nA.H.

At the time, since and again today, demanded assistance in the form of a monthly allowance, I understand $10.00 per month, would be satisfactory, the difference he could meet, from his revenue, work or trapping.\n\nThese Polsons originated from Temiskamingue, trapped all their lives north of La Sarre, Que., they have their camps located near Otter Lake, a distance of about 40 miles, from nearest railway point. This man's father Philip together with his family developed to take care of themselves during summer months, a fair farm, they cultivate land, on scale to permit them a fair living, when they can secure a little cash from the sale of their furs, settlers and white trappers are closing in on them more and more every year. These Polsons they are Indians, but outstanding, they stand up very well to the average white settlers, as regard mode of living etc., Philip & Charlie have learned to read and write more or less by themselves able to speak English and French, their wives also speak English, both are good housekeepers.\n\nConsidering that these Polsons, are not the \"bush type\" made actual efforts on their own, to improve and change their living habits, they have no other means to provide this child with education except placing her at a boarding school, considering the cost, I recommend same to your attention, in this case I feel if assistance could be granted, it would be a sound investment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6486, file 42074-3, part 1)\nOttawa,\nNovember 18, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to Josephine Polson.

Nous nous proposons, tout en la maintenant au cours r\u00e9gulier, de lui conseiller des cours sp\u00e9ciaux de dessin \u00e0 notre studio, elle manifeste une certaine facilit\u00e9 pour cet art et nous estimons qu'il contribuera largement \u00e0 sa culture g\u00e9n\u00e9rale; ce lui sera de plus un pr\u00e9cieux instrument quand elle entreprendra les \u00e9tudes du cours d'enseignement m\u00e9nager auquel jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent nous l'avons crue destin\u00e9e.\n\nCe nous serait un vif chagrin qu'elle ne rev\u00eent pas au pensionnat, c'est une exp\u00e9rience int\u00e9ressante que de mener \u00e0 bout l'\u00e9ducation d'une enfant de sa race.

She is becoming gradually familiar with the French language although she speaks English more easily. We were planning, while continuing the regular studies, to suggest for her special drawing lessons at our studio. She shows a certain aptitude for this art, and we feel that it will contribute considerably to her general development. It should prove quite helpful when she begins her domestic art course to which we believe she is destined.\n\nIt would be unfortunate if she were not to return to the school. It is a very interesting experience for us to promote the education of a child of her race. We are aware of your solicitude for this student and have no doubt that you wish her to continue her studies.\n\nThanking you . . . .\n\nR\u00e9v\u00e9rende Sr. Saint-Jean de Marie, a.s.v.,\ndirectrice,\nCouvent des Soeurs de l'Assomption de la S.V.,\nAmos, Qu\u00e9bec.\nTo The Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRe Your File No. 103-74 Josephine Polson\n\nAttached hereto letter from Les Srs. l'Assomption Amos, Que. which speaks for itself.\n\nCharles Polson, has made an unusual effort to pay for his share and kept up payments to-date, her father.\n\nConsidering cost and age of Josephine, ability etc., I suggest grant be renewed and increased to $15.00 per month for 1945/1946, it will cost this Indian about also $15.00 or a little more.\n\nThis girl cannot receive FAMILY ALLOWANCE unless born Dec. 26/1929.\n\nI am of the opinion she is a very good risk, they are outstanding Indians and have adopted themselves by themselves to a very good living standard, developed farming and are depending since a few years, mainly on farming and work for a living.\n\nH.

The others, are doing extremely well, and both it is question of keeping at an orphanage, if placed with other Indians, they would in no time spend their time at the hospital instead out and would cost a great deal. Elizabeth was treated at a Sanatorium for a long period, Philomena was in and out of the hospital all the time, hasn't been sick since taken care at the orphanage.\n\nI understand the present rate for whites is $18.00, considering this and present conditions of these Indian children, I recommend that their request be granted,\n\nH. Lariviere - Indian Agent.\nOttawa, 14 November 1946.\n\nMr. H. Lariviere, Indian Agent,\nAMOS, Quebec.\n\nWe have your letter of the 10th instant with reference to the four Indian children who are enrolled at L'Orphelinat du Sacre Coeur, La Tuque, Quebec.\n\nThe rate requested is higher than we allow for each pupil at any of our Indian Residential Schools.\n\nIt has been decided to allow the increased amount of $18.00 a month for each of the four children until June 30, 1947. About that time you should communicate with us again and arrangements will be made to transfer them to one of our regular Indian residential schools. If we had accommodation at any of these schools at the present time, we would transfer them immediately but as all of them have a full enrolment, the transfer will have to be delayed until next June.\n\nBernard F.

Sister Superior, if any of these girls don't stand up to expectations, they must return home, all this was made very clear to them on the Reserves and accepted on their own free will and of the parents, made to understand they had to work regularly and if they could not improve they would be returned etc.,\n\nI will visit La Tuque tomorrow check on them closely, there is no doubt that training these girls, is the only outlet to get results on medical in the field and more it does help all around on the Reserves, many girls appear to develop now some ambitions.\n\nH. Lariviere - Supt. Indian Agency.\nOctober 21, 1948.\n\nMr. H. Lariviere,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nAmos, Que.\n\nWe have your letter of the 14th instant enclosing application for tuition grants for the following:\n\nCharlotte Gull\nCharlotte Blacksmith\nAnnie Dube\nDelima Flamand\n\nIf you refer to official letter of August 12th you will note that we promised to allow a grant of $40.00 for each of the four Indian girls for a period of nine months during the academic year 1948-49.\n\nHowever, it is noted from the application form that only $30.00 from the appropriation for Indian Education is required for Charlotte Gull.\n\nWe are, therefore, prepared to allow an amount of $40.00 a month for a period of nine months during the academic year 1948-49, for the last three named girls mentioned above, but only $30.00 a month for nine months for Charlotte Gull.\n\nThe amounts authorized in this letter will be paid from the appropriation for Indian Education. This Division has no authority to authorize funds from the Welfare appropriation.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nSince 1946, in some ways we had difficulties to secure cover, that is payment for the training of these girls, just at present, we have 4 girls at La Tuque, one, Charlotte Gull, Education agreed at first to pay in full the $40.00 per month, but the fact that last year $30.00 was paid by Education and $10.00 by Welfare they have now declined to pay the $10.00 in her case, which means we are $10.00 short for period of training, that is for 9 months at $10.00 per month.\n\nAuthority would be appreciated to cover, if it cannot be granted, this Indian girl, considered very suitable will have to return home, this is her second year and starting to give us what we expect from her, these girls need to be trained for 3 years, to give satisfactory results.\n\nH. Lariviere - Supt. Indian Agency.\nAttention: Welfare Division\n\nRe: Letter from Education No. 42074-3 (E1) dated October 21st, 1948, and Letter 10374 (E1) August 12th, 1948.\n\nThis year considering the success we had on training what appeared the most intelligent Indian girls, to act as interpreters and assistants to nurses in the field, La Tuque Hospital, agreed to undertake training 4 girls, at $40.00 per month each, to select these girls, it is still in some ways complicated, however this is the Agency responsibility and troubles.\n\nThis idea, started in 1945, after discussing in Ottawa with Dr. P.E. Moore, now Director I.H.S., in order to get results from our Medical Field Services, in 1946 we could get only one girl who in our opinion would stand up and so on, Miss. Trapper, for her training at the time, I was advised Education would pay $20.00 per month and Welfare $10.00, that is $40.00 per month which was the agreed price with the hospital.\n\nWith Miss. Trapper, we increased our preventive measures, briefly we got out of it, more work from the nurses and more an improved understanding of things, from the part of the natives, briefly results are, all the various divisions are getting an improvement out of it; one point which I consider very important improved confidence from the part of the natives, which prepares the ground for education, hygiene and so on, probably at the start the Medical got out of it the most, however they paid for all the summer expenses for these girls and salary. To-day I estimate Welfare is getting a good share and Education with time will get an equal share, through them the natives start to realize that some education is good.\n\nThe idea in general about training and employing these girls, with nurses was to make a definite start to improve these natives, in some cases most primitive and without the aid of the most intelligent Indians, progress is too slow to make much headway.\n\n***************\nMEMORANDUM\n\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nWith reference to the correspondence on file hereunder, the Welfare Division is prepared to pay $10.00 per month towards the tuition grant submitted on behalf of Charlotte Gull, No. 46 Waswanipi Band, by Mr. H.

This girl gave us services as interpreters, above usual excellent, when with us.\n\nDelima Flamond :- One season at La Tuque, stationed with nurse at Obedjiwan for up to June, desired to go home, satisfied she will stand up; nurse at Obedjiwan has not ability to direct others, etc., this Indian girl with further training, even if she returned to her Reserve after second year, will contribute a great deal to betterment of her own large family and others. Request her return in September.\n\nAge November 9, 1933, Manawan Band No. 7.\n\nAnnie Dub\u00e9 :- One season at La Tuque, expressed desire to return home for summer, refused to talk French which she can do fairly good, considered of no value, as nurses' aid for our purpose, in spite of fact at hospital the Sisters, do feel she gave satisfactory returns. I am advising La Tuque, if they wish to hire her, on their staff as a maid, they can do so, but I am no longer interested in her on this plan. I saw this girl at the hospital last year a few times, no doubt at hospital she is different, however for us we need someone \"regular\" at home or away from home.\n\nCharlotte Blacksmith :- One season at La Tuque, expressed desire to go home for summer, refused to talk French or English, she can express herself fairly well in English when she wants to, \"home sick\" her trouble for our purpose, now and in future a doubt exist, I saw her at Waswanipi since she returned, a very large family, doing well at home and no doubt contributing on a much improved basis. I feel in her case a year at home may change her, will see in 1950, re-action, will drop her this year.\n\nCharlette Gull :- 2nd year training, this year giving expected results and very satisfactory at Mistassini, recommend her for third year.\n\nApril 18, 1932 Waswanipi Band No. 46.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6486, file 42074-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nAt Mistassini, we have a Miss.

She already speaks French, which\nshe learned at the hospital and does understand some English; her parents,\nmother died a few years ago, father and grandparents agreed to let her go.\n\nConsidering I would appreciate authority to cover\nunder Nurses Aid - training plan the following:\n\nCharlotte Gull: for third year.

Some of the Indians at Lake Abitibi, have been asking\nto send one girl, to \"help the nurses\".\n\nI would appreciate authority by return of mail, in\norder to allow me time, to arrange transportation on combined trips, when\nclosing stations or other Agency trips.\n\nForms sent us, went astray apparently at La Tuque Hospital,\nplease favour us, with 8 copies to cover your requirements.\n\nH.

Lariviere - Superintendent Indian Agency.\nCHIEF, EDUCATION DIVISION\n\nTraining of Nurses' Aides for the Abitibi Agency\n\nIn line with the wishes of Church authorities as expressed to the Parliamentary Committee on the subject of medical and nursing services to the Indians, it would be well, I think, to invite Mr. Superintendent Lariviere's attention to the desirability of assigning nurses and nurses' aides to the larger bands with due regard for religious affiliation. In the case of the large bands at Mistassini and Waswanipi, it seems to be difficult to get nursing personnel of Protestant affiliation, or to recruit and train under Protestant auspices of an adequate nature new personnel. It seems to me that to send girls who are sketchily schooled in the academic and religious fields, to a training institution which might tax their mental capacity and confuse their religious patterns, would likely produce an instability that would become evident sooner or later and result in casualties during training or in later service. A review of the cases mentioned on this file seems to support this opinion.\n\nI discussed the matter briefly with Dr. Leroux who admitted that we have not available the ideal method of getting needed personnel. He thinks that when the Moose Factory hospital has been completed, some of these nurses' aides may be trained there. That does not, however, solve the problem of their required pre-hospital schooling. It would seem that more girls from the Abitibi area should be directed at an earlier age to appropriate residential schools. At present Spanish and Moose Fort are the most accessible and I would suggest that their quotas for the Abitibi agency be increased.\n\nC.A.F.

She is one of a family who have three or four rather clever girls. Some of them served in the army and air force during the war and one is now a teacher in the school at Aklavik. She is very anxious to do something worth while. I think she is quite capable of being trained as a nurse or a teacher. She writes to me continually but I do not know how to make a contact for her. Would it be possible for you to write to someone and see whether it would be possible to give her a chance? If so I will be glad to give you any further information.\n\nI would be very grateful if you could do anything to expedite the matter of the cheques for the teachers at our four James Bay schools last year. I do not know what department should be approached in this matter. I have had no reply from any source on this subject.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6486, file 42074-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nI just thought I would drop a few lines to you as we are in the best of health.\n\nWe are doing fine in the school.

If at the end of that time she shows the necessary progress, aptitude, and interest she will be considered for employment in the Government hospital there. As far as teaching is concerned it has yet to be demonstrated that Miss Gull's abilities lie in this field and she should not be entrusted with the usual duties of a teacher in a residential school.\n\nThe suggested arrangement between your administration and this Department is that you should provide room and board and training under qualified instructors and the Department will pay the girl's transportation from Waswanipi to Moose Factory and return and the sum of $30 a month to the hospital matron of which she shall pay to the girl $10 a month as pocket money. The monthly payments are to be claimed quarterly through our Superintendent at Amos, Que. The agreement may be terminated by either party after a month's notice.\n\nWe are writing to the girl to determine whether she will accept this offer of room and board, training, and $10 a month.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nP.P.\nPhilip Melan,\nChief, Education Division.\nSeptember 10, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

There is a small hospital at Moose Factory and there is a boarding school near it. You would work part of the time in the hospital where the matron would teach you what to do. At the school you would have some work to do and the principal and the teachers would tell you what to do and how to do it.\n\nYou would have some time in which to study and to do things which you like to do in your spare time, but you would have to keep the rules that the hospital and the school make for people who work there.\n\nIt will cost a lot to send you there but the Department will pay what it costs for you to go and come back. While you are working and studying and doing what the hospital and the school wants you to do, you will get ten dollars ($10) a month. This pay will stop and you will have to go back home if you do not like to go on with the job. But if you like the work and do well, you may be able to get a job at more pay next year when the big hospital which is\nbeing built at Moose Factory is ready to take in sick people and children.\n\nIf you think you want to go to Moose Factory and do what I have said, please write to me at once. At the same time please write to Mr. Indian Superintendent Lariviere at Amos and tell him when you will be ready to go. Do not leave Waswanipi until you hear from Mr. Lariviere.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nSeptember 16, 1949.\n\nMr. H.

A year from now the girl may not wish to continue at Moose Factory, but if she returns to our service at Waswanipi she will be better equipped to work there.\n\nThis arrangement is being made in accordance with the view that any Indians who are to be employed as assistants to nurses or teachers require more schooling and directed training.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nMiss Katherine Gull,\nc/o H.B.C.,\nWassanipi Post,\nvia Senneterre, P.Q.\n\nDear Miss Gull:\n\nI have read your letter to Bishop Renison about wanting to go out to some place where you can get training that will help you to be a nurse or teacher.\n\nI think that the best place for you to go is Moose Factory.
