R. No. 1, in the Okanagan Agency, at a cost of $385.00.\n\nIn this connection, I beg to say that Mr. Coleman advises that an Indian of the Reserve has successfully dug a well, and he thinks that as there is an improvised borer in the Reserve, it may provide a successful experiment to bore near the School at a cost of approximately fifteen dollars ($15.00) and that if water should be found available for a well the latter could be dug, and supplied with curb and pump at an additional cost of about $150.00, inclusive of labor, and the original proposal could then be abandoned.\n\nI have advised Agent Coleman that I will support his suggestion and would recommend that he be authorized to have the boring done, and should this be successful, to place an item in his new Estimates for the sum of $150.00 as it is doubtful if funds will be available from General Vote and domestic systems cannot, if held at the Department, be used for domestic water supply but only for irrigation. If, therefore, the Department can approve the present spending of $15.00 for experimental boring, I would ask that authority be granted the Agent to have the work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

March 25, 1937.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 6904, amounting to $5.00 in favour of Mrs. Jimmie Bonneau, C/o Indian Office, Vernon, B.C., for buck-skin for handicraft purposes, Inkameep Day School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 164-11-4 dated July 24, 1936.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise that the question of domestic water supply for the Indian Day School at Osoyoos I.R. No. 1 has been under discussion for some time, this school being entirely without water, the nearest spring being some distance from the school and the nearest creek about a mile distant, making it necessary for the teacher to carry his water in buckets. Incidentally there is no fire protection for the building and that it was not burned down by an adjacent bush fire about five years ago was due to the efforts of the teacher and Indians.\n\nThis situation was reported to the Department in 1935 and he recommended a pipe line be installed from the spring to the school, and the Department requested a report in their letter of June 6th, 1936 (File 164-11-5) and I advised them on June 12th, 1936 that the cost would amount to $335.00 for the pipe line and that sinking a well would be problematical owing to rock formation. The Department advised me on June 18th as follows:\n\n\"In this connection I have to say that the Department will have no funds this year to cover the cost of having this work carried out. A note has been made to provide the expenditure - approximately $335.00 - in our estimates for the next fiscal year. Before incurring any expenditure, however, the Department would require to be definitely assured that there would be an ample supply of water obtained from the spring and also that the pipe could be installed in a manner to prevent freezing in winter. It is noted that the result from the sinking of well would be problematical, owing to rock formation. You might furnish full information with your estimates for the next fiscal year.\"\n\nand I included the cost in my estimates for 1936-37 as follows (page 6A):\n\n| Item                  | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| 3000' of 1\" pipe      | $300.00|\n| Concrete for intake    | 5.00   |\n| Fittings               | 5.00   |\n| Indian labour         | 75.00  |\n| **Total**             | **$335.00** |\n\nSince that date an Indian who lived some distance below the school and had a well that was unsatisfactory has driven it somewhat deeper and installed a concrete curb and now has a satisfactory water supply. We have also rigged up a boring outfit in connection with settlement of young Indians on a new development adjacent to Inkameep Creek where it will be necessary to explore for domestic water; consequently I would recommend that a bore be made at the school to ascertain if a well is possible, the cost of which should not exceed about $15.00 for labour, and if water is secured a well be dug and a concrete pipe curb installed, together with the necessary pipe. The cost would depend on the depth to water but should not exceed $150.00 complete with curb, pump and labour.\nIf the $15.00 exploration in this direction does not produce results then it will be necessary to pipe from the spring at the original cost, viz $355.00, which together with the $15.00 for exploration would amount to $400.00. However, I believe there is reasonable prospect of well water. It is not anticipated that either project will require supervision other than can be given from this office as the pipe line system would be merely excavating and laying a pipe on grade below the frost line with a simple concrete box intake and screen. A well would of course be even more simple in regard to construction.\n\nIf this application is approved it would be appreciated if the matter could be taken in hand while the school is closed during the summer recess.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Jas. Coleman)\nIndian Agent.\n\nG. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nSir,\n\nIn my letter of July 24th last year I made application to expend $15.00 in order to explore for water at the Indian Day School on Oscoyoos I.R.No.1, the intention being to bore a test hole to determine the possibilities by way of a well. Through pressure of work I was unable to take advantage of this and would respectfully recommend authorization of this expenditure for the current year.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Jas. Coleman)\nIndian Agent.\n\nD.M.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJas. Coleman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Your file 164-11-5.\n\nThe attached letter of the 11th instant from Indian Agent Coleman is in connection with his suggestion to provide a water supply for the Inkameep Indian Day School at Osoyoos I.R. No.1, Okanagan Agency, and in this connection I beg to refer to this office's letter 30/10/45120 of July 24, 1936, from Mr. C.C. Perry, recommending that Mr. Coleman be authorized to expend $15.00 in order to explore for water as suggested.\n\nI am also forwarding copy of Mr. Coleman's letter of July 21, 1936, in connection with this matter for the information of the Department. I would recommend that Mr. Coleman be given the necessary authority to bore a test hole to determine the possibilities by way of a well.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M.

My estimates called for $300.00 for the Okanagan and Penticton Schools but this was based on quotations from the Tremco Surface Coating Co., and if it is necessary to secure the material from local paint merchants at retail prices, the cost of material would probably be considerably higher than anticipated. Paint (Tremco) for the Okanagan Day School would cost $20.00 plus freight\u2014probably about $120.00. New ridgeboards for roof about $5.00 or a total of $125.00, and I anticipate I can arrange for labour for the balance.\n\nPenticton School estimates by the Tremco Co. are $122.10 for material, plus freight\u2014probably about $150.00\u2014and about $10.00 for roof and ridgeboard repairs.\n\nPossibly I can keep the labour costs within the balance of $110.00. If I can effect savings in labour costs I would require authority to purchase the small amount of paint necessary to redecorate the interior of the Osoyoos School which could possibly be done for $25.00.\n\nKeeping the costs ($150.00 for the two schools) below my estimates (and redecorating the interior of the Osoyoos School in addition) will necessitate extremely economical procedure but as I personally own a power paint sprayer I believe it can be done and a superior job secured than under ordinary conditions and in this way be able to exercise full control of the quality of material used in the work, which is practically impossible in the ordinary way.\n\nIf this work can be authorized as outlined I would appreciate your advice by wire if possible in order that it can proceed so far as interior work is concerned during the holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Jas.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter No. 215-10-3111 of May 2nd ultimo in regard to repairs and furnishings at Inikameep Indian Day School as authorized by the Department, I now advise that I am still awaiting a quotation on the cost of repairs and an addition to the building from Messrs. Topping and Son, Oliver, to whom I have written and will call on again this week.\n\nI, however, am forwarding herewith quotations of various local merchants on 1,000 feet of one inch galvanized pipe and it will be noted that the price quoted by P.C. Paul and Company, Penticton, of $16.50 per 100 feet, delivered at Oliver, is the lowest.\n\nThe length of pipe required to pipe water from the spring due East of the School is 1,000 feet approximately, and this could be installed as soon as authority is granted for the expenditure, subject, of course, to the co-operation of the Indians being obtained at this busy season.\n\nHowever, the Band agreed at the meeting with Mr. Inspector Coleman on June 10th instant that the school should remain at its present site until such time as a new school could be built and agreed to co-operate in the installation of this pipe line from the spring, but with the present scarcity of labour and high wages being paid, it remains to be seen if they will keep their word and install this pipe.\n\nI would request that I be authorized to pay the Indians a living allowance of $1.50 per day whilst working on the job and that a grant of $50.00 be made for this purpose.\n\nIn addition to the above, authority is requested for purchase of lumber required for the construction of an outlet box at the spring and for boxing in the stand-pipe at the school.\n\nHauling of the pipe and lumber from Oliver to the Reserve will cost about $5.00.\n\nThis installation will be proceeded with on receipt of the necessary authority.\n\n(Alfred H. Barber)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 10, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, the Department approves an expenditure of $210.00, in order to secure a water supply for the Inkaneep Indian Day School. When forwarding the account you should forward a copy of your Purchase Order.\n\nPhilip Phalen,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nAs you are aware, there has been considerable discussion about the conditions at Inkameep Indian Day School in connection with which, amongst other things, the question of the supply of domestic water has arisen.\n\nI asked Mr. Indian Agent Barber to obtain for me the cost of installing a domestic water supply from a spring in the locality of the school and I now enclose herewith his quotations which it will be noted are as follows:\n\n1000' 1\" galvanized iron pipe $143.90\nLabour $50.00\nLumber $10.00\nHauling $5.00\n\n$208.90\n\nIf funds could be provided for this purpose, I would strongly recommend approval of the application and would request authorization for the expenditure of $10.00.\n\nKT\n\nEnc.\n\nD.M. MacKay\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.,\nDear Sir:\n\nThe following consists of segregated estimates on proposed work at Indian school - Oliver, as follows:\n\nLaying new floor in Class Room - $78.00\nExtending building 12' on North end, using same exterior finish as at present. Finished floors, Gyproc wall board inside, and tearing out partitions in present living quarters - for sum of - $486.50\n\nNew porch over front door - about 6' square, same exterior finish, same doors and Gyproc wall board inside - for sum of $123.65\n\nThese prices do not include any painting or decorating.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.J. Topping\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nFurther to my letter of the 21st ultimo and with reference to your letter No. 215-10-3111 of May 2nd ultimo, in which you request that I obtain quotations for material and labour from local sources for the re-flooring, construction of a storm porch and an addition to Inkameep Indian Day School, I now forward herewith an estimate received from Topping & Son, contractors, Oliver, which quotes as follows:\n\nLaying new floor in class-room........................................$78.00,\n\nExtending building 12' on North end, using same exterior finish (siding), finished floors, Gyproc wall board inside and removing partition in living quarters.........................................................$66.50,\n\nNew porch over front door - about 6' square.\nSame exterior finish, glass door and Gyproc wall board inside.........................................................$123.65.\n\nThe estimated cost of the porch and extension is much higher than I expected and it is my opinion, in view of the Department's intention to construct a new school as soon as possible after the war, that the cost is too high to warrant the alterations being done at this time. However, it is for the Department to decide as to that.\n\nTopping and Son are the only builders and contractors in the Oliver district and they advise that they can not guarantee when they could do the work if it is authorized, owing to so much work and scarcity of labour, but would endeavour to do it before re-opening of the school.\n\nI understand that the Widdowsons intend to return after the vacation if he does not receive the appointment at some college in the East which he appears to be hoping for. If he does return with his family, I do not see how the family or himself, wife and child could live in the accommodation as it is at present, without bringing forth more severe criticism from the element in the district that is so active in this regard, and therefore it would appear that the Department must either authorize the alterations to be carried out, or, if possible, obtain a single teacher who would be content to make the best of conditions as they are with such additional provision for his comfort as may be necessary.\n\nIf it is decided to proceed with the extension and alterations, I would urge that I be advised at as early a date as possible.\n\nEnclosure:\n\n(Alfred H.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nFurther to my letter of even date with regard to Inkameep Day School and the attached estimate of Topping and Sons on the alterations and addition, I have now received an estimate of the cost of material which has been obtained from the Oliver Lumber Company and is attached hereto, amounting to $240.78. This, however, only includes 1 door and door frame, whereas three doors and frames would be required.\n\nIn view of the difficulty and delay I have met with in obtaining these estimates, I am forwarding same as received.\n\nThis estimate was requested on material to carry out the following work:\n\n\"Lay new floor in class-room 16'x20',\nErect porch at class-room entrance, 6x6,\nExtend the building 12' on north end, 12x16,\n1 partition,\nFloor extension,\nInside finished with gyproc wall board, as shown on attached sketch.\"\n\nCarpenters are very scarce in Oliver and wages of carpenters, if available are $1.25 to $1.50 per hour. I however, have contacted a carpenter in Vernon who, if advised at an early date, would do the work at 90\u00a2 an hour and I think this man would do a very satisfactory job, he having done some work at my house and I found him to be a good workman.\n\nLabour costs at this rate should not exceed $250.00 and I would recommend this be considered as against the estimate of material and labour given by Topping and Son, Oliver.\n\nEnclosure:-\n\n(Alfred H. Barber)\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am attaching hereto requisition for school material of Mr. B.C. Widdowson, teacher of the Inkamsep Indian Day School. The requisition is being forwarded as received owing to the fact that the teacher is spending his holiday up the Coast of British Columbia and considerable time would arise if the requisition were returned to him for the purpose of having separate requisitions made for school and janitor supplies.\n\nWith reference to the requisition, I would make the following recommendations:\n\nThat the amount for material for domestic crafts be reduced to $10.00,\n\nThat the purchase of one five gallon tin of coal oil be authorized.\n\nSome gasolene is required for the gasolene lamps at the school. However, I do not know if this can be obtained under the present restrictions.\n\nEnclosure:\n\n(Alfred H. Barber)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJuly 17, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Barber's letters of the 4th instant with reference to improvement of Inkameep Indian Day School from which it would appear that he could purchase the material as set out in the quotation of the Oliver Lumber Company for $240.75 and secure local labour, keeping the amount within the $500.00 which would be $168.15 less than the Topping & Son quotation which, in my opinion, is altogether too high. I would suggest that if funds can be provided that $500.00 be set up for this purpose and I will endeavour to have Mr. Barber make the best possible use of the amount not only in enlarging the quarters but possibly in the classroom as well which would meet our requirements until funds are available for new construction.\n\nWhen this school is replaced by a more pretentious structure, it should be possible to recover the amount expended on this occasion by its sale to an Indian of the Band.\n\nD.M.

Also the water is now piped to the school door from the spring 1000 feet away. The school reopened on October 1st. However, it was closed from October 16th to 26th inclusive owing to the teacher, Mr. Widdowson, having to go to Vancouver where his son was ill. Many of the Indians of this reserve are still away and the attendance is poor, being an average of about seven pupils.\n\nThe teacher, in my opinion, is hardly suitable for teaching young Indian children, although no doubt very capable in his own line.\n\nA.

When forwarding these returns you should have given some further particulars regarding this matter.\n\nIn several cases in British Columbia the Department pays a tuition grant of $12.00 per capita per annum on the average attendance for the tuition of Indian children who attend white schools. This grant is paid quarterly on the receipt of returns of attendance made out on the proper forms supplied for that purpose.\n\nThe Department is prepared to pay at the above rate for all Indian children who may attend the white school at Upper Trout Creek and, if these terms of payment are satisfactory to the board of school trustees, a resolution of the board to that effect should be forwarded.\n\nJ.

Upon receipt of this cheque you will be good enough to hand it over to the Secretary of the Board of Trustees.\n\nYou should instruct the secretary to see that the teacher prepares and forwards promptly at the end of each quarter, through your office, a return showing the Indian children in attendance at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nThere is a destitute Indian orphan girl belonging to the Penticton Band who is desirous of attending the public school at Trout Creek and I can get her board and lodging for $16. a month providing the department is prepared to pay that amount and if so she would be in a position to attend Trout creek public school for which the Department would be requested to contribute $1.00 per month.\n\nIf this is satisfactory kindly let me hear from you and I will make the necessary arrangements.\n\nAt present she is living with her Grandfather who is living away from Trout Creek point to Shingle Creek for the winter and it is just possible that this arrangement would only be necessary until next spring.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\nIndian Agent\nDepartment Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Sept. 24, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant in which you request that the Department will pay board and lodging, to the amount of $16 per month, for a destitute Indian orphan girl who is desirous of attending the public school at Trout Creek.\n\nIn reply I hast to say that it is considered that this girl could be sent to a residential school. Her age or religion is not stated, but, if she is between 7 and 15 years of age and is a Catholic, she might be sent to either the Kamloops or Kootenay Industrial School, and if a Protestant she might be sent to the Lytton Industrial, when it is ready to receive girl pupils, or to the Coqualeetza Industrial School.\n\nYou should make enquiry from the principal of one of these schools and endeavour to have her placed in one of these Residential schools, as the Department cannot provide the amount that would be required to pay for her board and lodging while attending a white school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. Robert Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSummerland, B. C.\nSir,\n\nFrom October 1916 to June 30, 1917 I taught in the school three Indian children of the name of Pierre, on the distinct understanding given me by the Indian agent (Mr. H.R. Brown) that for their tuition I should be paid direct, a fee of $1 per child per month.\n\nI find that at least a part of this grant was paid to the trustees of the school who claim it as their grant, with the result that for my extra work with these children I receive no remuneration. As the law does not require me to teach these children, I naturally refuse to do so.\nunless I am paid for my work. I should be greatly obliged if you would kindly let me know whether this grant is meant as a tuition fee or whether the trustees can use it for general purposes, i.e., buying cordwood etc. Your answer will decide the question.\n\nThe Indian Agent wrote I am sure he was out that he made a distinct promise that the fee was for tuition, I would be paid to me personally. Otherwise I would not have undertaken the education of these children.\n\nI am\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn W. Harris\nTeacher\nOttawa, Sept. 26, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant with reference to the payment of the tuition grant for the Indian children who attend the Upper Trout Creek public school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department entered into an agreement with the trustees by which they agreed to permit the Indian children residing in that district to attend the school on the payment of a tuition grant of $2 per capita per annum on the average attendance of such children. You should therefore apply to the trustees for any remuneration which you consider you are entitled to receive for the teaching of these Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

You will be good enough to state whether Margaret Pierre, for whose attendance at the Trout Creek School returns are now forwarded, is the same girl for whom you requested the grant to pay for her board and lodging. If so, you should also state what action you took to have her placed in a residential school as instructed in official letter of the 24th of September last.\n\nIf Trout Creek is a different school from Upper Trout Creek, you will be good enough to state in whose favour the cheque for the amount of the tuition grant for Margaret Pierre should be made payable.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

The former being within the bounds of the Municipality of Summerland near the point where Trout Creek empties into Okanagan Lake, while the latter is situated, as the name implies, at Upper Trout Creek, four or five miles outside the limits of the Municipality.\n\nThe destitute Indian girl is the same girl who was desirous of continuing in attendance at the school when her grandfather moved to Shingle Creek.

Sir Wilfred Laurier G.C.M.G.\nPrime Minister of the Dominion of Canada\n\nMy very most Hon. Sir:\n\nI beg to state briefly and most respectfully\nOur Siwashas on this Penticton Reserve have no school\nwhatever for educating their children really some im-\nportant steps ought to be taken in this matter, it is a\nneeded improvement in many instances to lessen crime and\nother criminal costly proceedings besides benefiting the\npresent and future of these Siwashas, for happy homes and\nprosperity in their midst. R.C. Fathers come and go to and\nfro but the young needs more constant training etc.\n\nI hope heartily yr G.T.P.Ry. will now go speed-\nily forward to be completed at the earliest possible\ndate. This part of B.C. is almost entirely hampered up\nwith most unjust C.P.R. Reserves and Chart Promoters Res-\nerves detrimental in every way and ruinous to B.C. great-\nness by keeping out settlers from coming in to settle up\nhappy and prosperous homes in these A.I districts. The\nlands\nOTTAWA, 13th October, 1903\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:-\n\nWith reference to the application for a school for the Penticton Indians I beg to say that this reserve is in the Kamloops-Okanagan Agency, which embraces nearly 4000 Indians and the only opportunity their children have of receiving an education is at the Roman Catholic Industrial school at Kamloops, which has provision for 50 pupils, and the new Church of England Industrial school near Lytton and the All Hallows Boarding school at Yale, also carried on by the Church of England. For about 650 children only 125 are thus provided for at these three schools.\n\nThere are no day schools on any of the reserves in this Agency and it would be next to impossible to provide day schools which would be of any service.\n\nThe Penticton Indians have one large reserve about 20 miles long by nearly 10 broad at the foot of Okanagan Lake, and two smaller reserves, one on the opposite side of the lake and the other some distance higher up. So you see that one day school would be of no general service to the Indians of this Band. There are only about 33 children of school age as shown by the last census.\n\nMr Agent Irwin in his last report says that these Indians, who are all Roman Catholics, are\nindustrious and many of them are well-to-do. They are located in the garden of British Columbia and as they are devoting considerable attention to fruit growing, their condition has very much improved within the last year or two.\n\nThese Indians should not be called Siwash which is a term of reproach, and they are temperate and moral, no instances of crime having been brought to the notice of the Department. They do not appear to be suffering from a lack of book-learning.\nOTTAWA, 20th October, 1903\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to that paragraph of your letter of the 1st instant in which you call the attention of the Right-Honorable, the Premier, to the need of education among the Indians of the Penticton reserve, I beg to say that the Department, to whom the matter was referred, regrets that it does not at present see its way clear to provide educational facilities for all the Indians of the Kamloops-Okanagan Agency. There are at now two industrial and one boarding school carried on in this Agency. Owing to the number of small reserves and the scattered locations of the Indians on the larger reserves in this Agency, it would be next to impossible to provide day schools which would be of any service.\n\nThe Penticton Indians are on a large reserve, about 20 miles long by 10 miles broad at the foot of Okanagan Lake with two smaller reserves, one on the opposite side of the Lake, and the other some distance higher up. You will see, therefore, that one day school would be of no general service to the Indians of this band, who have only about 33 children of school age, as shown by the last census.\n\nW. Smythe Barker, Esq.,\nJustice of the Peace,\nCo. of Yale,\nPenticton, B.C.\nThese Indians are all Roman Catholics and are reported to be industrious and, many of them, well-to-do; their condition having very much improved within the last year or two.

Robert Brown,\nSummerland, B.C. 380198.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your request for information about the Indian children attending school here, I may say Johnnie Houghton made good progress in his work. The two little girls did well, considering the time they were in attendance, at the same time remembering they have not yet acquired a very full...\nunderstanding of the English Speech.\n\nWe find the Indian children do very well in mechanical processes, but do not excel in reasoning.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nEtta J. Guilt.\nOttawa, January 9, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nAs you are aware an arrangement was made by the Department whereby the Indian children on the Penticton reserve are allowed the privilege of attending the public school in the neighborhood. Mr. Max Inspector MacDonald writes the Department that these Indians are anxious to have a school established on the reserve. He states that there are between 40 and 50 children of school age and that they have now to walk three miles to the public school.\n\nYou have already been communicated with in regard to the application to have a portion of the funds of the fund used for the erection of a Church building and I have to ask you to submit a full report upon the educational needs of these Indians making any suggestions and recommendations that you may wish to offer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. Robert Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nOttawa, September 20, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to official letter of February 6th, last, and previous correspondence in regard to the establishment of a school on the Penticton Reserve and to ask when the Department may expect to receive your report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. Robert Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 20th ult., file No 249740/1, I beg to say that following your letter of March 9th file No 329913/1, to Inspector Dr K.C. MacDonald in which you stated that action would not be taken with regard to opening School at Penticton until the question of the Enderby School had been given further consideration, I took no action with reference to the Penticton School. I may say however that there are between 40 and 50 children of school age, and that the nearest Provincial school is between 2 and 3 miles distant, where only a very limited number could be accommodated, and that at the time this subject was under discussion the majority of the Indians were in favor of having a school in their midst. I think I can safely say that if the Department are prepared to open a school at that point, the Indians would be agreeable, particularly so, if their old Church building could be utilized for school purposes as they are desirous of building a new church. However if the Department will advise me as to what steps they are prepared to take I will submit same to the Band, and report fully thereon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nSecy.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, October 10, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant in reference to the establishment of a school on the Penticton Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the number of children resident on the reserve would appear to warrant the establishment of a school. The Department, however, is not inclined to incur any large expenditure until the matter has been given a trial. I would ask you to state whether the church building would now be available for school purposes and whether the services of a teacher are likely to be secured. It would be well for you to communicate with the Roman Catholic authorities in reference to the matter. If a building is available you should obtain an estimate of the cost of the necessary furnishings.\n\nWith regard to your inquiry as to what steps the Department is prepared to take I may say that if circumstances justify the salary of a teacher will be provided and the school furnished. As you have already been informed the funds of the band cannot be used to erect a church and it may be that there will be a possibility of utilizing the church building for school purposes.\n\nThe whole matter should be carefully gone into by you and a full report submitted at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Robert Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 10th ult., File 249,740/1., I beg to say that I discussed the matter of a school with the Rev. Father Conan, who is the Catholic Missionary in charge of the Indians, and he was very anxious that a school be established at Penticton, and thought the present church building could be utilized after the first of the year when their new church will be opened, providing the Band was willing. On interviewing the Band they were quite agreeable that the building should be used, but suggested that the Department purchase rather than rent it, but would make no definite statement as to the price. With regard to necessary furnishings, some of the supplies at Enderby could be made use of, if the Department deem it wise and an agreement is reached with respect to the church.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nSecy.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 15, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant in further reference to the establishment of a school for the Penticton Indians.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your remarks that the church building is available are noted. Mention is made, however, of the purchasing of this building and in the same sentence the Department is led to infer that the building is the property of the band. If so the Department does not presume that they wish to have it pay for the building in order to conduct a school for the benefit of their children when it is willing to pay the salary of a teacher and provide the furnishings. If this building is available and if you are satisfied that the Indians would take an interest in the school the Department will transfer the furnishings from the Enderby School, where they are not of use, as soon as assuredly by the Rev. Father Conan that the services of a satisfactory teacher are available.\n\nI may say that for a teacher with professional qualifications a liberal salary will be paid. It may not, however, be possible at the present time to obtain such a teacher, but no doubt the Reverend gentleman will be able to nominate some person with such attainments as will enable her to satisfactorily conduct an Indian School, at least for a time. When you are heard from again the matter will be finally decided upon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Robert Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of letter received from Sec'y. Penticton School Board.

We have as many white children as our rooms at present will accommodate, and as there is now a suitable building on the reserve unoccupied we would like to see a school of their own established there.\n\nKindly let me hear from you, and oblige.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.

Box 215.\nOttawa, March 27, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant enclosing a resolution from the Secretary of the Penticton School Board.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the attitude of the board, it would appear to be necessary to provide educational facilities on the reserve for these children. You state in your letter that at a recent meeting you discussed the subject, hoping thereby to secure a majority in favour of having school of their own. Is the Department to take it from this that the majority of the Indians are not in favour? If they are not the Department would like to know how many children there are who would take advantage of the school and what prospects there are of making a success of it. In official letter of November 15th, last, you were given instructions with regard to this matter, but no reply was received to that communication. Kindly take immediate action and report without any further delay in accordance with instructions contained in that letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. Robert Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSummerland, B.C.\nReplying to your letter of the 27th March File No 249,740/1, I beg to say, that at a meeting of the Penticton Band of Indians held on the 26th Decr 1911, your letter of the 15th Novr was read and explained to the Band, but the majority were strongly opposed to a School being opened, some going so far as to state that when they wanted their children educated they would pay Teachers salary themselves.\n\nAgain on the 12th of February, I read to the Band the Notice from the Secretary of the Penticton School Board stating the Trustees, owing to lack of room, would be compelled to withdraw permission to Indian children to attend, and on taking a vote could only obtain 12 signatures in favor of a School being opened, and I find that out of those who were in favor of having a School there are only 12 children of School age available.\n\nI am afraid under the circumstances it would be impossible to make a success of the school, and that was my reason for not reporting fully at the time. I may state however that the Penticton School Board have not yet carried out their threat to refuse permission to Indian children to attend.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nSecy.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th ultimo in further reference to the establishment of a school at Penticton.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department would not be able to report on this matter again at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLear,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. Robert Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nOttawa, March 1, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nIn 1910 an application was made to the Department on behalf of the Indians of the Penticton reserve for the establishment of a school. The proposal was made to use the church building for school purposes, as the Indians had at this time in view the erection of a new church building, which it is understood has since been completed.\n\nOwing to the number of children of school age on this reserve it would appear advisable to open a day school, if a building in which a school of this kind can be given a trial is available. The Department would be prepared to provide a salary for the teacher and the necessary equipment, etc. I should be glad to have you look into the matter and report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

For two reasons we could not well admit them, even if they desired to do so. Many of the white people object to having their children sit beside the Indian children; besides our clas-\nrooms are so well-filled, it will be necessary for us to open a new Division, and secure a new teacher at a very early date.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\nEtta J. Guill.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nMarch 29, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that the District Band of Indians are willing to have a school opened on the Reserve. The Department has prepared to erect a suitable school house, equip same, and pay a teacher duly qualified a salary on a par with salaries paid by the Public Schools in the Province.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\n[Stamp: Schools Branch]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6406, file 835-1, part 2)\nOttawa, April 5, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo asking if the Department is prepared to erect a suitable school-house on the Penticton Reserve, equip same and pay a teacher provided the Indians are willing to have a school opened on the reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to erect a school on this reserve, but if a suitable building is available the Department would be prepared to provide a salary for the teacher and the necessary equipment. Kindly state whether any building suitable for the purpose could be obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. Robert Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to place before the Department the following facts with a view to an improvement being made in educational matters in the Okanagan Agency. There is but one small school in the Agency, at Osoyoos, which is unavailable for any other Reserves and during the past year I have carefully studied the question of education. In some cases I have succeeded in having Indian children attend the public schools which is undoubtedly the very best means of improving the Indian both in mind and body, but public schools are not often close enough to Reserves to be available, and Indians are not always accepted in them when they are. There appears to be strong objection on the part of Indian parents to allowing their children to attend Industrial Schools. They claim, not without reason, that the children are worked too hard and do not receive the benefit of their labour, and also that when they return to their parents, they are almost strangers and are restless and idle as soon as they are free from restraint. They also claim that they want their children at home out of school hours, which is also natural enough.\n\nI have continually pointed out the necessity of education, and have won over many parents who, a year ago, bitterly opposed any mention of schools, and have even been requested to have teachers brought on the Reserves.\nTwo schools are immediately necessary, one on Okanagan Reserve No. 1 at or near Six Mile Creek and the other on Penticton Reserve near the Church and Council House. At each place there are at least forty and possibly fifty children of school age ready to attend. The two schools, of course, will only represent part of what will eventually become necessary. I have looked over the plans of various small schools built by the Provincial Government for country needs and find that a fifty pupil school with the teacher's rooms could be built for about $3,000., but presume the Department would have plans, etc. suitable for Reserves.\n\nI respectfully request, therefore, that permission and definite instructions be given for the erection of these two schools at an early date.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 5, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo regarding educational matters in the Okanagan Agency and recommending that two schools be built, one on Okanagan Reserve No. 1 and the other on the Penticton Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, while the need of schools in the Okanagan Agency is recognized, the Department has no funds in the current year's estimates to provide the expenditure required in the erection of new buildings. The Department will place an item in the estimates for the next fiscal year for a school building at each of these points, and, if the item is allowed by parliament, will be in a position to have this work undertaken next summer.\n\nI may add that the Provincial Department of Education is being requested to be good enough to furnish plans of a fifty pupil school which would be suitable for the requirements at both these points.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I should be pleased if you would direct that plans of such buildings be forwarded for the information of this Department in the preparation of plans for the new day school buildings which it is proposed to erect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I would point out that this plan provides recreation rooms for the boys and girls, while in the day schools erected by this Department no such provision is made. Instead, however, provision in many cases is made for living quarters for the teacher.\n\nI am enclosing the blueprint for your consideration and shall be pleased to have your views as to whether you consider it would meet the requirements on the two above mentioned reserves by eliminating the recreation rooms and instead providing quarters for a teacher. If you can furnish approximately an estimate of the cost of erecting a building of this kind I should be pleased to have this information, in order, if it is decided to go ahead with the work next summer, the amount necessary can be provided for submission to parliament at the next summer. Any suggestions that you care to make regarding the building will be gladly received. You will be good enough to return the enclosed blueprint to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S. Williams\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nOttawa, October 25, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant enclosing a blue print plan of a large one roomed school building.\n\nIn reply I beg to thank you for this blue print.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S. Williams\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe Engineer,\nDepartment of Public Works,\nVictoria, B.C.\nReplying to your letter of the 25th ultimo with reference to Day School Building on the Okanagan Reserve No. 1, I beg to return the blue print which accompanied your letter. This does not appear to me to be the type of school required on the Indian Reserve. As suggested in your letter, there are features about it which are unnecessary, viz., the recreation rooms for boys and girls, also, the furnace heating.\n\nI have gone carefully into this and find that it would cost about $5,500 to build this school at Six Mile Creek and rather less at Penticton on account of the difference in distance from railroad between the two places.\n\nIn the course of a few days, I will forward a blue print of one of the local schools which appears to meet our requirements at a far less cost. A school house with two or three rooms as accommodation for the teacher could be placed upon the Okanagan Reserve for approximately $4,300.00 and further information will be furnished as soon as I can obtain the loan of the plans of such a building. I will also then reply to your letter of November 10th. on the same subject (which did not bear a file number).\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of October 5th regarding the erection of schools in this Agency when it was promised that an item would be placed in the estimates for a school in Penticton and Okanagan Indian Reserves. Plans were forwarded and the matter left in abeyance. This Agency has probably less facilities for the education of Indian children than any other in the Province, as we have but one school here with nine pupils in the whole Agency. By sending the children to the Public Schools adjacent to Reserves about fifty or sixty more are being educated at very small expense, but the reserves remote from public schools have no facilities at all. On the Okanagan Reserve there are probably seventy-five children of School age and at Penticton fifty and this matter should not be delayed longer than it is absolutely necessary. I hope therefore that at an early date construction of these schools will be commenced.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.J.C. Ball,\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, December 3, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 23rd and 27th ultimo respectively with reference to plans for two day school buildings it is proposed to erect; one on the Okanagan Reserve No. 1 and the other on the Penticton Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, should the item which is being included in the estimates for submission to parliament at its next session for the erection of these two buildings be passed steps will be taken to have these buildings erected next summer and the plan of a smikmak building forwarded by you under cover of your letter of the 27th will receive consideration.\n\nI have to thank you for the trouble you have taken and also for the information furnished by you regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nSir,\n\nFile 249740\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th inst. (no file number) and my reply of the 23rd inst., I beg to report that I have obtained the plan of a plan enclosed herewith, of a small school which would meet the requirements at 6-mile creek, Okanagan Indian Reserve #1. This school has room for 50 desks but is called a 40 desk one-room school. It is economical in construction, the single roof and chimney for school and house reducing the cost materially compared with separate buildings.\n\nThe approximate cost would be $4300 at present prices with a possible reduction in the spring and construction could be carried on in winter as provision is made for either brick or concrete block pillars as foundation.\n\nThe architects whose names appear on this sketch plan have had much experience in school and public buildings and are at present engaged on a large school and also the Bank of Montreal building at Penticton and understand local needs and conditions, and they inform me that schools of this type appear to meet the requirements at moderate cost of small communities.\n\nOn account of the proximity to\ntown of the Indian village on the Penticton Reserve (about two miles) it is possible that a school without teachers accommodation would be more satisfactory and of course could be built for much less than the above figure.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst Deputy & Secretary\nIndian Agent\n\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nARCHITECT.\n\nRegarding the erection of day school buildings on the Okanagan #1 and Penticton Reserves: It will be necessary to provide accommodation at Okanagan for 50 desks and also living quarters for a teacher. At Penticton, seating accommodation for 40 pupils will be sufficient and it will not be necessary to provide accommodation for a teacher.\n\nI may say that the estimates for the current fiscal year provide the sum of $6,000 for a school on the Okanagan #1 Reserve, while the same amount for Penticton was disallowed. Day schools are urgently required on each of these Reserves, as there are no educational facilities provided for the children. I would suggest, if sufficient funds can be supplied, and the Deputy Minister approves, that plans be prepared for both these schools, and tenders called for their erection at the same time.\n\nSites have not yet been selected. The school on the Okanagan Reserve is to be located at or near Six Mile Creek, and the school on the Penticton Reserve near the present Church and Council House. If it is intended to proceed with the erection of these two schools, the Agent should be requested to select a suitable site for each, containing about one acre of ground, which should be level, dry and easily drained, and should be central to meet the requirements of the children on the Reserve.\nOttawa, June 8, 1921.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Sutherland,\n\nWill you please advise me what accommodation should be provided for in the day schools to be erected on the Penticton and Okanagan Indian reserves; also if it is the intention to provide a teacher's residence in connection with these schools.\n\nArchitect.\nI beg to report that Mr. Inspector Megraw has advised me that only one school has been authorized for this Agency and will be commenced this summer, viz., on Okanagan Indian Reserve No. 1, and that the proposed Penticton School has been disallowed. This matter was the subject of several reports which I made last year and the decision is a disappointment. Several Penticton Indians who formerly opposed a school in every way have now changed their attitude completely and were looking forward to seeing their children educated. Two of them told me on my recent visit that if the school was not commenced soon, they were going to send their children to Omak, Wash., Indian School. Most of the educated Indians in the Southern part of this Agency attended United States Schools which is an unfortunate necessity as they return with a wrong perspective of Canadian affairs. The Penticton Public School, like most schools here, is overcrowded (although a new one is being built) so they cannot make room for Indian children.\n\nThere has been an objection to allowing the Penticton Reserve Council House to be used for educational purposes, but under the present unfortunate circumstances, I will approach the people again with a view to obtaining the Band's consent to this building being used for a school until one can be built.\n\nI have tried to reduce expenditure in this Agency to the lowest amount hoping this would assist in having schools built, as I consider education is the greatest need of the Indians here. As a rule they are able to make a good living in spite of their lack of education, but this handicap should be removed from the next generation as competition will be keener when the country around the Reserves fills up with white settlers.\n\nAlthough I do not wish to become importunate in this matter, its necessity in the interest of the Indians of this Agency is so obvious that it would be a neglect of duty if I did not make every effort to assist them, and I respectfully request that education in this Agency is given every possible assistance in future estimates. While\nit is true that some Indian children attend Public Schools, this is most precarious as these schools are apt to close whenever the \"white\" attendance falls below a certain number as is expected at Westbank, or at Larkin where the school is closed on account of a Consolidation School being opened at Armstrong which will not admit Indian children. I only mention these as an example of the difficulties I am experiencing in having some of the children educated. At both these schools, which may not re-open after the summer vacation, there are nineteen children altogether who will have to leave school just as they have got well started in their studies and this, taken in conjunction with the latest information from Mr. Inspector Megraw, is most disappointing.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.G.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan E. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nMr. [signature]\n\nWe should reply to\ngentle letter and express\nhope that we cannot\nundertake erection of either\nof these schools this season.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6406, file 835-1, part 2)\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of letters of the 19th and 26th ult., with reference to erection of schools on Okanagan and Penticton Reserves and note that neither of these schools can be build this season. This is a disappointment to many of the Indians who expected to be able to send their children to school after summer vacation. The only facilities in the Okanagan are the Parkin Public Schools and these schools have now been closed and will not re-open. At Penticton there are six children who will be sent to Omak, Wash. Indian School next month and I consider it unfortunate that they should be sent across the International Line for education. I find that several who have received their education in the United States have become a detriment to the Reserve upon their return to this Side. I hope, therefore, before any other children are sent away that arrangements can be made for their education on this side of the Line. I have tried to find vacancies for them at Kamloops and other Indian Schools, but have not been successful. I may add that your letter of November 10th last indicated that a day school would undoubtedly be built at Okanagan and the Indians were so advised whenever they made inquiries. It may be possible at Penticton to find accommodation temporarily for twenty-five or thirty pupils in the Council-house, but unfortunately the majority dislike the idea of using the Council-house for school purposes.\n\nWill you please inform me whether the Department would consent to employ teachers if temporary\naccommodation for a school can be found.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOTTAWA, July 19th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo in further reference to the erection of day school buildings on the Okanagan #1 and Penticton Reserves.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, owing to the necessity of curtailing expenditure as far as possible, it is regretted that we cannot undertake the erection of either of these schools this season. The question of the erection of school buildings on these Reserves will have to be held over until next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nOTTAWA, April 26th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo, with reference to arranging temporary accommodation for the purpose of providing educational facilities for the children of school age on the Penticton and Okanagan Reserves.\n\nIn reply I beg to say, with reference to Penticton, that it is noted the Band desire to use the priest's house as a temporary school and that you consider it would be satisfactory for the purpose until such time as a new day school building can be erected.\n\nIt is also noted that you are advertising for a teacher, and that it will be necessary for this Department to supply 50 desks and the school materials required. If you are able to obtain the services of a suitable teacher and can arrange with the priest for the use of his house on the Reserve, you may arrange to have it fitted up for school purposes.\n\nRegarding the desks required, it is noted that you consider 50 will be needed. These desks, if purchased now, could be used when the new day school is erected. The Department will approve of the purchase of the number of desks considered necessary by you. You should be careful to ascertain the probable attendance and only that quantity of desks required should be purchased. It is noted in former communications that you state it would be necessary to arrange for temporary accommodation for 25 or 30 pupils of the Penticton Band, but if this is all that would be likely to attend it will not be necessary to obtain desks for a larger number. We will leave this matter in your hands, and expect that there will be no unnecessary desks secured.\n\nIt will be necessary, in compliance with the requirements of the Purchasing Commission of Canada, to obtain competitive prices before making the purchase of these desks. They have directed us to authorize you to obtain quotations from the following firms, in addition to any others you wish, viz:\n\nE. N. Moyer Co. Ltd.,\n10187 - 104th St., Edmonton, Alta.,\n\nE. G. Parnell,\n567 Hamilton St., Vancouver, B.C.,\n\nClarke & Stuart Co. Ltd.,\n550 Seymour St., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIn asking for quotations, you should state that the desks required are \"Single Silent Sanitary Desks\", \"OR EQUAL\". The contract should be given to the firm from whom you obtain the lowest price.\n\nF. J. G. Bell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\n\n- Properly -\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6406, file 835-1, part 2)\nProperly certified accounts, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred, together with a memorandum showing the names of the firms asked to quote a price and the prices quoted, should be forwarded to the Department when payment will be made.\n\nYou will be careful to obtain these desks in the sizes and quantities of each size required.\n\nRegarding the teacher, you should submit for the consideration of the Department the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher secured by you. If a properly qualified teacher is secured, we would be prepared to pay a salary at the rate of $550 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law.\n\nWe will provide a blackboard, school books, stationery etc., as soon as a teacher is secured and a requisition forwarded for the school material required. The size of the blackboard should be given, both length and width of same.\n\nI will be pleased if, at a later date, you will inform me as to the amount of rent, if any, that will be charged for the use of the priest's house during the time it is used for temporary school purposes.\n\nRegarding a school for the Okanagan Reserve, it is noted that it is difficult to find a suitable building in which to carry on the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActg. Deputy Superintendent General.\nI beg to refer to your letter of September 26th, 1921, with reference to arranging temporary accommodation for pupils of the Penticton and Okanagan Bands.\n\nI have been unable to secure the services of a suitable teacher so far, principally on account of the Provincial Government scale of wages being higher than as shown in Mr. Cairns' letter attached. Miss Agnes Reeside of White Rock, B.C., was teacher at the Westbank Forman Public School in 1920 and 1921, where 17 Indian children attended. She was quite successful with these children and I wrote her inquiring whether she would consider teaching Indians on Penticton Reserve. She has replied stating her willingness, but requiring $1,200 per annum, her present salary, which is much in excess of even the maximum Day School salary as shown by Mr. Cairns.\n\nThe teacher he refers to, Miss Lena B. Roberts, has written to me, but I do not think it fair to Mr. Lett, the Foster School principal, to take a teacher from his school. If she is successful there, he will wish to retain her. If she is not, I would not care to have her here.\n\nI have not inquired regarding the teacher mentioned in the last paragraph of his letter, for obvious reasons. These two schools are not suitable for elderly teachers as there will be a certain amount of discomfort, etc., to contend with on account of locality.\n\nI note in your letter that building on both these Reserves may be commenced this year; these Schools are needed as there are no educational facilities in the Agency except one little day-school at Osoyoos with less than a dozen pupils.\n\nWith reference to providing material and desks for the School, these could be used in a permanent school later, the desks required being for children from 7 to 14. Will you please advise me whether I should make a requisition to you for these desks or obtain competitive prices in British Columbia for your consideration. So will be needed to open school with at Penticton.\n\nI am advertising for a teacher now, and hope to locate a suitable one in the near future. The Penticton Band wish to use the priest's house on the Reserve.\nas a temporary school, this is a well built and large house put up by the Band and has never been used on account of the Priest living in town permanently.\n\nOn the Okanagan Reserve there is more difficulty in finding a suitable building.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nPost Office Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nMarch 7, 1922.\n\nFred J.O. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to yours of the 3rd inst., I beg leave to say that the maximum salary for a Day School teacher is $900.00 per annum with two months' holidays, viz., July and August. It is not usual to commence with the maximum.\n\nMiss Lena B. Rewerts, the junior teacher at the Lytton Industrial School, wrote me concerning the salary of a Day School. She would not be any better in that respect than where she is. He is getting $5.00 per month and found. I sent her your address. She may write you. She has a certificate and a few years' experience. Mr. Lett tells me she is young. I have not seen her.\n\nIf she does not write you in due time kindly let me know and I will put you in touch with another teacher who is no longer young, but still capable of rendering good service. She is a qualified teacher.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(SGD) R.H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools.\nOTTAWA, Sept. 9th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, in which you state that it may be possible to arrange for temporary accommodation for 25 or 30 pupils of the Penticton Band in order to provide them with facilities for an education.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that if you can arrange for a suitable building for school purposes in either the council house or elsewhere, the Department will provide a grant for the payment of a teacher's salary. As the erection of a day school building for both the Okanagan and Penticton Reserves may be proceeded with next year, it is not intended that any undue expenditure will be authorized in fitting up a temporary building at the present time for the Indian children of the last named Reserve. We will, however, provide the children with school material and a blackboard; also desks, if the latter are absolutely necessary. If desks are required, you should state the ages of the children for whom they are required. These desks could later be used when the new school building is erected. You may undertake to make arrangements for a suitable building to carry on the work temporarily, and also endeavour to obtain the services of a suitable teacher. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher secured by you should be submitted for the approval of the Department, and you should also state the amount of salary which you consider should be paid.\n\nIf you can make similar arrangements for temporary accommodation at Okanagan you may do so, and the Department will consent to the payment of a teacher's salary, and will provide school material, etc., as mentioned above in the case of Penticton.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

She has been four years in the Katzie Day School - Indian. She is twenty-three years of age. I have no hesitation in recommending her for the position at Penticton. She is now receiving the maximum salary, viz., $900.00 per annum and the bonus. In the case of a transfer she would receive the same salary.\n\nShe had an attack of influenza last Spring. She has been advised to change place of dwelling. I at once told her of the Penticton school, and told her to write you.

Teacher Certificate - valid for life.\nPreliminary and Advanced Diplomas of the Vancouver Normal School.\nStrathcona Trust Certificate.\nAdvanced Certificate of the MacLean Method of Writing.\nFirst Aid to the Injured Certificate.\nHome Nursing Certificate.\nI have had five years experience in an Indian School here and feel fully confident I can render the same satisfactory service at Penticton, should I receive the appointment.\n\nWith regard to references I may name Inspector R. H. Cairns, Vancouver B.C., Acting Indian Agent L. M. Dyneec, New Westminster, B.C., and Rev. E. C. Chirouse O.M.I., Mission City, B.C. The latter will testify to the spiritual training I have given.\n\nIn view of the fact I have rendered five years satisfactory service to the Department, I presume my present salary will continue unbroken, together with the bonus.\n\nI may say I am prepared to make Penticton School worthwhile.\n\nYours, Sir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHelena Coughlan\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of September 9, 1921, with reference to obtaining the services of a teacher for the Penticton Reserve.\n\nI was informed by Mr. R.T. Ferrier when he passed through Vernon recently that a day school for Penticton and Okanagan had been provided for, but if the Penticton school is not completed before school re-opens, the priest's house is available as it is unused, and the Band and the priest are willing for it to be so used.\n\nI now enclose an application for the position of teacher from Miss Helen Coughlan, Port Hammond, which appears to be satisfactory as it is supported by a letter of Inspector R.H. Cairns who knows this lady's qualifications. I have advised her that her application has been submitted to you for consideration, but the question of returning the application blank without a letter upon which I could not advise her. Apparently her principal reason for desiring a change is on account of her health and I have pointed out to Miss Coughlan that this school may be difficult to handle for awhile, and in her own interest to obtain advice as to whether her physical condition would warrant the responsibility.\n\nIn other respects her qualifications appear to be satisfactory and she has had experience with Indian children. As all the Penticton Band are Roman Catholic, she will be qualified in this respect also, although Mr. Ferrier said he will look to me to make this school a success and not to Father Wagner, the parish priest at Penticton who attends to this Band occasionally, and who will not be connected with the School in any way.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant enclosing a copy of a letter which has been sent to Francois Timoyakin with reference to the school.\n\nWhen visiting the Reserve last week, the Chief seemed very down-hearted on account of this man's continual agitation against him because he supported having the school on the Reserve, and the timely letter sent to Timoyakin will have a very beneficial effect.\n\nAs he does not belong to the Penticton Reserve at all, but is a member of the Similkameen, this may be an opportune time to move him back to where he belongs.\n\nI can not find out who told the Indians throughout this Agency that if a school is built on the Reserve, part of the Reserve will be sold to pay for it. I am continually hearing the same thing from one end of the Agency to the other. A few years ago, when Manuel Louie of the Osoyoos Reserve returned from a visit to Ottawa, he told the Osoyoos Band much the same thing and your letter in the matter repudiating every statement he had made had a good effect at that time, and I have heard nothing further since from him.\n\nThe same agitation is going on on Okanagan Indian Reserve No. 1 where a school was built a year ago, and Mr. A.D. MacIntyre, solicitor, of Kamloops, wrote you on their behalf some time ago.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nAs the Indian parents see the improvement which the school has made in their children, opposition is lessening, and I hope in time will disappear.\n\nSchools in this Agency, of course, are an innovation in the past year, and they have not become used to them yet.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 9, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information, a copy of a letter that is being directed to Mr. F.

I consider that the conduct of the school on the Penticton Reserve is in the best interests of the members of the Band.

You wrote back, and asked what School House you were getting, answered that it was a Mission School. But since then have not heard from you; the School House is now finished, but so far the children have not used it. We sent you a petition saying we did not like it. Many other Indians who did not sign there, are ready to do so now, but they do not like it. If you would like to know how many there is, that do not like it, we can send their names, anytime you like.\n\nWe do not want our Reserve broken up, which we are told is likely to be done. We want it to be kept the same (as the Queen in the beginning told us that it should be). We Indian Council and Priest forcing the people to leave the school, and we do not want it. It is the half breeds that are forcing us to leave the school. They are the ones that signed for it, and they have no right to be on the reserve at all!\nwe hope that you will be able to settle this matter for us. If you cannot, we shall have two over the ocean to see the king, and get him to look after our affairs.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

She is at present in receipt of as high a salary as we pay teachers of Indian day schools, except in one or two cases where teachers possess superior qualifications, and have given many years' service. We are, therefore, not prepared to grant Miss Coughlan any increase in salary at the present time.\n\nWe note that there is a good attendance, and that progress is being made in the work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nSir\u2014\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a further application from Miss Helen Coughlan, teacher at the Penticton Indian Day School.\n\nMiss Coughlan is requesting an increase of salary, and as she came to Penticton from the Port Hammond Indian School in September of this year, I do not know when she received her last increase. I presume there is a regular scale of salary for teachers and the Department will have her record on file.\n\nSince coming to the Penticton School her work has been satisfactory and the children have made good progress. I do not quite understand her reasons for an increase, viz. \"dissension among the Band\", as she has nothing to do with the Band and does not live on or near the Reserve. The school is full and has the best support of the parents of these pupils and also of the best Indians on the Reserve and I cannot see how the opposition of some of the older Indians or any dissension among them can affect her in any way. Miss Coughlan has a nervous and highly strung temperament, but appears to know her work and is able to handle the children satisfactorily. As she has been in this Agency only four months, there is nothing else I can say regarding her, but if an increase is due her, I am pleased to recommend it.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit an application for increase of salary. My work on this Reserve is vastly harder and heavier owing to the prevailing discontent among the Band, which I am endeavouring to defeat.\n\nI trust you will appreciate that an annual allowance of $40.00 scarcely justifies the work.\n\nI therefore anticipate the Department's approval.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHelen Coughlan\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I do not understand why this application was made direct unless it may be because other applications she has made for an allowance as janitress and position as field matron for her mother were not recommended. In the first instance only a small building is being used temporarily and I considered the question of janitress could be raised after the new school is built, and in the case of field matron no such position exists on the Penticton Reserve, neither is it necessary. Miss Coughlan was advised what salary she would receive as teacher at Penticton which I understand is the maximum and was given the position at her own request. She is boarding in Penticton about one and a half miles from the school. Should she so desire, there would be no objection to the use of the room above the school for living quarters and Miss Coughlan was so advised.\n\nUnless it is customary to make employees an allowance for board, I cannot see why a precedent should be established in this case, and I cannot therefore recommend the same.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Bali]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 8, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that Miss Helen Coughlan, the teacher lately appointed to the Penticton Indian Day School, has applied to the Department for an allowance for room and board.

I understand from Mr. Ferrier that these schools were to be commenced immediately so that, if possible, they could be ready for opening after the vacation. I have been approached by several Indians as to whether these schools will be built this year as they wish to make arrangements for sending their children elsewhere if there is doubt about them being built. I may say that several Indian parents will send their children to the Omak, Wash., or other United States Schools in preference to Kamloops.\n\nI would appreciate definite information as to the erection of these schools on account of inquiries being made by the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.

We hope to be able to send you these plans in a few days as they are now nearly completed. In the meantime, the teacher will have to carry on without these.\n\nIt is noted that Miss Coughlan, who was appointed teacher, will commence duties as soon as the priest's house is ready.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This priest's house was built by the Band from their own funds and they will give the use of it free of charge as it has never been used by the priest who is also willing that school be opened there. The list is enclosed for your approval. Miss Coughlan asks for abundant black-board space and I note that in your letter you ask me to state the size of the black-board required.

(RG 10, Volume 6406, file 835-1, part 2)\nSir,\n\nI beg to report with reference to the above Indians that on Wednesday last, the 22nd inst., I met him in Penticton while on my way to Similkameen and he asked me to see taxi-driver for him about a disputed bill for car-hire, which I promised to do.\n\nAs I was leaving him I remembered having sent out some notices to Indians whose children were not attending school and told Timoyakin I had sent one to him. He asked me why I did that and I told him that the School had been opened over two years and the Chief had complained about several Indians who were refusing to send their children and wanted some action taken. He then threateningly said \"If you try to send my children to school you will lose your life\". I explained that this was a serious thing to say and told him to retract his statement. I asked him if he meant that he would kill me and advised him to be careful how he answered as he was liable to meet for intimidation. His only reply was \"You will see\", which was practically as much a threat as his other statements.\n\nConsidering the trouble I have had with this man, as the above quoted file numbers will show, I reluctantly laid an information against him and Magistrate Pope of Penticton sentenced him to three months imprisonment. It has always been my personal opinion that Timoyakin is not sane, but in the public good I do not think it advisable to allow him to intimidate in this way. The fact is well known since that Timoyakin was holding meetings of those who opposed the school and has threatened to throw him in the lake if he did not close the school on the Reserve.\n\nTimoyakin has a bad record for intimidation in addition to five years in the penitentiary for stabbing. The Kootenay Power and Light Company employees had to have police protection when working through the Reserve on account of Timoyakin threatening as much the same situation arose when the Kettle Valley Railway branch line was built two years ago. Last year he bought the house on the floor of Penticton shooting ducks on each which is on the edge of the Reserve and tried to intimidate him into paying him a fine. On the man's refusal Timoyakin wrestled the gun away from him in a savage manner, severely bruising him. While the man was committing an offence (although he claimed he did not know it was Indian Reserve at that point) there was no occasion for Timoyakin's savagery.\n\nYou are possibly aware that he claims some kind of special protection on account of certain correspondence he has had with His Excellency the Governor General and also the Prime Minister, and he put up an ingenious defense after telling the Magistrate he wanted...\nto be tried by the \"highest court\" as Mr. Pope has no jurisdiction over Indians. Fortunately Mr. Pope did not understand this although he told Timoyakin he was troublesome, contentious Indian. Mr. Pope told Timoyakin that he could be tried summarily or demanded at the County Court, but Mr. W.J. Kelly, acting for Timoyakin, advised me he is getting the conviction quashed because Mr. Pope did not say that in the letter event Timoyakin would be let out on bail. It will be unfortunate if he is able to quash this conviction as Timoyakin needs the lesson that he is not above the law. His influence among some of the Indians is bad indeed. I do not know whether you would consider it advisable to employ legal assistance to oppose Mr. Kelly's action, but if so it would be necessary to send these instructions. I think the records will show that I have been very lenient with this man, but cannot allow threats of this kind as it is not in the best interest of the Indians themselves to do so.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nFJCB:3.\nOttawa, April 25, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that F.

The discipline is good in both schools and the children very keen. It is much regretted that there is still opposition to the schools among certain of the Bands, these being the troublemakers referred to above. They have no authority to tell the Bands to do anything but support them in this opposition by the authorities at Ottawa! As an example of the way they try to mislead the more ignorant Indians, two of them sent a letter to His Excellency the Governor General. The reply they received was merely an acknowledgement by the Governor General's Secretary, but was sent to them as \"appointing Baptiste Chief, and boss of all the Indian lands\", (Baptiste being one of the archtroublemakers). It can be easily understood how they misled some of the Indians, and I am continually being called upon to refute absurd statements which they make; but as soon as one ghost is laid away, scare up another; usually about half of the majority pay little attention to the agitators and these Indians try to lead them on, but the minority make a great deal of unpleasantness and noise out of all proportion to their numbers. However, the Idle Season is over and they will now settle down to work for another season and will not have so much spare time on their hands to employ in stirring up discontent.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(Sgd.) F. J. C. Ball,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nMarch 7th, 1925\n\nRe File 164-10-1\n\nWith reference to your letter of 9th April, 1925 I beg to forward the following information which has been given me by Indians in this Agency.\n\nFrancois Timoyakin of the Penticton Reserve is again travelling through the Agency with another petition, which you will no doubt receive in due course. At first the petition was to prevent the R.C.M.P. Indian Agent and priest from having anything to do with the Reserve matters, but later a separate petition was sent in regarding the priest, apparently on the advice of certain self-appointed advisers.\n\nI may say that the two Indians mentioned in your letter of 9th April, 1924 as having forwarded the petition against the school, have recently disagreed and Baptiste Chuchuhaskit laid an information before the magistrate at Penticton against Francois Timoyakin for the malicious publication of a warrant for the defendant addressed to him was taken from the Post Office by Francois Timoyakin, who refused to give it up saying \"the information was not good for Chuchuhaskit to know\". As a matter of fact the search warrant disclosed that this letter was merely an acknowledgment of a letter Chuchuhaskit had written to you and contained no other information. Timoyakin was brought before the magistrate at Penticton, who remanded the case. I think the police are charging him only with theft of cattle under the value of $10, and thus reduce the charge from a serious one to a minor offence. In this connection the R.C.M.P. report (copy of which I received) mentioned obtaining a search warrant and being assaulted by the Timoyakin family in executing it.\n\nThere have been a number of liquor cases on the Penticton Reserve recently, several suppliers being arrested by the R.C.M.P. there. In addition, they arrested a negro, several half-breeds and fifteen Indians for gambling. Indian women have complained to me that even their blankets have been lost to them by the Indians gambling and it was certainly time step were taken to try and stop it. But Timoyakin sees an opportunity here for obtaining signatures to another petition. They claimed in Court that the magistrate, police, Indian Agent, etc., have no jurisdiction over the Reserve and I notice in the R.C.M.P. report that the former Agent here, Mr. J.R.Brown, who lives near Penticton Reserve, appeared in Court to help these Indians evade the law and the police bear out what I have known for some time; that much of this petitioning and agitating is prompted by Mr. Brown.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6406, file 835-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nAs an instance of the danger of this attitude that the Indians are not subject to the law while on their Reserve I might mention that when an intoxicated Indian on the Saulteaux Reserve killed his wife about two years ago, the Indians actually held a meeting to discuss whether they should try the Indian in their own council house instead of notifying the police.\n\nThere was no suggestion of persecution by the police in taking action in the gambling case. Even some of the school children were among the number although not arrested. They had chosen a large root-cellar with scouts to give warning and the Chief stated he did not know where the gambling was done, although he knew it was going on. They all pleaded guilty except one and were fined $10.00 each. The ring-leader who had a lawyer to defend him was fined $25.00 and costs. Timoyakin's son and daughter were also fined $10.00 and costs, and any petition, to remove everyone who tries to prevent crime and lawlessness among them, will receive a certain amount of support at such a time.\n\nI considered it advisable to forward these particulars so that you would have information in advance. I do not know the contents of this revised and inspired petition, but would welcome an investigation.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.O.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nFJCB:O.\nSir:\n\nRe: Baptiste George - Pemberton, B.C.\n\nIndian Act\n\nI beg to enclose herewith, for your information, copy of a report dated the 25th ultimo, as received from the Officer Commanding N.

I note with satisfaction that you are hopeful that this action will end the agitation against education by Francois Timoyakin and his faction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBox 693,\nVernon, B. C.\nSir,\u2014\nRex V. Lessard, Manuel, George & Timoyakin\nPenticton Indian Day School\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a cheque for $5.00 representing fines paid by the following Indians of the Penticton Band: George Lessard, Baptiste George, Julia Manuel, Mrs. Francois Timoyakin, under Section 10 (3) of the Indian Act on the 15th inst.\n\nThis represents the termination of the trouble on Penticton Reserve regarding the day school. For two years I have tried to induce every parent to send their children to school and have taken every opportunity of persuading them rather than taking drastic action. With many of them it was effective, but there is a determined section of the Band who have fought against the school from the first. They profess to believe that the Government claims four square miles of land round the school as compensation for the cost of building it. I am convinced that this is taught them by United States Indian women on Penticton Reserve who have married members of the Band. They point out various places in the State of Washington which they say were lost to the Indians in this manner. Penticton Reserve is so near the boundary it is difficult to persuade them that we have absolutely nothing to do with Indian affairs in Washington, but this sect who oppose the school also oppose everything which is done for the benefit of the Band. The leaders are Francois Timoyakin, and I regret to say, Chief Joseph Louie of the Lower Similkameen Indian Reserves. Chief Michele Jack of the Penticton Band has complained bitterly of this Chief's activities among the worst element on his Reserve and I am sending you a separate report on him.\n\nOn the 14th I held a meeting of the Band and explained the whole situation regarding the school and told those who had received summonses that they would be required to attend the Police Court next day to answer them. After the Chief, head-men and I had left the meeting, Chief Joseph called another meeting advising them to pay no attention to the summonses, and in consequence none appeared. Bench warrants were issued for their arrest and they were found by the police holding another meeting at which they had drawn up a petition requesting Chief Michele Jack removed as Chief. This will also be forwarded under separate cover.\n\nThe four mentioned were brought to the Court and charged before me under Section 10 (3) and all pleaded guilty, when they were each fined $2.50 and $2.50 police costs. Their spokesman said they would not pay fines.\nor send their children to school so I committed them to jail for ten days in default. At this they immediately changed their minds and promptly paid up. I warned them that paying their fines did not relieve them from sending their children to school, as they were physically fit to do so having been examined by Dr. McGregor, and that any further failure to obey the law would result in the children being sent to Kamloops Industrial School. I say say that many of the children are anxious to attend but are prevented by their parents.\n\nIt was gratifying to hear the many expressions of approval of these actions from the Chief and other loyal Indians of the Penticton and other Bands. Many of them had driven from fifty to one hundred miles to be present and expressed their entire approval and hoped Chief Joseph Louie would be deposed and prevented from further interference with the Penticton Band.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.S.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nFJCB:O.\nSir:\n\nRe- Old Philip - Penticton, B.C. - Indian Act.\n\nReferring to previous correspondence in connection with the above, I beg to enclose herewith, for your further information, copy of a report dated the 16th instant as received from the Officer Commanding at Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nCortlandt Sternes,\nCommissioner.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nM.

Timoyakin.\nYour File B.28\nE.B.C.\n\nReferring to my letter to your Mr. Chisholm of the 26th inst., I am today in receipt of what I think is a final report on this matter from my agent in Vancouver, Mr. W.J. Baird. A short account of the proceedings herein is as follows: The accused's application first came on before Mr. Justice Morrison, one of the Supreme Court Judges at Vancouver on May 8th. My agent, Mr. Baird, acted on behalf of the Department of Indian Affairs, and Mr. Coulter of Vancouver on behalf of the Provincial Attorney-General's Department, Mr. Richards appearing on behalf of the accused as agent at Vancouver for Mr. W.G. Kelly the accused's Counsel at West Summerland, B.C. The application was adjourned at the request of Messrs. Baird and Coulter in order that they might have an opportunity to further confer on the matter and examine the papers. The adjourned application came on for argument on May 11th. Mr. Baird raised the point as to the lack of 6 days' notice being given of the application for the Writ of Certiorari as is required in our Crown Office Rules.\nThe Deputy Minister of Justice. May 29th, 1925.\n\n(Civil) No. 23. After argument the Judge finally made an Order setting aside his previous Order quashing the Writ of Certiorari. The accused's Counsel then made an application for a Writ of Habeas Corpus. This came on for hearing on May 13th, and was adjourned for a week upon the request of Mr. Baird in order that he and Mr. Coulter might prepare an amended warrant, which would probably stand the test.\n\nThe return for the Writ of Habeas Corpus came up before the same Judge, Mr. Justice Morrison, on the 26th inst., and the accused's application was dismissed. Mr. Richards then made a further application for Certiorari and Habeas Corpus and this came up before another Judge, Mr. Justice Gregory, on the 27th inst., and the accused's application was again refused.\n\nIn order that you may be able to see exactly what has been done in this matter by myself and Mr. Baird, my Vancouver Agent, I am taking the liberty of enclosing to you the complete correspondence file in the matter between Mr. Baird and myself. From this I think you will see that the matter has been exceptionally well handled at Vancouver by Mr. Baird on behalf of the Indian Department.\n\nI also enclose my Bill of Costs in triplicate pursuant to the printed instructions to agents from your Department, which has been handed to me since I first took\nThe Deputy Minister of Justice. May 23rd, 1925.\n\ncharge of this matter by your Mr. Ball, the Indian Agent here.\n\nI also enclose Mr. Baird's Bill of Costs in the sum of $125.00, which I have put in my bill as a disbursement to my agent.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will return the enclosed correspondence file after you are through with it.\n\nI am pleased that the matter has terminated so successfully for the Department. The accused in this case evidently put up quite a strenuous fight, but I think that the ends of justice have been well served by the failure of his successive applications to have the conviction set aside. The accused will now, I presume, serve out his regular term of imprisonment imposed upon him by the Magistrate.\n\nI am handing a copy of this letter to Mr. Bell, the Indian Agent here.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRBE:M\n\nEncl.\nSir,\n\nA.3.E.B.C.\n\nYour reference No. 164-10-1\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of June 12th and to return you herewith account of Mr. R.

The teacher secured by you should be a Roman Catholic, have second class professional qualifications and some teaching experience. The maximum salary we would allow would be at the rate of $105 per teaching month. If considered necessary by you, you may consult Mr. Inspector Cairns before making the appointment. Please inform the Department as to the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher secured and the salary promised.

While at Katzle I was ill and school was closed for six weeks and I received my cheque just the same, as the report went in as \"absent through illness.\" Do you think we should get a substitute to carry on school?

The returns for the Okanagan and Penticton Schools are very unsatisfactory as regards attendance. At Penticton this is deliberate as the Indians are refusing to attend as a protest against the survey of the cut-off which was made this Summer and they are awaiting the return of their Chief from Ottawa before sending their children to school. This attitude is not favoured by a number of the parents who, however, have been intimidated by the majority to conform with the actions of the malcontents. They have promised full support of the school on the Chief's return and I hope to have a more favourable report next time.\n\nAt the Okanagan School the cause of the poor attendance since the school reopened in September is on account of the Indians being absent in the orchards picking apples at which work the children are almost as capable as their parents and some of the families make very good wages. It would be advisable at the Okanagan School to make the holidays somewhat later than at present if this could be arranged, and I will take up this matter further.\n\nAt the small school in Osyopee the attendance is good. On this Reserve the Chief, who is quite progressive and industrious, gives every assistance possible to make his school a success, whereas at Penticton the Chief is opposed to education, which seems to show his unfitness for the rank he holds. The Indians admit that the children who have attended these schools have done remarkably well in the short time they have been in operation and I do not think these temporary difficulties will have any material effect upon the schools.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.

We note that the holidays at present begin and finish too early in the year to meet the conditions in the Indians' mode of life. The Department will await a further report from you, with a recommendation, before the vacation period next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. J. O. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B. C.\nI visited the three day schools in the Agency during September. At Osoyoos there is a full attendance but the Okanagan attendance is affected because so many families are away picking apples. Next week should see an improvement and the question of a change in the vacation period at the schools will be taken up before next year. The holidays commence and finish too early in the year to suit the Indian mode of life. At Penticton the school is temporarily at a standstill until their difficulties mentioned above are disposed of.\n\nF.J.C.Ball,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant and duly received yours of the 23rd ultimo advising me of Mr. Sandby's appointment as teacher of the Penicton Indian Day School.\n\nI have no doubt Mr. Sandby will be quite competent, but the reason the Indians prefer a female teacher is on account of the predominance of girls and also that the former teacher, Miss Coulman, instructed them in domestic science, hygiene and other matters which a male teacher could not, of course, undertake. However, as the appointment has been made, the best will be done under the circumstances.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.T.

Danahy. In forwarding Mr. Danahy's application, he also enclosed a recommendation and certificate of moral character from Rev. Aidan Angle, O.S.B., and the Department approved of Mr. Danahy's appointment. We note, however, that the Indians would prefer a female teacher and that Miss Helen Pelter has been recommended for the position. If Mr. Danahy does not accept, please forward full information regarding the qualifications which Miss Pelter possesses, when favourable consideration will be given to her appointment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Danby for the position of teacher at the Penticton Indian Day School vice Miss Helen Coultham, resigned. In your letter to me of June 4th, File 164-10-1, you instructed me to make necessary recommendations and I presume Mr. Danby is in possession of these.\n\nThe Indians would prefer a woman teacher in place of Miss Coultham as most of the pupils are girls. Miss Helen Porter has been recommended by several priests and sisters of a convent she has attended. Miss Porter has had six months training in the Normal School of Bellingham, Washington and I have written her for information as to whether she holds any certificate.

I should be grateful if you would let me know if you consider it advisable to have this day school remain closed indefinitely. Or do you believe that it should be re-opened when the chicken pox epidemic will no longer interfere with the attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

I found that a number of the Indians are suffering from a severe chicken-pox and the medical officer considered it inadvisable to hold a meeting and for the same reason it was necessary to close the school for the time being.\n\nF. J. C. Ball,\nIndian Agent.\nVernon, B.C., Oct. 25, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 1st ultimo, I beg to advise that I visited the Penticton Reserve on the 22nd instant.\n\nAs the school has had to be closed I have taken up the matter with Inspector Pragnell of having the teacher, Mr. Danahy, transferred to Kamloops Industrial School where he was formerly employed rather than remaining idle in Penticton.\n\nF. J. C. Ball.\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\u2014 File 164-10-1.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant with reference to the closing of the Penticton Indian Day School. I have kept in close touch with the situation and find that the Chief, Michele Jack, is the strongest influence against the school which, I imagine, shows his incompetence to be the leader of the Indians of the Penticton Band. I hope to send a more detailed report regarding this Chief who has always received every support I can give him, but on account of some of his actions recently, he is fast losing the support and sympathy of his Band.\n\nThe Medical Officer considered it would be safe for the children to return to school on the 5th instant and on my last visit to Penticton, the teacher advised me that he expected to have full attendance in the near future. I received a phone call from the father of some of the school children asking me on no account to allow the teacher to leave or to close the school longer than necessary.\n\nI am leaving for Penticton tomorrow on other business and will look further into the matter. I would respectfully recommend that no action be taken towards closing the school. Those Indians who are opposed to it are in the minority and represent the worst element of the Band. Their noisy tactics give the impression that they are stronger than is really the case. The Rev. Father Wagner, who is the missionary for this district, is giving me his support in trying to improve the attendance at the school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.

We have noted the qualifications which she possesses, also that her appointment is approved by Rev. Father Welch, New Westminster, and Rev. Father Wagner, Penticton.

At the time of Mr. Danahy's appointment the Reverend Father Welsh of New Westminster and Reverend Father Wagner of Penticton recommended Miss Helen Felter, 715 Royal Avenue, New Westminster, B.C., for the appointment.\n\nMiss Felter advises me that she completed High School with the Sisters of St. Anne's Academy, New Westminster, also six months normal course in Bellingham. I am writing to her for the necessary certificates and would respectfully recommend her appointment.

He should prepare a return showing the attendance and days taught during the current month, and this should be forwarded in order that payment of the salary due him can be made.\n\nIt will be necessary to obtain the services of a teacher to succeed Mr. Danahy, and I have to request that you will consult Mr. Inspector Cairns and the Church authorities interested with a view to obtaining a suitable teacher to begin duties on or about the 1st of February next. In your letter of July 27th, last, you stated that the Indians would prefer a woman teacher, as most of the pupils are girls. If you consider that the services of a woman teacher would be more satisfactory for this school, you should endeavour to obtain a qualified female teacher.

J. C. BALL,\nIndian Agent,\nVERNON, B. C.\n\nAppointment Miss Pelter teacher Penticton school at salary ninety dollars per teaching month has been approved as per official letter to you twenty-seventh instant.\n\nJ. D. McLEAN.\nJanuary 22nd, 1927\n\nSir,\n\nRe Penticton School\n\nI have the honour to report upon conditions on Penticton Indian Reserve in connection with school matters with a view to obtaining your advice and instructions.\n\nThe school question is inextricably entangled with other matters which I will endeavour to lay before you as fully as possible. The Penticton Band comprises some of the most progressive and some of the least progressive Indians in the Agency. The Chief, Michele Jack, is a weak vacillating person who has no authority among the Band and is mistrusted by both parties. When speaking to me he always professes to be in favour of the school but before the other Indians he seems to curry favour with the malcontents if they are in the majority, although he apparently signed the petition for the school (as per attached copy).\n\nNot much harm would be done if those opposed to the school did not send their children to it, but the more serious aspect of the matter is that they are intimidating those who are sending their children, and these people being in the minority are now saying that unless all the children are forced to attend, they will of necessity be compelled to remove their children from the school.\n\nIn order to have a thorough airing of the whole trouble I held a meeting on the 13th instant, which was well attended by both factions. Previously I visited the school and found only nine pupils present instead of twenty-five or more who should have been present. I explained the necessity of the school and pointed out the provisions of the \"Indian Act\" compelling attendance so that they could thoroughly understand attendance at school was not a matter for them to decide among themselves. This precipitated trouble and some very strong speeches were made, including a request to depose the Chief immediately.\n\nFrom the long harangues from six or seven of them I find that the principal reasons for their opposition are as follows:\n\n1. That a few miles south of Penticton in the State of Washington, the reservations have been thrown open to settlement and the land sold to pay for the construction of schools and educational expenses of the Indian children, and the same would occur in Penticton.\n2. That only a year or two after the Penticton school was built 14,060 of their Reserve is taken from them, supporting their contention as above.\n\n3. That Indians do not need education and if all the children are educated they will become like white people and will eventually sell their reserve.\n\n4. That they are opposed to accepting the money expended on the school and its maintenance as it will have to be repaid in some way or other, either by further confiscation of their land or taxation.\n\nIn addition to these points some of them went further and said the \"Indian Act\" was nothing to them, they were Indians and no law made by white people had any effect upon them. Dominick Paul said the Indians intended making their own laws, in future appointing their own chief and policemen and no white people or others would be allowed on the Reserve. There was considerable Bolshevistic talk also, which shows of course that many of these Indians are being badly advised. Baptiste Chuchuheskit is one of the most ignorant and most troublesome Indians I have ever met and he is the man they want for Chief. He said they intended to close the school, and prevent any children entering. I listened to them for several hours, and have never heard at any meeting so much stubborn ignorance and conceit.\n\nThe more progressive Indians and those in favour of the school were outnumbered and none had the courage to speak. I asked the Chief, as usual, to speak first, and he said it was no use for him to speak, they were all against the school.\n\nIf these Indians are allowed control of school matters it will have the worst possible effect, not only on Penticton Reserve but also on the other Reserves wherever schools are operating. Chief Baptiste George of Inkaneep Reserve (Seyoces) is watching the Penticton matter very closely, he is a strong supporter of the school on his reserve, but says he has a continual fight with some of his Band in consequence. As I left his Reserve after a meeting there on the 13th he asked me to tell him the result of my meeting the next day at Penticton and earnestly advised me to keep the school open at any cost. It is interesting to note that without a single exception, those Indians who oppose the school do not work their land, live under poor conditions and are usually dirty and unkempt in their homes and persons compared with those who support the school.\n\nWe appear to have arrived at a point where a decision will have to be made between closing the school or enforcing attendance. If the school is closed it will be a retrograde step which will take many years to overcome and may have far-reaching consequences, not only in this Agency but even further afield. It will mean peace on the Reserve for awhile at least, but not in the best interests of the Indians.\n\nIf the school is to be kept open, provision must be made to enforce attendance and protect those who are supporting it. This will necessitate the employment of a truant officer who will doubtless be strongly opposed in the execution of his duty. It will also be necessary...\nto arrange to send the physically fit children to Kemloops Indian School who are prevented by their parents from attending the day school. The prosecution of an Indian and the imposition of a small fine under the \"Indian Act\" has no effect unless the parents realise that the next step is compulsory attendance either on the Reserve or at Kemloops. As a matter of fact they treat the fines with levity. The Indians have had a start given them among those already attending because a male teacher was appointed last September, but he has resigned and a female teacher will be recommended, commencing her duties about February 1st.\n\nI have taken the liberty of reporting at length, perhaps some of the information being considered irrelevant. I was warned long ago not to attempt education in this Agency, one of the Indians going so far as to threaten my life, but unless a beginning is made I do not see how there can be any hope of making decent citizens of the Okanagan Indians.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.O.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan C.

There are about 28 children between the ages of 7 and 14 in our Reserve, all who should have the benefit of a school. We cannot any longer see them growing up in utter ignorance of education and look at it in silence. Their future welfare demands that the Government treat them in the same manner as other Indian tribes throughout the country by giving us a school and teachers.\n\nMost of our young, grown up people feel with sorrow their lack of education, and not a few of them are trying the almost impossible task of instructing themselves during their spare time, in their eagerness to acquire at least some rudiments in reading and writing.\n\nSome of us parents make the sacrifice of sending our children to the far away schools at Kamloops, B.C. or Omaha, N.S., U.S., but this can only be done by a few, and only for too short a time on account of the money inconvenience, and most of the time those schools have not sufficient room to accommodate our children.\n\nWe kindly ask you as our Agent to strengthen this, our petition by your own support, and to forward it to the Government headquarters.\n\nIn hope that the Government will soon do something to remedy their shortcomings of our civilization.

The Indian Agent says we must send them to the school provided. But we do not want too. Last year five of us were arrested, one sent to prison for three months, the other fined. Recently the Indian Agent was here, and said he would give us 10 days to obey, then after that he was going to have us arrested. He, the Indian Agent said that he should appoint a Constable, from among the Indians who obeyed the law, and that the others would have no say in the matter. We claim that all should have a voice in the matter. Will You let us know if the Indian Agent has the power to do that himself, whether You sent him to be the chief ruler over us. And if we have any say ourselves as to who shall be over us. We should like to send our children to what school we would like, and also how many of them should go. Before You discovered this Country...\nWe educated our children by the seven laws of nature, and would like to do the same now. We are ready to obey the laws of the country, but would like to be able to educate our children the way we think best.\n\nWe would like you to open the Court House in Ottawa so that we could come to you there in person and explain our case ourselves.

If you will refer to your files 25 D 62 J and 25 D 497 J, you will find that your Penticton detachment gave us much assistance at that time. Mr. Indian Agent Ball, of Vernon, in whom I have considerable confidence, informs me that a second crisis in the affairs of the day school on the reserve has arrived. It is his belief that we will either have to close the school or enforce attendance. I need not point out that, if the school be closed, it will have a very harmful effect on the Okanagan Indian groups.\n\nWould it be possible to detail a constable of your Penticton detachment for special duty under our Mr. Ball for a few weeks?

Mr. King's private secretary acknowledged the letter, stating that it was being referred to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs. The Honourable Mr. Stewart has handed this letter to me. I am not writing direct to Timoykin. I should be pleased if you would let him know that his letter has been received and that it is our intention to continue the Penticton Indian Day School, which all eligible Indian children should attend. Timoykin asked for permission to come to Ottawa. You might explain the folly of this action and tell him he had better stay at home.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBox 693,\nVernon, B. C.\nSir,\n\nRe File 164-10-1\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of the 12th inst. regarding the resignation of Mr. James A. Danahy, teacher of Penticton Indian Day School. I wrote you on the 21st inst. regarding Miss Helen Pelter of New Westminster, B.C. who had been recommended by Rev. Father Welsh and Rev. Father Wagner. Mr. Inspector Cairns is also willing to recommend the appointment, and I respectfully request authority by wire to notify Miss Pelter to commence her duties as soon as possible in order to avoid the school being closed after Mr. Danahy's departure.\n\nI presume a salary of $900.00 per annum would be paid to Miss Pelter, and have sent you night lettergram in this matter today.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nFJCB:C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report, in reply to your letter of the 4th ultimo, that the Penticton Indian Day School matter came to a head on Tuesday, the 15th instant, Timoyakin being the principal actor, although it must be admitted there are three others, Dominick Paul, Dominick Buckley and Baptiste Chuchuhaskit, equally as bad as Timoyakin. The names of these four should be noted, as all trouble on Penticton Reserve is caused by one or all of them.\n\nI was called to Penticton to meet the Grazing Commissioner on the 17th regarding co-operation in a clean up of wild horses on the ranges, and whilst discussing the matter with him received a message to the effect that the R.C.M.P. had been requested in trying to make some arrests on bench warrants of stipendiary Magistrate Pope of Penticton. I left immediately for the barracks and was present when the two constables made their report to the R.C.M.P. Inspector, one of them had been appointed trust officer and summonses had been issued to several of the Indians for non-attendance. No notice was taken of the summonses and the magistrate ordered arrests to be made. When the constables arrived on the Reserve they found about 40 of the malcontents, male and female gathered at Francisco Timoyakin's house. A warrant was handed to Timoyakin who at first said he would go and talk to the magistrate. Baptiste Chuchuhaskit, who seems to be considered a chief by these unruly members of the Band, told Timoyakin he must not go, they would stay on the Reserve. An attempt was then made to arrest Timoyakin, but the Indians gathered round the constables threateningly. Fortunately the two constables, Rivett-Jarnac and Woodcock, took a sensible view of the matter. They felt that the original offence was only a trivial one and they did not wish the Indians to commit a greater offence by obstructing or assaulting the police, so they returned to barracks to report.\n\nThe Inspector ordered the three constables to accompany him to the Reserve to make the arrests. I asked him to give me an opportunity to persuade the Indians not to get into trouble etc. I went out ahead of the police and found the Indians congregated in the Council House. Neither the Chief nor any of the decent law abiding Indians were present. Baptiste Chuchuhaskit met me and said the Indians were not going to allow white policemen on the Reserve and that the magistrate could not try Indians; they made their own laws and had their own Indian judges etc. I told him he was creating trouble for himself and the other Indians if he advised them in this way. Led by the four mentioned above they commenced milling around and shouting that they would not let the police arrest them. I pointed out that their own Chief was not present and they said he was a white man anyway because he wanted the school and was no Chief of theirs. By this time the police had arrived and the Inspector entered the room, he told them he had warrants for four of\nthem, that the charge was a trivial one involving only a $2.00 fine, but they had disobeyed the summons and he had come to take them. As they only shouted at him he called in the Constable and ordered them to make their arrests. Constable Rivett-Carnac touched Timoyakin on the shoulder as he sat on a form and told him he was under arrest, when Timoyakin immediately struck at the Constable who then took a hold of him and dragged him to his feet. This started a general fracas, men and women joining in, and it was impossible to see very much as I was busy keeping Chuchuheskit and Dominick Paul from actively taking part. The police handled the situation with restraint, even when one of them was dragged to the ground by Timoyakin and dozen men and women. They eventually got Timoyakin into their car although he fought every inch of the way. When they fell, he sustained a scalp wound by hitting the side of the form. Only three blows were struck by the police who were bleeding from scratches and had dislocated his thumb. During the melee Timoyakin's wife was knocked down; she is a veritable virago. The police then returned and took four or five of the more active Indians, including one young woman and returned to town. I stayed at the Council House and made those who remained there feel very much ashamed of themselves for their foolishness. Chuchuheskit and Dominick Paul refused to say anything and I could see that they all felt their position. I might say that during the melee no attempt whatever was made to offer the slightest violence to the Inspector or me.\n\nThe Indians were placed in jail and I asked the Medical Officer to accompany me when he examined them, but their injuries were not slight. By this time they all seemed in good humour. Next day they were brought before Stipendiary Magistrate Pope, charged with obstruction and were each fined $10.00 and costs except Timoyakin, who was considered the ring-leader his fine being $100.00 and costs. They were all defended by Mr. Woodward, Barrister of Penticton, but pleas of guilty were made.\n\nThe school cases were also tried and disposed of. Timoyakin had the day before this trouble taken his own child and four others to Nicola, a provincial government school about 30 miles from Penticton, and Mr. Pope dismissed the charge against him in consequence.\n\nI found Mr. J.W.S. Logie of West Sunderland in close conference with some of these trouble-makers when the Indians were placed in custody, but one of them saw me and immediately stopped talking and went away. Logie is a clever man, an idealist and also the leading Communist in the district. I think the R.C.M.P. have certain information about him. It is unfortunate that some action cannot be taken against people of this kind. His theories are dangerous to Indians, although I believe he has no intention of causing actual trouble among them, but the fact that these malcontent Indians say they are going to run the Reserve without schools, or churches or agents or any other white people shows the result of his teachings even if he does not actually preach against religion, law and order.\n\nYesterday I went out to the Reserve and met the Indians who had paid their fines and returned home. They were all at their homes or on the road, I do not think they intended holding any meeting. I found trouble-makers present from all the other bands, William Madeleine of Salmon River, Edward Joe of Osoyoos and several others. The Chief claimed he was too sick to have been present at the council house.\nwhen the trouble occurred and all the law abiding Indians said they were glad something had been done - they were being threatened continually for supporting the school. Many of them came to Penticton during the evening to express their satisfaction, and at one house where the father Harry Pete, had been afraid to send his children to school, the wife and daughters begged me, with tears in their eyes, to make Harry Pete send them back to school as they wanted to go. I have done this and these children are back again.\n\nWhile these troublesome Indians make most noise, almost without exception they are the ones who do as little work as possible and make no use of their large holdings of land. Tinyakin is the exception, he is a fairly good worker. I hope some day he will have a change of heart and become a law-abiding and useful Indian.\n\nAs I have reported on before, the school trouble is really the result of the cut-off at Penticton Reserve and the most absurd statements are made by the Indians on every occasion to the effect that the rest of the Reserve will be sold to pay for the school; recently they say they have been told that four square miles around the school will be sold. At innumerable meetings I have tried to reassure them and they say it will be done without my knowledge or theirs either. The cut-off has made more trouble than it is worth. The 14,060 acres is almost worthless to anyone, white or Indian, except to raise a few head of stock. It will be many years before the feeling against it is eradicated. The past three days have been a rather trying experience, but I hope everything will now settle down peaceably. The school attendance is improving already and its strongest supporters are the pupils themselves, past and present.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.O.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan O.Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nFJCB:G.\nRe: Mary Manuel (Indian): Penticton, B.C.\n\nSection 169 C.C.of C.\n\nWhile at the Penticton Indian Reserve, March 15th, 1927, with Reg.No.7635, Cpl.O'Reilly, Reg.No. 9935, Cst.Carmac, C.R., Reg.No.10109, Cst.Woodcock, R., and P.J.C.Ball, Esq., Indian Agent, executing Warrants for the arrest of Francois Tinoyakin, George Lessard, Mrs.Manuel Basil, and Joe Paul, Indians\u2014the above named actively assisted in the attempt to resist arrest, by attacking and generally obstructing the Police, so much so, that it was necessary to arrest her and convey her to the Penticton Municipal Lock-up; this took place about 2 pm.

Arrests ensued because of interfering with the police in the discharge of their duties. Among those arrested were Francois Timoyakin, George Lessard, Conrad Sam, John Smith, and William Grange.\n\nThe evidence shows Inspector R. L. Callicott of the R.C.M.P., and of Constables Carrock and Woodcock was to the effect that the Indians tried to arrest Timoyakin, the Indians refused to be arrested in a manner and they were unable to carry out their demands.\n\nTOUGH DAY OUT.\n\nReturning in the afternoon, escorted by Corporal O'Flynn and the Indians, Sergeant Woodcock and Carme attempted to arrest Timoyakin, when they were met by a crowd from twenty-five to thirty men and women. A free fight ensued, and the Indians tried to escape, but the officers had to battle their way to the schoolhouse. The backs, heads and faces were in evidence in the courthouse, here and there, on the streets and in the alleys. The officers' uniforms were also badly damaged.\n\nThe accused were fined $15 each and costs each.\n\nGAUDE TROUBLE.\n\nTimoyakin has been active among the Okanagan Indians on the Penticton reserve for several times past, and has caused much anxiety to Indian Agent Hall. The band is now being moved to another place where the government intends to take from them the land on which the school is built. Timoyakin wrote to Ottawa complaining of the treatment he received. There is no reason for their discontent, however, except that they are opposed to the fact that 14,000 acres of the reserve lands on the west side of Okanagan Lake have been taken from them some time ago, and they are afraid a similar course will be followed to take away the school built on the reserve by the government.\n\nMr. E.

They were convicted and fined $10 apiece.\n\nThe evidence of Inspector R. L. Cadzow, the constables and of Constables Carnack and Woodcock was to the effect that when the constables tried to arrest Timoyakin, the Indians gathered in a threatening manner and they were unable to carry out their duties.\n\nReturning in the afternoon, accompanied by Corporal O'Reilly and the Indians Argosy, Woodcock and Carnack attempted to arrest Timoyakin, when they were attacked by from twenty-five to thirty men and women in a free fight. The place in the council hall and the officers had to battle their way to the door with the prisoners. Cut heads and faces were the evidence in the courthouse here as evidence of the severity of the melee.

Woodcock to apply for warrant, which was issued, and in company with Reg. No. 9835, Const. Woodcock proceeded to the Penticton Indian Reserve in order to effect the arrest, but so threatening was the attitude of the Indians, of whom some thirty or more were assembled to prevent arrest, that the Constables in question desisting the matter too serious to proceed with without further instructions reported to me.\n\nOn receipt of this information I proceeded to the Indian Reserve, with Mr. Ball, the Indian Agent, directing Reg. No. 7635, Cpl. O'Reilly, J.R., Reg. No. 9925, Const. Carmac, C.M., and Reg. No. 10109, Const. Woodcock, F., to follow.\n\nI entered the Council House on the Reserve where the Indians were all congregated and, at Mr. Ball's request, went outside, allowing him an opportunity to address the Indians. While some time elapsed I entered, and seeing that Mr. Ball was making no headway, I told the Indians briefly and clearly that I had come out to arrest certain members of the Band, among which was the accused, for which I had warrants, etc., and that they would have to come. In the meantime Cpl. O'Reilly, Cpl. Carmac and Woodcock had arrived, I ordered them into the Council House and pointing out the accused ordered Cpl. Carmac and Woodcock to arrest, immediately on these Constables laying hands on the accused a general melee took place, some 25 to 30 men and women attacking the Police. The arrest was finally effected some 40 or 45 minutes later and the accused placed in Police car, together with 8 other prisoners and taken to the Penticton Municipal Lockup.\n\nCpl. O'Reilly laid Information and the accused appeared before T.A. Pope, Esq., Police Magistrate, Penticton, B.C., at 10 am on March 16th, 1927, under a charge, Section 169(a) Criminal Code \"did wilfully obstruct a peace officer in the execution of his duty.\" He was represented by Counsel, W.A. Woodward, Barrister, Penticton, B.C., and entered a plea of Not Guilty to the charge. The evidence for the prosecution was given by myself, Constables Carmac and Woodcock, and Mr. Ball, Indian Agent, all of which went to show that not only did the accused obstruct and resist a Peace Officer in the execution of his duty, but that actually assault had taken place; each witness was more than corroborated. In the defense, Mr. Woodward, Barrister, admitted the charge but submitted that the accused was acting under misapprehension in the fact that he understood that the Government would deprive them of their land if they sent their children to school.\nSCHOOL,\n\nconsequently he being an ignorant Indian, there was some colour of right for his action. He then put the accused on the witness stand and asked him to tell the Court his side or view. The accused entered into a long rambling account of how the Government had robbed them of their lands and also that they wanted to build their own school, etc., I recalled Mr. Ball, in rebuttal, showing that the accused and all Indians had been repeatedly informed to the contrary.\n\nThe Defence Counsel also objected to our authority in enforcing Section 10, Indian Act, by compelling children, as specified therein, to attend school; whereas we were specifically appointed as Truant Officers by the Supt. General of Indian Affairs, the objection was overruled after considerable wrangling and the accused was sentenced to pay a fine of $100.00 and costs, in default of payment 6 minimum months I.N.L.-Fine and costs paid.\n\nI would say that respecting the objection of the Counsel for the Defence that it is unlikely the Police will be upheld in the future unless armed with appointment from the Supt. General of Indian Affairs, in compliance with Section 10 of The Indian Act.\n\nI have requested this appointment in a letter to you of today's date. The urgency of this is apparent insofar as notwithstanding the action already taken by us to compel school attendance so far is not being complied with and I anticipate and perhaps more serious trouble.\n\nNo more force than was absolutely necessary was used in effecting these arrests and the restraint and good temper shown under very trying circumstances by Cpl. O'Reilly and Constables Garnes and Woodcock, especially the two Constables who suffered considerable abuse and injury, was wholly commendable and I desire to bring it to your notice.\n\nCosts taken by R.O.M.P.,\nArrest - Cst.

L. Cadby, the Royal Canadian Constables Carman and Woodcock was to the effect that when the constables tried to enter the council hall again, the Indians gathered in a threatening manner and they were unable to carry out their duties.\n\nFOUGHS WAY OUT.\n\nReturning in the afternoon, the patrol by Inspector Cadby and the Indian agent, Woodcock and Carman attempted to arrest Timoyakin, when they were attacked by from twenty-five to thirty men and women. A free fight took place in the council hall and the Indians rushed out and way to the door with their prisoners. Cut heads and faces were in evidence in the combatants, but there was none of the severity of the melee. The officers' uniforms were also badly damaged.\n\nThe accused were each fined $5 each.\n\nSECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR\n\nGATEWAY TO CANADA\n\nThere has been a great deal of trouble among the Okanagan Indians on the Penticton reserve for some time past and has caused much anxiety to Indian Agent Hall who has been under the impression that the government intended to take away their land. Although the school was recently built, and Timoyakin wrote to Ottawa complaining of the proposed invasion. There was some reason for their discontent, however, since the Indians protest largely to the fact that 14,000 acres of the reserve lands on the west side of Okanagan Lake have been taken from them long ago, and they are afraid a similar course will be followed to pay for the school and other improvements by the government.\n**INDIANS ATTACK MOUNTED POLICE**\n\nRefused to Send Children to School\u2014Warrants Issued For Arrest\n\nPUT UP FIGHT\n\nMen and Women Join in Melee\u2014Several Injured\u2014Lenient Sentences.\n\nArising out of the refusal of several Indians on the reserve to send their children to school and an effort on the part of the officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted police to serve them with warrants for arrest charges under section 169 of the Criminal Code of Canada of interfering with the police in the discharge of their duty were laid against Francois Timoyakin, George Lessard, Cosmus Sam, Julia Maracle and Willis Ignace. They were brought before Magistrate Pope in the local court Tuesday, the school cases being disposed of by a fine of $10 and line, principally white men, who do not understand the difference in the laws of the States and Canada, predict similar conditions here, the simple Indian believing.\n\nRefusal to send their children to school is a protest against imagined injustice, and led to defiance of the law as exemplified in the recent attack on the Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers when they attempted to arrest the ringleader. A big responsibility rests on those who misrepresent facts to the aboriginal whose mental capacity cannot grasp the subtle insinuations of the peace disturber.\n\nMagistrate Pope imposed fines of $10 each on each of the accused, but pointed out the law provides the penalty of $50 fine or imprisonment for two years. He took the case because of the wrong impression they held of the intentions of the government in connection with the reserve. Mr. Ball also pleaded for leniency for the accused, stating they had been influenced by others to resist arrest.\n\nOn behalf of Francois Timoyakin Mr. Woodcock claimed there was no assault made by his client except that he refused to be handcuffed. The evidence of Inspector Cadie of the R.C.M.P. and of Constables Carnac and Woodcock was to the effect that when the trouble began, three officers arrest on the morning of Tuesday, the Indians came in a threatening manner and they were obliged to carry out their duties. Returning in the afternoon, Mr. O'Reilly and the Indian agent, Mr. F. J. C. Ball, Woodcock and Carnac attempted to arrest the Indians when they were attacked by 25 to 30 men and women. The melee fight took place in the school hall and the officers fought their way to the door with their prisoners. Cut heads and faces were the evidence of the severity of the melee. The officers' uniforms were also badly damaged.\n\n---\n\n**INDIAN UNREST**\n\nAmong the causes for the present unrest of the Indians on the Penticton Reserve, as stated by Indian Agent Ball, is the untruthful assertions of white agitators that it is the intention of the government to confiscate the land on which the new school on the reserve was built.\n\nAs a matter of fact there is not the slightest ground for such a misstatement. Indians do not get the white man's angle where confiscation of property plays a part and the taking from the local reserve recently of 14,000 acres on the east side of the lake, has served to arouse suspicion of the further intentions of the government.\n\nIn the United States certain lands are taken and used for the education of Indian children, funds being raised by sale or rental of the estates appropriated for that purpose. In Canada no such methods exist. On the contrary the government provides the money for the education of the Indian. Agitators from across the line, principally white men, who do not understand the difference in the laws of the States and Canada, predict similar conditions here, the simple Indian believing.\n\nMagistrate Pope concurred and Mr. F. J. C. Ball asked to take a place on the bench. Indian Agent F. J. C. Ball also gave assistance during the hearing and put out several points in connection with the grievances of the Indians. All the Indians except Timoyakin pleaded guilty to the charges of obstruction, but claimed they only did so when one of their women was being undressed.\n\nMagistrate Pope imposed fines of $10 each on each of the accused, but pointed out the law provides the penalty of $50 fine or imprisonment for two years. He took the case because of the wrong impression they held of the intentions of the government in connection with the reserve. Mr. Ball also pleaded for leniency for the accused, stating they had been influenced by others to resist arrest.\n\nTimoyakin has been active among the Okanagan Indians on the Penticton reserve for some time past and has caused much anxiety to Indian Agent Ball. Timoyakin wrote to Ottawa complaining of the supposed injustices. There seems to be some discontent, however, apart from the present trouble, in the fact that 14,000 acres of the reserve west of Okanagan lake were taken from them some time ago and will be sold. Similar courses will be followed to pay for the school built on the reserve by the government.\n\nMr. T. B. Williams, secretary of the Band Council, waited on the council with a request for a grant of $500. The matter was laid over for the completion of the estimates.\nWest Kootenay Sub-District Office.\n\nPenticton, B.C., March 18th, 1927.\n\nThe Officer Commanding,\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police,\nB.C. District, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have the honour to request that Mr. No. 10109, Sgt. Woodcock, R.C. (who at present is detailed for work on Indian Reserve in accordance with your instructions of 17-2-27) be appointed a Truant Officer within the meaning of Section 10 paragraph 2, of The Indian Act, which I submit calls for specific appointment. At any rate during recent trials held here the Defending Lawyer contended that the Police did not have the powers of Truant Officers without such appointment and, although I managed to sustain our right to the satisfaction of the Court, I feel convinced that a specific appointment is necessary under the hand and seal of the Supt. General of Indian Affairs.\n\nI may say that it is more than likely that more trouble will take place here respecting the Indians; they are at present very hostile and determined to resist, the last fracas may or may not have had a good effect. Consequently the matter of appointment, as requested, is all the more urgent, as I cannot afford to go into Court without being fully armed and protected as to procedure and authority.\n\nCopy of this letter forwarded to Mr. Ball, Indian Agent, Vernon, B.C.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInsp.\n\nR.L.

I would request that these appointments be expedited, so that our authority in that respect cannot be questioned.\n\nI attach hereto a further report by Inspector Cadieux, bringing up the point as to whether it is necessary according to Section 10, Paragraph 1 of the Act that the Supt.

General of Indian Affairs; it is not sufficient, in other words merely to serve notice directing attendance on any school designated in the notice referred to\u2014evidence must be produced to show that the school referred to in notice is the school designated by the Dept. General; at any rate in the cases Francis and Old Philip, both these men sent their children over to Ollala, some 25 miles away, to some relatives merely to obviate them complying with notice served on them. As a consequence these cases are postponed sine die, until such ruling is made.\n\nI therefore would ask that I be instructed on this point so that in the event of further trouble no point in procedure will be ever looked.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInsp.\n\nsgd R.L.

I am enclosing, for your use, a few mimeographed copies of the Notice to Truants.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nP. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBox 693, Vernon, B. C.\nApril 6, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Stirling:\n\nI am returning a letter of Mr. F. M. Buckland, of Kelowna, and I wish to state that there is another angle from which to view the recent unfortunate difficulty with a group of Penticton Indians who refuse to obey the law.\n\nCertain malcontents, led by the Indians Francisco Timoyakin, Dominick Paul and Baptiste Cheshushasket, refuse to send their children to the Indian day school on the reserve. They believe, or pretend to believe, that any apparent activity will result in alienation of a part or all of their reserve. Time and time again, Mr. Indian Agent Ball of Vernon and others have patiently tried to correct this impression, but agitators have been able to keep a large number of the Band in a state of unrest. The result is that the non-progressives and least intelligent Indians distrust this department. I sometimes believe that Timoyakin and Cheshushasket are testing out their ability to get complete control of the reserve and to sever connections with Canadian government and institutions. I am very pleased to be able to say that there is also a strong sentiment of loyalty on the reserve, but it is the malcontents only that are heard in public meeting.\n\nOn January 15th, last, Mr. Indian Agent Ball called a meeting of the Indians to discuss the poor attendance at the day school. This meeting was well attended by both factions, i.e., the progressive, loyal Indians and the reactionary group. May I quote from Mr. Ball's letter of January 22nd:\n\n\"I explained the necessity of the school and pointed out the provisions of the Indian Act compelling attendance, so that they could thoroughly understand the school was not a matter for them to decide among themselves. This precipitated trouble and some very strong speeches were made.\" The question of alienation of their reserve was raised, and some went further \"they said the Indian Act was nothing to them, they were Indians and no law made by white people had any effect upon them. Dominick Paul said the Indians intended making their own laws, in future appointing their own chief and policemen; and no white people or others would be allowed on the reserve.\"\n\nBaptiste Cheshushasket is one of the most ignorant and most troublesome Indians I have ever met and he is the man they want for chief. He said they intended to close the school and prevent any children attending. I listened to them for several hours.\n\nGrote Stirling, Esq., M. P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6406, file 835-1, part 2)\nThe more progressive Indians and those in favour of the school were outnumbered and none had the courage to speak.\n\nIf these Indians are allowed control of school matters, it will have the worst possible effect, not only on Penticton reserve, but also on the other reserves wherever schools are operated.\"\n\nMr. Ball pointed out in his letter that, with a single exception, the Indians who oppose the school do not work their land, live under poor conditions and are usually dirty and unkempt in their homes and persons. Mr. Ball concludes as follows: \"We appear to have arrived at a point where a decision will have to be made between closing the school or enforcing attendance. If the school is closed, it will be a retrograde step which will take many years to overcome and may have far-reaching consequences, not only in this agency but even further afield. If the school is to be kept open, provision must be made to enforce attendance and protect those who are supporting it. This will necessitate the employment of a truant officer, who doubtless will be strongly opposed in the execution of his duty. I was warned long ago not to attempt education in this agency; one of the Indians going so far as to threaten my life; but, unless a beginning is made, I do not see how there can be any hope of making decent citizens of the Okanagan Indians.\"\n\nI arranged with Commissioner Starnes, of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, for a member of the Penticton detachment to be detailed for special duty as truant officer for the Indian reserve. There were three steps leading up to the difficulty of the 15th ultimo. On March 6th, seven Indians were served notice by Constable F. Woodcock to send their children to school by the 14th of the month. One Indian - Harry Pete - complied. On the 14th, information was laid before Magistrate Pope and summons were issued for the other six. Five of these were served the same day. The sixth Indian - Old Philip - was away from the reserve. These summons required the Indians in question to appear at the Penticton Court at 10 A.M. on the morrow. Dominick Jack, only, appeared in court and the charge was withdrawn as his child was unwell. The other four - Joe Paul, Francois Timoyakin, George Lessard and Mrs. Anna Burt - disobeyed the summons, and at 12.30 noon, of the 15th, Constables Woodcock and Carnac proceeded to the Penticton Indian reserve for the purpose of making the arrests. Of course, they had secured warrants.\n\nThese two officers of the R.C.M.P. found the four Indians in question in a group of some thirty at the home of Timoyakin. They refused to come along, and, when the Constables attempted to arrest them, they were prevented by the Indians. In this connection, I should like to quote from the report of Mr. Inspector Cadis, of the R.C.M.P.: \"So threatening was the attitude of the Indians,- of which some thirty or more were assembled to prevent arrest - that the Constables in question, deeming the matter too serious to proceed with without further instructions, reported to me.\"\nMr. Indian Agent Ball writes as follows: \"When the Constables arrived on the reserve, they found about forty of the malevolent, male and female, gathered at Francois Timoyakin's house. A warrant was handed to Timoyakin, who at first said he would go and talk to the Magistrate. Baptiste Chuchuhaskit, who seems to be considered a chief by these unruly members of the Band, told Timoyakin he must not go - they would stay on the reserve. An attempt was then made to arrest Timoyakin, but the Indians gathered round the Constables, threateningly. Fortunately, the two Constables - Carnac and Woodcock - took a sensible view of the matter. They felt that the original offence was only a trivial one and they did not wish the Indians to commit a greater offence by obstructing or assaulting the Police, so they returned to barracks to report.\"\n\nInspector Gadin and three constables, accompanied by Mr. Ball, the Indian Agent, proceeded to the reserve to make the arrests. I shall now quote from Inspector Gadin's report: \"I entered the Council House on the Reserve, where the Indians were all congregated, and, at Mr. Ball's request, went outside allowing him an opportunity to address the Indians. After some time elapsed, I entered, and, seeing that Mr. Ball was making no headway, I told the Indians briefly and clearly that I had come out to arrest certain members of the Band, among which was the accused, for which I had warrants, etc., and that they would have to come. In the meantime, Cpl. O'Reilly, Cst. Carnac and Woodcock had arrived. I ordered them into the Council House, and, pointing out the accused, ordered Csts. Carnac and Woodcock to arrest. Immediately on these Constables laying hands on the accused, a general melee took place, some 25 to 30 men and women attacking the Police. The arrest was finally effected some 40 or 45 minutes later and the accused placed in police car, together with 5 other prisoners, and taken to the Penticton Municipal Lockup.\"\n\nMr. Ball reports in part as follows: \"The Inspector ordered the three Constables to accompany him to the reserve to make the arrests. I asked him to give me an opportunity to persuade the Indians not to get into trouble. So I went out ahead of the Police and found the Indians congregated in the Council House. Neither the Chief nor any of the law-abiding Indians were present. Baptiste Chuchuhaskit met me and said the Indians were not going to allow white policemen on the Reserve and that the Band would not try Indians; they made their own laws and had their own Indian judges, etc. I told him he was creating trouble for himself and the other Indians if he advised them in this way. The Indians commenced milling around and shouting that they would not let the Police arrest them. I pointed out that their own Chief was not present and they said he was a white man anyway because he wanted the school and was no Chief of theirs. By this time the Police had arrived and the Inspector entered the room. He told them he had warrants for four of them, that the charge was a trivial one involving only a $2.00 fine, but they had disobeyed the summons and he had orders to take them. They all shouted at him, he called in the Constables and ordered them to make their arrests. Constable Rivett-Carnac touched Timoyakin on the shoulder as he sat on a form and told him he was under arrest, when Timoyakin immediately struck at the Constable, who then took a hold of him and dragged him to...\nhis feet. This started a general fracas, men and women joining in, and it was impossible to see very much as I was busy keeping Cheshushasket and Cominick Paul from actively taking part. The police handled the situation with restraint, even when one of them was dragged to the ground by Timoyakin and a dozen men and women. They eventually got Timoyakin into their car, although he fought every inch of the way, when they fell, he sustained a badly-sewed by hitting the edge of the form. Only three blows were struck by the police who were bleeding from scratches and one had dislocated his thumb. During the melee Timoyakin's wife was knocked down; she is a veritable virago. The police then returned and took four or five of the most active Indians, including one young woman and returned to town. I stayed at the Council House and made those who remained there feel very much ashamed of themselves for their foolishness. Cheshushasket and Cominick Paul refused to say anything and I could see that they all felt their position. I might say that during the melee no attempt whatever was made to offer the slightest violence to the Inspector or me. The Indians were placed in jail and I asked the Medical Officer to accompany me when he examined them, but their injuries were only slight. By this time they all seemed in good humour.\"\n\nThis story is somewhat different to that related to Mr. Buckland. The Indians, and not the police, were the aggressors in the free-for-all. Mr. Hall has on many occasions with great patience explained to the Indians the reasons for the school law. Mr. Buckland writes: \"It is generally stated that, had these Indians been served with court process in the usual way, they would undoubtedly have appeared in Court to answer such charges as might be preferred against them.\" In reply to this, I wish to point out that the four Indians whom the police set out to arrest on the afternoon of the 15th of March had been served with notice to send their children to school on the 9th of the month, they had failed to comply by the 14th and summons were then served. These four failed to appear in Court on the morning of the 15th and the warrants were then issued. At noon of the 15th, they had a further opportunity to proceed to Court quietly, when the two policemen presented themselves on the reserve. I am inclined to believe that these Indians were treated with patience and I have already congratulated the Commissioner of the R. C. M. P. on the restraint shown by the members of the Penticton detachment.\n\nReferring to Mr. Buckland's remarks concerning Mr. Hall, may I state that on the 17th of March he went out to the reserve and had the assurance of all the law-abiding Indians that they were glad something had been done as they were being threatened continually for supporting the school. Further, quoting from his report: \"Many of them came to Penticton during the evening to express their satisfaction and at one house, where the father, Harry Pete, had been afraid to send his children to school, the wife and daughters begged me with tears in their eyes to make Harry Pete send them back to school as they wanted to go. I have done this and these children are back again. . . . . . . . . . . . . The past\nthree days have been a rather trying experience, but I hope everything will now settle down peaceably. The school attendance is improved already and its strongest supporters are the pupils themselves, past and present.\"\n\nThe Magistrate, who was no doubt influenced by Mr. Ball's recommendations, took a very lenient view of the matter and did not send anyone to jail. Tinoaykin, who is considered one of the mischief-makers, was fined $5 and costs for failing to send children to school and $100 and costs for resisting and obstructing. On the same charges, Lousard was fined $5 and costs and $10 and costs, respectively. One other of the original seven charged with failing to send their children was fined $3 and costs. Three Indians were arrested in connection with the obstruction of the Police. Two were fined $10 and costs and the third, costs only.\n\nIn Mr. Buckland's letter, there is mention of an alienation of land from the reserve for school purposes. He writes of two miles square, which comprises the Indian settlement on the reserve. May I state that the land on which the school is situated is still Indian reserve and at the outside only one acre is used for school purposes.\n\nBaptiste Cheshuhaskit's report on the affair disagrees so materially with the official reports of the Police and the Indian Agent, that I do not see any merit in replying to it.\n\nI am very hopeful that this whole affair, while most unfortunate and regrettable, will have a very salutary effect on the malcontents of the reserve. The Department must hold the ground that it has gained against the reactionary element, or the progress of the Okanagan Indian groups will receive a serious setback. The patience of Mr. Ball, the restraint of the Police and the decisions of the Magistrate all go to show that our attitude has been one of forbearance.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nRe: Baptiste Cho-Chesasket (Indian); Penticton, B.C.\n\nActing on instructions received from the C.C.R.C.P., Penticton, B.C., I made an investigation re the above named, and Dominic Buckley, reported separately, forwarded concurrently.

Cho-Cho-estak barricaded himself in his cabin and the Mounted Police attempted to arrest five of their number who refused to come out. Orders to the new building recently built by the government on the reserve by Mr. Buckley held the door of an automobile when Constantine Buckock and Carmie tried to get the men into custody. As a result the men they had seized at that time were not released until late in the day, and only after a severe fight between the Indians and the police, several of whom received injury. About thirty natives attacked the Mounted Police, five of whom had to quit their way and prisoners from the council chamber where the Indians were held.\n\nIn imposing a fine of $100 and costs on each of the men Magistrate Pope said it was evident there had been evil influence growing among the Indians for some time past and that behind the prisoners were the ring-leaders in an attempt to defy the law. In lieu of payment the fine the Indians will be committed to prison for six months.\n\nThe school at Penticton still exists on the reserve, the Indians refusing to send their children to the government school, they claim being under the impression intended to take more of their land to pay for its erection.\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nRe - INDIAN ACT (School Attendance),\nPenticton Indian Reserve, B.C.\n\nI thank you for your letter of the 6th instant, in above, together with enclosures.\n\nMight I ask that you send me a further supply, say 100, of the \"Notice to Parent, Guardian or Other Person by Truant Officer\", for distribution to those members of the Force who have been appointed Truant Officers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCortlandt Starnes,\nCOMMISSIONER.\n\nDr. Duncan C.

Mr. Woodward says he must take advantage of any technicality in the interest of his clients, although he is quite in sympathy with efforts to send the children to school.\n\nThe attendance at Penticton has improved and some Indians have sent their children to other schools so as to avoid further trouble and I have not interfered with this arrangement as presumably the object is to have the children educated rather than have them attend any particular school. The last two families to give in had rather a rude awakening when the Penticton Municipal police arrested two boys for stealing from clothing left in the recreation park by athletes. They were caught with the stolen goods in possession and committed by the City Magistrate to the Industrial School. It was rather embarrassing to Francois Timoyakin as one of the boys was his grandson. The Indians are all beginning to admit that the children are better off in school, and while the recent trouble was unfortunate and unavoidable it is better to avoid fruit already. Some of them have admitted to me that they were afraid to send their children before because of intimidation and are glad the matter was taken out of their hands. Only those who understand the psychology of the Okanagan Indian can realise the patience and diplomacy necessary in dealing with them for their own good and the local public generally is very much in sympathy with the policy of education for Indians.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\n\nDuncan C.

Sir,\n\nIt will be necessary to obtain the services of a qualified teacher for the Penticton Indian Day School for the academic year beginning on or about September 1st, next. The work at Penticton, because of the attitude of the parents, is most difficult, and our local officers believe that a more mature and fully qualified teacher than has been employed in the past would have a better chance to solve the particular problem there. I have, therefore, to request that you will arrange to nominate, in due time, a teacher of the type required. It would be advisable to consult Mr. F. J. G. Ball, Indian Agent, Vernon, and Mr. Inspector Cairns, Vancouver, regarding the obtaining of the services of a qualified teacher whose appointment would meet with their approval. We are informing Mr. Agent Ball that you will be communicated with relative to the obtaining of the services of a teacher. Full particulars should be forwarded as to the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated by you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev.

John Welch, O.M.I., to nominate a teacher for this school, and he is being written today and requested to give this matter his prompt attention. A copy of the communication addressed to him is enclosed herewith, for your information. It is thought that Father Welch would be able to nominate the services of a qualified teacher for this school. He will, no doubt, communicate with you in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. J. C.

As the majority of the pupils of this school are Roman Catholic it will be necessary that the teacher is also Roman Catholic and it appears that the only way we can obtain the services of a qualified teacher is by advertising, otherwise there is a tendency for unqualified persons to be recommended for these schools.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nFJCB:O.\nOttawa, May 25, 1928.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to your services at the Penticton Indian Day School. I am pleased to state, in reply, that the Department has had no complaints with reference to your conduct or to your teaching, and you will please consider that the termination of your services is not a case of dismissal for cause. The work at Penticton, because of the attitude of the parents, is most difficult, and our local officers believed that a more mature teacher would have a better chance to solve the particular problem there.

Ball, Vernon, B.C., advising me that my services would not be required after June 30th.\n\nIn regard to this I must say I have not had an inspector's report within the fifteen months that I have taught there. Last June the school was closed by Doctor's order for measles. Mr. Cairns came to visit the school just after the school was closed so he was unable to give a report of my teaching work. In view of this I cannot understand this dismissal.\n\nMr. Ball has signed two notes on my register saying everything was satisfactory except attendance, and\nI can truthfully say I earnestly endeavoured to improve it.

The narrow construction that has been placed upon this word by the accused would imply that the Superintendent General to comply with the Act would have to write a personal letter to the parents of all the Indian children in the Dominion of Canada. Surely no one would seriously uphold such a contention. The word \"designated\" in the Section has a general and a particular significance. Where a school is equipped and maintained on a reserve by the Superintendent General for the education of the children residing on such reserve, as in the case of the Penticton school, that is a general designation by the Superintendent General of that school for the attendance of such children. If a child is taken away from its home and sent to some other school, on the instructions of the Superintendent General, that would be a particular designation of the school which such child would be obliged to attend. That is the intention of the Act and the interpretation which has always been placed upon it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.J.C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nRe Your File 164-10-1\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ult. and regret that I did not explain more explicitly Mr. Woodward's technical objection. It is quite true that Section 10-2 specifically states the truant officer shall notify in writing, but Mr. Woodward's objection is under Section 10-1, which states that \"every Indian child \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 shall attend such school as may be designated by the Superintendent General.\" Mr. Woodward contends that the Superintendent General has not designated the Penticton Indian Day School as the school which Indians on Penticton Reserve shall attend. He maintains that the parents must be notified by the Superintendent General that this is the school designated by him for the children to attend, and that no other person except the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs can so instruct them.\n\nAs pointed out in my letter of the 18th ult., all that is necessary to overcome this objection is to amend Section 10-1 by adding the words \"or his agent\" after the word \"Superintendent General.\" Section 13 and other sections of the \"Indian Act\" have these words added, but they were omitted in Section 10-1 and the lawyer is taking advantage of the omission.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nFJCB:C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise that on account of an outbreak of measles on Penticton Indian Reserve the Medical Officer has closed the Penticton Indian Day School temporarily.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nFJOB:C.\nOttawa, May 31, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your Pn. 1-10-2 of the 18th instant, asking for an interpretation of Section 10 of the Indian Act. I cannot understand how the Magistrate allowed the technical objection of Mr. Woodward, the Barrister who defended the Indians. Section 10-2 specifically states the truant officer shall notify in writing. I may say that the truant officer, when signing the warning notice to truants, does not designate the school, but indicates which one has already been designated as the school for the child in question to attend.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The Reverend Father Welch has sent me the name of an applicant for the position of teacher in the Indian Day School at Penticton. This lady, Miss MacLennan, has had many years of experience. She has taught in Saskatchewan for eight years and has also a Second Class Certificate from the Province of Nova Scotia. She has worked as a missionary under the Oblate and Benedictine Fathers.\n\nI think we are very fortunate in receiving an application from one who has had long and varied experience.\n\nFather Welch has sent me a letter recommending Miss MacLennan's appointment, which I approve.\n\nIn all probability Miss MacLennan will be here to open the school September 4th., this being the date upon which all the Public Schools in the Province open.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Schools of B.C.\nOttawa, October 9th, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the September quarter return of the Penticton Indian Day School and it is noted that it is signed by Miss C.

Her services are quite satisfactory, and we are fortunate in having her take charge of the school but I am rather afraid the salary is not sufficient to keep her long as she finds living expenses so much higher in B.C. than in her home in Nova Scotia.\n\nI regret not having written you about this matter but was under the impression I had done so explaining the circumstances of her employment.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

We note that she possesses a second class certificate for the Province of Nova Scotia and that she taught for several years in Saskatchewan.\n\nWe have noted your reference to the salary allowed, viz., $90 per teaching month.

According to inquiries made I find that expenses are higher in Penticton than in perhaps any place where Indian schools are situated. For instance in Nova Scotia I know of Teachers in Indian schools who only have to pay fifteen dollars per month for board. In cases where board accommodation is so high I think your department will be good enough to consider the need of application for an increase in salary.\n\nOn the occasion of the official visit of the late Mr. J.H. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools, on April 10th, I told him that I found it very hard to get along with my present salary and he suggested that I write to you regarding the possibilities of an increase and that the work accomplished in my school together with testimonials regarding my ability as a Teacher and Disciplinarian would be testified to you in his official report of his visit.\n\nTrusting that you will give the above matter your kindest consideration,\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nYours very Respectfully,\n\nC.

For the first time for a good many months the attendance at Penticton Day School was improved, ten pupils being present on November 27th. The teacher at this point Miss MacLennan, was thrown from a horse in September while riding on the reserve for recreation on a Saturday and had to take hospital treatment for a few days. Latterly, I have received several requests that the department pay her hospital account, but I do not feel that the department has any responsibility in this connection, the Okanagan Indian Day school held a sale of their work in Vernon during the week ending November 21st, but the results were not very encouraging, probably due to a combination of hard times, rather high prices, set on the work, and lack of finish to the articles. However, they are selling a fair amount of their handicrafts privately and ordinary school work is well maintained. The children of this school are making over old naval uniforms supplied by the Commissioner into school uniforms with success and thereby providing themselves with neat warm clothing.\n\nJames Coleman,\nIndian Agent.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. SCHOOL INSPECTOR BARRY ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE PENTICTON INDIAN DAY SCHOOL DATED DECEMBER 3, 1932.\n\n---\n\nThe teacher (Miss Catherine MacLennan) is, she states, suffering from neuritis. She is in my opinion suffering from some form of nerve trouble. I doubt that she is well enough at present to be teaching school. This teacher, I understand, was thrown off a horse some little time ago, and was out of school for two weeks during October. As far as I can learn from the teacher and Indian Agent, this accident took place on a Saturday, out of school hours, on the Indian Reserve. Pressure is I understand being brought to bear on the Indian Agent to recommend the payment of the teacher's hospital expenses, etc. I should recommend that the Department refuse to consider the payment of any such expense. In my opinion this teacher had no business to be riding an Indian pony on the Reserve.\n\nI do not consider that the children are making much progress. They are very backward. The teacher has an excuse for each and every criticism that I have made. It is just a waste of my time to make any further suggestions to this teacher.\n\nx x x x x\n\nSpecial Report on Schoolroom. The schoolroom was untidy on the occasion of my visit. x x x x x I am thoroughly dissatisfied with conditions at this school. x x x x x There is no course open to me but to ask the Department to terminate the services of the teacher.\n\nIt is important that when a new teacher is appointed to this school local recommendations be ignored. There are properly qualified and highly recommended Catholic teachers now available for appointment. These teachers besides being recommended by the Catholic authorities here are also recommended by the Provincial Department of Education. Rather than accept the recommendation of any local authority, I would recommend that the school be closed for at least a year. I am, however, of the opinion that an outside teacher will be able to increase the attendance, and place the school in working order again.\nOttawa, January 14, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15/10/23592 of the 7th instant, submitting the report of Mr. Barry on his inspection of the Penticton Indian Day School, and recommending that the services of Miss Catherine M.

The appointment of the teacher whom you nominate should be concurred in by Archbishop Duke, 646 Richards St., Vancouver, as he has requested that all changes in teachers of schools conducted under the auspices of the Catholic Church in British Columbia be approved by him.

Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nJanuary 6, 1932.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith my report on the Penticton Indian Day School, Okanagan Agency. This school was inspected on December 3rd 1931.\n\nAs I am thoroughly dissatisfied with the work of the teacher, Miss Catherine Macdonald, I am forwarding a special recommendation that she be relieved of her appointment as from the end of March 1932.\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nSpecial Report in accordance with Departmental letter 4-210 dated January 14, 1931 and attached to my Report on the Penticton Indian Day School.\n\nIn accordance with the instructions issued to me by The Department of Indian Affairs, I am forwarding this special report for your information. I beg to state that I do not consider the services of Miss Catherine MacLennan at present teacher of the Indian Day School at Penticton, to be satisfactory. I have therefore to recommend that she be removed from her position as teacher of this school. My reasons for taking this action are contained in my report on the Penticton Indian Day School, which has been made as the result of an inspection carried out on December 3, 1931. I would recommend that Miss MacLennan be given as long notice as possible, and that her appointment be terminated as from the end of March next, and a new teacher be appointed to take charge of the school from April 1st 1932.\n\nIt is further suggested that the Department obtain a special report from Mr. Indian Agent Coleman, of the Okanagan Agency, on this school, should this be thought necessary.\n\nGerald H. Barry.\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nVictoria, B.C.\nJanuary 6, 1932.\nPenticton Indian Day School  \nPenticton B.C.  \nFeb. 4th 1932.\n\nSuperintendent, Indian Affairs  \nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your decision following recommendation made by Inspector Barry regarding my dismissal from service as Teacher of the Penticton Indian Day School, to take effect on March 31st 1932, I beg to make the following reply.\n\nAlthough I have not received from your Department any report on the reasons for my dismissal I take for granted the following are the reasons that prompted Inspector Barry to make his unfavourable decision against me. The presence of a Camp Cot in my school-room - the occasional visits of Rev. Father Cullinan to the school - and the lack of progress made by the pupils, were the topics for discussion made by Inspector Barry on his recent official visit to our school, which lasted little over an hour.\n\nI explained to him that the Camp Cot was installed in my school-room not on my suggestion but through an act of good will of a friend of mine, Mrs Scott. After my return from the local hospital where I had been recovering for two weeks suffering from injuries received to my foot and ankle, in an accident, my ankle was still swollen and the idea of the cot was to enable me to raise my foot at noon hour. As I am alone in school at noon, and two miles from town, I was glad to have an opportunity to act on the advice of my physician and rest my ankle. Had I every anticipated that such a rumpus would be made by Inspector Barry concerning the cot I certainly would not have permitted its use. Personally however, I consider...\nnot a necessity in any school, but more particularly in a Rural School, and I know it is one of the first requirements of a school nurse for first aid purposes.\n\nThe second matter which obviously aroused the ire of Inspector Barry was the fact that I permitted Father Cullinan to visit the school for the purpose of giving religious instruction - when I gave him this information in reply to his questions regarding teaching religious instruction at my school his reply was \"He has no right here - this is a Public School\". I have never received any instructions from your Department prohibiting the visits of Father Cullinan or any other clergyman to my school - and I took for granted Father Cullinan knew his privileges.\n\nAt the close of his official inspection Mr Barry remarked that this school was backward. I grant that some of the pupils are not up to date in their work, and I shall endeavour right here to acquaint you with the reasons why they are not. The big drawback is poor attendance, and poor attendance has been due to two great reasons. One is that our unofficial Indian Chief has always been opposed to education and always will be - and it naturally follows that no assistance, co-operation or encouragement can be had from him. The other reasons are starvation and want of clothing. In this first instance I made requisition to your Department for hot lunches at school, knowing too well how this would encourage attendance, but to date this requisition has not been honoured. In the second instance I beg to state that in the past three years, were it not for the fact that I took the responsibility of clothing the pupils, there would have been no attendance at this school. The local officers of the R.C.M.P. have always been very kind in lending valuable assistance in the matter of taking the clothing from town and in the help of distribution of same to the different homes. Corp. Fenton R.C.M.P., who by the way happens to be now stationed at Ottawa, will, I am sure, request be pleased to\ntestify to the amount of social service work which I have rendered to my pupils. Too many times have I been obliged to buy food and clothing for pupils in order to encourage attendance, when I knew too well how poor attendance is the big hindrance to progress at school.\n\nI feel positive that if Inspector Barry knew more of conditions existing among Indians he would not be quite so rash in putting the entire blame on the teacher.\n\nConcerning my ability as a teacher and disciplinarian, I can only refer you to the various reports of Inspectors made on my work and accomplishments in the Public Schools of Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan. You likely have a record of my diplomas and certificates on file, and if they were not of the highest type you surely would not have invited me to come all the way from Nova Scotia to accept this position.\n\nIn conclusion I ask that consideration be given me at least for recognition in what little I have done and that my services be retained.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nC.M. MacLennan.\nARCHDIOCESE OF VANCOUVER\n\nChancery Office\n\n646 Richards Street\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nJanuary 28th, 1932.\n\nMr. C.C. Perry\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI received your kind letter of January 21st, for which I am very grateful and I am glad to concur with the appointment of Miss Elizabeth Weydert as teacher of the Penticton Indian School. So far as I know she is a very capable young woman and has been highly recommended by Father Evans, Rector of St. Andrew's Cathedral in Victoria.\n\nVery sincerely yours\n\n\"W. M. Duke\"\n\nArchbishop of Vancouver.\nOffice of the District Inspector of Indian Schools,\n\nJanuary 20, 1932.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter No. 164-10-1, dated January 14th, 1932, I have the honor to recommend the appointment of Miss Elizabeth Weydert as teacher of the Penticton Indian Day School from April 1st next.\n\nMiss Weydert is twenty-two years of age, was trained at the Victoria Normal School and holds a First-Class Permanent B.C. Certificate. She is, of course, a Roman Catholic and has had two years experience in the Provincial Public Schools having taught religious education at Athalmer in preparing children for their First Communion and is recommended for appointment as a teacher in the Indian Day Schools by Reverend C.E. Evans, Rector of St. Andrew's Cathedral, Victoria. I have enquired with care into the record of this girl while teaching in the Provincial service and am satisfied that she has proved herself a very good teacher indeed.\n\nI hope that you will see your way clear to recommend Miss Weydert for the vacant position at Penticton if Archbishop Duke signifies his concurrence.\n\nMiss Weydert's address is Oaklands Post Office, Victoria, B.C.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\nOttawa, February 24, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your Pn. 1-10-2 of the 17th instant, with reference to Miss MacLennan, teacher of the Penticton Indian Day School, whose services are not required after the end of March. The Department is glad to receive this expression of your opinion. You were written on the 18th instant in this connection. You may inform Miss Weydert that the deduction may not be 10% but only 5% during the ensuing fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJames Coleman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI have a copy of a letter sent by Miss C.M. MacLennan, teacher of Penticton Indian Day School, who is under notice by the Department.\n\nWhile the statements contained therein are generally of a very wild nature, it appears that a comment on some of them would possibly be of assistance.\n\nHer statement that Inspector Barry claimed that the Missionary had no right in the school is, in my opinion, absolutely incorrect and entirely contrary to the general expression of his opinion on the subject, both on this particular tour of inspection and previous inspection, when he impressed on all our teachers, in my presence the necessity for a reasonable amount of religious instruction, and it is extremely unlikely that he would advise Miss MacLennan directly contrary to the other schools and myself.\n\nThe complaint regarding the unofficial Chief, Michele Jack, is correct to some extent; but while this man is not favorable to education, he held the same position as official Chief during the period when Miss Coughlin was in charge of the school, and at that time the attendance and progress was excellent. A teacher fitted for this class of work will fill the school despite opposition from any particular section of the Band and this is evidenced by the school on Okanagan Indian Reserve No.1 under the charge of Mr. Walsh, and where the opposition has been even greater. The strongest opponents to the school are now sending their children there.\n\nRegarding starvation and want of clothing, conditions on Penticton Reserve are somewhat better than on the Reserves north of that point. Miss MacLennan has endeavoured from time to time to act as a benefactor to the Indians - at the expense of the Department, by requesting relief for those attending school; this, in my opinion, being an attempt to make them put on an appearance, soon after taking over that she had a woman Mary McDougall, of 34, attending school as a pupil, and that she was bringing considerable pressure to bear, and through one of the R.C.M.P. to place this woman on relief to enable her to attend school. This I refused to do for the reason that in my opinion she was not a proper ward of the Department having married one Narcisse Brooks of Omak, Washington, U.S.A. in 1918, deserting him shortly after; neither of the woman's parents were Indians within the meaning of the Act, her mother being the notorious Rose Sandford, now married to an Indian of Okanagan Indian Reserve No.1. As this Mary McDougall was continually having illegitimate children, I did not consider her a fit person to have in the school. Another similar case was that of a Mrs. Marcellus and her illegitimate children.\n\nRegarding the hot lunches, I would state that all\nthe children attending lived within a few minutes walk of the school and I did not consider them necessary, as the children can and do go to their own homes for lunch, which is entirely different to conditions on Okanagan Indian Reserve No.1 and Osoyoos Indian Reserve where lunches are supplied, but many of the children travel several miles to school. Concerning her alleged clothing of the pupils, I would simply state that previous teachers had a better attendance without having to do so. It is quite possible that her friends have supplied cast off clothing which she has passed on to some of the children. Corporal Fenton, now of Ottawa, to whom she refers (and who is a Catholic) may or may not support her statements regarding her alleged social work, but I am of the opinion that the general history of this school prior to Miss MacLennan's arrival will show the necessity of same.\n\nWhatever blame Inspector Barry put on the teacher was to my mind fully justified. He was obviously dissatisfied after his visit in the spring of 1931, but reserved judgment until his next visit. I have found him absolutely fair and impartial on his inspections, although naturally he expects results. Some of his innovations have been new to the teachers, and one teacher in this Agency advised me that while he could not see that they would be successful with Indians, he would give them a trial. At a later date, he admitted that the Inspector was perfectly correct and that he was astonished at the results attained by following out these suggestions, although he admittedly had no personal confidence in them at the outset. This particular school is now operating entirely in line with the Inspector's suggestions and is very successful. I have had personal experience as a school trustee and a teacher for a short period, and consider that I am justified in my opinion that Miss MacLennan's reflections on the Inspector are entirely without foundation, and that his attitude in this agency has been entirely friendly and helpful to the teachers in regard to their difficulties.\n\nWith reference to Miss MacLennan's request that her services be retained, I prefer to make no comment as, no doubt, the decision of the Department was reached after careful consideration of all information available in the case.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSIR,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(James Coleman)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, February 18, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has approved of the appointment of Miss Elizabeth Weydert as teacher of the Penticton Indian Day School - duties to commence on the first of April.

I am informed that she is outspoken, autocratic and not by any means an ideal employee where the Indians are particularly difficult to guide.\n\nI am enclosing, for your file, a copy of Mr. Barry's second report in Miss MacLennan's case.

Barry, District Inspector of Indian Schools made a recommendation, dated January 20th, ultimo, copy of which is sent herewith, and in which Miss Elizabeth Weydert is suggested by him as a suitable teacher for appointment at this school. Inspector Barry's recommendation was forwarded to Most Reverend Wm. M. Duke, Archbishop of Vancouver under cover of letter addressed to him on January 21st, ultimo, in which he was requested to consider and if satisfactory concur in the nomination of Miss Weydert.\n\nA reply has been received from the Archbishop in which he concurs with the appointment of Miss Weydert.

BARRY ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE PENTICTON INDIAN DAY SCHOOL (Date of inspection Nov. 22, 1934).\n\nORIGINAL ON NO. 164-10-6.\n\nAll the children on the local Indian Reserve do not attend school, either here or elsewhere. It might be well now that the status of the Indians in the Okanagan has been determined to insist that all children attend school unless there is a definite reason why they should not do so. This matter was mentioned in my last report on this school, and it will be remembered that I there suggested that the Department request the Indian Agent to report on all children living on the Penticton Indian Reserve who did not attend one or other of the Indian schools. I do not know if the Department has now received such information, or if it has issued any instructions with regard to such children. Three children belonging to the George family mentioned in my last report are now attending school at the Kamloops Indian Residential School. It would be a pity to close this school, and I am quite certain that with some effort it would be possible to increase the attendance, which is now very small. The average attendance for the past year has been as follows:\n\nQuarter ending December 1933 9.0\n\" March 1934 7.67\n\" June 1934 7.33\n\" September 1934 9.85.\n\nThe teacher's control is very good. The schoolroom is clean and bright, the walls freshly kalsomined and the floor oiled. It is a pity that all the available children do not attend this school, which is well above the average in standing.\nKamloops, B.C., May 5th, 1932.\n\nINSPECTION REPORT OKANAGAN AGENCY NO.7.\n\nI inspected the day school at Penticton. There were nine pupils on that date. The new teacher, Miss Weydert will, I believe, pull this school together, as there is already a distinct improvement.

McLellan, teacher at the Indian Reserve School at Penticton is to be dismissed from her school at the end of next month.\n\nAfter three years acquaintance with Miss McLellan I cannot quite conceive of such action being taken against her because she has at all times evinced a most thorough-going professional attitude toward her work and taken a real pride in the progress of her pupils.\n\nShe has always been on excellent terms with all the members of my staff and when in contact with us educational problems and progressive methods of teaching have invariably been discussed with genuine enthusiasm. To my mind she strives always to keep abreast of the times and endeavors at all times to give her young charges the advantages that modern methods can afford.\n\nOn several occasions she has taken advantage of the equipment a large school affords and it has been my pleasure to give her copies of various types of work in Arithmetic, Geography, History, etc.,\n\nTo me, her attitude towards her work and the seriousness with which she discusses it have always given the impression of a sound and progressive worker.\n\nReally, I cannot quite conceive of anything like dismissal coming into the life of Miss McLellan. The case, I think, deserves your most serious consideration because, if she has to go, I fear a real injustice through misunderstanding will have been done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Duke, in which the Archbishop nominates Miss Catherine McDonald on transfer from the Okanagan Indian Day School to be teacher of the Penticton Indian Day School in place of Miss Mary Elizabeth Weydert who resigned her position to be married to a Mr. T.Curteis, your file 164-10-1 of June 2nd last.\n\nTo fill the vacancy at the Okanagan Indian Day School, His Excellency has nominated a teacher with Provincial experience, Mr. Thomas Noel Curteis, the man Miss Weydert is to marry this month.\n\nThe above nomination would have been forwarded to the Department some time ago had it not been that Miss Catherine McDonald was at first rather unwilling to accept His Excellency's nomination and wished for a transfer to a school near Vancouver or Victoria. These matters have now been adjusted and Miss McDonald is anxious to go to Penticton on transfer from the Okanagan Indian Day School near Vernon.\n\nI have interviewed Mr. T.N.Curteis and find that he was trained in the Victoria Normal School and now holds a Permanent First Class Certificate in British Columbia. He is a Catholic and 21 years of age. For the past three years he has been in charge of Grades 1 to 4 inclusive at the North Cedar Provincial Day School. In 1936 he attended the Provincial Summer School in Victoria and qualified in Reading, Geography, and Modern Methods, while at the 1937 Summer School he received certificates in Psychology, Literature, and Science. He is a well set up young man interested in school games and with some experience in Manual Training which would be of use in the Okanagan Indian Day School.\n\nThe Indian Agent, Mr. Coleman, is anxious that a married man be appointed to the Okanagan Day School, and I have no hesitation on behalf of the Indian Commissioner in recommending that the Archbishop's nominations be accepted and Miss C. McDonald be moved to Penticton and Mr. Curteis be appointed to the Okanagan School.\n\nNominations for any other teaching positions in Indian Day Schools working under Catholic auspices will be forwarded as soon as I have had an opportunity to discuss the matter with His Excellency Archbishop Duke who is expected to return to Vancouver towards the end of the month.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

M. Duke\nArchbishop of Vancouver.\nSchools\n\nThese have been making their usual progress. Miss Weydert of the Penticton School is marrying a young Catholic school teacher who has very excellent reports from his inspectors. Miss Weydert has proven unusually successful with this school and as her husband made application to join our teaching staff after his marriage in July, I thought that it would be an excellent idea to have this young couple take over the Okanagan Indian Day school, which has always been a problem, there being a number of adult girls attending and the attendance has fallen off rather badly in recent years. It has an enrollment of 35 pupils with the last average attendance being only 24.68. It was considered that this young couple working together on the problem could promote the interest of the children and that a young married woman could handle the elder girls by securing their confidence and bringing them to a better understanding of their responsibilities, as well as handle the domestic science end of the teaching, the young man being quite capable of taking the boys with elements of agriculture and manual arts. However, to my surprise the present incumbents, two aged ladies, are not taking favourably to a transfer to Penticton where I felt they would be much more comfortable living in the town and free from the inconveniences of living on a reserve where they are liable in ordinary winters to be snow bound for weeks at a time, besides the undoubted advantage of taking over a school that has been brought up to an excellent standard, by Miss Weydert. Personally I would prefer to see competent male teachers in all of the three day schools in this agency in order to give effective training to the boys on agricultural subjects as well as the orthodox curriculum and have part of the available time allotted to training these youngsters in what will eventually be their life work.\n\nJames Coleman\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, June 2, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, enclosing the resignation of Miss Elizabeth Weydert as teacher of the Penticton Indian Day School.

Curteis, R.R. #1, Ladysmith, B.C.\n\nIn recommending that the Department accept Miss Weydert's resignation to take effect as from June 30th, 1938, I would endorse the Indian Agent's remarks, as contained in paragraphs 2 and 3 of his letter of the 2nd instant, and suggest that a letter be addressed to Miss Weydert expressing the Department's satisfaction with the services that she has rendered as teacher of the Penticton Indian Day School.\n\nI have discussed this matter with Inspector Barry who informs me that, when Miss Weydert was first appointed as teacher of the above School, there was considerable opposition on the part of the parents and prominent Indians to the education of their children. Great care had to be exercised by the Indian Agent and Miss Weydert, whose efforts to gain the confidence of the Indians at length met with success and it became possible to obtain almost perfect attendance without resort to any sort of coercion. Capt. Barry considers that Miss Weydert has been one of the very successful teachers in this Province and hopes that it may be possible to recommend shortly the appointment of Mr. Thos. N. Curteis as teacher of the Okanagan Indian Day School near Vernon, and the transfer of Miss Catherine McDonald from this School to the Penticton Indian Day School. Such arrangements would, I know, be satisfactory to Mr. Indian Agent Coleman and will be made the subject of a\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nletter to the Department when Inspector Barry has had an opportunity of talking over the matter with His Grace Archbishop Duke.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOkanagan Indian Agency,\nVernon, B.C.,\nMay 2, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI enclose herewith notice of resignation effective June 30th next of Miss E. Weydert, teacher at the Penticton Indian Day School for the reason that she intends to marry.\n\nIn my opinion Miss Weydert has been the most effective and competent teacher we have had in this Agency and her work there has practically eliminated the serious and violent opposition to education that was prevalent at the time she assumed charge. She has been a good, all round teacher doing excellent work with manual training with the boys and domestic subjects with the girls.\n\nIt will be greatly appreciated if the Department, when accepting her resignation, would kindly express their satisfaction with her past services at this school.\n\nI would suggest that more than usual care be exercised in selection of her successor and that a teacher who can show a friendly and sympathetic attitude towards the children be secured if possible in order to ensure continuation of the good work commenced by Miss Weydert.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Jas. Coleman),\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure:-\n\nJC/HM.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O.Box 5, Vancouver, B.C.\nBox 265\nPenticton B.C.\nApril 25, 1938.\n\nMrs. J. Coleman,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon B.C.\n\nDear Mrs. Coleman:\n\nI beg to advise you that I am resigning my position as teacher of the Penticton Indian Day School at the end of the present quarter, June 30, 1938, as I am getting married.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation for your great assistance during the time I have taught under your supervision.\n\nI would also be grateful to you for a reference in case of any future necessity.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nElizabeth Weydert.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been asked to recommend the above lady for the post of teacher at the Penticton Indian School.\n\nI was working for eight years among the Indians of the Okanagan, and our priests became well acquainted with Mrs Moore at West Summerland. Her devotion to her work, and the successful way in which she has brought up her own family amid great difficulties won our regard....\n\nI am now holding appointments at this Home in the City for Destitute men, and am also acting-Chaplain at Oakalla Gaol....\n\nI should like to think that a word from me might be of help in securing the post for Mrs Moore.\n\nYours very truly\n\nA. J. Carlyle\nSchools\n\nThese are all progressing quite well. Miss. M.E. Weydert, of the Penticton Indian Day School, announced her intention of resigning at the end of the term as in July next she will marry a Catholic school teacher. This will be a serious loss to the agency as she took hold of a problem where the Indians were violently opposed to education and made them quite enthusiastic about it.\n\nJames Coleman,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nMrs. Verle Moore has applied for appointment as teacher of the Penticton Day School and states that Miss E. Weydert intends to resign.\n\nWe have not yet received any resignation from Miss Weydert and you should see her at once and, if she intends to give up duties at the end of June, you should obtain her resignation.\n\nIn the event of her resigning you should consult the Roman Catholic Church authorities and request them to nominate a qualified teacher to take charge of this school on September 1. I understand that Penticton is now in the Diocese of Nelson and the Bishop is Right Reverend Martin Johnson, D.D.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJas. Coleman, Esq.,\nP.O. Box 693,\nVernon, B.C.\nOttawa,\nMay 17, 1938.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter applying for appointment as teacher of the Penticton Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department has not yet received the resignation of the present teacher and as a result we are not prepared, at the present time, to make any decision regarding another teacher for this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nH.

Heywood has written me that she has resigned her position as teacher of the Indian School at Centennial B.C. and therefore I beg to make application for the position now vacant.\n\nI believe you already have an application of mine on file, forwarded to you by Captain Barry.\n\nI am an experienced teacher, having over fifteen years experience, all in B.C.\nI have a Second Class certificate, also Certificate for Penmanship and Physical Training and I am able to teach music. I had experience conducting the choir of St. Ann's Church in Penticton and will if appointed teach the pupils the church music required.\n\nI am well acquainted with the children and their parents in the Penticton Indian School having often assisted Miss Heyden in her Sports Days and Festivals.\n\nI am a widow with two boys but they are finished High School.\nI sincerely hope you will give my application serious consideration and also hope you will favour me with an appointment.\n\nIf I am so honoured I will endeavour to the best of my ability to prove myself a competent teacher as well as to do my utmost to instruct the pupils in their Holy Faith.\n\nI am asking my Inspector to write you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMrs. Verle Moore\nOKANAGAN AGENCY INSPECTION REPORT NO. 12, May 14, 1937.\n\nPENTICTON DAY SCHOOL:\n\nOn the day I visited this school, there were twelve children in attendance, out of a roll of 16. Most of the absentees were away owing to sickness. I heard the children at their class work. Miss Weydart seems to have good hold over her children and all seemed to be doing most satisfactorily. The school rooms, outhouses, and grounds were all in good order and tidy. The teacher is also giving these children good instruction in sewing, and even in manual training. In connection with the latter, I understand the manual training teacher of the white, town schools is willing to take the boys of the Indian school. If this can be arranged it would be a splendid idea. Indian Agent Coleman is to communicate with the department in the matter. I consider this school very creditable to Miss Weydart, the teacher.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nREPORT ON OKANAGAN INDIAN AGENCY FOR MONTH OF MAY 1937.\n\nSCHOOLS:\n\nThese are all making satisfactory progress. The children of each of the three day schools entered the annual poster competition of the Latham Humane Foundation (an organization somewhat similar to our Society of Prevention of Cruelty of Animals) to which there were over 5,500 entries from all over the world. Each school secured several certificates of merit and one young woman at Penticton Reserve managed to get into the not very extensive prize list for a small award, which was very good considering the extent of the entries. This all came about by the Foundation inviting my personal entry but as I had no time I suggested that they might be interested in the Indian children's contributions with the results stated.\n\nJames Coleman,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON OKANAGAN AGENCY FOR MONTH OF AUGUST 1936.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nThese have all re-opened. I was present at the re-opening of the Penticton Indian Day School and it was extremely gratifying to note the eagerness with which the children welcomed the teacher and their anxiety to commence work. All the pupils turned up, spotlessly clean and well dressed, one girl with a broken arm still in splints. The spirit existing in this school between the teacher, Miss E. Weydert, and the pupils is commendable, particularly when it is realized that this band have staged violent riots protesting against education. Remarkable progress has been made at this school with the manual training supplies granted by the Department this year. While nothing is heard of their handicrafts and art work I put on an exhibition of same at a flower show in the Coldstream and among those in attendance was the Principal of a large private school who fully admitted that his pupils couldn't compare with the Indian children, age for age or otherwise.\n\nJas. Coleman.\nIndian Agent.\nOKANAGAN INDIAN AGENCY REPORT FOR MONTH OF MAY 1936.\n\nSCHOOLS:\n\nThese are all progressing as usual and doing good work. Penticton Day School has been provided with manual training tools and material and it is expected that this feature will add considerably to the value and attractiveness of the curriculum. A great deal of publicity has been given to some painting on buck-skin done by one of the pupils of Osoyoos School, this work securing the bronze medal of the Royal Drawing Society's annual exhibition at the Guildhall Gallery in London. The teacher, Mr. Walsh, is anxious to have this medal presented by the Governor-General at Vancouver when he visits the Vancouver Exhibition in August, also to have the boy working on handicrafts at this Exhibition. He has been given a prize by the Archbishop recently and he thinks it would be fitting for the Department to give some small token for his general application and attendance.\n\nJames Coleman\nIndian Agent\nKamloops, B.C.,\nMay 8th, 1936.\n\nOKANAGAN AGENCY INSPECTION REPORT NO. 11.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI arrived in the Okanagan Agency in the evening of the 26th April, being met by Indian Agent Coleman. I was in the Agency until the evening of the 28th.\n\nI inspected the Day School at Penticton, under Miss Weldert.\n\nEverything seemed in excellent shape. The school was tidy and clean, as also were the children. Their work was excellent. Miss Weldert is undoubtedly an excellent teacher.\n\nThere were fourteen children present out of a roll of 17, in grades 1 to 7, excepting grade 6.\n\nThe reading in all grades was very good. Grade 7 was well up to standard, and the children knew their work. Their writing was good as was their arithmetic.\n\nThis is undoubtedly one of the most successful day schools, and everyone is satisfied, children, teacher, parents and the Indian Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell\n(Signed)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nGSP/S\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6406, file 835-1, part 3)\nOttawa, February 5th, 1935.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your Pn. 1-10-2 of the 24th ultimo, with reference to the attendance at the Penticton Indian Day School.\n\nIn view of your report regarding the attitude of the Indians, the Department does not consider it advisable to take any special action at the present time towards forcing the children to attend school.\n\nInspector Barry's report shows that good work is being done at the school and you should encourage the teacher to continue putting forth her best efforts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJames Coleman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B. C.\nSir:\n\nre: Your File No.164-10-1.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th ultimo with reference to Mr. Inspector Barry's report regarding attendance at Penticton Indian Day School, and to advise that there are approximately 15 Indian children living within one mile of this school, and not attending same.\n\nThe Penticton Band petitioned the Department on December 21st 1921, the petition being signed by 16 members of the Band, and the school was built in 1923, but after it was opened a number of the petitioners commenced to oppose it, and finally, in 1925, my predecessor in office, Mr. Ball, attempted to enforce attendance and eventually issued summonses under the \"Indian Act\" to several parents, which were ignored. Bench warrants were issued, and when the R.C.M.P. attempted to put them into effect, some eighty-odd Indians opposed them by force and the officers were considerably mauled, one Indian coming seeking the gun of one of the officers, and probably would have used it, but for the prompt action of the R.C.M.P. Inspector. The arrests were made and convictions ensued, and there the matter rested, no increase in school attendance being effected.\n\nIn my opinion, the matter resolves itself into the fact that if we propose to enforce school attendance, there will be more or less a repetition of the previous trouble, but if the enforcement is once commenced, it should be followed through to the limit; otherwise not opened up at all. So far I have taken the attitude with the Penticton Band of endeavouring to sell them the idea of education, rather than legal enforcement, but I must admit that there has been no noticeable result. This attitude was taken largely for the reason that if an issue were made of the question, it placed those Indians who were sending their children to school in a rather difficult position, until such time as general enforcement were effected.\n\nIt seems to be an Indian idea in this Agency to petition the Department for something, and when we attempt to carry out their wishes, to have a large number of the original petitioners make an issue of the matter, and actively oppose it. This has happened twice in my experience on Okanagan I.R.No.1 and Okanagan I.R.No.9.\n\nI am rather inclined to the opinion that if the attendance at this school is not considered commensurate with the expenditure, it might prove more effective to inform the\nBand that unless they propose to give better support to the institution by the end of the present term, no further educational facilities will be provided, and close the school; and if it is re-opened in future, it would only remain open as long as the average attendance was maintained at a minimum of 25 pupils. It is problematical whether or not this would have the desired result, but in my opinion it is the most effective manner in dealing with the type of Indian we have in this Agency, and at the same time put it up definitely to the more progressive element to exert a greater measure of pressure on the backward element. If, however, the Department feels that attendance should be enforced, I will inform the Indians of our intentions and the B.O.O. in charge of the R.C.M.P. at Penticton to enforce attendance two weeks after my notice to the Indians.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(James Coleman)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nMiss C. McDonald at the Penticton Day School does not seem very happy in her new school and it is hoped that she will realize that this was a very excellent little school. I am afraid the danger here is that the attendance will fall off unless she can develop some enthusiasm.\n\nJames Coleman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJuly 25, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant, the Department approves the appointment of Miss Catherine McDonald as teacher of the Penticton Indian Day School.\n\nShe should begin duties at the latter school on September 1, and salary will be allowed her at the rate of $900 a year.\n\nPlease inform those interested accordingly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\n\nMajor D.

Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nOkanagan Indian Agency,\nVernon, B.C.\nAugust, 16 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have a letter from Miss Catherine McDonald informing me that she is taking over the Penticton Indian Day School at a salary of $90.00 per month.\n\nIn this connection I would point out that we have always paid the teacher $100.00 per month at this point and up to some time after Miss Weydert took over Janitor's allowance of $50.00 per annum, but this was cut off at the time of general economy reductions. The reason this school was paid a higher rate than Okanagan and Osoyoos was that the teacher did not have the advantage of quarters, etc.\n\nWill you kindly advise if this new rate of $90.00 for Penticton was in error and if not whether the Janitor's allowance could be restored?\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) James Coleman\n(Jas.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am forwarding herewith a copy of a letter received from Mr. Indian Agent Coleman, Okanagan Agency, with reference to the salary allowed for Miss C. McDonald on her transfer as teacher to the Penticton Indian Day School.\n\nYou will remember that on the nomination of His Excellency Archbishop Duke Miss C. McDonald was transferred from the Okanagan Indian Day School to the Penticton Indian Day School at a salary of $900.00 a year by authority of Departmental letter 164-10-1 of July 25th 1938.\n\nOn the nomination of His Excellency Archbishop Duke the Department approved of the appointment of Mr. T.N.Curteis as teacher of the Okanagan Indian Day School at a salary of $1,000.00 a year. Miss Weydert who had been teacher at the Penticton Indian Day School at a salary of $1,000.00 a year resigned her position to marry Mr. Curteis. The authority for Mr. Curteis's appointment is contained in Departmental letter 164-5-1 of July 25th 1938.\n\nI would request that the matter of the salary of the teacher at the Penticton Indian Day School be taken into consideration by the Department as Miss C. McDonald will in any case have to arrange for her own transportation daily to the school a distance of about two miles from Penticton Post Office. There is no residence for the teacher at the Penticton Indian Day School, while of course Miss McDonald lived at the teachers residence which forms part of the Okanagan Indian Day School while teaching there.\n\nI would recommend that if possible in any way Miss McDonald be paid a salary of $1,000.00 per year as teacher of the Penticton Indian Day School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding herewith a letter which I have received from Inspector Barry, and a copy of a letter received by him from Indian Agent Coleman, Okanagan Agency, with reference to the salary authorized for the new teacher of the Penticton Indian Day School, Miss C. McDonald.\n\nWe were anxious to have Mr. Curteis and his wife at the Okanagan Indian Day School, as it was felt that Mrs Cutteis, formerly Miss E. Weydert, would be able to do much for the Indian women and children on the Okanagan Indian Reserve No. 1. This young married couple would have the use of the living quarters attached to the Okanagan Indian Day School located on that Reserve and distant some fourteen miles from Vernon.\n\nThough not particularly anxious to transfer the teacher there, Miss C. McDonald, agreed to accept His Excellency's nomination and go as teacher to the Penticton Indian Day School.\n\nMiss McDonald, who is a very experienced teacher, will have to provide living accommodation for herself and her sister, who lived with her at the Okanagan school, and will have in addition to arrange for transportation from Penticton to and from the local Indian Day School. She will not be able to use a bicycle as Miss Weydert did, as she and her sister are around fifty years of age.\n\nUnder these circumstances I would agree with the recommendations of Indian Agent Coleman and Inspector Barry and request that if possible the salary of the teacher at the Penticton Indian Day School be not reduced to $900.00 per year but retained at the former figure of $1,000.00 per year.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nAugust 31, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 26th instant with reference to the salary that is being allowed to Miss C. McDonald who has been transferred to the position of teacher of the Penticton Indian Day School effective September 1.\n\nCareful consideration has been given to the contents of your letter but the Department feels that $900.00 is an adequate salary for Miss McDonald.\n\nHowever, it has been decided to allow an amount of $50.00 a year for janitor services. If Indian Agent Coleman so desires Miss McDonald can be appointed as janitor. She can either do the work herself or can employ Indians. In the latter event, of course, she will be expected to pay the Indians from the amount which she receives for janitor services.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 13th instant and my reply of the 17th instant, with regard to the resignation of Miss Catherine McDonald as teacher of the Penticton Indian Day School.\n\nWhen replying to you on September 17, I overlooked the fact that Miss McDonald had been in our employ since September 1, 1938, and consequently no deduction had been made from her salary for Retirement Fund purposes, as such deductions only commenced after September 1, 1939.\n\nMiss McDonald's salary for the month of June was computed as follows:\n\nGross Amount ........................................ $117.00\n\nDeductions:\nIncome Tax ........................................ $16.50\nPayment on Victory Bond ......................... 16.80\nPayment on War Savings Certificate ............ 1.00 34.30\nNet Amount paid ..................................... $82.70\n\nAs she was not paid salary for the months of July and August, there was only one deduction for the Victory Bond, namely, $16.80. If Miss McDonald desires to forward us $34.00 we will arrange to have the Bond sent to her. However, if she does not wish to do this but desires the return of the $16.80, it will be necessary\nfor her to make personal application for the refund of the payment of $16.80 to\n\nR. L.

The Okanagan School has been\nclosed for over a year, and there are approximately 40\nchildren awaiting its reopening and the Indians are all\nvery perturbed and dissatisfied with the situation. This\nis very regrettable as they are so anxious in that area,\nthat their children go to school and I recommend prior-\nity of this school be given over others where there\nare less children to attend.\n\nAlfred H. Barber\nIndian Agent.\nDear Mr. Barber,\n\nI thank you for your letter dated March 11th. As Napoleon has not been here since I wrote you, I presume he has received a letter from you giving the information he asked for. I am sorry to hear from you that Napoleon has such a poor record, but perhaps like many other young people, he will become wiser as he grows older especially if he marries and settles down.\n\nThere is another matter I wish to write to you about, perhaps you will kindly look into this and see what can be done.\n\nThe matter has been brought to my notice that Joseph Kruger would like his three children to attend the Penticton public school. I am informed that the Penticton Indian Day School has been closed since last October when Mrs. Macdonald, the teacher became indisposed, and that it has not been re-opened since, consequently, the children are without education. I gather that the school bus passes the Kruger's door as their house is situated on the main road.\n\nI believe the Department would be willing to pay the tuition fees if the School Board would accept the youngsters. You will recollect that the Oliver School took in young girls from Inkonseep last year so I do not anticipate the Penticton public school raising objection. Perhaps you would make enquires and see what can be done providing all the facts are as presented to me.\n\nPerhaps you will forgive me if I touch upon a personal matter. I cannot help feeling that you resent my asking you from time to time for information or assistance for the Indians. In doing so, it is not my wish to intrude into affairs coming within your jurisdiction, my action is motivated by the desire to help both the Indians and the Department and it is for this reason I approach you. The Indians and their problems are our concern,\" Mr. Jennesse said, \"they are bewildered and confused\" and whatever an individual can do, he should do.\n\nFor this reason I would like to ask that we meet from time to time in a friendly way and talk matters over. Please be assured Mr. Barber that my only wish is to help both you and the Indians, perhaps between us we might be able to guide them, for it is a lead they are looking for.\n\nIt will give me pleasure if you will ring me up when you are next in Oliver, I repeat my oftmade invitation that you will be very welcome at any time you may call to see me, or if you are too busy to come out, I will meet you in town.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPresident.\nBISHOP'S RESIDENCE\n\n813 WARD STREET\nNELSON, B.

No doubt you will be giving this matter your consideration.\n\nI have written to Mr. Barber (the Indian Agent at Vernon) concerning the Kruger children, I have no doubt he will make the necessary enquiries.

C.,\nFebruary 20, 1950\n\nMr. R. F. Davey,\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Davey,\n\nI inaugurated night classes in for adults three evenings a week from 6:30 to 9:00 for approximately ten weeks. The original plan was to teach reading and writing to a few of the older people who were without those skills but so many others ask if they might not attend that I found myself with an advanced class. I was pleased because it is such a good example to my own pupils, and to their parents many of whom are now pupils too. I decided their main need was everyday arithmetic and language, and because of the Clubwork I started, have also taught them how to conduct meetings properly and have been giving them a background of Canadian history. We have accomplished quite a bit of work. The Indians are quite handicapped by living so close to town. It seems as though they never thought it worthwhile to organize their own community as they could always drift in and loaf around in town. However, they were too busy to do that this winter for besides the night classes on Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays I have a Women's Club for handicrafts on Wednesday evening, and my husband has organized a men's club to teach them carpentry.\n\nAlthough this has taken most of my time I am anxious to continue the work next year. Could you supply me with the names of teachers working along this line, or any books that you have found useful guides in this line of adult education? I would like to learn more about cooperative projects but the groundwork can only be built slowly as there are two or three quite wealthy old Indians who will not be bothered about the others. I have quite a nice group of younger ones who are anxious to learn more modern methods.\n\nWill you give me authority to requisition both sets of readers for Grades III and IV? The group of beginners that I started with last year read very well. We finished the 'These are our Neighbours' shortly after Christmas and are reading the old Highroads Grades III and III.

Murray, district horticulturist at Penticton, was guest speaker at the adult education class held at the Indian day school last Friday evening.\n\nThe classes, which began in January, are held three times weekly under the direction of the day school teacher, Mrs. H. E. Hayes.\n\nIn all, 22 persons from the Indian Reserve have registered for the beginners' and advanced classes. Cold weather has hampered attendance.\n\nA variety of subjects are offered, from reading and writing for the beginners to land use, agriculture and Canadian history and government for the advanced group.\n\nMrs. Hayes, in an issue of \"Smoke Signals,\" the school newspaper, reports that the classes are making excellent progress.\n\nAs well as publishing day and night classes near the paper also intends to reproduce original stories, poems, drawings, or articles pertaining to Indian culture such as legends, beliefs and handicrafts.\n\nMost important, however, to be brought out at the Friday session was the need of an irrigation system for the reservation lands. It was pointed out that the water supply dwindles around the middle of July and that very seldom is there a sufficient supply during August.\n\nWith an adequate supply of water, it was felt, approximately 500 acres could be cultivated.\n\nOne result of the meeting will be that all cattle on the reservation will be sprayed this year to counteract \"warbles.\" It was pointed out that in the Similkameen area, spraying over a period of time had almost completely removed this menace.\n\nMr. Murray was thanked by Chief Gideon Eness and Mrs. Hayes.\n\nThose enrolled for the adult education classes are as follows: Beginners: Mrs. Angela Eness, Mrs. Helen Alex, Mrs. Susan Kruger, John Kruger, Joe Kruger, Felix Lezard, Elisabeth Felix, Antoine Felix; Advanced: Amelia Gabriel, Annie Eness, Mrs. Phillip, Edward Gabriel, Paul Gabriel, Anna Eness, Jacob Kruger, Irene Antoine, James George, Francis Phillip, Lizzie Lezard, Narcisse Gabriel, Louise Gabriel and Gleon Eness.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Davey favours the supply of these, which are to be used apparently in connection with the Adult Study group.\n\nIt is felt that Mrs. Hayes should be given as much encouragement as possible in this very fine effort.\n\nI am also enclosing a newspaper clipping which indicates some of the progress which is being made at this Adult Education group.\n\nW.S.

Arniel, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nSome members of Penticton Band have formed a club which they have named the \"Arrow Club\", and have applied for assistance to pay an instructor. Mr. Jack Hayes, husband of the school teacher at Penticton, is a qualified carpenter and offers his services for this purpose. As a matter of fact, Mr. Hayes has been instructing the Indians in this course for several weeks.\n\nThe original plan of the Club was to learn carpentry so they would be able to construct better homes, furniture, etcetera. Their present plans include the construction of a community hall on the reserve and Mr. Hayes has promised to supervise this work in connection with the Club activities.\n\nThe activities of this men's club is co-ordinated with the Homemaker's Club, organized by Mrs. Hayes, the teacher, and both clubs participate in an adult education programme which has been organized by Mrs. Hayes. Mr. Hayes' services will consist of three hours instruction every Wednesday evening and he will use his own tools for this purpose. He has signified that compensation of $20.00 per month would be satisfactory to him, and if you feel that this expense is warranted and funds are available for such purposes, I would be pleased to have this expense authorized.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nSuperintendent,\nOkanagan Indian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Citizenship & Immigration\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nUnder date of February 28th (file 835-1 E), Mr. Neary acknowledged receipt of information with regard to work being done by Mrs. Hayes in connection with adult education on the Penticton Reserve. We now have for consideration a proposal, reference Mr. Sampson's letter of February 27th attached, involving payment of $20.00 a month to Mr. Jack Hayes for instruction to members of a men's club known as the Arrow Club, the activities of which are coordinated with the Women's Homemakers Club.\n\nMr. Sampson recently discussed this matter with District School Inspector Davey who is inclined to favour the proposal and who reports very favourably with regard to the activities of the Arrow Club. Mr. Sampson's suggestion is recommended for favourable consideration on a trial basis for a period of four months from March 1st.\n\n-W. S.

Before forwarding your recommendation to the Director could you please advise us as to the number of Indians who are receiving instruction each Wednesday night. I would suggest that we put this proposal to the Director in the form of a payment of $5.00 per evening for vocational training for adult Indians.\n\nBernard P.

These last mentioned day schools are situated close together and have been confused on the files - thus the indecision regarding building.\n\nThe File Numbers are: Okanagan 164-5, Penticton 164-10, Salmon River 558462.\n\nR.T.F.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\n\nNo.\n\nALSO\n\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise in reply to your letter of the 16th August last that the tenders for the Okanagan Day School were duly forwarded on the 4th September but no reply has yet been received.\n\nAs the roads out to the Reserve are not good after the weather breaks up, construction should be commenced as soon as possible if the work is to be completed this year.\n\nWith reference to the temporary arrangement at Penticton whereby we are using the priest's house, this is very crowded and inconvenient for the 20 pupils enrolled and no others can be taken in. I hope the Department will find it possible to have building operations commenced there in the near future. This school will not include teacher's residence and will be smaller than the Okanagan School.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOTTAWA, October 24th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing a requisition from Miss Helen Coughlan, teacher of the Penticton Indian Day School, for payment of her travelling expenses from Hammond to Penticton.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department does not pay the expenses of teachers proceeding to their schools and, consequently, this account cannot be paid.\n\nIt is noted from the copy of Miss Coughlan's letter which you enclosed that she was given to understand the Department paid expenses of this kind.

The opposition to education has lessened materially since the school was started and I think too much attention has been paid in the past to the objections of ignorant members of the Band, both here and elsewhere. Anyone who sees the scholars and the other children together must be struck with the great difference already shown between them and I hope to see every Indian child in the Agency being educated, not merely for their own good, but for the good influence these children already have in their homes which is shown by increased attention to personal cleanliness, neatness of their homes, and other ways.\n\nAt the risk of being considered importunate, I respectfully request that the question of a school building on Penticton Reserve be given early attention.\n\nThere is only one school building in this Agency, the one opened this year on the Okanagan Reserve, although three schools are operating. As far as Indian opposition is concerned, I have noticed that every move I\nAss't. Dep. and Sec'y......(2)\n\nhave made to improve or advance their condition has always been opposed by some of them, but if attention is paid to this party the Bands will remain in their present state indefinitely. Of course educating the children is only a means to an end, viz. the improvement in their standard of living generally.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, March 22, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, urging the Department to arrange for the erection of the Penticton Indian Day School at an early date. I note that the crowded condition of the building we are at present utilizing as a classroom makes it imperative that better quarters be provided for the warmer weather.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that, although the Architect's Branch is very busy preparing plans and arranging for letting the contracts for several buildings this year, I am hopeful that an early commencement will be made in the case of the Penticton Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

A.\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of March 22nd last with reference to the erection of the day school at Penticton Indian Reserve.\n\nThe building which we have been using is too small to accommodate all the children who wish to attend and has been badly over-crowded since it has been used. I hope that the construction of the new day school can be proceeded with so that it can be ready for occupancy when school re-opens after the summer vacation. Only a small school is necessary and need not include a teacher's residence as it is within two miles of town and the present teacher has no difficulty in living in Penticton and teaching on the Reserve. Very good work has been accomplished and the children have made splendid progress under adverse conditions, but for health reasons they should not be kept in the small room at present in use longer than is absolutely necessary.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nGOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, British Columbia\n\nOKANAGAN AGENCY.\n\nTo Penticton Dray and Express Co.,\nPenticton, B.C.\n\nDATE DETAIL AMOUNT\n1923 June 29 Delivery, packing and storage charges on books and school supplies of the Penticton Indian Day School. $4.00\n\nPENTICTON, B.C., June 1923\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nIN ACCOUNT WITH Penticton Dray and Express Co.\nROBERT PARMLEY, PROPRIETOR\nCOAL, WOOD AND GENERAL HAULING\n\nDATE FOLIO CREDIT AMOUNT DEBIT AMOUNT TOTAL\nJune 29 Del Books etc from and to Indian School?

Etter and Pearson have asked for this further certificate to be forwarded. As stated in my letter of January 2nd when forwarding the first certificate for part payment, I do not know the contract price and am enclosing the forms in blank.\n\nIn connection with the school building, no provision was made in the plans for a cupboard of any kind. In the Okanagan Day School there is a cupboard off the school room in which to store books, stationery, brooms, etc., and it will be necessary to have some provision made. Etter and Pearson have quoted a price for constructing a cupboard 7' wide by 6'6\" high, complete with locks and painting, for $49.00. They have also tendered a price of $12.70 for five window screens, galvanized wire, painted and fixed in place and two screen doors 1\u00bc\" thick with Bonner spring hinges and catches, painted and fixed.\n\nI respectfully request advice as to these quotations.

The reason I did this was that inexperienced persons would probably do much damage to the new floor.\n\nIt was also necessary to have a box or cupboard in the wood-shed in which to keep the storm windows and screens when not in use, the cost being $3.00. If these articles are left in the wood-shed without protection, they would be damaged much beyond the cost of this cupboard.\n\nAs the building is near the main road, I was asked to have screens put in front of the toilets; the labour and material of this work was $13.45.\n\nIt was necessary, in order to save the expense of sending out men and material, to do the work before the contractors left, and I took the responsibility of having the necessary extra work attended to, and I hope it will be approved.\n\nThe cost of the work as shown herein is $25.70 which is fair and reasonable, and I asked the contractors to submit their price in each case before the work was commenced, and it is respectfully requested that payment be made to the contractors, Etter & Pearson, as per voucher No. 1541 attached.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n**GOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA**\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, British Columbia\n\n**OKANAGAN AGENCY**\n\nTo Etter & Pearson,\nPenticton, B.C.\n\n| DATE | DETAIL                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1924 | Apl. 15th Fitting up desks, Making box for storm sash and putting up screens for Penticton Indian Day School.

I would refer to your letter dated August 18th, last, in which you stated that the above amount would be the maximum required and should cover the cost of the floor, shingles, lumber for roof, windows and doors, and might allow something for a stove, stove pipe, and roof jack. It is noted that a further sum of $75 would be required to purchase material for the purpose of building desks of the old-fashioned type, with seats attached.\n\nIt is understood that the Indians will get out any logs required and do the work of erecting a building.\n\nYou may therefore arrange for the purchase of the materials required to complete the building and for the construction of the desks, to a total cost not exceeding $275. The Department is not prepared to supply standard desks at this point until we are assured that the work is successful. It is considered that wooden desks, made locally, would be satisfactory.\n\nPlease arrange for the purchase, from firms on the approved list, and have the materials forwarded to the site. You should supervise the work and arrange with the Indians to perform the labour. If it is intended that classes be conducted during the coming summer months, you should see that the work of completing the building is proceeded with as soon as possible. Please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, stating in detail the building materials purchased. These, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. In this connection it should be understood, however, that as the appropriation will not be available until after April first, next, payment of accounts cannot be made before that date.\n\nIf you find that the construction of the building is progressing satisfactorily and that it will be completed in time to open the school this coming summer, you may take up with the church authorities the question of nominating a suitable teacher. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated should be forwarded for the approval of the Department. The date on which it is intended to open the school and the length of time it will be conducted should be stated.\n\nYou are being written in a separate communication regarding the proposed summer school at Fort Grahame.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

C.\nVanderhoof, B.C., October 11th, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to attach hereto the attendance report of the Fort McLeod Summer school, along with a report from the teacher, which I trust you will find satisfactory.\n\nWhile on the subject of schools I wish to say that the total expenditure for school buildings both at Fort McLeod and Fort Graham this year amounted to approximately $120.00 out of the amount of $450.00 authorized by the Department. The new school at Fort McLeod was not completed last spring in time to hold school in, so that the church was used. However, now it is ready, except for the roof, windows and other material which will have to be shipped in and which will cost approximately $185.00 landed at the head of the waterways so that the Indians can get it. I would suggest that we allow the Indians sufficient gasoline to take the material down the river and lakes by boats and which should cost about $30.00 so that the $185.00 for material plus $30.00 for gasoline would be $215.00 and if agreeable to the Department I propose to make this purchase now of the money that is available and have it ready to go in first thing next May. This will make the total expenditure of $335.00 and the balance of $115.00 could be returned to the Treasury. Please advise me in this connection at your convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI would respectfully refer you to your letter of October the 19th last, File No. 163-125 relative to the purchase of material to complete the Indian Day School at Fort McLeod Indian Reserve. In November last Voucher No. 8276 was submitted from this office in favour of the Andersen Lumber Yard for the supplies in question, which with transportation charges from Prince George to Summit Lake amounted to $183.02. There is, however, a charge of approximately $20.00 for gasoline and oil for the Indians to take this material from Summit Lake down to Fort McLeod. This account however is not being submitted by me at this time as I deem it advisable not to buy goods of this nature until they are going to be delivered as there might be a difference in the price of gasoline and oil in the spring. I would, therefore, esteem it a favour if you would kindly give me the necessary authority to buy two barrels of gasoline and ten gallons of oil to be given to the Indians as soon as they come to Summit Lake early in May. The reason I am asking for this authority now is so that no delay will occur after the Indians arrive at Summit Lake. You will please understand that owing to no means of communication between Summit Lake and here it will not be possible for me to know when the Indians are coming until they actually arrive at Prince George, consequently I want to have everything ready for them when they do come.\n\nWhile I am on the subject of the Schools at Fort McLeod and Fort Graham I wish to advise that Mr. Cormack will again be available to teach at McLeod but we will have to get a new one for Fort Graham as Mr. ... will not be able to come up there this year. I have had one or two applications for the position at Fort Graham but owing to the lack of information given I had to return them to the applicants and ask that they give fuller information regarding themselves and their qualifications. Before I submit the applications to the Department for approval I will have them agreed to by the local church authorities who are in charge of those missions.\n\nIn the meantime would you be kind enough to advise me definitely if the salaries are going to be the same this year as last, and if it will be possible for the Department to consider a small grant towards travelling expenses for these boys getting from Prince George to Forts McLeod and Graham. As you know transportation costs down the rivers and lakes is quite an expense and even a grant of $15.00 or $20.00 to each teacher would certainly help a lot. Please advise in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n| Description                                      | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| 1 No. 224 Secondary Heater                      |          |            |       |\n| 1 Doc. 6\" Stove Lips                            |          |            |       |\n| 1 - 6\" Flue Pipe                                |          |            |       |\n| 1 - 6\" Collar                                   |          |            |       |\n| 1 Roof Jack                                     |          |            |       |\n| 1 pc. 36 x 72\" Galv.

This matter has been held in abeyance pending the appointment of a teacher, but should the Department approve the appointment of Miss Anne Wuchner, whose application is dealt with in a separate communication, I would recommend that the Department approve the purchase of a new heater at an approximate cost of $36.00.\n\nD.

The heater has had to be repaired each year for the past four years but I now recommend that a new heater of the circulatory type, coal burning, be supplied before the cold weather arrives.\n\nI have enquired locally and no suitable heaters are available and therefore cost of one can not be quoted.\n\nSize of class-room is approximately 26'x30'.\n\n(Alfred H.

Barber,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nVernon B.C.\n\nWith reference to the requisition of June 30th for supplies for the Penticton Day School you may spend an amount of $5.00 a month during the period November 1st, 1949 to April 30th, 1950 for the purchase of milk and cocoa to supply hot drinks to the children attending this school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nReference is made to District School Inspector Davey's report covering his inspection of the Penticton Indian Day School which was forwarded to you under cover of my letter of May 9th, particularly that section dealing with the condition of the building and outhouses.\n\nMr. Hett, in his letter of July 11th and enclosures attached, outlines the repairs necessary and the cost of same. You will note that general repairs are estimated to cost $453.60 and that Jack Hayes, contractor at Penticton, is prepared to supply all material and labour for this sum, and that interior and exterior painting will cost $711.20 for material and labour.\n\nNo specific provision was made in the Estimates for this work but according to Mr. Davey, with whom I have discussed the matter, the general repairs should be made this year and the painting could, if funds cannot be made available, be postponed until next year. I should appreciate being advised what funds can be made available for this school and if Mr. Hayes' tenders can be accepted. Apparently Mr. Hett has found it difficult to get anyone but Mr. Hayes interested in the work.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVernon, B.C.,\nJuly 11th, 1949.\n\nW.S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver.\n\nRe: Penticton Indian Day School\n\nWith reference to your letter of May 9th, file 10-11-5, and the District School Inspector's report, I enclose herewith an estimate of the cost of work that should be done on the Penticton Indian Day School this summer.\n\nBoth the boys and girls' toilets are in very poor shape and must be replaced.\n\nThe chimney now in the school is in good condition but is right in the centre of the front wall of the school, which means the pipes have to run over the teacher's desk, and the stove is between the desk and the class. If it was moved back to the wall it would take up too much of the blackboard space and would not heat the other end of the classroom where the doors are situated.\n\nThe chimney now required would be at the side of the school, near the back, and the stove would be behind the class. It would be less expensive to build a new chimney out of blocks (which are considered as good as bricks), than to take the brick chimney down and rebuild it.\n\nThe other items, cupboards and shelves, et cetera are all necessary.\nW.S. Arneil, Esq., - 2 - July 11th, 1949.\n\nWith regard to the painting, the outside could wait for another year, but should be done this year if possible.\n\nEstimates given by Jack Hayes, Contractor in Penticton.\n\nThe school Inspector's report also mentioned a well, but I will see if it is possible to pipe water into the school from a nearby spring. If this cannot be done I will obtain an estimate for digging a well.\n\n(D.M.

This return shows that the school was in operation 60 days during the quarter, but that the present teacher, Miss Bland, only taught for 21 days. The Department has had no intimation whatever of a change of teachers at this school and when the change occurred you should have at once informed it. In the meantime Miss Bland's earnings only are being paid, but, if Miss Tranter taught any part of the term, as the return would appear to show, the amount due her will be paid upon representation to that effect by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

It was in connection with the latter that the suggestion referred to was offered. I thought it would be easier to keep in touch with the changes made from time to time. In the case of Miss Bland the change was made by the Church authorities, and I did not know that Miss Bland was in Port Essington until I received the report for the quarter.\n\nI understand the school was taught by Rev. Mr. Pierce during the first part of the quarter. Miss Tranter is on a year's vacation, and is not likely to return to Port Essington.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6407, file 836-1, part 1)\nThe Indians remain in their village all summer, as there are so many canneries at this place, so the children could attend school, and some children who come from other villages when their parents come to work could attend too.\n\nThe new school house that I reported on my former inspection as not being properly completed, has been strengthened by the contractor, and is now in good shape. It has not been used as yet.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector.\nMarch 11, 1912.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq., Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that when visiting Fort Rossington last month I found that the Day School had been closed since the 4th of May 1911, when Miss Bland (only taught two months \u2014 a good teacher) left the school under instructions from the Rev. T. Perrier who informed her that they did not have the funds to keep her. I believe he expected the Missionary, the Rev. W.H. Pierce to teach, but he refused, as he did not have time (nor is he qualified).\n\nThe former teacher, Miss K. Tranter, having taught the school for twenty years or more was granted a year's furlough with pay by the Church authorities, but the Indians were told that she would return as teacher at the end of her furlough. At the end of January, 1912, Miss Tranter was sent to Bella Bella School.\n\nI found the Rossington Indians very much aggrieved by this. They stated that the premises made that Miss Tranter would return to their school after her holiday had been broken, and they requested that if the Church does not open the school, that the Department furnish them a teacher.\n\nI found there were twenty-two children of school age in the village that had been home all winter, and their parents are anxious for them to be at school. During 1910 and the first part of 1911 a number of the Rossington Indians went up the Skeena cutting wood, etc., for the railway construction camps, but when the work was finished near by they returned to the village.\n\nThis school can be kept open ten months and a half of the year, and it is important that a suitable teacher be in charge.\n\nI talked this matter over with Rev.

I have to ask you to be good enough to see that the wishes of the Department in this respect are carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt., of Methodist Indian Missions,\nBrandon, Man.\nI beg to report that I visited the Indian Day school at Fort Essington on the 29th ultimo, and found the school closed. As the school should rightly have been open for a week, I called on Miss Fanny Noble, the teacher who taught last term, under the direction of Rev. G. H. Raley, of the Methodist Church, who resides at Port Simpson. I was informed by Miss Noble that she was quite willing to teach, but that she had not been instructed to do so and was under the impression that her services were no longer required by the Church authorities.\n\nIn view of the fact that Miss Noble is a successful teacher, and has won the favor of the Church and Government officials; thinking also that Rev. Mr. Raley's omission was an oversight, I asked Miss Noble to start school again on the following Monday (today). She gave me her assurance that she would do so. I am writing Rev. Mr. Raley today, explaining my position. There were a number of children of school age in the village, and the parents were asking why the school was not open. I trust that my action has your approval.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant;\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nPort Essington, B.C.\nSept. 3rd 1913\n\nJ.

Your action, therefore, is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakatla, B.C.\nWith further reference to my letter to you S.P., of September 1st instant concerning the opening of the Port Essington Indian day school for the Fall term, I regret to have to admit a very foolish error on my part in having supposed that the school should have been opened a week earlier than the date of my visit. By strange coincidence also both Miss Noble and I had overlooked that Labor Day came on the 1st and that the school should rightly have been opened on the 2nd instant in accordance with the latest regulations of the Department.\n\nThe fact that Miss Klippert opened the Metlakatla Indian Day school on the 25th August, at the same time as the Provincial day school was opened, led me to become confused slightly at the time of my visit. Miss Klippert is paid solely by the Department as in the case of the teacher at Massett, and she had expressed her willingness in the interests of her pupils to fall into line with the Provincial regime.\n\nThe fact remains, however, that Miss Noble had received no instructions from Rev. Mr. Raley to conduct school this term, and was under the impression that her services were no longer required. Rev. Mr. Raley has expressed his satisfaction with the arrangement made to have Miss Noble conduct school this term; and appears to have forgotten to mail instructions to her. He also agrees that Miss Noble did satisfactory work during former terms.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nExtract of letter received from Rev.

She is deeply interested in her work amongst the Indian children.\n\n(Sgd.) Charles Clifton Perry\nIndian Agent.\nExtract from Report on the Schools in the Nama Agency by Mr. A.M. Tyson, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Dated October 19, 1915. Original on File 427021-61\n\nFORT ESSINGTON DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThis school was visited the 25th of September, but it being Saturday, same was closed. Miss Noble is the teacher in charge and reports the attendance fair and the children making satisfactory progress. The building is a good one and well equipped with the necessary furnishings.\n\nSgd. A. M. Tyson,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am taking the liberty of writing you in order to express my views regarding the education of Indian children in this village.\n\nDuring the past few years conditions have changed very much. Formerly, it was easy to secure a good attendance at the Day School for the greater part of the year, but it is very difficult. Civilization has come. Whites and foreigners are all around us. This makes it more difficult for the Indians to earn their living at home, and when he moves out, whether it be to fish camp, hunting ground, logging camp, or other places of employment that have opened up since the whites...\ncame, his wife and children go too.\n\nHere, any progress that has been made at school during the period they have been able to attend, is all lost during the next few weeks or months absence, and on their return, the teacher has to begin and go over the same ground again, thus no real progress to the child and both teacher and pupil are discouraged.\n\nA large sum of money is expended by the government year by year to carry on these Day Schools, and educate the Native children. And it seems as if so little is accomplished as a result. May I suggest what in my opinion could be a change for the better? I refer to a Boarding School\u2014a small building to accommodate say about twenty-five or thirty.\n\nIf we had such a building, the parents of these children would place them there instead of taking them away at intervals. Many many times they have come to me before leaving, say \"I am only to\nhave to take my children away from school, but I cannot leave them behind, for there is no place where they can stay.\"\n\nThe Indians living at Port Essington are two tribes, formerly belonging to the Kit-um-Kalen village, which is a distance of almost forty miles up the river, and to Kit-se-las, which is another village about six or eight miles further above that.\n\nAt the time of the construction, some of the families moved there in order that they might work on the G. J. and P. Canal; they took their children along.\n\nAt Kit-um-Kalen, there are about ten children of school age, and no school. Early in spring, they come down here for the summer's work, where their children attend school here until the holidays begin. These people often say how much better it would be if their children could attend school the whole of the year, so that if a boarding school were here, they would be glad to leave them.\nAt Kik-e-las, there is a school, but there,\na mile, the attendance is irregular, and from\nthe same cause.\n\nIf a small building were erected here at Port\nEsquimalt, the children belonging to these three\nplaces could all be taken in and receive\nregular instruction and make good progress\nthat would satisfy the government, and be\nvery pleasing to their parents.\n\nThe government has been especially fond\nin doing their utmost to educate and\ndevelop the Indian race; therefore these\nfew suggestions will I trust be helpful\nto them in their future plans for further\ndevelopment.\n\nBefore closing, I might add, that as a mis-\nsionary, I have known these people for about\n34 years. They moved down in a body with\nall their children and belongings right from\ntheir heathen homes surroundings at that\ntime, in order to live a Christian life, and\nbe taught in the Christian way.\n\nI was sent here here as missionary\nteacher. In three days there were no\nwhites living here except one man, Mr. Robert Crosthwaite by name, the leader.\n\nAfter remaining with these people a short time, I was sent to another field in the Upper St. Lawrence. Six years ago we were moved from our home up here to again came at this mission. During the years that intervened from my first coming here till now, I have been in close touch with this people, having always come down in spring with the upper river Indians on the fishing season. I stayed at the mouth of the river until the fishing closed.\n\nYou will have readily see how I have watched and followed all the many changes that have taken place during that time. That same valley has given me several experiences. In those early days, there was only a steamer calling occasionally among the Indians; canoes were the only mode of travelling then a most wonderful change came, when river boats began to operate up and down the river. We could travel to Toronto in a few days instead of taking two weeks a mile. Then more wonderful still was the coming of the railroad, trains into the place.\nof chambers. How we can arrive at Hazelton in a few hours from starting.\n\nWill you respond in your valuable time any further. At any time you desire all information that I could give I shall be pleased to answer any question in the best of my knowledge.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nW.H. Pierce\nOttawa, January 11th, 1937.\n\nSir,\n\nInspector Cairns, who visited the Port Essington day school on October 9th, last, reports that the average attendance at this school, for the past year was less than eight out of an enrolment of thirty.\n\nThe Department desires that there should be a better attendance at this school and you are expected to put forth every effort to increase the attendance, at once. If necessary, the regulations should be enforced.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the Department of the result of your action in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Perry Esq.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Perry:\n\nI am enclosing my report for this quarter and I'm really proud of the attendance, which has been very regular since the middle of November. On Dec. 26th we had an entertainment and 33 children took part. It was really splendid and they have received high praise from the white population. You asked me to let you have the names of the boy and girl who attended the greatest number of days till Christmas. Ethel Nelson has attended 69, and John Spencer 59 out of 85 school days, which I think is splendid; and Ethel Nelson especially is deserving of a prize.\n\nI am also enclosing the receipt from Geo.

Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nExtract from Agent Perry's report on the Fort Essington Day School for the month of May, 1916. Original on 121237/7.\n\nI am of the opinion that as soon as it is possible to allow Miss Noble an increase of salary this should be done. She is a most patient and resourceful worker.\n\nExtract from Agent Perry's report for the month of December, 1916.\n\nMiss Noble is doing well at this school. Her salary is small for the amount of work she does. Some time ago I recommended that the same be raised, but I have received no word from the Department as to this.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No.121237-1, of the 11th instant, concerning the report of Mr. Inspector Cairns on the poor attendance at the Port Essington Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply thereto I beg to say that the enrolment at this school is misleading. It is customary for the teacher to retain on the register the names of children who, whilst visiting Port Essington with their parents from other villages up the Skeena river sometimes attend school.\n\nThe enrolment should be reduced to twenty for a basis of criticism. The teacher has often made the remark that Indians cannot be expected to leave their children alone when they are off to their camps to get food supplies. The parents have not the means wherewith to provide for their children keep whilst they are away. The boarding schools are full to overflowing, and many of the children could not enter a boarding school not being sufficiently healthy.\n\nSometimes this school is not able to accommodate the number of children, and the teacher asks for more desks. I am enclosing herewith a photograph taken of Miss Noble and her scholars, taken in December ultimo.\n\nI consider the attendance, under all circumstances, good, and Miss Noble's work quite satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 10, 1920\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of your letter of the 22nd ultimo, applying on behalf of Miss Noble, teacher of the Port Essington Indian Day School, for an increase of $200.00 in her salary from the 1st of January last, I beg to say that this matter is being referred to Rev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Day Schools, who arranges with the Department the salaries paid to teachers in Methodist Indian schools. As soon as a reply is received you will be advised as to the Department's decision in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert,\nB. C.\nOttawa, February 10, 1920\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nMiss Fanny J. Noble, teacher of the Port Essington Indian Day School has applied through Mr. Agent Perry for an increase in her salary of $200.00 per annum from January 1st, last.\n\nThe salary now allowed her, namely $600.00 per annum, is the amount asked for by you when arranging the schedule of salaries for teachers in the Methodist Indian Day Schools in October last. I may say that Miss Noble also receives the bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum. She has no teacher's certificate, having only attended High School for two years.\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to curtail expenditure to the lowest possible point but will be pleased to receive your views as to whether you consider Miss Noble should be granted any increase in her salary.\n\nYou, no doubt, know the situation personally at Port Essington and whether Miss Noble's services are such as would warrant any further increase. The Department will be pleased to have an early reply as to your views in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nAgent Perry requests that Miss Fanny J. Noble, teacher of the Port Essington Indian Day School, be granted an increase in salary of $200.00 per annum from January 1st, last. She is receiving at present $600.00 per annum and the bonus. This is the amount of salary asked for by Rev. T. Perrier in the schedule of teacher's salaries submitted by him in October last.\n\nMiss Noble has taught this school for a period of eight years. She has no teacher's certificate but attended High School in Victoria for two years.\n\nInspector Cairns states that she does fair work, the pupils read fairly well, spell accurately and the writing and drawing show close supervision on the part of the teacher. There is an enrolment of 22 pupils with an average attendance of 13.\n\nThere is no doubt that the cost of living at Port Essington is very high, but with the qualifications that Miss Noble possesses she is receiving at the present time as high a salary, except in two cases, as the other teachers in the schools conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church. The teachers at Port Simpson and Skidegate Methodist schools receive $900.00 each per annum.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPlease reply to Mr. Perry.\n\nA.G.M.\nExtract from letter received from Chas. C. Perry, Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B. C. Dated January 22, 1920.\n\nOriginal on 121237-5.\n\nI beg further to advise the Department that Miss Noble, the teacher, has informed me that she is finding it very difficult to get along on the amount paid her for salary. She asks that she be granted an additional allowance of $200.00 per annum beginning January 1st.\n\nI would recommend that the Department favourably consider this suggestion.\n\n(Sgd.) Chas. C.

Ferrier,\nBrandon, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to yours of March 1st, I may say I have neither 2nd nor 3rd Class Certificate. I took the 2 years High School course, but was unable to attend Normal School at the time, through financial difficulties at home. My standing as a teacher can only be judged by the work I have done in this school during the last 7\u00bd years. My knowledge and understanding of the Indians of this district has enabled me to reach them in such a way as to gain better results than even a certificated teacher coming from the city. I have been conscientious in my work and have spared no effort, in and out of school hours. I don't consider my request unreasonable but moderate, judging from salaries paid to other teachers around this district\u2014and the price of commodities to live and keep oneself respectable. I just received your letter by this evening mail and trust that my reply reaches you before you leave for Ottawa. I also trust my request will meet with your approval. I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSamuel J.

The matter had also been taken up with the Provincial School Inspector, and their admission into the public school arranged.\n\nI am fully in accord with Capt. Barry's recommendation in the matter as I believe it will be in the best interests of the children concerned.\n\nWith regard to the work of the school, I shall communicate with the teacher, Mrs. Fosson, advising her that the Department expects greater progress to be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWEC, JJ\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 29th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department has just received Inspector Barry's report regarding his visit to the Port Essington Indian Day School on the first instant. He points out that there are too many children attending this school, and recommends that the ten children who cannot be considered as Indians within the meaning of the Act be excluded from the Indian school. He states that these children can attend the local provincial day school and that the provincial inspector wishes these children to attend that school. It appears from the Inspector's report that the teacher's daughter is included among the ten children mentioned above.\n\nPlease let me know at once if you agree with this recommendation of Inspector Barry. He advises that he has already discussed the matter with you. The Department feels that it would be in the best interests of the Indian children attending this school to take the action recommended by Inspector Barry, but a definite decision will not be made until your reply is received.\n\nYou may inform the teacher, Mrs. Pogson, that the Department is not satisfied with the work that she is doing and that, unless there is a very decided improvement at this school before the next visit of the Inspector, the Department will be obliged to consider dispensing with her services at the end of the next academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nEXTRACT from Inspector Barry's Report regarding his inspection of the PORT ESSINGTON INDIAN DAY SCHOOL on May 1st, 1936 - Original on File 168-6-6.\n\nTeacher:- Mrs. Elizabeth Pogson. Age 54.\n\nThere is a very definite reason for the failure of the children during the past year. There are too many children for this rather elderly teacher. Suggestions are made below to eliminate this difficulty. It will also be understood that I have done everything possible to help the teacher with regard to methods, etc. She is however rather too old to make much use of my \"Demonstration and Type Lessons\". Her knowledge of the Psychology of Teaching is in my opinion very limited, hence she does not get the best results, and her pupils suffer. Mrs. Pogson is nearing the end of her teaching career, and I am afraid that it will not be very long before she forces me to ask the Department to make a change of teachers here. I think that a letter from the Department to this teacher stating that her work has not been considered very satisfactory during the past year by the Inspector of Schools might result in some improvement in the work.\n\nThe 10 children who cannot be considered as Indians within the meaning of the Indian Act were taken off the Register by the teacher on instructions of Mr. Indian Agent Collison.\n\nThere is not sufficient seating accommodation for the Indian children and the extra 10 children now attending this school. In addition, the teacher is not able to teach all the children with success. The standard of the work is thus falling and nothing that I can do will improve matters.\n\nI have therefore to recommend that the ten children at present attending this school who are not Indians, and this includes the teacher's own little girl, be EXCLUDED FROM THE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL. I understand that they will be admitted to the local Provincial Day School, which is located within a few hundred yards. I also understand that it is the wish of the Provincial Inspector of Schools for this District that these children be sent to the Provincial School. I agree with him.\nhim in every way. I would ask that definite instructions be sent to the Indian Agent, Mr. W. E. Collison, to instruct the teacher, Mrs. Pogson, to exclude all children who are not Indians from the Port Essington Indian Day School. This will make the provision of new single desks less necessary and give the teacher a chance to pull up the general standard of the work in the Primary Grades.\n\nAs I am not anxious to recommend that a new teacher be appointed here at the present time, I have taken the only remaining course and recommended a reduction in the number of children to be taught. The children who attend the school while living on the Indian Reserve though not Indians belong to two families. There are good reasons I understand why these particular families should be allowed to remain on the Indian Reserve. The child of the teacher is falling back in her work and I consider she too should attend the Provincial School, and be taught by someone other than her mother.\n\nNo doubt, the Department will wish for a full report on the matters mentioned above from the Indian Agent. I may say that these matters have been discussed with Mr. Indian Agent Collison on several occasions during the past two years, and I believe we are in complete agreement with regard to the necessity for the exclusion of the NON INDIAN CHILDREN in this case, without laying down any general rule which must be followed in all such cases.\nJanuary 21st,\n1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your favor of the 20th instant,\nwith the information that Mr. Indian Agent Collinson,\nPrince Rupert, has engaged the services of Mrs. Elizabeth\nPogson as teacher of the Fort Essington Indian Day School\nto succeed Miss Dorothy Dean, resigned. I note that Mrs.\nPogson has the necessary professional qualifications and\nteaching experience, and the appointment should prove quite\nsatisfactory.\n\nBelieve me\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nJNS.MLT\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6407, file 836-1, part 1)\nOttawa, January 20, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. Indian Agent Collison, Prince Rupert, has engaged the services of Mrs. Elizabeth Pogson as teacher of the Port Essington Indian Day School to succeed Miss Dorothy Dean, who resigned from the end of December, last. Mrs. Pogson holds a professional second class certificate for British Columbia and has had eight years' experience in teaching. She has an invalid husband to support and a five-year-old child. It is presumed that they will live with her on the Reserve. The salary allowed Mrs. Pogson will be at the rate of $100 per teaching month. We trust the appointment of Mrs. Pogson as teacher at Port Essington will be satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. R. B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto, 2, Ont.\nOttawa, January 20, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, informing the Department of the appointment of Mrs. Elizabeth Pogson as teacher of the Fort Essington Indian Day School to succeed Miss Dorothy Dean whose resignation took effect at the end of December last. The qualifications which Mrs. Pogson possesses have been noted and are satisfactory. It is also noted that by making this appointment the school work is being continued without a break. The Department approves of the appointment of Mrs. Pogson, with salary at the rate of $100 per teaching month, and the authorities of the United Church of Canada are being informed of her appointment. It is hoped that she will meet with every success in the work at this school.\n\nRelative to the request to supply fuel and light, I have to say that you may arrange to furnish the quantity of fuel required, and you should obtain same at the lowest possible cost. The Department, however, considers that the teacher should provide her own lighting. I may say that the supplying of fuel is to be continued only during the period Mrs. Pogson teaches at this school. If, in the future, the services of a single teacher are engaged she would, no doubt, be able to obtain boarding accommodation as in the past. In such case, the supplying of fuel would not be allowed. You should forward a properly certified voucher covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the fuel supplied Mrs. Pogson.\n\nYou might inform the Department whether Mr. Pogson, who, it is noted, is an invalid, will reside on the Reserve with his wife, as the Department does not desire, unless in exceptional cases, that a man having no duties in connection with Indian work live on a Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert,\nB.C.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of Dec. 30th last regarding the appointment of a teacher for the Fort Essington Indian Day School, and in reply would state that on Miss Deane's resignation which took place at the end of the year I immediately appointed Mrs. Elizabeth Pogson who had applied for the position at the time I received Miss Deane's note.\n\nMrs. Pogson holds a professional second-class certificate for B.C. and has had eight years experience in teaching. I am enclosing copy of her last inspector's report. By this appointment the school work was continued without a break, and I would recommend that the appointment be endorsed, and that Mrs. Pogson be allowed a salary of $100.00 per teaching month.\n\nAs I understand Mrs. Pogson has an invalid husband to support, and a five-year old child, a request has been made for a fuel and lighting allowance which, if possible, I would recommend. Young teachers previously have been able to board out and have not required a fuel allowance. The appointment, however, of a married woman may prove more satisfactory as she is likely to remain for a longer period.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent\nTo Whom It May Concern\n\nThis certifies that Miss Elizabeth Close has taught during the past two years in my Inspectorate, last year doing very successful work in Dominion City public school. The previous work she did excellent work in Stephenfield S.D.\n\nI can unhesitatingly recommend her to any School Board desiring an industrious, earnest and successful teacher.\n\nW.C. Hartley\n\nInspector of Schools,\n\nCarman, Man.\nOttawa, December 30, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nA communication has been received from Rev. Arthur Barnar, of the Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, informing the Department that Miss Dorothy Deane, teacher of the Port Essington Indian Day School, has given up duties. Mr. Barnar states that he has telegraphed you regarding the appointment of Miss Mabel Widsten, of Bella Coola, to succeed Miss Deane. I shall be pleased to hear from you as to whether you have obtained the services of Miss Widsten and, if so, what salary you would recommend she be paid and the date she began duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

If Miss Widsten accepts, the Department will approve of her appointment. No doubt, we will hear from Mr. Collison as to the action taken by him with reference to obtaining a successor to Miss Deane. We are communicating with him regarding the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev.

W. H. Pierce, to the effect that Miss Dean, teacher of the Day School at that point, has left for good. In the emergency, I took the liberty of sending a night letter to Mr. W. E. Collinson, Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, last night, informing him that I have received a letter from Miss Mabel Widsten, of Bella Coola, who taught at Klemtu last year. She asks if there is a vacancy in British Columbia, so I have suggested to Mr. Collinson that, providing he has no one nearer, he write to her and engage her for the balance of the school year to fill this vacancy.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory to the Department, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nArthur Barner\n\nAB.MLT\nNovember 27th,\n1929\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your favor of the 26th - File No. 168-6-1 - with the information that Mr. Indian Agent Collinson of Prince Rupert has engaged the services of Miss Dorothy Deane as teacher of the Port Essington Day School where her duties began on November 5th.\n\nI thank you for this information and am glad to know that the position is so satisfactorily filled and the appointment meets with the approval of the Department, with salary at the rate of $100.00 per teaching month.

LOUISE PARKLEY,\nPort Essington, B.C.-Sept.18/29.\n\nDear Mr. Barnet:\n\nI have been here since the beginning of the month but have only had school two days on account of measles epidemic, with new cases coming up all the time, but outside of that I have decided I cannot stay here. I could not live in the hospital, it is too large and barn-like for one person to stay in alone and the kitchen which I would have to use is horribly dirty and I would not begin to clean it. Dr. Large then gave me permission to stay in the nurses' home and I went to work and fixed up two rooms and bought a stove and linoleum for the floor and several other things and stayed there a few nights but could not put up with it. There are drunken men ranging around this town and fighting every night and it is not safe for any woman to live alone. You will know I am not exaggerating facts for I have lived alone before several times and am not nervous, but in view of the fact that terrible things have happened here I think the Department should be approached and a mounted policeman should be stationed here for a time and get the place cleaned up, for it is the Indians who drink and fight and some of the worst offenders live right next door to where I have to live.\n\nThe measles will likely keep the school closed for some time and you will have time to arrange for another teacher. I am going to Hazelton in the meantime and after awhile you might find some place else for me. I would just as soon go back to the prairie as have this to put up with. I don't really want to give up the work but this experience has not been very pleasant and I have been in bed for a week staying with Mrs. Hunt whom I knew in Hazelton. There is no place to board here or I would have managed that way.\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Asst.

Noble, teacher of the Port Essington Indian Day School, be granted an increase in salary of $200.00 per annum, from the first of January, last. She is receiving at present $600.00 per annum and the bonus.\n\nAs this school is under the auspices of the Methodist Church, Rev. T. Ferrier was written to regarding the qualifications which she possesses and asked to state his views in the matter. He now encloses a letter which he received from Miss Noble and she is asking that her salary be $750.00 per annum, plus the bonus.\n\nShe has taught this school for a period of eight years. She has no teacher's certificate, but attended High School in Victoria for two years. Inspector Cairns states that she does fair work; the pupils read well and the general class-room work shows close supervision on the part of the teacher. There is an enrolment of 22 pupils, with an average attendance of 13. Mr. Ferrier states that she has given excellent satisfaction as teacher. She has good natural ability, does good work as teacher, keeps the place looking well and is doing as good a work as most of our certified teachers, and he requests that she receive the salary she asks for.\n\nShe is making this request on account of the cost of living at Port Essington. She is at the present time receiving as high a salary, except in two cases, as the other teachers in the schools conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church. The teachers at Port Simpson and Skidegate receive $900.00 each per annum.\n\nI beg to request your decision as to whether Miss Noble's\nNoble's salary be increased by $150.00 per annum, or to the amount of $750.00, together with the bonus, if continued, from the first of April.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nThis appears to me a reasonable request.\n\nK. P. E. L.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your enquiry re Miss Noble's qualifications as a teacher:\n\nI enclose you a letter that I have received from her. She has requested that her salary be $750.00 plus the war bonus. Miss Noble has taught the Port Essington school for some years and has given excellent satisfaction as a teacher. She has good natural ability, does good work as a teacher, keeps the place looking well and is doing as good a work as most of our certificated teachers. I believe that Mr. Cairns your Inspector is always satisfied with his inspection at this point. Personally I would be sorry to see her leave Port Essington and if it is possible for the Department to grant her the request I would like it to be done.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\n\nTF/GF\nGOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCE OF SASKATCHEWAN\nCANADA\n\nG.B.

Muller, B.A., B.Ed., of Weyburn on June 10, 1932 in Range View School District #599. Inspector Muller's report in part is as follows:\n\n\"Mr. Severson is a highly promising teacher. He aims to provide purposeful work that interests and satisfies. His method of teaching has a very strong tendency towards the projects idea. His questions are well selected and require considerable thought. His classroom manner is pleasing and his discipline is good...He is well liked by the pupils and ratepayers.\" Mr. Muller's general estimate is \"highly promising.\"\n\nIn this school he had twenty-one pupils from Grades 1 to VIII inclusive.\n\nOn May 29, 1933 Inspector Muller saw Mr. Severson's work in the same school with the same grades. In general his report is along similar lines to the former one. He states the discipline is good and that the pupils are making average progress, although some of them appear to be over graded.\n\nOn October 10, 1933 Inspector Muller saw Mr. Severson's work again at Tenhild School, District #1060. He had fifteen pupils in Grades 1, II, IV, V, VII, IX and X. He reported that the pupils were making average progress.\n\nOn September 11, 1935 in Dravland School District #947 Mr. Muller again inspected Mr. Severson's work. He had thirty pupils in Grades 1 to VII inclusive. On the occasion of this visit while commenting on Mr. Severson's good personality...\nand the good organization of his work he criticized Mr. Severson's assignments as being not sufficiently definite and searching. He found that the pupils were interested, responded well and that the general tone and discipline of the school were good.\n\nOn September 16, 1936 Mr. Severson's school was inspected by Inspector J.R. Fraser of Radville. There were twenty-nine pupils in Grades 1 to VIII inclusive. Mr. Fraser comments favorably on the organization of the work, the classroom management and the provision of purposeful seat work. He describes Mr. Severson as a conscientious teacher of a very good type who should give satisfactory service.\n\nI trust the above will be of assistance to you in appraising Mr. Severson's qualities as a teacher in relation to the schools in your charge.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector of Teacher Training and Supervision.\n\nThe Home Board of Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\nRoom 411,\nDominion Bank Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nAugust 19th, 1937.\n\nMr. R.A.Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have your letter advising that Mrs. Elizabeth Pogson has resigned.\n\nIn a letter some time ago, Dr. Osterhout intimated that he would recommend Mr. Earl Benjamin Severson, a married man with a Saskatchewan certificate. I have wired Dr. Osterhout asking him to forward to me immediately the credentials, etc., which Mr. Severson holds so that I can submit them to you officially. In the meantime, I am writing this so that you will know the matter is receiving attention.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD:HC\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nAugust 21st,\n1937.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,- Re: Nominations, British Columbia Schools\n\nI have now letters from British Columbia, relative to the vacancies and changes in the Schools and beg to make the following nominations:\n\n1. Bella Coola. To replace Miss Young, Mr. T. Reginald Kelly. This is a transfer from Kitselas. Mr. Kelly is the son of a missionary and has taught under your Department previously.\n\n2. Kitselas. To replace Mr. Kelly, we beg to nominate Mrs. Irene Margaret Wilson. Mrs. Wilson is a graduate of the Victoria Normal School. Her husband is a returned soldier and my information is that, owing to his wounds or disability, he is not able to provide a living for his family.\n\n3. Port Essington. I beg to nominate Mr. Earl Benjamin Severson. Mr. Severson has a Saskatchewan Provincial Second Class Certificate and moved to British Columbia from the dried out area. I beg to enclose the report from Dr. G.B. Stillwell of the Department of Education, Saskatchewan.\n\n4. Port Simpson, Senior Room. Miss Lillian Kathleen How, B.A., graduate of the University of British Columbia and Vancouver Normal School. She taught for a year and a half at the Alberni Indian School.\n\n5. Port Simpson, Junior Room. Miss Leila Swartz. Miss Swartz holds an Interim First Class Teacher's Certificate for British Columbia and attended the Teacher Training Courses at Victoria in 1933 and holds certificates for Primary Grade Course and Course for Teachers in Indian and Rural Schools.\n\nIn his letter to me, Dr. Osterhout says these applications have been considered by him with Captain Barry who approves of them, but this is only second hand information and you will, no doubt, receive a communication from Captain Barry in due course.\nThis leaves the only vacancy in British Columbia at Kispiox. We have not yet resolved our difficulties. Captain Barry had agreed, as I understand, that if Mr. McConnell were transferred from Kitamaat to Kispiox and Mr. Burchill went to Kitamaat, he would offer no objections for a year, but Mrs. McConnell's health is such that the move cannot be made and we shall have to wait for a few days before we have a definite recommendation to make to you.\n\nWith best regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD:ENS\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 16th inst. No.168-6-1 regarding the Port Essington Day School, I would state that at the time of my visit, there were only six pupils present, most of the children having left the reserve with their parents to engage in fishing and other seasonal occupations.\n\nBy referring to the March (1938) quarterly school return, it will be seen that there are twenty-one pupils enrolled and attending school.\n\nAttendance during the winter months is fairly regular with the exception of one family whose attendance is not satisfactory.

Mines & Resources.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nOur information is that Mr. Andrew Rutherford is leaving Port Essington, and as a successor I beg to nominate Mr. Francis W. Chilton. Mr. Chilton is forty-two years of age and is married. He is a graduate of the Regina Normal School, 1923, and has a first-class professional, permanent certificate for the Province of Saskatchewan. He has also had twenty years' teaching experience. There is no question in my mind concerning his ability. He is the son of one of the ministers of the British Columbia Conference who has recently superannuated. He served during the last war and has a disability pension of 30 per cent., on account of chronic bronchitis, due to gas. Mr. Chilton will, I think, be a very satisfactory teacher. I understand that Captain Barry approves of his nomination.\n\nWe shall be glad to have your confirmation as soon as possible, as it is necessary for Mr. Chilton to leave Vancouver not later than September 24th.\n\nWe are having a great deal of difficulty in getting teachers for some of these schools, due to the reduction in the number of teaching months, which has brought the salary almost below the minimum set by the Provincial Government for teachers.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The various transfers of teachers of Indian schools working under the auspices of the United Church of Canada have been noted.\n\nI have suggested to Mr. Rutherford that he call on me at an early date so that I may give him some help with regard to the limits of work in the Grades and the methods in use in the Indian schools before he goes to Port Essington, which school I hope to visit on my forthcoming inspection tour in the Bella Coola, Skeena River, Babine, and Stuart Lake Agencies.\n\nWith regard to the transfer of Mr. J.B. Glover to Alberni Indian Day School from Klemtu, I may say that Mr. and Mrs. Glover have three big children of High School age and a baby. Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge has been requested to inform me which of the two cottages on Department property at the site of the Alberni Residential School will be available for the new teacher and his family, what furniture, if any, is available, and if any absolutely necessary repairs are recommended before the teacher takes up residence there.\n\nShould some small repairs be needed to the above cottages located so conveniently near the building used as the Alberni Indian Day School, the matter will be brought to your notice. The last teacher here, Miss K. Pitts, lived some distance from the Day School with her father and mother.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

He is a graduate of the Springfield Y.M.C.A. College, Springfield, Mass., and he holds a First Class Sask. Permanent Certificate.

As you know, it is very difficult to get the type of man who will do both jobs satisfactorily, and, as far as I am concerned, I have grave doubts about the wisdom of having two persons at this village. I do not think that the work warrants it.\n\nLast year we had Mr. Severson there, and I gathered that, whilst his work was to a certain extent acceptable, yet it was not of a sufficiently high character as to warrant his continuance at that particular point.\n\nDr. Osterhout has written nominating Mr. Andrew Rutherford for this position. Mr. Rutherford is 52 years of age. He has his B. A. from McMaster University. He is a graduate of the Springfield V.M.C.A. College, Springfield, Mass., and he holds a First Class Saskatchewan Permanent Certificate. He has had 7 years' teaching experience, 3 of which were spent in Japan. He has been Vice-Principal of a 7-room Public School. In his application he says that he will, at the first opportunity, take the Summer School Course in Education in British Columbia and acquire British Columbia standing. I do not know just what your rules are, but I would judge that there has been no hard and fast procedure governing these appointments as far as Provincial standing is concerned, provided the Teacher has proper qualifications somewhere else.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you in connection with this appointment at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD:BJ\n\nIndian Affairs.

McCutcheon, Chief Treasury Officer. In this letter, Mr. McCutcheon says that the cost of living bonus to all employees earning less than $1,296 per annum and who are heads of household, is $11.91 per month.\n\nNow in the case of R.B. Vanmatter, Port Essington, the cheque for October is $106.32. I do not know how you got that amount with a cost of living bonus of $11.91, as our understanding is that Mr. Vanmatter's salary is $100 a month less $5 hold-back. His cheque should be $106.91.\n\nIn the case of Rev. D.W. More, Kispox, B.C., his cheque for October is $100.15. His salary should be $90 a month plus $11.91, or $101.91.\n\nI am not, of course, finding any fault with the fact that the cheques are short in so small a proportion, but we ought to have the thing clear, as we send the cheques to these men regularly and want to add the cost of living bonus, as the cheques come from your Department. Perhaps you could inquire why these cheques are for these particular amounts.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6407, file 836-1, part 1)\n1. Mr. R.B.

Mr. More. There are so many regulations in effect at the present time covering payments of National Defense tax and cost-of-living bonus that practically every case has to be considered separately. I trust that the enclosed statement will explain the matter satisfactorily to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Geo. Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 8, Ont.\nAttention of Mr. Hoey\n\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of Nov. 20th, giving us information as to how the salaries are made up for Mr. Vannatter and Mr. More. I confess that I am astonished to find that, contrary to the instructions provided on the back of the National Defence Form N.D.T.1, a deduction has been made in these cases for National Defence Tax. Section 9 of the form which I have before me says: \"Rate of tax in the case of a married person - 2 per cent if the income exceeds $1,200 per year\". It is quite obvious that this is an old form and that it should be 5 per cent, but I note it says that the rate is applicable to the total income.\n\nNow of course it is ridiculous, if I may use the term concerning the action of such a distinguished body as the Treasury Branch, to assume that Mr. Vannatter gets $100 per month for twelve months or that his salary exceeds $1,200 per year. We cannot, of course, assume that your Department is going to pay Mr. Vannatter $100 a month for twelve months because you have assured us that it is only for nine months. Will you, therefore, try to discover from the Treasury Branch why they have assumed that Mr. Vannatter's total income exceeds $1,200 a year? It certainly does not, so far as your Department is concerned.\n\nThe same thing applies to Mr. More.\n\nWe shall be glad if you will get the Treasury Branch to rectify this error, which no doubt has got into a number of others.\n\nEvery section of the instructions which I have read is to the effect that whilst all these taxes are collected month by month, they are based on the yearly income and the monthly computation is simply on the basis of usual practice of paying salaries in twelve monthly instalments, which is obviously not the case with your teachers.\n\nI should also be glad if you would find out how the salary of $96.81 is arrived at in the case of Mr. E. S. Martin of Skeena Crossing, B.C.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNovember 22, 1941.\nE.S.

Mr. More.\n\nWith regard to the National Defence Tax deduction from each of these gentlemen I attach copy of form N.D.T.1, revised July, 1941. I have marked a paragraph on the reverse side of this form which shows that every employer must deduct National Defence Tax if the monthly salary rate is such that if continued for 12 months would cause the annual earnings of the employee to be in excess of the amount on which National Defence Tax is levied.\n\nA married employee, and this will, of course, apply to all Indian day school teachers, from whom National Defence Tax is deducted and whose actual earnings during the calendar year do not exceed $1200.00 has the privilege of applying for refund of the National Defence Tax which has been deducted from his salary. I enclose, for your information, a copy of Section 12 of the National Defence Tax which indicates the procedure such employee must adopt.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter, I trust the following statement will explain the payment to Mr. E.S.

Vannatter of the Port Essington Indian Day School. On the same mail I had a letter from Dr. Dorey, who has been in Vancouver, telling me something of the circumstances which led to this resignation. Dr. Dorey and I are very much disappointed in Mr. Vannatter. When I met him three or four years ago in Nova Scotia I was quite struck by his missionary spirit and thought he would prove worthy of the trust both the Government and the Church placed in him. Evidently I was mistaken.\n\nWe shall in due course send you a nomination of his successor.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRBC: EMS\nPrince Rupert, B.C.,\nMay 26th, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Your File 216-8-8274\n\nWith reference to your request of May 13th, for the names and ages, etc., of the Indians involved in the offences by Mr. R. R. Vannatter, ex-teacher of the Port Essington Indian Day School, I have to say they are, Harold Bolton age 12, Ernest Wesley age 12, and Raymond Wesley age 8.\n\nThe above matter was first brought to my attention by a letter signed by Stephen Campbell and Ed. Bolton. This letter was received Saturday, May 2nd, and Monday May 4th, at Essington I contacted these men who gave me the names of the boys mentioned above, who could supply some information, also the names of the following girls: Mildred Bennett age 8, Dorothy McKay age 11 and Irene Bolton age 14. I was convinced that Mr. Vannatter had done some wrong, so went directly to him and he admitted his wrong doing, as reported in my letter of May 5th. He absolutely denied, and stated that he was prepared to take oath to the effect that he had not molested the girls in any way whatever. I gathered from him that his misbehaviour had been going on at various times for at least two months.\n\nIrene Bolton and Dorothy McKay were not at Essington on May 4th, but I interviewed the mother of the 8 year old girl and found her statements to be somewhat confused. I called on the Provincial Police and they informed me that they had made certain investigations and that their findings had not been corroborative, and that they intended to investigate the case further. As Mr. Vannatter had admitted his guilt to me, and as the matter was in the hands of the Police I considered that it was not necessary for me to go further in the affair. The Police expressed the opinion that a charge could not be laid under Section 206 of the Criminal Code, but that it could be dealt with under the Act as contributing to juvenile delinquency.\n\nI have been informed since, that the Police now have evidence which makes it possible to lay information under Section 206 of the Criminal Code, but this does not involve any of our Indian Day School students.\n\nMr. Vannatter took charge of the Port Essington Day School October last. I visited the school on October 30th,\nand found that he had good control over the children. I called on him December 23rd, and found him keenly interested in his school work. I visited this school again on February 27th, and everything was in order and the children appeared keenly interested in their work and good progress was noted among the scholars. Up to within a month of the complaint received against Mr. Vannatter, I had always received good reports concerning him from the people of Port Hastings.\n\nTrusting I have fully covered your requirements in the above case, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.G.\n\nJ.

Mr. Hunt, our Superintendent, states that, while the Department was not quite satisfied with her work as a teacher, she is quite satisfactory from the standpoint of character and personality, and has a good influence among the Indians. Mr. Hunt has communicated with Mr. Indian Agent Gillett, and has also discussed the situation with the Commissioner, Major Mackay, and both are agreeable to Mrs. Poisson's appointment under existing circumstances.\n\nWe shall be glad to have your approval of the appointment at your earliest convenience.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nMIT.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRes: Port Essington School.\n\nOn April 8th I visited the Port Essington Provincial School in the company of Mr. Indian Agent Anfield and Inspector E. Hyndman of the Provincial Department of Education.\n\nThere was 38 pupils on the roll, all of whom were of Indian or mixed origin. Of this number, there were 18 of Indian status, one of whom was absent due to illness.\n\nThere was a very happy atmosphere in the classroom and the pupils appeared to be making excellent progress. Last year separate schools were in operation at this point and I was fortunate in being able to compare attendance records for this year with that of last and previous years. The improvement in this respect was most striking. In the corresponding week last year, the number of Indian pupils attending our school was 7 and on going back through the register to the 1944-45 academic year, I noted that for no quarter did the average attendance of our pupils reach 14 although as many as 22 had been enrolled. In the present year, the average attendance has been well over 90%.\n\nThe attendance has so far exceeded our expectations and the Provincial authorities find it necessary to operate another room next year.\n\n(Sgd) R.F.

The qualifications which Mrs. Pogson possesses have been noted and are satisfactory. It is also noted that by making this appointment the school work is being continued without a break. The Department approves of the appointment of Mrs. Pogson, with salary at the rate of $100 per teaching month, and the authorities of the United Church of Canada are being informed of her appointment. It is hoped that she will meet with every success in the work at this school.\n\nRelative to the request to supply fuel and light, I have to say that you may arrange to furnish the quantity of fuel required, and you should obtain same at the lowest possible cost. The Department, however, considers that the teacher should provide her own lighting. I may say that the supplying of fuel is to be continued only during the period Mrs. Pogson teaches at this school. If, in the future, the services of a single teacher are engaged she would, no doubt, be able to obtain boarding accommodation as in the past. In such case, the supplying of fuel would not be allowed. You should forward a properly certified voucher covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the fuel supplied Mrs. Pogson.\n\nYou might inform the Department whether Mr. Pogson, who, it is noted, is an invalid, will reside on the Reserve with his wife, as the Department does not desire, unless in exceptional cases, that a man having no duties in connection with Indian work live on a Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

This information will, no doubt, be stamped on the metal parts of the desks, and is required in order to have uniformity in the seating arrangements if new desks are supplied. Full shipping directions should also be stated.\n\nOur funds for the next fiscal year are extremely limited, and I should like to have your views as to whether these extra desks are necessary at the present time to provide seating accommodation for the children who attend. When we have your reply, consideration will then be given to the ordering of the desks.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E.

The Department will be aware that we have no authority to divert water without permission of the B.C. Water Comptroller and arrangements will have to be made for the diversion of water in this case. From the Inspector's report I gather that the Indian Agent looked into this matter but I have no information concerning any report which he may have forwarded to the Department. Should the Department wish it, I will be pleased to take the question up with Mr. Agent Collison with a view to obtaining water, if possible, for the Port Essington School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nEXTRACT from Inspector Barry's Report on his visit to the PORT ESSINGTON INDIAN DAY SCHOOL on May 18, 1933.\n\nOriginal on File 168-6-6.\n\nThere is no water at the school. Drinking water is obtained at present from a neighbour. After my inspection of October 1, 1931, I recommended that the main water line be connected to the school by a 1 inch pipe. This would require some 150 feet of 1 inch pipe and the necessary taps and connections, and would be a great convenience to the teacher and pupils. The Indian Agent looked into this matter some time ago, but as far as I could learn nothing has been done in the matter.\nPort Essington, B.C.,\nOct. 7th, 1933.\n\nPort Essington Indian Day School\nTo Stephen Campbell\nFor work on school windows - .75\n\n(Mrs.) Elizabeth Pogson\n(teacher)\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nTo: [Name]\n\nPort Essington, B.C.\n\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1935 Nov.25th | To 2 brooms supplied Port Essington Indian Day School, as per attached account. | 1.20   |\n\nAuthority 160-6-4, Nov.6th 1935\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent\n\n---\n\n**TRIPPLICATE FOR FILE**\n\nVoucher in duplicate attached for record.\n\n---\n\n**TOTAL:** 1.20\n\n---\n\nForm 52\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

In this connection it is noted that, in co-operation with the District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power and Hydro-metric Bureau, it was ascertained that arrangements could be made with the Water Company, owned jointly by the Anglo B. C. Packing Company and the B. C. Packers, Limited, to obtain water from their system by installing a 3/4 inch galvanized pipe-line to the school, with one tap, at an annual rental of $10.00.\n\nPlease state if, in view of payment of rental, the Water Company will supply the piping and install the line to the school with necessary connections and tap and also if the pipe will be installed below the frost line, or will it be above ground and exposed? It is thought that, unless this pipe is below frost, it would be useless during the winter months.\n\nIf the Company will install the pipe-line with the necessary connections, in a manner that will prevent freezing, the Department would favourably consider payment of rental for this service, at rate mentioned above. Before a final decision can be given, further particulars are requested, regarding installation of the pipe and also if, in view of the annual rental, installation will be made without cost to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nChas. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nP. O. BOX 656, VICTORIA, B. C.\nSir:\n\nMay I request that the Department be good enough to refer to the report of Inspector Barry on the Port Essington Indian Day School dated May 16th, 1933, in which on page 3 he stated that there is no water at the school and recommending that as the school would require some 150 feet of one inch pipe and the necessary taps and connections, an effort should be made to see if water could be conveyed to the school as this would be a great convenience to the teacher and the pupils.\n\nIn this connection I beg to advise the Department that in co-operation with Mr. C.E. Webb, District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau, at Vancouver it has been ascertained that the water system at Port Essington is owned by the Port Essington Water Company and that this Water Company is owned jointly by the Anglo B.C. Packing Company and the B.C. Packers Limited. Mr. Webb has discussed the matter with Mr. H.W. Harris, Manager of the Cannery at Port Essington with the result that Mr. Harris has agreed to put in a 3/4\" galvanized pipe line to the schoolhouse with one tap, the annual rental for this service would be $10.00 which is equal to $1.00 per month for each teaching months during which this school is open. Any extension or enlargement of this system desired by the Department of Indian Affairs is to be borne at its own expense. In any agreement, of course, the Indian Department will not hold the Water Works Company responsible for discontinuance of water service on account of rent. I have conferred with Inspector Barry who is in agreement that one tap will satisfy the requirements at this school, at least for the present, and it is, therefore, recommended that such an arrangement be entered into for the water supply at the Port Essington Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF/KD.\n\nChas.

Harris who looks after the water supply system at Port Essington. Mr. Harris tells me that on occasions when extreme frost occurs they find it necessary to shut off the water supply in order to protect the system. For this reason this point must be brought out in any suggested water rental.\n\nThe company will install at their expense, a 3/4\" galvanized pipeline from their main to the school house, with one tap, at an annual rental service of $10.00, which I consider to be very reasonable and would suggest that the Indian Department avail themselves of the offer. The water supply comes by a wood stave pipe a distance of some two miles through rocky muskag country. The pipeline is only buried in places. The expense of covering the whole system has, I understand, not been considered economically feasible. The company will cover the 3/4\" pipeline if it is in soil. If over rock they cannot guarantee this. However, the Indian Department will receive the same service as any other water users from this system, and it is only on rare occasions I am told, that the water supply is shut off.\n\nI trust the above information will cover your requirements and will no doubt satisfy the department as to the reasonableness of the water company's offer of a water service.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"C.

It is noted that the Engineer consulted the manager who looks after the water supply system at Port Essington and that he agreed the Water Company would install, at their expense, a 3/4\" galvanized pipe-line from their main to the school building, with one tap, at an annual rental of $10. The Department has noted the manner in which the pipe-line will be installed and that the same service will be given as is received by any other water users from this system.\n\nThe Department will approve of you arranging with the Water Company to install the pipe-line and tap and will pay for the service rental at the rate of $10.00 per annum. This rental will be paid upon receipt of an account, in triplicate, from the Company for the amount due each year. Accounts should be forwarded through your office, and you should attach them to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nI would suggest that this service begin from the beginning of the next fiscal year, viz.: April first, next, if possible to have the pipe installed and the service in operation by that date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6407, file 836-5, part 1)\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF G. H. BARRY, INSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS, on his inspection of the PORT ESSINGTON Indian Day School - forwarded under cover of letter from C. C. Perry, Asst. Indian Commissioner, His No. 15/40032 of June 10, 1935.\n\nThe buildings consist of a schoolroom and a toilet, the latter having been constructed about two years ago. As mentioned in my last report, a very destructive fire occurred in the village about a year and a half ago, the United Church Mission house and Church being destroyed, as well as part of the old board walk to the school. A new church has now been built but its location is rather nearer to the school than takes in the place of the old board walk. A new walk is necessary for the school and the toilet should certainly be moved back from its present very prominent position close to the wall of the new church and placed at a position to the back of the school or well on one side away from the church. There is a pipe line to the school from which water is now obtained. The schoolroom should be painted inside and outside at the first opportunity. The buildings belong to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nThree dozen screw hooks for the hanging of children's coats are very badly required at this school. Coats were lying all over the place when I visited the school.\n\nThe following single school desks are needed, and I should recommend the usual Crown Single School Desks, made in B. C. For the information of the Department, the quantity required and sizes are as follows:\n\nOne front section Number 2 One front section Number 3\nTwo Desk sections Number 2 Four Desk sections Number 3\nOne Rear Section Number 2 One Rear Section Number 3\n\nThis matter has not been discussed with the Indian Agent, who should, of course, be asked for a report before such desks are supplied.\nOttawa, June 20, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Barry, in a report on his recent inspection of the Port Essington Indian Day School, recommends that a new board walk be installed, to replace the walk which was destroyed by fire at the time the mission house and church were burnt. He states, also, that the toilet should be moved back from its present very prominent position and placed at the back of the school or well to one side, away from the church. He has recommended, further, that the inside and outside of the school building be painted when funds are available.\n\nI have to request that you will submit an estimate of the cost of material and labour in rebuilding the board walk and also the cost of moving the toilet to another site and placing it in a good, sanitary condition. You might state, also, the cost of the material and labour to paint the inside and outside of the school building. We may have no funds this year to carry out the painting, but same will be noted for our Estimates for next year. When information is received regarding the cost involved in the building of the walk and the moving of the toilet, consideration will be given to authorizing the expenditure required.\n\nI have to request that you will arrange for the purchase and installation of three dozen coat hooks for the hanging of the children's coats. The Inspector states when he visited the school the children's coats were lying all over the place. Please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of supplying and installing the hooks.\n\nThe Inspector states, further, that a number of\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nsingle school desks be supplied. He recommends the Crown single school desk. You might state if you could arrange for the purchase, if you receive authority, or if you would prefer the order being placed here. In the latter event, I would request that you give full shipping directions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nSir:\n\nI shall be glad to receive authority to have the following repairs and improvements carried out in connection with the Port Essington Day school.\n\nAt the time of the fire last year which wiped out the village church and mission house, the plank walk to the school was totally destroyed and will need replacing for a distance of 165 feet over swampy ground.\n\nThe present school toilet should also be moved to a new location at the back of the school as it now stands too close to the church and is proving to be a nuisance.

This present stove burns wood only and is totally unsuitable for the size of the school.\n\nIn addition to this, it has been impossible to get any Indians at Port Essington to cut fuel wood this summer. Price of wood is out of all proportion even if one could get Indians to cut it. If we are going to retain Mrs. Pogson as teacher at Port Essington, it is imperative that an oil heater be installed at once, and it is recommended that this equipment be shipped direct to Port Essington Indian Day School and the accounts forwarded to this office for vouchering. I understand from the local representative of McLennan, McFeely & Prior Ltd. that the larger of the two oil burners will cost $105.00 approximately. If the purchase is made immediately, I can arrange for the winter's supply of oil to be delivered at Port Essington before the fuel barge leaves that fishing centre.

C.\n\nDear Mr. Anfield:\n\nAs you know, this School Board has been admitting the Indian children of Port Essington to the public school there for the past two years, and, as the enrolment of Indian pupils is about 55% of the total enrolment, it was found necessary to engage an extra teacher and use a second class-room.\n\nIn order to provide a suitable class-room, the School Board has purchased a building in Port Essington for $1500.00, and will spend approximately $1000.00 more to convert it to a school.\n\nIn view of the fact that the above purchase is made necessary in order to provide suitable school accommodation for the Indian children, this School Board asks that your Department kindly give consideration to a grant of $1500.00 towards the expenditure.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBOARD OF SCHOOL TRUSTEES\n\n(Mrs.) Myrtle M. Roper\nSecretary-Treasurer.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Port Essington School\n\nAttached is a self-explanatory letter from Mr. Superintendent Anfield covering a request from the Provincial School Board at Prince Rupert for assistance in renovating a building to be used for class-room purposes.\n\nIt will be noted that 55% of the total enrolment at the Port Essington School is of Indian status. In view of the information included in Mr. Anfield's letter and that of the attached copy from the School Board this request would appear to be reasonable and it is recommended that the grant of $1500.00 as recommended by Mr. Anfield be authorized.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n;mh\nencls.\nW. S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B. C., P.O. Box 70\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nRe attached copies of correspondence received today from Prince Rupert District School Board.\n\nThe situation at Port Essington is as follows:\n\nThe attendance requires a two room classroom, the old second classroom belonging to the school board was unsafe and has been destroyed. The Indian Day School building temporarily used by the school board as a second classroom is unsuitable to the needs of the board. It is slowly collapsing and is in poor physical condition. The board do not consider favourable any attempt to repair this building. They have therefore bought a new building which will become the second classroom, at Port Essington. The attendance of this school of native children has been highly satisfactory and the entire experiment of co-education of white and native children is an accomplishment in co-operation. The board asked the assistance of the Department in providing new classroom and from every point of view, I have no hesitation in recommending that an outright grant of $1500 be made towards the capital cost of this new plan. If the school board were at this time to discontinue the present arrangement, we would be faced with an expenditure of at least a thousand dollars to repair and renovate the old Indian Day School which if my memory is correct, is over 40 years old.\n\nThe Department's views on this of this assistance in this capital expenditure is requested.\n\nP. Earl Anfield\nIndian Superintendent\n\nenclosure\nDecember 30, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n\nProposed Port Essington Joint School\n\nYou will recall previous correspondence from Mr. Anfield concerning this proposed joint school. While funds were not available last year for this project, it may be possible to provide now the $1,500 recommended by Mr. Anfield. I would suggest that you agree to a transfer of funds from one of your other projects in British Columbia.\n\nI presume that the building has been completed and that the Board is prepared to enter into an agreement similar to that prepared for Hazelton.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/RM\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Port Essington School\n\nI wrote you under date of August 23rd in connection with a request from Prince Rupert School District No. 52 for a contribution of $1500 towards the cost of providing a second classroom at Port Essington, the necessity for which was occasioned by the enrolment of Indian pupils. Apparently no reply was received to my letter and Supt. Anfield has again raised the question, reference his letter of December 19th and enclosures attached.\n\nYou will note that the cost of the building to the School District was $2,508.31, and that the total enrolment is comprised of 22 Indian pupils and 27 white pupils. The single classroom owned by the School District prior to the arrangement for the joint education of white and Indian pupils would have been sufficient to meet the needs of the available white pupils and consequently it is felt that the School District's request for a grant of $1500 towards a second classroom is reasonable. The arrangement for the co-education of white and native children has been most successful and I would urge that the Department endeavour to secure funds to meet the request of the School District.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nW. S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B. C., P.O. Box 70\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Port Essington School\nPrince Rupert School Dist. #52\n\nAttached please find application of the above-noted School Board for an outright grant of $1500.00 towards the purchase and furnishing of a second classroom at Port Essington where we have 22 Indian pupils attending elementary school on a per capita basis in the school administered by the Prince Rupert District School Board. At present there are 27 pupils (white) attending the school, a total pupilage of 49 children.\n\nDuring the first year that Indian children were accommodated in this per capita basis, we had approximately 17 pupils attending. In the second year this number increased to the place where a second classroom was necessary. We placed the former Indian Day School, built in between the years 1909 and 1912 at their disposal. This building was in such condition that extensive repairs would be required to make it suitable for continued use. The Board also felt that they were not justified in putting provincial tax-payers funds into a federally owned building on an Indian Reserve. They therefore negotiated for and purchased a building (formerly the R.C. Chapel and residence) adjacent to the one room white school and have made it into a second classroom.\n\nThe Board asked for capital assistance towards the purchase and adoption of this building for school purposes on the grounds that they would have no need for the extra building if they were not educating out Indian children.\n\nActually, we are getting off easy in this matter as the Board might have considered we should pay the whole cost of the second classroom. They have consistently co-operated in joint\neducation for whites and Indians.\n\nI have therefore, no hesitation in recommending once more, an immediate grant of $1500.00 towards this building and your early advice will be appreciated.\n\nIt might be said that if the grant is refused, we may be asked to discontinue the present arrangement, following which we would have to immediately construct a one room school and teacherage at Port Essington, the cost of which should not be less than that at Metlakatla.\n\nI would refer you to my correspondence in this application, under date of August 16/49.\n\nF. Earl Anfield\nIndian Superintendent\n\nfeaym\nDecember 14, 1949.\n\nMr. F. E. Anfield,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBox 187,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Anfield:\n\nOn August 13th last, we wrote you asking that the Indian Department make a grant of $1,500.00 towards the purchase and reconstruction of a building in Port Essington, to be used as a school there.\n\nThis building was purchased for $1,500.00 and a further amount of $1,008.31 was spent in reconstructing it for school purposes. This whole expenditure of $2,508.31 was made necessary in order to provide accommodation for the Indian pupils, as the School Board already had in its possession, a school building adequate in every way for the white pupils.\n\nWe urge that the necessary steps be taken towards making a grant on the above expenditures.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBOARD OF SCHOOL TRUSTEES\n\n(Mrs.) Myrtle M.

Hyndman of the Provincial Department of Education.\n\nThere were 38 pupils on the roll, all of whom were of Indian or mixed origin. Of this number, there were 13 of Indian status, one of whom was absent due to illness.\n\nThere was a very happy atmosphere in the class room and the pupils appeared to be making excellent progress. Last year separate schools were in operation at this point and I was fortunate in being able to compare attendance records for this year with that of last and previous years. The improvement in this respect was most striking. In the corresponding week last year, the number of Indian pupils attending our school was 7 and on going back through the register to the 1944-45 academic year, I noted that for no quarter did the average attendance of our pupils reach 14 although as many as 22 had been enrolled. In the present year, the average attendance has been well over 90%.\n\nThe attendance has so far exceeded our expectations and the Provincial authorities find it necessary to operate another room next year.\n\n(Signed) K.F.

Barry, District Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C., covering his report of inspection on the 3rd ultimo of the Port Essington Indian Day School, Skeena River Agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nReport on Port Essington Indian Day School\n\nThe average attendance at the school has slightly increased. The drop in the attendance for the quarters ending December 1935 and March 1936 is due to the fact that some ten children attending the school are not shown on the Roll of the school after September 1935. The average attendance has been as shown below:\n\nAttendance for Quarter ending:\n\n| Quarter       | Year | Attendance |\n|---------------|------|------------|\n| September     | 1934 | 22.60      |\n| December      | 1934 | 21.67      |\n| March         | 1935 | 32.80      |\n| June          | 1935 | 28.47      |\n| September     | 1935 | 28.45      |\n| December      | 1935 | 19.85      |\n| March         | 1936 | 19.45      |\n| June          | 1936 | ?          |\n\nThe real average attendance for the quarters ending December 1935 and March 1936 was some 10 greater than shown above. The 10 children who can not be considered as Indians within the meaning of the Indian Act were taken off the Register by the teacher on instructions of Mr. Indian Agent Collison.\n\nThere is not sufficient seating accommodation for the Indian children and the extra 10 children now attending this school. In addition the teacher is not able to teach all the children with success. The standard of the work is thus falling, and nothing that I can do will improve matters.\n\nI have therefore to recommend that the ten children at present attending this school who are not Indians, and this includes the teacher's own little girl, be EXCLUDED FROM THE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL. I understand that they will be admitted to the local Provincial Day School which is located within a few hundred yards. I also understand that this is the wish of the Provincial Inspector of Schools for this District that these children be sent to the Provincial School. I agree with him in every way.\n\nI would ask that definite instructions be sent to the Indian Agent, Mr. W.E.Collison, to instruct the teacher Mrs. Pogson, to exclude all children who are not Indians from the Port Essington Indian Day School. This will make the provision of new single desks less necessary and give the teacher a chance to pull up the general standard of the work in the Primary Grades.\n\nGeneral Remarks:\n\nThere is little that I need add to the above. While the work of the Primary Grades is at present most unsatisfactory, it would be possible to greatly improve this if there were less children in the school, or if the teacher were younger and more efficient.\n\nAs I am not anxious to recommend that a new teacher be appointed here at the present time, I have taken the only remaining course and recommended a reduction in the number of children to be taught. The children who attend the school while living on the Indian Reserve though not Indians belong to two families. There are good reasons I understand why these particular families should be allowed to live on the Indian Reserve. The child of the teacher is falling back in her work and I consider she too should attend the Provincial School, and be taught by someone other than her mother.\n\nNo doubt the Department will wish for a full report, on the matters mentioned above, from the Indian Agent. I may say that these matters have been discussed with Mr. Indian Agent Collison on several occasions during the past two years, and I believe we are in complete agreement with regard to the necessity for the exclusion of the NON INDIAN CHILDREN in this case without laying down any general rule which must be followed in all such cases.\n\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nMay 14, 1936.\n\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, BC\nAttendance problems; remedies suggested, Etc.\n\nIn the following I have tabulated the numbers in each Grade, showing those on the Roll of the School and those not on the Roll under separate headings.

These pupils are mentioned later in this report. They are included here as the actual number of children inspected was 27, made up of 6 Boys and 21 Girls.\n\nNumber of classrooms: One.\n\nNumber of desks in each classroom: 6 Single and 13 old Double.\n\nName of teacher: Mrs. Elizabeth Pogson, Age 54.\n\nHealth: The teacher's health is reported to be \"Good\".\n\nRemarks relative to methods employed by teacher:\n\nMrs. Pogson was trained at the Winnipeg Normal School. She holds Second Class Permanent Certificates in Manitoba and British Columbia. She also holds an Ontario Second Class (Non Professional) Certificate. Mrs Pogson has had eight years experience in Provincial schools and seven years in Indian schools.\n\nIn my last report I mentioned that the teacher had made a great effort to improve the standing of her school. During the past year I am sorry to say this improved standing has not been maintained. The teachers work with the Primary pupils in Grade IA and Grade IB is not in my opinion satisfactory. Some of the children were absent however and I am therefore not stressing the teacher's obvious weakness in the teaching of the primary at the present time.\n\nOne of the Grade 6 pupils seen on the occasion of my visit in May 1935 passed the High School Entrance Test in June 1935 with the minimum mark of 60%. This boy is I understand doing good work in the Prince Rupert High School.\n\nMuch more thorough teaching is necessary in the Intermediate and Senior Grades. The results of the Achievement Tests given during this last visit indicate that the teacher has neglected to make certain that the lessons, if properly taught, were understood.\n\nThere is a very definite reason for the failure of the children during the past year. There are too many children for this rather elderly teacher. Suggestions are made below to eliminate this difficulty. It will also be understood that I have done everything possible to help the teacher with regard to methods, etc. She is however rather too old to make much use of my \"Demonstration and Type Lessons\". Her knowledge of the Psychology of Teaching is in my opinion very limited, hence she does not get the best results, and her pupils suffer. Mrs Pogson is nearing the end of her teaching career, and I am afraid that it will not be very long before she forces me to ask the Department to make a change of teachers here. I think that a letter from the Department to this teacher stating that her work has not been considered very satisfactory during the past year by the Inspector of Schools might result in some improvement in the work.\nAttendance problems; remedies suggested, etc.\n\nIn the following I have tabulated the numbers in each Grade, showing those on the Roll of the School and those not on the Roll under separate headings. The whole of the below mentioned pupils attend the school.\n\nClassification:\n\n| Grade | On School Roll | Off School Roll | Total |\n|-------|----------------|-----------------|-------|\n|       | Boys: Girls: Total: | Boys: Girls: Total: |\n| 7     | 0 2 2          | 0 1 1           | 3     |\n| 6     | 0 1 1          | 0 0 0           | 1     |\n| 5     | 3 4 7          | 0 3 3           | 10    |\n| 4     | 0 0 0          | 0 0 0           | 0     |\n| 3     | 0 1 1          | 0 1 1           | 2     |\n| 2     | 1 5 6          | 0 2 2           | 8     |\n| 1A    | 1 2 3          | 1 0 1           | 4     |\n| 1B    | 5 2 7          | 1 1 2           | 9     |\n\n|       | 10 17 27       | 2 6 10          | 37    |\nRemarks relative to the examination of pupils:\n\nReading: Some of the children in this Grade have been here over a year, one or more have been here three years. I am informed by the teacher, Grade 1B have finished Two Little Indians and are at Page 57 of Friends. The reading was very elementary word for word, and far below the usual standard of the Indian Day School for this Sub Grade. Grade 2 has finished Friends and are at Page 106 of the Highroads Reader Book 1. One of the children off the Roll of the School could read this well. Grade 2 read quite well the first half of Highroads Reader Book 2. The Grade 3 pupil read well from Highroads Reader Book 3. Grade 5 read in a very satisfactory manner from Highroads Reader Book 5, but they are very weak in the meanings of the harder words. Grade 6 was absent and Grade 7 reads from Voice of Canada, Lady of the Lake, Etc. The reading of Grade 1 is very unsatisfactory while the remaining children present read well.\n\nArithmetic: Grade 1B have only a very limited knowledge of the Combinations and Separations to 10. Grade 1A are supposed to be able to work the Combinations and Separations to 20 according to the statement of the teacher. The only child that had no idea of this work. Grade 2 can Add and Subtract with and without carrying and Borrowing. Grade 3 can work Short Multiplication and Short Division, and know the Multiplication Tables to times 12. Grade 5 know something of the work in Fractions and are starting Decimals, while Grade 7 is working the prescribed course. The actual work done by Grades 2, 3, and 5, in Arithmetic is a little below average, while Grade 7 is well up to the average. In the All Canada Test:-\nGrade 3 made a Mid Score of 12.5 the Norm being 13.6\nGrade 4 made a Mid Score of 20.5 the Norm being 27.0\nGrade 7 made a Mid Score of 36.5 the Norm being 35.4\n\nThe idea of SUBTRACTION is not yet thoroughly in school. Paper after paper showed that the children did not understand the usual signs used in Arithmetic, and particularly could not recognize or work questions involving the subtraction of numbers. This was of course pointed out to the pupils and a short lesson taught to remedy this failure as far as possible.\n\nGeography: The B.C. Geography for Juniors is used. More definite lessons are needed throughout the school.\n\nHistory: Pages from Canada's Story is used in Grade 5.\n\nWriting: This is very uneven. While some pupils can write quite well others are very poor in this.\n\nArt: Very elementary work has been done.\n\nSpelling: The Spelling in Grade 2 was \"Poor\" while that of the remainder of the school was \"Good\". The usual Buckingham Achievement Scale was used. Grades 2 & 3 being given 25 words from Columns \"I\" & \"J\", while Grades 4 & 7 were given 25 words from Columns \"Q\" & \"R\". The following were the results:\nGrade 2 made a Mid Score of 58% the June Norm being 70%\nGrade 3 made a Mid Score of 100% the June Norm being 86%\nGrade 5 made a Mid Score of 90% the June Norm being only 70%\nGrade 7 made a Mid Score of 98% the June Norm being 90%\n\nSinging: While the teacher is not able to sing herself the children sang nicely with good tone, hymns, Etc.\n\nGeneral School Work: The standard of achievement in the various school subjects in general was tested by the B.C. Achievement Test for Juniors 1934 for Grades 3 and 5 and by the B.C. Achievement Test 1933 for Grade 7. Grade 3 made a Mid Score of 8, the Norm and expected score 18.3\nGrade 5 made a Mid Score of 27.5 the Norm being 35.2\nGrade 7 made a Mid Score of 50.5 the Norm being 62.6\n\nThe above results are low but fairly satisfactory. The great weakness of the school being the work of Grade 1. There has however been a very great falling off in the general achievement results since the last inspection, when the tested work of the pupils was \"Very Satisfactory\".\nThe average attendance at the school has slightly increased. The drop in the attendance for the quarters ending December 1935 and March 1936 is due to the fact that some ten children attending the school are not shown on the Roll of the school after September 1935.\n\nThe average attendance has been as shown below:\n\nAttendance for Quarter ending:\n\n| September 1934 | 23.80 |\n|----------------|-------|\n| December 1934  | 21.87 |\n| March 1935     | 32.80 |\n| June 1935      | 26.47 |\n| September 1935 | 28.45 |\n| December 1935  | 19.83 |\n| March 1936     | 19.45 |\n| June 1936      | ?     |\n\nThe real average attendance for the quarters ending December 1935 and March 1936 was some 10 greater than shown above. The 10 children who can not be considered as Indians within the meaning of the Indian Act were taken off the Register by the teacher on instructions of Mr. Indian Agent Collison.\n\nThere is not sufficient seating accommodation for the Indian children and the extra 10 children now attending this school. In addition the teacher is not able to teach all the children with success. The standard of the work is thus falling, and nothing that I can do will improve matters.\n\nI have therefore to recommend that the ten children at present attending this school who are not Indians, and this includes the teacher's own little girl, be EXCLUDED FROM THE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL. I understand that they will be admitted to the local Provincial Day School which is located within a few hundred yards. I also understand that it is the wish of the Provincial Inspector of Schools for this District that these children be sent to the Provincial School. I agree with him in every way.\n\nI would ask that definite instructions be sent to the Indian Agent, Mr. W.E.Collison, to instruct the teacher Mrs. Pogson, to exclude all children who are not Indians from the Port Essington Indian Day School. This will make the provision of new single desks less necessary and give the teacher a chance to pull up the general standard of the work in the Primary Grades.\n\nGeneral Remarks:\n\nThere is little that I need add to the above. While the work of the Primary Grades is at present most unsatisfactory, it would be possible to greatly improve this if there were less children in the school, or if the teacher were younger and more efficient.\n\nAs I am not anxious to recommend that a new teacher be appointed here at the present time, I have taken the only remaining course and recommended a reduction in the number of children to be taught. The children who attend the school while living on the Indian Reserve though not Indians belong to two families. There are good reasons I understand why these particular families should be allowed to remain on the Indian Reserve. The child of the teacher is falling back in her work and I consider she too should attend the Provincial School, and be taught by someone other than her mother.\n\nNo doubt the Department will wish for a full report on the matters mentioned above, from the Indian Agent. I may say that these matters have been discussed with Mr. Indian Agent Collison on several occasions during the past two years, and I believe we are in complete agreement with regard to the necessity for the exclusion of the NON INDIAN CHILDREN in this case without laying down any general rule which must be followed in all such cases.\n\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nMay 14, 1936.\n\nGerald H.

It remains to be seen whether Mr. Severson can improve the standing which I may now grade as \"Fair\". It certainly is no higher than this, and many Provincial Inspectors would classify it as \"Poor\".\n\nAll the children have not as yet returned and by the time of my next inspection things may be much better.\n\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOctober 28, 1937.\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nRemarks relative to the examination of pupils:\n\nAs only six pupils were present it is not easy to be perfectly fair in these remarks.\n\nIn general the children read quite well. Grades 5 and 4 are reading Highroad Readers which they read last year. Grade 4 is well able to go to Grade 5. Grade IA in Highroad Reader Book 1 and Grade LC from the Board read quite well. One little boy while a pupil of this school for several years does not appear to be able to distinguish words. The teacher will take special care in this case, and if possible discover the cause of failure.\n\nThe Number Work and Arithmetic is not as good as the Reading in any Grade tested.\n\nThe small children still count their Addition Facts and Subtraction Facts. I have shown the type of Drills necessary to remedy this.\n\nAll the writing is in pencil so far. The teacher tells me that he has just received the ink exercise books and that the pupils will use ink where this is required in future. The small children must certainly learn to print and write in the pencil exercise books and not only work on the Boards.\n\nIn Language the teacher appears to have carried out suggestions made for the teaching of Oral Composition in Grade 1. These suggestions were given to him when he called at my office in Victoria before coming to Port Essington. Grades 4 and 5 are using the English Usage and Work Books properly. Grade 4 will now join Grade 5.\n\nThe Elementary Geography is being taught in accordance with suggestions previously made to the teacher. The Built Up Panel Posters will now be used properly, which has not been the case in the past here.\n\nThe pages from Canada's story will be used as a test in Grades 4 and 5 for Canadian History.\n\nI have suggested a course in Elementary Science which now takes the place of Nature.\n\nQuite good work has been done in Art and Handwork by the little people.\n\nSome attempt is being made to teach Singing.\n\nIn general the teaching so far is very elementary, and far too much time has been given to so-called testing. I have urged the teacher to make a start in definite lessons in the various subjects.\n\nControl of the children is \"Fair\".\n\nAttendance problem: remedies suggested, etc.\n\nOnly Indian children attend this school now. The children of John Wesley, MAILE Age 19, RITA Age 8, GILBERT Age 10, and DOUGLAS Age 9 do not attend regularly. The teacher has called on the parents and the Indian Agent is aware of the circumstances. The father should be warned to send his children regularly to this school and I would ask that a check be kept on this matter.\n\nIn the case of SILAS INNES Age 12 Grade 4 and ROY INNES Age 9 Grade IA the home conditions are stated to be very bad. The father is dead and the mother drinks, is often in Prince Rupert and neglects the children.\n\nShould these children be found fit from a medical point of view I strongly recommend that they be sent to Coqualeetza Indian Residential School as soon as possible. I know that there is room there for them.\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT ON PORT ESSINGTON INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nUnited Church of Canada Skeena River Agency.\n\nDate of inspection: October 29, 1937.\n\nNumber of pupils present:\nBoys 3\nGirls 3\nTotal 6\n\nNumber of classrooms: One.\n\nNumber of desks in each classroom: 6 single.\n12 old double.\n\nName of teacher: Mr. Earl B. Severson.\n\nHealth: Appears to be in very good health.\n\nRemarks relative to methods employed by teacher:\n\nMr. Severson was trained at the Minot Normal School, North Dakota, U.S.A., in which State he holds a Second Class Certificate. While in Saskatchewan he was granted a Second Class Certificate.\n\nHis teaching experience includes some three years in the U.S.A. and four years in Saskatchewan.\n\nMr. Severson is married and has two small children of 4 years and 2 years of age.\n\nIt is very difficult to make any just estimate of this teacher's qualifications and ability, as there were only six children in school at the time of my inspection, four of whom were in Grade 1.\n\nWhile Mr. Severson does not impress me as a teacher who has had a very thorough training, I may say that in Victoria and again here I have outlined work for him, and shown him the limits for various subjects in the various Grades.\n\nHe states that he has spent the greater part of the past two months in trying to find out what the children knew. I informed him that he must start immediately to teach those who come to school, and that he must take definite lessons.\n\nWhen visited the four small pupils during the most important part of the morning session were engaged in making out cuts from old catalogues, while the older children two in number were writing some sort of Silent Reading Test.\n\nIt will be necessary for this teacher to settle down and teach definite lessons to all the Grades.\n\nI believe that he should be told that he will be expected to attend the Provincial Summer School in Victoria next July to qualify in Primary Work and some other related course of use to him in his work at Port Essington. As this is so their important I wish to recommend that a letter be sent to Mr. Severson to this effect, so that he will have ample warning and be able to make the necessary financial arrangements when the time comes.\n\nThis teacher has been given ample help and instructions to make the present year's work at any rate fairly successful.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nOctober 29, 1937.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 6,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am forwarding herewith my report on the Port Essington Indian Day School, Skeena River Agency.\n\nThis school was inspected this morning, October 28th. I was accompanied by Mr. Indian Agent Collison. The weather is very bad indeed. We started from Prince Rupert in the launch \"Naskena\" at dawn and were very lucky to be able to get to Port Essington and back in the day. The storms are now so bad that any more launch work this season is just a matter of waiting for a suitable day. After my visit to the newly erected school at Kitselas early next week, I propose to return to Vancouver. I shall probably go south on the Canadian National S.S. Prince Rupert sailing from here on Thursday evening, November 4th. This will enable me to be in my office in Vancouver on Monday morning, November 8th, when I hope to have the opportunity to discuss with you the more important items of interest brought to my attention during the present itinerary. You may of course be out of the city at that time and in this case such discussion can well be postponed to suit your convenience.\n\nWith regard to the attached report, I wish to draw your attention to my recommendation that SILAS and ROY INNES be admitted to the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School if this can be arranged. With the father dead, and the mother drunk or absent in Prince Rupert, the home life of the children is of course homeless. I believe that the Indian Agent is in agreement with my view of the matter, and I hope that the Director of Welfare and Training will consider this a legitimate case for Residential School treatment. I very much doubt that the Reverend Scott, Principal of Coqualeetza, is aware of the conditions of this family. The teacher of the Port Essington Indian Day School, Mr. Severson, who is also the United Church Missionary there, is anxious that the children be sent to Residential School. He would no doubt get any necessary papers filled out if these were sent to him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding herewith report of Capt. G. H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C., together with his letter of the 29th October, covering his inspection on the same date of the Port Essington Indian Day School, Skeena River Agency.\n\nThe recommendation of Inspector Barry that Silas Innes, age 12, Grade 4, and Roy Innes, age 9, Grade 1A, be sent to Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, if found fit from a medical standpoint, is concurred in.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

Mr. Rutherford was requested to teach Health daily and to stress modern forms of Physical Training. Arts and Crafts are to be given more attention. Some sewing is being done at present.\n\nThe B.C. Achievement Test was used to test the standing of Grade 6 (Mid Score 54), Grade 5 (Mid Score 20 Norm 25) and Grade 4 (Mid Score 24 Norm 28) and it was found that while Grade 4 is about average Grade 5 and Grade 6 are about a year below average. This is mainly due to the failure of the previous teacher here.\n\nThe present standing of the school is \"Satisfactory\".\n\nThe home conditions of Roy Innes 1k, Silas Innes 14, and Dora who lives in the Innes home as an adopted child are reported to be unsatisfactory. The Indian Agent is dealing with this matter. Dora should be sent to Coqualeetza if passed by the medical authority, the two boys named were at Coqualeetza and had to be sent home as too ill to continue there.\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER.\n\nGERHARD H.

Perhaps it would be well for you to obtain from the Indian Agent a detailed statement of what action has been taken with regard to these children, and what can be done for the little seven year old adopted child Dora who by all accounts is badly treated by Mrs Innes, reported by me on October 29th 1937 as often drunk or absent in Prince Rupert.\n\nWith the Indian Agent's report before you and this school report you will be in a position to advise the Department. I very much doubt that Mrs Innes, whose husband is dead, is a fit and proper person to have charge of any children. Even if not strong these children would in my opinion be better off at Coqualeetza than in Port Essington.\n\nThere has been some friction between the teacher Mr Rutherford, who is also the United Church Missionary, and the Catholic Priest with regard to some of the boys attending games with other children off the Indian Reserve, such games and/or classes being organized by the Priest, Reverend Father Champlain.\n\nI explained to Mr Rutherford that as far as his position as a teacher was concerned it would be better for him to pay little attention to the fact that the Indian boys mixed with others in the Port Essington village though as a United Church Missionary he had a perfect right to give his congregation any advice he thought right. Mr Collison and I had previously seen the Catholic Priest who stated that he had no wish to draw the United Church children away from the school, and could not prohibit them taking part in games etc. with other boys from the village, if they wished to visit his hall. It will be understood that there are a number of churches working in Port Essington. As a result of our visit to the Priest and teacher better relations between them should result.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith report of Capt. G.H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C., together with his covering letter of the 6th ultimo, with respect to his inspection on the 4th of last month of the Port Essington Indian Day School, Skeena River Agency.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Collison has been asked for a report on the home conditions of Silas and Roy Innes and the adopted child Dora, referred to by the Inspector.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

The teacher reports that he is not satisfied as to this boy's mental health. I have not seen him lately as it is better he should be out of school. He would appear to be violent on occasion. I have suggested that Mr. Indian Agent Gillett have this boy examined by the local Medical Officer who attends here in the fishing season in this way there would be no cost or very little to the Department and on the report of the M.O. further steps could be taken if necessary.\n\nThe B.C.

Grade 2 is ready for promotion to Grade 3.\n\nA great improvement has been made in the work of the school since last inspection. Teacher works hard for the children, he follows advice. Children are happy and clean. School is clean. The general standing of the school is now \"Good\" possibly \"Very Good\" Assistance was given to the teacher with methods and suggestions made to improve the work still more.

It would be better for these children now attending the local Provincial school at Port Essington to be in a neighbourhood not almost exclusively Japanese and Indian.\n\nMr Rutherford would do very well at the Port Simpson Indian Day School, where I expect a man will be needed next year.

Blackboard writing is very neat and legible.\n\nThis school, together with the other schools in this area, is in great need of library books.

Progress in primary reading is especially good. There are several retarded pupils in this school. This appears to be largely due to irregular attendance. Mrs. Bogson takes an interest in keeping this school neat and tidy.

Thorsteinson's report covering his inspection of the Fort Essington Indian Day School on November 3rd.\n\nI have requested Mr. Indian Agent Gillett to advise if there is any particular reason for the poor attendance at this school and to let me have any suggestions he can make which would remedy the condition.\n\nFor D. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nPRINCE RUPERT, B.C.,\nJanuary 23, 1945.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., VANCOUVER.\n\nYour File 215-8-8525 - Jan. 17th, 1945.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Inspector Thorsteinsson's report on Port Essington School relative to attendance, I would say that according to Mrs. Pogson, she had no difficulty in having the children attend school when they were at the village, but they move around considerably with their parents to logging camps and fishing grounds. I do not know of any steps that can be taken to remedy the matter, other than some scheme whereby one family would board another's children when the parents have to leave the village. I have suggested this many times in the various villages, but some of the parties concerned who are well able to do this are not sufficiently interested to spend any money for the education of their children, and those who would be in a position to take children would not trust one of their own people with reference to payment.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJG/k.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFurther to my letter of January 17th forwarding Provincial School Inspector Thorsteinson's report covering his inspection of Fort Essington Indian Day School, I now enclose herewith for your information Mr. Indian Agent Gillett's letter of January 23rd outlining the difficulties encountered in maintaining the attendance at this school.\n\nIt would appear that in view of the excellent opportunities offered the Indians for employment at various points nothing much can be done while this continues to keep them in their villages and thus ensure the attendance of the children at the school. However the enforcement of Sub. Sec. 2 of Section 4 of the Family Allowances Act should do much to remedy this situation.\n\nD. M.

Since the death of her husband, who was Postmaster at Port Essington for many yrs., she has a desire to leave the place and has only carried on the school out of loyalty. This has been a dreadfully cold and severe winter and she does not think her health will stand any more. She is far from young and I would pay tribute to her efforts.

After living in it for three months, I received notice unexpectedly to vacate the rooms. Another person had rented the whole house.\n\nThe only available house in town is one owned by an Indian. This one needs some repair in order to make it habitable. Two weeks ago I wrote to the Indian Agent asking if he was willing that we should have this.\n\nI have not received an answer; nothing has been done to the house and I have to move into it at the Easter vacation. I have to\nI am very anxious and concerned about the house and do not know how to keep it in good condition. The owner will not let me make any repairs. Moreover, I cannot live there in winter unless it is made warmer.\n\nIn many other districts there is a teacher's residence. Would it be possible to buy or build one here? As my husband's health is poor, I should like to remain for some time. I find the work very interesting and have already become attached to the pupils; but the housing problem presents a very serious difficulty.\n\nWill you kindly take the matter up with the proper authorities and ascertain whether something can be done about it.\n\nTrusting that you may be able to accomplish this,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nElizabeth Roy\n\nIndian Affairs.

Our funds for the present fiscal year are extremely limited, and it will not be possible to consider the erection of a residence. It is hoped that you can make arrangements to obtain suitable living accommodation.

M. Richards, teacher of the Indian school at Port Simpson, B.C., he refers to a circular which had been sent from the Mission Rooms, and intimates that any apparent neglect in forwarding quarterly school returns has been due, to some extent at least, to the difficulty of obtaining the necessary blank forms from the Indian Agent. He states that for the December quarter he had to get some blank forms from the teacher in the Girls' Home, which are the same as are used for public schools, but he had to choose between that and being very late in making the required returns. Mr Richards further states that he \"wrote the Agent twice for a Register, and then did not get it until about one-third of the quarter had gone by.\"\n\nIn reply to a question of Mr Richards respecting the computing of the average attendance, I have sent him an extract from the Departmental letter of March 22nd in which this point is specifically referred to. In a Memorandum issued by the Department of Indian Affairs, Sec.5 reads as follows.\u2014\"By the number of school days in the quarter is meant the number of days the school is open during the quarter.\" Mr Richards states that Mr Todd contradicts this, and maintains that the divisor is to be the full number of days in the quarter, exclusive of Saturdays and Sundays, whether the school is open or not.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nThe Hon. the Super't General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Mr. Inspector Green's report on the Fort Simpson Day School, which shows a very small attendance, there being only fourteen present out of 150 children of school age in the village. The explanation for this unsatisfactory attendance is that the Teacher, who is a member of the boarding school staff, has his time so fully occupied that he is unable to secure a proper attendance by visiting and becoming acquainted with the Indian parents and pupils.\n\nThe Indians wish to have a teacher who shall devote his whole time to the day school, and as the Department pays a salary it considers that they should have one. Mr. Demeane would be willing to accept the position of teacher to the day school, and the Department thinks that he should be given charge of the school and that he should sever his connection with the boarding school, so as to be free to devote the whole of his time to the betterment of the villagers and their children. It is hardly fair that the interests of the 150 children should be sacrificed for the 20 children who are in the boarding school.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will not raise any objection to this proposition, and it will be willing to pay Mr. Demeane a much better salary than he now receives.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Missions,\nBrandon, Man.\nif he will undertake the work and try and secure a fair average attendance. It would like to hear from you before making any definite move in this direction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Secretary.\nRev. T. Ferrier\nSuperintendent of Methodist Indian Schools and Hospitals in Canada\n\nThe Secretary Department\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.\n\nOct. 30th 07.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying by order of the\n1st No. 119542/1, Re teacher at\nPort Simpson day school.\n\nWhen I was there in Sep last & discovered the results of which you\nspeak, but the small attendance\nat the day school is not due to the fact\nthat Mr. Dineen is a member of the\nstaff of the Boarding School, but he\nhas not had enough time to visit\nthe children & parents in their home\nis true and to remedy this state of\naffairs I engaged a first-class\nman as carpenter & Mr. Wiseman\nat $300 & Board per year. The duties\nof Mr. Wiseman will relieve Mr.\nDineen of a great many worries.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6408, file 837-1, part 1)\nhe was responsible and allow him sufficient time to visit the people in their homes which will no doubt tend to increase the attendance at the school. We cannot secure this when the people are away from home nor when they are bound to raise some excuse for not sending their children to school. Mr. Deneen is in charge of the Boys' home, and it would disorganize the arrangement to give Mr. Deneen an authority and try and place some other in charge. We can see how this new plan works out. If not satisfactory some other can be adopted.\n\nThe salary paid Mr. Deneen is $600 Board. Under the present arrangement I would suggest that the Department pay the $600 and for what service he renders to the Home can be commuted by his board. Let me have the views of the Department on the above, and I will write Mr. Deneen. Yours respectfully,\n\nT. Ferrier\nOttawa, November 12th, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, regarding the Fort Simpson Day School and suggesting that the whole of the teacher's salary be assumed by the Department and that the Home would furnish him with board and lodging for such services as he could render that Institution.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department considers that it would be in the best interests of the Indians that Mr. Dineen should be allowed to devote all his time to the Day School and the improvement of its condition, and if it undertakes to pay his full salary it could only be on this condition. The cost of his maintenance in the boarding school would be very little and his sickness there should amply repay the home for any outlays it is put to for his board and lodging.\n\nThe Department would like you to communicate with Mr. Dineen on this subject if its proposition is accepted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Missions,\nBrandon, Man.\nIndian Industrial School\n\nat\n\nSalary. I will try and see what can be done to secure another principal and matron for the Boys Home.\n\nIn my judgment if the department will pay $600 toward his support for his services as a teacher, and let the present arrangement have a fair trial, that this will be the best solution.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Maclean leaves $500 for his wife $300 as balance of the house. Neither the day school nor the Boys' Home could pay him sufficient to keep him there for only one of these positions.\n\nAnd in my judgment he renders better service as a teacher in the school position than would be rendered by a teacher who would come in there for the salary the Department would pay. Unless the Department can pay a salary of about $600, you will see when you add furnished house & light fuel, stable expenses &c what he & his wife now receive, that it is worth at least $1200 and that is the only way we can retain his services.

Ferrier\nOttawa, June 23, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Green, in his last report on the Fort Simpson Boarding School, suggested that it might be well to have Mr. Dinsen, the teacher, who is also in charge of the day school, devote his whole time to the needs of the latter.\n\nThe very poor attendance at the day school may be to some extent attributable to the fact that Mr. Dinsen has more work that he can very well manage. Communication has been had with the authorities of the Methodist Church, but it would not appear possible to have Mr. Dinsen sever his connection with the boarding school under present conditions. It would appear necessary, however, to take some means to try to effect an improvement. There are reported to be one hundred children of school age in the village and less than half of this number is enrolled with a small average attendance.\n\nThe Department would like to have a full report from you upon the situation and would be glad to have any suggestions that you may wish to make.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.

Secretary.\n\nC. O. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakatla, B.C.\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter No II9542/I, dated June 23rd, ultimo, in which you ask for a report upon existing school arrangements, and a few suggestions as to the betterment of such.\n\nAs you will judge from the reports of both teacher and Agent from time to time, conditions are far from being satisfactory at the present time.\n\nFor some time I was of opinion that if the money now spent on the maintenance of Boarding Schools were applied to the creation of efficiently equipped Indian Day schools with a public school system and fully qualified teachers, the difficulty would be removed; but having thought the matter carefully over, and taken into consideration the nomadic habits of the people\u2014their being at their home village only about three months of the year\u2014the impracticality of trying to effect an arrangement whereby the children could follow up their studies in different schools as they moved from place to place with their parents in pursuit of their occupations\u2014the non-enactment of compulsory attendance regulations, being the policy of the Department to rely upon the mission of its officers, teachers and missionaries, to overcome the apathy of the Indians\u2014I have almost come to the conclusion that the idea of the Day school system is a psychological absurdity.\n\nAt the same time I am convinced that the Boys' Home, Port Simpson, is an institution which stands for very little in view of the amount spent each year by the Department and the Methodist Church, for its maintenance. Boys are allowed to go to their homes and to the canneries during the summer months, and as soon as the season is over when the lads should return to the institution, they are\nconspicuous by their absence, and parents lay unfounded charges of harsh treatment, starving, peisinging etc., against the workers of the institution.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that the Indians have been the subjects of superfluous fending the lavishment of which, by coaxing, effeminate handling with presents and soft speech, which geads rather than aids the Indian nature, and which the Indian does not look for, the result of which is that the Indians have been made to feel that the white people are under some form of obligation to them, and they now manifest a decided indifference to the methods adopted to educate them.\n\nThe Indians have a great respect for the law when they see it carried into effect, and the success of William Duncan among the new Alaskan Indians is a proof of this.\n\nAt the various Council meetings of the Indians I am asked to enforce the law, to make regulations and see that such are carried into effect, whether in relation to schools or the Indian Act, or the By-laws of the villages.\n\nI am in favor of a thoroughly equipped Indian Day school, with up-to-date appliances, competent teachers with boarding arrangements; compulsory attendance for eight months of the year, and four months leave of absence during the fishing season.\n\nUnder the present arrangements the yearly pay of teacher is given for about three months work. I would appoint a fully qualified teacher at an extra hundred dollars per ### eight months, and give the teacher the opportunity of spending part of the season with the pupils at the canneries not for the purpose of teaching them but for the purpose of being near them to learn their experiences.\n\nI would also suggest that the parents of the pupils be expected by the Department to contribute towards the keeping of the pupil by paying for their clothing, and their fare to and from the canneries. Up to the present this has been done by the Church.\nTeaching Mr Dineen's work at Fort Simpson, there is no doubt but that he has too much in hand at present to do justice to either the school or the Home.\n\nHe makes a splendid head of the Institution, and has the boys well in hand. They are smart and industrious, and under his management would make good progress.\n\nI would recommend that the Department spend a little money on painting, and in making the surroundings of the institution more homelike, or if this is the duty of the Church advise the Church to see to it, employ a good teacher as before intimated, issue a circular for distribution among the Indian parents showing how essential is the education of the children as they make physical progress towards the new conditions of civilization as they spring up on every side, and also the decision of the Department in the matter of compulsory attendance in the light of the similar regulations under which it is incumbent upon white people to send their children to school.\n\nI think the Indians would fall into line with such a movement when it became apparent that it was being carried to a practical and successful issue.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI very much regret to report that upon my calling in at Fort Simpson on my way South from the Nass, on the 5th instant, I found that while there are nearly 100 children of school age in the village, only two of them were at the school.\n\nOn the 23rd September a telegram reached me & from the Rev G.H. Raley, as follows:\n\n\"School matters Port Simpson require your attention earliest date important\"\n\nBeing then about to start by steamer for the Nass, calling at Fort Simpson on the way North, I asked the Captain of the steamer to wait a little while in order to an interview with Mr. Raley. I met him, and talked the matter over. Mr. Raley was not prepared to give his opinion as to the reason of the poor attendance at the school, but appeared to suspect there may be some personal feeling against the teacher, Mr. Dine.\n\nI asked Chief Dudoward, Chief Councillor why the people did not send their children to school, to which he replied \"The people will tell you\".\n\nI afterwards met Chief Henry Nelson, and put the same question to him. He replied \"The teachers we have up here are no good.\n\nI called on Chief Kelly who, upon being questioned, said: \"Sometimes I send my children to school, but they don't get on. I ask them when they come home what they learn, and they not know what to tell me. They don't bring home their books like white children.\"\n\nIn several instances I have heard the remark that the children are being killed in the Boy's and Girl's Homes, because through some hereditary taint they happen to die sometimes either...\nafter their release from the institutions.\n\nFor some time very unkind remarks have been made by the Indians about the association of the missionaries with the Church and Government for which a whiteman would have been incarcerated, but these have all been tolerated by them because they came from the Indians, which so far as it goes is quite right.\n\nI may inform the Department that Mr Dineen, the present teacher has received another appointment in Manitoba, and leaves at an early date. I feel sure that when he has gone the Indians will feel the loss of one who has conscientiously done his very best for them, while the Boy's Home will lose one of the best Principals it has ever had. The fact that Mr Dineen is to be the Rev T. Ferrier's assistant at the Brandon Institute speaks for his integrity, worth as a disciplinarian and good character.\n\nThe Department is not ignorant of the condition of affairs at Fort Simpson, and has previously received my recommendations, which, according to your letter No II9542/I, dated August 12th last, are held in abeyance.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nSchools\n\nI think Mr. Dineen has been transferred to the Brandon School.

Ferrier\nPort Simpson Aug 1/11\n\nDepartment of Education\nOttawa\n\nI, the undersigned, hereby make application for the position of teacher of the Indian Day School at Port Simpson B.C.\n\nI hold a B.A.(Tor) degree as certificate.\n\nAge 26.\n\nAm a member of the Methodist church.\n\nFor testimonials of character apply to Rev. T. Legate, Missionary, and Rev. J. H. Haley, Port Simpson B.C.\n\nSigned, M.M. Richardson\nSir,\n\nEnclosed is a copy of a letter addressed to Rev. G.H. Raley, of Fort Simpson, regarding the vacation of the Canadian Day school by the teacher without notice as per the Department's regulations. The same will explain itself.\n\nI would point out that during the past four years each appointment at this school has taken the form of a make-shift. Mr. Savage was first in charge of the school for a few months, and was dismissed by Rev. T. Ferrier, Supt. of Indian Education of the Methodist Church, for smoking. Next was Mr. Lionel Dineen, who taught for a short term, and afterwards left to take up work at Brandon, Manitoba. After his departure the school was in charge of a lad named Ramsley Haley, son of Rev. G.H. Raley for a little over 2 months.\n\nThe school was next conducted by Mr. Frank Moody, an ex-pupil of the Coqualeetza Institute at Chilliwack, B.C., for a little over 5 months. When he left, Miss Bland took charge whose term was very short. She was succeeded by Mr. L.M. Richardson who has now left after a term of about one year. Mr. Richardson has now left. No notice has been given of his intention to resign.\n\nAs this school is the largest on the agency, there being about 150 children of school age in the vicinity of the school, it is thought that the Methodist Church authorities should endeavour to do better for this school than they do in the matter of appointing teachers. The reason for the frequent changes would appear to be that the salary paid for services as teacher is inadequate, and in consequence there seems\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nseems to be a scarcity of teachers.\n\nI am of opinion that the day has come when teachers should be both competent and sufficiently paid. Missionaries of the present day in British Columbia do not feel themselves called upon to make the sacrifices which were necessary fifty years ago. The country is rich, and environment is modern. The cost of living is high in the north, and teachers should not be expected to be competent masters of their profession and at the same time penurious in their mode of living.\n\nThe present system is only playing at schools. The Port Simpson Indian Day school should have a fully qualified teacher, with a salary of at least $75.00 per month and a place of residence. Anything less than this will have a tendency to perpetuate a system which finds the school poorly attended, and frequent changes of teachers resulting in the impediment of the progress of education instead of the advancement looked for by the Department.\n\nI would recommend, therefore, that the Reverend T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Education in Methodist schools in Canada, and Rev. G.H. Raley, President of the Methodist Conference of British Columbia, be communicated with, with a view to a change in the school management and the ultimate advancement of the Indian children in the way of education.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nI beg to call your kind attention to the enclosed copy of the Department's regulations for the guidance of Inspectors, Indian Agents and Teachers in respect to the conduct of Indian Day schools, the last clause of which stipulates that \"all teachers will be required to give at least one month's notice of their intention to resign\". A copy of these regulations was mailed to all teachers in this agency in April last, including Mr. Richardson.\n\nI visited Port Simpson on the 5th instant, and found the Indian Day school closed; and found that Mr. Richardson had vacated the school without giving notice of his intention to do so. I received a letter from Mr. Richardson in connection with some wood for which he paid for use at the school, and in his letter he intimated that he intended to go east in about a fortnight. The letter was sent from Vancarcel, on the Skeena River, where Mr. Richardson has apparently been for some time.\n\nAs you have most to do with the appointment of teachers for this school as President of the Conference and Chairman of the Simpson District, I must press upon you the importance of conducting the school along the lines of the Department's regulations. The school should now be open, but as it is the children are in the village without a prospect, apparently, of receiving instruction for some time, or at least until a suitable teacher can be appointed. Kindly let me hear from you when you expect to have the school in charge of an efficient teacher.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6408, file 837-1, part 1)\nOttawa, October 24, 1913.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to call your attention to official letter of the 29th of May, 1911, in which you were informed that the Department would be prepared to pay $720.00 a year to a duly qualified teacher for the Fort Simpson Day School and, if a married man were available, $300.00 a year to his wife in consideration of certain services in the way of field matron and nursing work in the village. Nothing apparently has been done so far to give effect to this proposal, as Mr. and Mrs. Knott, whom you had in view for this position, declined to go to Fort Simpson. Mr. Richardson, who was then appointed to fill the vacancy, left without giving notice of his intention to resign. The constant change of teachers has a very bad effect on the school and renders any permanent progress in education impossible.\n\nThe Department wishes you would take the necessary action to secure the services of a thoroughly competent teacher for this school who would not be expected or requested to perform any work in the boarding school, but left free to devote all his energies to the day school.\n\nAs the establishment of the day school on a sound working basis is most important, I trust that you will give this matter your careful attention and advise\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nthe Department with any suggestions that you may think proper.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\nOttawa, October 30, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant reporting the appointment of Mr. J. H. Young as teacher of the Fort Simpson Indian Day School by the Methodist Church authorities.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department trusts that Mr. Young, if successful, will remain on permanently, as it agrees with you that the constant changes in the school have a disorganizing effect and I may inform you that the attention of the Rev. T. Perrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, has been called to this unsatisfactory state of affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nO. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakatla, B.C.\nI beg to inform you that the Methodist Church authorities have appointed Mr. J.H. Young as teacher at the Port Simpson Indian Day school, as successor to Mr. L.M. Richardson who has left to take up a position as missionary in the east. Mr. Young is a capable teacher, and has been a professor at the Columbian College at New Westminster in connection with the commercial department. He is a candidate for the Methodist ministry, and expects to be sent to a station at any time.\n\nIt seems unfortunate that the frequent changes of teachers result in difference and variety of teaching systems making it hard for the Indian children to follow up their studies. One teacher has one way, and another another way, and this cannot but be detrimental to the interest of the pupils.\n\nMr. Young has sent in a requisition for school material, which I am enclosing with this letter. Of this list, I would recommend that the Department furnish the exercise books, rulers, pen-nibs and chalk. As to the primers, arithmetics and scribblers, I have written to Mr. Young, and enclose herewith a copy of my letter which will explain my reasons for not asking to have the last named articles forwarded to the Port Simpson school until an explanation be given as to the disposal of previous consignments.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nTo the Secretary,\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nReplying to your request of the 24th. instant, re a teacher for the Port Simpson day school, I have noted carefully its contents. The policy proposed in this letter is next to an absolute impossibility. There are three classes of teachers that are available for a school of this kind. If a man is following the regular teaching profession and is absolutely no good as a teacher, you could get him to go to Port Simpson for $720.00. If he stands well in his profession he will simply laugh at you when you offer him that amount of money. To secure his services you would have to pay from fifteen hundred to two thousand a year. The third class we have to draw from are men who have the missionary spirit and who are either probationers in our church or offering themselves as such. Mr. Richardson was a probationer in the Methodist church, and a graduate of Victoria University. He accepted of the position for a year to help us out of the difficulty we were in. I went so far as to offer him what was equal to at least a thousand dollars for his services another year, but he felt that the time had come when he should take up his regular work of preaching. This necessitated the securing of another man, whom I think holds\na similar position in his relationship to the church. Upon this I am not quite positive, so I have written Mr. Raley this morning asking him for particulars. The Department will see from this the great difficulty in carrying out a policy such as is suggested in your letter. My own opinion is that the problem will not be solved until we have a plant for the boarding school suitable to meet all the needs of a place like Port Simpson, and in the meantime I trust that the former request that I made is provided for in the estimates. The present building used for the Boys' Home is certainly a disgrace both to the Government and to the Methodist church.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I would like to see a really serious attempt made to build up an efficient school. Good teachers and a truant officer are needed. The Indians should now be sufficiently civilized to respond to an effort to give them a first-class school\u2014Day School. Of course, it must be remembered that pressure will have to be brought to bear, if necessary to compel regular attendance.

Miss Bradshaw made this application on the suggestion of Miss Klippert, teacher of the Metlakatla school. I am inclosing herewith her testimonials, which I would ask you to be good enough to return to me.\n\nSince the closing of the boys' school there should be an attendance at this day school to warrant two teachers, although the average for the June quarter was only 24.7. If it is finally decided to engage the second teacher, we might appoint a truant officer.\n\nI should be glad to have your views as to the advisability of engaging a junior teacher and to know whether, in the event of such an appointment being made, you would be willing to give Miss Bradshaw a trial.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nPrincipal,\nBrandon Industrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nTo all whom it may concern:\n\nWe, the undersigned Trustees of Trolley N. School, Hamilton, do hereby certify that Miss Myra Bradshaw has had charge of the Junior Department of our school for the past eight years; she has during that time proved herself to be a very superior teacher, and a woman pre-eminently adapted to take charge of young pupils. She loves her work and is never more happy than when surrounded by young children. Her patience and her tact in dealing with wayward children are practically exhaustless, and her motherly tenderness is such as to win their hearts, and make them obedient to her commands. It is with sincere regret that we sever our connection with her as a teacher, for we gave her the same salary that we give to our principal, in order that we might retain her service in our Junior Department.\n\n(Signed)\n\nP.G.

Her pupils rendered her a ready obedience, not through any element of fear but rather of love. Her class made good progress under her careful instruction.\n\nIn regard to her duties as an assistant, I beg to certify that she was always ready to co-operate in any way requested and was very congenial and helpful in all her duties in connection with the school as a whole.\n\nI have a very high opinion of her moral character and I have no hesitation in heartily commending her to any Board needing the services of a good primary teacher.\n\n(Signed) William Aberhart, B.A.\nCalgary, Alta.,\nJune 4, 1914.\n\nThis is to certify that Miss Myra Bradshaw had charge of a primary class in Alexandra School, Calgary, for three years during which time her work was always found to be exceedingly satisfactory. Her understanding of modern methods, her sympathy with the needs of children, her understanding of the problems of child life and primary education; coupled with her desire to do the very best in her power, made her at all times a very satisfactory teacher for junior children. In addition to her other qualifications, Miss Bradshaw possesses a very considerable degree of artistic ability which stands her in good stead in the class-room.\n\nSigned,\n\nA.M. Scott,\nDept. of Schools.\nHamilton, Oct., Dec. 27, 1907.\n\nI have much pleasure in bearing testimony to the very excellent work done by Miss Anna Bradshaw while in charge of the junior Department of Holby St. School, Hamilton. She has been in charge of this department for the past eight years, and during this time has proven herself to be an exceptionally good Primary Teacher. In dealing with her pupils, she is kind, considerate and tactful, and yet maintains suitable order and discipline. Her system of instruction is based upon the most modern and approved methods, and she is in reality an up-to-date teacher, with an excellent record of past successes. It is therefore with the fullest confidence in her worth as a woman, and her ability as a teacher that I most heartily commend her to the favorable consideration of all Boards of Education.\n\n(Signed) J.H. Smith,\nP.S. Inspector,\nWentworth Co., Ont.\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nReplying to yours of the 7th re the application of Miss Myra Bradshaw for the position of Junior Teacher in the Fort Simpson School, the first question is whether we will be justified in dispensing with the services of Mrs. Duduward. I have written Mr. Cairns on this particular point asking him for a frank expression of his opinion on behalf of the Department. It is a unique case, and I would not like to be a party to anything that might appear to be unjust to a long and faithful servant.\n\nIn the event of dispensing with the services of Mrs. Duduward, I have been in correspondence with Miss Smiley, who was formerly in our employ at the Boys' Home. Miss Smiley has a 2nd Class Certificate and has had special training in some other lines. Mr. Cairns, your Inspector, speaks highly of her standing, and I have practically offered her the position, if there is a vacancy. I have not yet heard whether she will accept it.\n\nI am also in correspondence with Mr. Grant of Vancouver, who holds a 2nd Class Certificate for B.C., to take charge of the Senior Room. If we get these two teachers I think that the school will be well supplied. Should Miss Smiley not accept the position of Junior Teacher, I would be pleased to nominate Miss Bradshaw. In the meantime I will have to wait until we settle about Mrs. Duduward, and also for Miss Smiley's reply.\n\nEnclosed find the copies of testimonials as per your request.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.

Hamilton at the Fort Simpson Indian Day School by the Methodist Church authorities, I would beg to make a few observations:\n\n(1). It is noticed that the Church invariably nominates a person who is a theological student, whose ambition is to enter the ministry. This being the case, the teacher is expected to undertake preaching and other duties in preparation for which time is occupied which should be devoted to school studies, and in looking after pupils. Particularly at Fort Simpson there are disadvantages noticed, as the local missionary as Chairman of the Simpson District of the Church travels considerably and his duties are undertaken by the resident teacher.\n\nThe student's term as teacher is short-lived; and in addition to this he has to leave his school in the charge of a supply whenever he goes to Prince Rupert to study seminary.\n\nMr. Hamilton, the present Teacher, has informed me that he finds the extra burden of work more than he should undertake, and agrees that his connection with Church duties is detrimental to the best interests of the school.\n\n(2). It will have been noticed by the reports of this school from time to time that there are over one hundred children of school age in the vicinity of the school. The average attendance throughout the present and preceding years has been very poor in spite of the fact that the school is well equipped and in first-class condition.\n\nThe demand for compulsory attendance at this school would be beneficial has been anticipated by the Department in the appointment of the Dominion Constable, Mr. Watkinson, as Truant Officer.\n\nThe Department is paying for the services of a teacher at the rate of $56.00 per month, yet the Indians have an apparently settled idea that the school is operated under Church auspices and control and will not heed the frequent warnings given by the Truant Officer.\n\n(3). The Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nThe primary classes have in the past been conducted by Mrs. A. Budoward, wife of the late head Chieftain. While this lady has done her best, there is no indication that her efforts have in any measure helped to prepare the little ones for admission to the higher classes. Mrs. Budoward has abandoned this work, and now the classes are all together in the main class-room. For a time she appointed one of her sons to look after her duties, but he is entirely incompetent to undertake such duties.\n\nNo requisition has ever been made for kindergarten materials, nor are such made use of in the class-room.\n\nIn view of the foregoing observations, it has occurred to me that the Port Simpson Indian Lay School should be brought entirely under Government control, more particularly as the salary paid is equal to that paid other Government teachers. Nomination should be made by the Government or its officers and the Indians notified that in future the school will be a Government school, attendance at which when the Indians are at home will be compulsory, subject always to the provisions of the school regulations.\n\nAn additional experienced teacher should be appointed for the primary classes.\n\nA place of residence for the use of teachers could be furnished, if desirable, placed at the teachers' disposal at a reasonable rental. In this way the teachers would not be thrown upon the hospitality of the Mission.\n\nIn the appointment of teachers as suggested, care should be taken to nominate persons who are of good mor-\nSir,\n\nmoral character, and who have certificates of qualification at least equal to those under which Provincial teachers are accepted under salary.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nPort Simpson Indian day school without teacher for Junior classes\nsenior room overcrowded Mrs Dudoward, not teaching instructions of reverend\nT.

In the list of Indian schools west of the lakes conducted under the auspices of your church left by you in the Department on the 19th ultimo and which has been approved by the Deputy Superintendent General, provision was made for the salary of a second teacher at this school, and I have to request that you will take the necessary steps to have a qualified teacher provided with as little delay as possible, as there is only seating capacity in the class-rooms in the school for 45 pupils in each room. Even if the senior teacher could have all the pupils in his room he would not be able to do justice to the number.\n\nPlease advise the Department of the name of your nominee.

T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to yours of the 4th, #119542-1, re the Junior teacher for the Fort Simpson Day School, when I was in Ottawa I explained to Mr. Benson and Mr. Sutherland the peculiar position in which Mrs. Duduward had placed the question of supplying this room with a teacher. In that explanation I pointed out that Mr. Cairns and myself were of the opinion that we should have a properly qualified teacher in the junior room, and we offered Mrs. Duduward the position of Recruiting officer. To this she has taken very serious offence, &c., &c., as her personality had to be dealt with on the Reserve. I wrote to her asking her to open the school and go on with the teaching until I could see her, and in the meantime no other would be appointed. However, she has positively refused to accept of the school under such circumstances, and I was informed of this before receiving your communication of the 4th. I at once wrote Mr. Cairns, your Inspector, and I also wrote Miss Freeman of the City of Vancouver, who is a properly qualified teacher, to call and see Mr. Cairns, and if she were satisfactory to him, she was to go out to Fort Simpson at once and take charge of the school. As yet I have not heard from Mr. Cairns or Miss Freeman.\n\nI may say that Miss Smiley is not a Normal Trained teacher. I wrote Miss Bradshaw offering her the position, but she was engaged for another school and therefore could not accept it. I am in hopes that Miss Freeman will accept it, and from what I have been able to learn, I believe that she will make a very good teacher, she having Normal training.\n\nAfter what has been said to Mrs. Duduward, it would never do to appoint a person who has not had Normal Training and who is not a holder of a properly qualified certificate.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.F./M.C.B.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Tyson, Inspector of Indian Agencies dated October 19, 1915. Original on file 427021-61\n\nPORT SIMPSON DAY SCHOOL (METHODIST)\n\nVisited September 28th. This school is in charge of Mr. E. S. Grant. The attendance at present is not quite satisfactory as a large number of the children are still absent but we are looking forward to better results in the near future. The building is fairly good and well equipped. Sanitary conditions are also good.\n\nSgd. A. M. Tyson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nWhilst passing through Port Simpson by steamer going south from Nass River, Dr. Large called attention to the fact that the new teacher, Mr. E. S. Grant, who had just entered upon duties at the school, had more pupils than he could manage. Dr. Large further informed me that he had notified Rev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Education in Methodist Schools of Canada, that Mrs. Dudoward, the late primary teacher, had declined to teach any more, on account of the fact that she had been notified by Rev. Ferrier that her services would no longer be required, in view of another appointment that had been made by the Department of a teacher to take her place. I have not yet been informed of the future arrangements for the conduct of the school, although I have hitherto pressed most strongly for action in the direction of appointing government teachers. At present I have complaints from the teacher from Dr. Large and from Dominion Constable Watkinson, that a second teacher is badly needed for this school.\n\nI will be glad to be informed as to the future policy of the Department in the matter of this school. I telegraphed you on the 3rd in this connection.\n\n(Sgd) Charles Clifton Perry\nIndian Agent.\nTo The Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nReplying to yours of Nov. the 16th, # 119542-1 re the attendance at the Port Simpson School, the delay of placing a teacher in the Junior room has been caused by the refusal of Mrs. Dudward to continue the work when it was expected of her. As soon as I was aware of this I got into communication with Mr. Cairns, your Inspector of Indian Agencies. He has recommended a Miss Elsie Potter, who has a Normal Training in B.C., and she has been engaged to take charge of the Junior room. We have a Mr. Grant, a Normal trained teacher in the Senior room, and now with this Normal training in both rooms, I hope everything will be satisfactory for the education of the children at Port Simpson.\n\nInasmuch as Mrs. Dudward is dissatisfied, her personality is to be reckoned with, and it might be necessary to appoint a Recruiting Officer in order to get a regular attendance on the part of the children.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.F./ M.C.B.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Inspector had lately visited the school and had held a meeting with the people outlining the future policy of the Department for this school. Mr. Cairns has informed me that it is the proposal of the Department to give this school a further chance of showing a better attendance and that if the Indians do not respond to efforts made to bring this about, the Department will consider the closing of the school for a time at least. I think that now is the proper time to close the school. I feel sure that it will be effective in bringing the Indians to realize the value of the school when open. I would keep it closed for a year or until guarantee of attendance is given. It has been suggested that Indian trustees be appointed but no satisfactory outlines of their duties has been proposed.\n\nChas. C.

Original 119542-6\n\nAverage attendance for quarter ended:\nDecember 31, = 41.49\nMarch 31, = 26.50\n\nThese people are indifferent concerning the education of their children. They do not send their children even when they are in the village. I saw a number of children of school age running around the village not attending the school.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS:\n\nI called the people together to discuss with them the matter of school attendance. They made various excuses but gave no good reason for the poor showing in the matter of school attendance. My own opinion is that it is due to indifference and an utter lack of appreciation of the subject of education. They do not seem to realize the necessity of the children being trained. One Indian suggested that a committee be appointed to aid the truant officer in his work. All children of school age should be compelled to attend school regularly. I purpose taking up with Mr. Agt. Perry the matter of appointing an educational committee from the council of the village. They had much to say about an industrial school and seemed to think this would solve the problem.\n\nSgd.

I have to request that you will be good enough to inform the Department whether any new arrangements were made for the conduct of this school after the summer holidays and, if so, I beg to remind you that the Department should have been consulted before they were carried into effect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Original on 119542-7\n\nMrs. Perry, Agency Clerk and ex-teacher of the Crosby Girls' Boarding School, called at the school whilst visiting the Crosby Boarding School. She found the school closed and Mr. and Mrs. Racklyeft informed her that school had been opened in the morning but that only one Indian child was in attendance. Both teachers were that afternoon visiting the Indian parents and had received assurances from five Indian families that they would have the children attend the following day.\n\nI have instructed Dominion Constable Watkinson to keep record of those parents and guardians who persistently neglect to send their children to school.

Original on 119542/7.\n\nWhile the teachers are efficient in their class work, I regret that the school was in a chaotic condition from the point of view of discipline. I found books, rulers, etc. scattered under the desks, and little hills of sweepings which the janitor had left here and there in corners of the rooms. Books had been stolen from the school and the building had been broken into and cupboards rifled.\n\nConstable Watkinson was instructed to make an investigation immediately; and the teachers were notified that the school must be kept in more satisfactory condition and better discipline maintained.\n\nI have arranged for a better janitor service.\nOttawa, October 28, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of your report on the Fort Simpson Day School, which refers to the non-attendance of children at this school, I beg to say that the Department approves of your decision to prosecute Indians who neglect to send their children to school, and it is thought that if proceedings are taken against them, it will have the desired effect of making them conform to regulations.\n\nYou will please instruct the truant officer to notify the parents of all children who are not attending school, that their failure to make them do so, will render them liable to the penalties provided for in the Regulations Relating to the Education of Indian Children.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary\n\nC.

There is a little weakness in regard to discipline and also in the matter of tidiness.\n\nDated, April 21st, 1917.\nOttawa, March 29, 1917.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department is advised that there is a conspicuous lack of discipline at the Fort Simpson Day School. Mr. Agent Perry in a recent report on this school states as follows\u2014\"On the 7th instant I called at 2.15 p.m. and found the school wide open with noone in charge and no pupils present. I went down to the village and interrogated some children who informed me that this hour was recess\u2014from 2 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. I then met the teachers, who were making their way back to school at 2.20. At 2.25 p.m. the school bell was rung. I stayed at the school until 3.10 p.m., when five little girls walked leisurely into school. Mr. Rackley started a class with these. The Agent also states that he found the blackboard and class-room work most satisfactory from points of efficiency and that the teachers are painstaking and well liked by the Indians.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to impress upon the teachers of this school that better discipline might be maintained in the future and that the pupils must be more punctual.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, August 9, 1917.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nSince writing you on the 29th of March, last, in reference to the apparent lack of discipline at the Fort Simpson Day School reports have been received from Mr. Inspector Cairns and Mr. Agent Perry in regard to this school.\n\nMr. Cairns stated that \"the work of Mr. Racklyeft may be characterized as fair. There is a little weakness in regard to discipline and also in the matter of tidiness\". Mr. Cairns last visit to the school was made on a Saturday, when it was not in session.\n\nMr. Perry states that, \"while the teachers are gifted, the discipline is not good. The school is opened at any hour of the day and closed at any hour. The building is frequently left open and school material and supplies are often missed. The scholars are frequently seen running about in the village, while the teachers are wandering about by themselves in school hours instead of looking after the children. When the school bell rings, which may be at any time, the Indian children take no notice and go into school whenever they feel inclined\".\n\nMr. Perry enclosed a letter addressed to him by the Rev. Mr. Spencer in regard to this school, who says \"we have in charge of our school gifted teachers, whom it is a pleasure to meet. I have noticed, however, during\n\nRev. T. Neffier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6408, file 837-1, part 1)\nduring the year more or less irregularity in opening and closing the school. Then again, to an outsider who happened to be passing the school building one would conclude from the noise inside, that the children were imposing on a good natured teacher.\n\nThere is also a letter from the Dominion Constable, who acts as truant officer, confirming these statements.\n\nMr. Perry, in concluding his remarks on this school, states that there is no strained feeling between the teacher and himself, as they are pleasant people to meet, but there is absolutely no discipline in the school or out of it and that something should be done to change this.\n\nThe Department would like you to look into this matter with a view to remedying the lack of discipline at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter No.132906-1, of the 22nd ultimo, which was erroneously addressed to Agent Fouger, of Bella Coola, and concerning the report of Inspector Cairns on his visit to the Port Simpson Indian Day School. In reply I beg to transmit to you herewith for your perusal letters I have received from Dr. J.C. Spencer, clergyman in charge of the Port Simpson Methodist Church, and who has the oversight of the school, and from Dominion Constable Watkinson, the truant officer.\n\nFrom these letters it will be gathered that while the teachers are gifted, discipline is not good; and that the teachers seek to make the school inspector responsible for the lack of discipline, which I feel sure is not the case.\n\nThe school is opened at any hour of the day and closed at any hour. The building is frequently left open and school material and supplies are often missed. The scholars are frequently seen running about in the village, while the teachers are wandering about by themselves in school hours instead of looking after the children. When the school bell rings, which may be at any time, the Indian children take no notice and go into school whenever they feel inclined. The Department cannot expect me to stop this kind of thing by having the truant officer fall into line with a system of this kind. As Mr. Watkinson states,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nteachers should do their part by keeping strictly to the school regulations laid down by the Department.\n\nI have spoken to the teachers about locking the school doors when leaving the premises, but they have taken no notice whatever of this. Mr. Watkinson has complained to me of this on several occasions.\n\nI would also mention that for years it has been the custom to have a teacher sent to Red Cliff oolachan fishing camp, Mass River, to teach the children who go there from Port Simpson. This year, I went to Port Simpson to arrange with Mr. Racklyeft to go to Red Cliff, and later left Port Simpson with the understanding that he would go. Mr. Racklyeft never went there, however. Later he explained that as he took his advices concerning the school from Dr. Spencer, the local clergyman, he did not feel under any obligation to go with his children to Red Cliff. Yet the Department continued to pay his salary as teacher.\n\nWhilst writing on this subject I would point out that there is no strained feeling between the teachers and myself. The teachers are pleasant people to meet, but there is absolutely no discipline in school or out of it. Something must be done to change this.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nPort Simpson June 15th 1917\n\nMr. B. B. Dew\nInd Office.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYours of a recent date to hand asking me be the efficiency of our Indian Day School.\n\nI may say we have in charge of our school gifted teachers, with whom it is a pleasure to meet.\n\nI have noticed however during the year more or less irregularity in opening & closing the school.\n\nThen again to an outsider who happened to be passing the school building one would conclude from the noise inside, that the children were imposing on a good natured teacher.\nThe attendance under former teachers 1916 was small.\n\nThe attendance this year has much improved.\n\nOur teachers tell us that Inspector Evans when he engaged them to come here gave them a free hand and told them to work up the attendance.\n\nIn other words he told them not to follow too closely the course of study laid down.\n\nIf need be take the children off on the beach or to the woods for rambles; anything to increase the attendance.\n\nIf however the inspectors do not find satisfactory progress being made by the pupils, I think they should make recommendations with a view to obtaining results.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJ. L. Spencer\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter re Indian day schools and in reply I wish to state that as regards the attendance and as far as I am concerned as truant officer I have done everything in my power to keep the attendance up.\n\nI have talked to the school as truants five and some children at one time and I have had all kinds of trouble with the parents.\n\nThe Indian school cannot be compared with the White school as the Indians here are mostly all fishermen, they are here one day and away the next day and they will not leave their children in the village to go to school, as they have no interest whatsoever or do not at any time visit the school.\n\nI am informed that Inspector Burns has given the teacher authority to use any means whatever to get the attendance, this in my opinion should not be, as strict discipline should be used, school opened on time and everything done to show the Indians that the teacher is doing his part and they had to do theirs; and then if they will not send their children to school either close the school or enforce the regulations string, these half measures with the Indians is poor policy as they will take advantage of you every chance they get, it is only those who are in close contact with them every day to know that this is true.\n\nI am quite willing to do or work in writing anything that could be done for the benefit of the Indians.\nThere is at present about 15 children in the village and most of these will be going to the cannery tomorrow.\n\nThe toilets at the school are in a very unsanitary condition and should be attended to before the new term, also the side walk leading to the school is in very bad repair.\n\nA good fence should also be provided for the school as the proper time be kept.\n\nI may also mention that on the last visit of Inspector Burns which was on a Saturday school was called and it could not be expected that all the children in the village would attend it being a holiday and their parents just home from the fishing grounds for the week end.\n\nC C Perry Esq\nIndian Agent\nPrince Rupert B.C\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA J Macdonald\nDivision Constable\nOttawa, May 22nd, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nInspector Cairns, who recently visited the Port Simpson day school, reports that the attendance is very unsatisfactory.\n\nThe Department will expect you to urge the Indians to send their children to school, regularly. There is a good teacher in charge and it is hoped that your interest in this matter will encourage the Indians to send their children, so that they may receive the benefits of education.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nI. Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nOttawa, August 9, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th of June, last, in regard to the lack of discipline at the Fort Simpson Day School and enclosing communications from the Rev. J. C. Spencer and Dominion Constable Watkinson in connection with this matter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Rev. Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, is being written to and informed that the Department would like him to look into this matter with a view to remedying the lack of discipline at this school.\n\nIt is noticed that the Dominion Constable states that the toilets are in a very unsanitary condition, that the sidewalk leading to the school is in very bad repair and that a clock should be provided.\n\nYou should arrange to have the closets properly cleaned and the sidewalk repaired and you may purchase a clock, the cost of which should not exceed $5.00 or $6.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, August 9, 1917.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe lack of discipline at the Fort Simpson Day School has again been brought to the attention of the Department by Mr. Agent Perry, the Rev. Mr. Spencer and the Dominion Constable.\n\nIt is stated that the teacher, Mr. Racklyeft, when spoken to, claimed that he was authorized by you to use any means whatsoever to get the attendance; in other words you told him not to follow too closely the course of study laid down, but to take the children off on the beach or to the woods for rambles; anything to increase the attendance.\n\nWhile the Department does not accept these statements, it would be glad to know what instructions, if any, you gave Mr. Racklyeft in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. R. H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRoom 14,\n249 Hastings St., East,\nVancouver, B.C.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to yours of the 9th, No. 132906/1; re the discipline of the Port Simpson Day-School:\n\nI have discussed this matter with Mr. Perry in person. I have had also some correspondence with Mr. Cairns on the subject. Mr. Cairns and I are both of the opinion that Mr. Berry's criticism is a little too severe. When I visited the school in March last, I offered personal criticism to both Mr. and Mrs. Racklyeft. They are a very fine spirited couple and are well liked by the people of the community. The Indians in council passed a resolution in my presence requesting that they be sent back as the teachers. Mr. Cairns are both of the opinion that we should stand by them and see if the question of discipline cannot be remedied. I am writing Mr. Racklyeft to-day.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\n349 Hastings St. East,\nVancouver, B.C.,\nAugust 18, 1917.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir:\n\nYour letter of August the 9th, numbered 12296/1 re the discipline of the Port Simpson Day School came to hand in due time.\n\nBefore going North about a year ago, Mr. and Mrs. Rackleyft came to my office to talk over the work at Port Simpson.\n\nMr. Rackleyft is an experienced gardener and has also worked as a carpenter. I suggested to him that he might turn these to account in arousing an interest among the pupils. I also suggested that the subject of Nature Study be taken in rambles in the woods and at the Beach, sometimes. This method is often followed in connection with our Public Schools.\n\nOf course in all this I never once hinted that there should be any laxity of discipline. I am particularly emphatic in demanding excellent order in the class-room and exemplary conduct on the way to and from school.\nIt is only fair for me to say that Mr. and Mrs. Racklyeft did fairly good work last year. They understand modern methods, having taken a course of training in the Normal School at Vancouver. I am told the Indians held a meeting to give expression to a desire to have Mr. and Mrs. Racklyeft remain as their teachers. To have the good-will of the Indians is a strong point in their favor. Both of the teachers are musical, and are held in high respect by the white residents of Port Simpson, I am informed.\n\nMy opinion is that Mr. and Mrs. Racklyeft should have a further chance to overcome a weakness that has manifested itself in their work in the past. If after reasonable time there is no improvement, then a change might be brought about.\n\nI shall visit the school in October and will go into things thoroughly with the teachers and report fully to the Department.\n\nThese people have so many admirable qualities that I feel it is worth while to try to remedy the weakness.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Schools for B.C.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Cairns, your Inspector for Schools in British Columbia, and I were in Mr. Scott's office in the Spring of 1916. Among other items of business, we jointly recommended that Mrs. Dudoward should have a retiring allowance of $200.00 a year. Mrs. Dudoward is the widow of the late Chief of the Port Simpson Band. On behalf of the Methodist Church I agreed that the Church would pay one-half of this and the Government were to pay the other. It was so reported to the office in Toronto. Mrs. Dudoward has been paid the $200.00 a year since this date.\n\nOn enquiry of the Accountant of our Missionary Board I find that the Department have not paid over to the Church the $100.00 per year. Mrs. Dudoward is still receiving the $200.00 so if the Department will send a cheque to the Mission Rooms for $200.00 this will settle the account up to March 31st, 1918. $200.00 will be one-half of what Mrs. Dudoward will receive from the 1st of April, 1918 to the 1st of April, 1918.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\nOttawa, March 4, 1918.\n\nIn reference to your report on the Fort Simpson Day School for the month of January, last, I beg to say that you should ask the resident Missionary, Dr. J. C. Spencer, to furnish the Rev. T. Perrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, with a full report in regard to the conditions there.\n\nYou will also be good enough to inform the teachers that the school must be opened at the proper time and that better discipline must be maintained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nExtract from Mr. Agent Perry's report on the Fort Simpson Indian Day School for the month of January, 1918. Original on 119542/7.\n\nOn my visit to the reserve in December the local Indian council appointed two of the better educated Indian councillors as a School Visiting Committee. On the occasion of this visit I found that this Committee had not visited the school or taken any interest in it at all.\n\nI noticed during my stay in Fort Simpson of four days that the school bell was being rung very irregularly. My attention was called to the poor state of discipline by Dr. J. O. Spencer, the resident Missionary, and also by Dominion Constable Watkinson, Truant Officer.\n\nI have asked the truant officer for a full report and list of truant pupils. One would feel more encouraged in the matter of prosecuting parents and guardians if the children were being sent to a school where the teachers were good disciplinarians.\n\nIt is surprising to me that Dr. Spencer does not appear to be informing Rev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Education, of conditions at the Fort Simpson Indian Day School, but prefers to continue complaining to me.\nOttawa, November 8, 1917\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 30th ultimo, in which you call attention to the personal recommendation made by yourself and Mr. Inspector Cairns in the spring of 1916 that Mrs. Dudoward, widow of the late Chief of the Port Simpson Band, be granted a retiring allowance of $200.00 a year, one-half of which was to be borne by the Methodist Church, I am directed to say that there is no appropriation from which such a gratuity could be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nAttendance has been very unsatisfactory, partly due to an epidemic of whooping cough. Parents are indifferent. They display very little interest in education.\n\nThe teachers are doing their best for the pupils. They find great difficulty in getting the cooperation of the parents. In fact it is impossible. The parents are in a critical, fault-finding mood. They seem to be upset about the war. The old people seem to think that an attempt will be made to make them go into the army.\n\nDate of Inspection, June 10th, 1916.\nSir,\n\nI beg to call the Department's attention to the fact that for many years past the authorities of the Methodist Church of Canada in the Fort Simpson District have arranged to have the children of Indians belonging to Fort Simpson taught Red Cliff, Nama River, at the village of Nimipumun during the oolachan fishing, and a very fair attendance was the result particularly as at such time the Indian parents engaged in fishing are glad to have their children out of their way and in a warm place. The fish are usually taken from under the ice and the parents cannot very well attend to the home fires and fish as well. Women as well as men engage in the preparation of the oolachan oil for food.\n\nLast season I arranged with Mr. Rockleyft the Indian Lay School teacher at Fort Simpson to have him go to Nimipumun, but after my return from Port Simpson I found that he had not gone to that point. In explanation, Mr. Rockleyft later informed me he had not been given to understand at the time of his appointment that he would be expected to go to Fishery Bay and for this reason he did not go notwithstanding he was prepared to go at the time of my visit to Fort Simpson.\n\nIt is desirable that the Department arrange with the Superintendent of Education of the Church to have this teacher go to Nimipumun during the oolachan fishing season. The Methodist Indians of Fort Simpson have a\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nbuilding at this place which could be used for school and residence purposes during this time. The season commences at the end of March and continues till about the end of May. About 15 to 20 children from Fort Simpson go there. The attendance at the Fort Simpson school for the June quarter is shown only at 9.56. Had Mr. Rockleyft gone to Red Cliff this year, Mr. Rockleyft could easily have attended to those at Fort Simpson.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nJuly 26, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to the Fort Simpson Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has written to Reverend Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, and requested him to look into the education at this point with a view to improving conditions.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nChas. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert,\nB. C.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to yours of July 26th, no. 119542-1:\n\nI have taken up this matter with Mr. Racklyeft and requested him that in future when the Indian children are gathered in fishing camps in sufficient numbers to be able to open a class among them, that he do so. I also have urged him to press the attendance question, and during the coming year to improve on order and discipline. They are an excellent couple and are doing good work in the class-room but if the school does not improve in these three particulars during the coming year I think it will be necessary to make a change of teachers. When I am out there I shall so inform them.\n\nIn the meantime, I might draw the attention of the Department to the extreme difficulty that we have in getting teachers at the present time. There is such a lack of teachers in every province and the salaries they pay make it next to impossible to secure the best teachers for Indian schools on the present scale of salaries.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\nSir,\n\nI regret to inform you that Mr. and Mrs. R.A. Rockleyeft, Indian day school teachers at Fort Simpson, are ignoring all official communications addressed to them from this office. The local Methodist District Superintendent, Rev. W.S.A. Crux, B.A., is experiencing the same difficulty and has written to them complaining of this; in fact he has been writing along these lines for some time.\n\nI regret that I am not able to get from Mr. and Mrs. Rockleyeft the forms filled in relative to the Civil Service Classification, Nationality and other particulars, or in connection with weekly returns of truant pupils.\n\nThe Rockleyefts are drawing salary which they are not earning, and I am strongly of opinion that something should be done to put a stop to this. Rev. Mr. Crux has today informed me that he is writing to the Superintendent of Indian Education in Methodist Schools of Canada in this connection, and he agrees with me that conditions are not satisfactory.\n\nApart from matters of correspondence, the actions of both Mr. and Mrs. Rockleyeft with the Indians have not been conducive to satisfactory educational arrangements in the village of Fort Simpson.\n\nI would recommend that both Mr. and Mrs. Rockleyeft be discharged from the Department's service.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He states that they are neglecting all official correspondence addressed to them from his office and that the local Methodist District Superintendent, Rev. W. S. A. Crux, is experiencing the same difficulty. They have neglected to fill in the forms relative to the Civil Service Classification which were sent them and in which their nationality and other particulars were asked for. They have also failed to furnish the weekly returns of truant pupils.\n\nHe also states that aside from the matters of correspondence the actions of both Mr. and Mrs. Racklyeft with the Indians have not been conducive to satisfactory educational arrangements in the Village of Port Simpson.\n\nThe Department would be pleased if you would inquire into the matters complained of and, if the Racklyefts are not prepared to conform to the requirements of the Department, it is thought that it would be in the interests of all concerned if an early change is made at Port Simpson.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

I enclose you Mr. Rackleyt's letter which seems to indicate that matters are amicably settled. He encloses the envelope that contains Mr. Perry's letter showing the post office stamp to be October 9th. I am of the opinion that it might be well to move Mr. Rackleyt providing we can get suitable teachers for Port Simpson. Mr. Rackleyt might make a good teacher for Hartley Bay. He and Mr. Perry are both Englishmen they seem to be decided to disagree, although Mr. Rackleyt's letter shows that he is ready for peace. If matters are no better in the future the only remedy will be to change the teachers.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.

Normal school. I have tried in every way to help them. They both have considerable teaching ability. The Indians like them and Rev. J.G. Spencer, M.D spoke very highly of them at the time my visit. He said they were willing to do anything to help the work among the Indians. He mentioned particularly the Sunday school. However they have not made a success in the school. They have voluntarily resigned. That clears the way to try to get someone next year who will make a success if that be possible.\n\nDate of Inspection, February 11th, 1916.\nJuly 5th, 1919\n\nI beg to inform the Department that Mr. R.A. Rockleyft, Indian Lay School Teacher, of Port Simpson, was absent from the school from the Easter holidays to the end of the June quarter, and he should therefore not be paid by the Department salary for that period.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 2, 1920\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to draw your attention to official letter of January 19th, last, regarding the appointment of a teacher for the Port Simpson Indian Day School to succeed Mr. James Oliver.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to state whether a teacher has yet been secured to replace him at Port Simpson. I may say that Mr. Agent Loring reports that Mr. Oliver began duties as teacher at Kiteegukha on the 3rd of January last. The Department is pleased to continue him in the service as a teacher and would like to be informed as to what salary he was promised for his services. I may say that the former teacher, Miss Wright, received $700.00 per annum and this is all that can be allowed for the salary of a teacher at this point.\n\nIf a new teacher has been secured at the Port Simpson School you will be good enough to state the name and qualifications and also the amount of salary promised. The Department would like to have complete information regarding the teachers at both these points as soon as possible in order that it can prepare the pay-list and the amount of bonus due for the quarter ending March 31st, next.\n\nKindly give this matter your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. O. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, January 19, 1920.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Department has recently received a report of inspection of the Fort Simpson Indian Day School for the month of December, last, from Mr. Agent Perry.\n\nHe states that he found everything satisfactory, there being a good attendance. He reports quite an improvement in the discipline and work since Mr. Oliver took charge. He also states that Mr. Oliver has given up his duties and has left for the Upper Skeena.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to endeavour to obtain a properly qualified teacher for this school as soon as possible, one who would exercise proper control and discipline, as the children of this village are reported to have become very unruly under the lack of discipline maintained by the Racklyefts. The name and qualifications of the person nominated by you as teacher of this school should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nExtract from December Quarter Return of the Port Simpson Indian Day School. Original on 119542-2.\n\nIt is exceedingly unfortunate that the Methodist Church of Canada cannot place a teacher in this school both efficient and able to carry on the work for the good of the children of this village. Mr. Oliver has been at Port Simpson for a couple of months and has left for the Upper Skeena. He is a splendid man and it is a great pity that a satisfactory arrangement cannot be made by the Church for the proper control of this school, particularly as the children of this village had become so unruly.\n\nIf the Church cannot properly look after the arrangements, the Department should nominate and appoint the teacher as at Metlakatla and other villages.\n\nChas. C. Perry\nAgent.\nExtract from Agent's Report on the Port Simpson Indian Day School for the month of November, 1919. Original on 119542-7\n\nDominion Constable Watkinson, Truant Officer, reports a great change in the conduct of this school under Mr. Oliver. It is regretted, however, that Mr. Oliver is reported to be leaving shortly. I understand he is a preacher and teaching is not his main employment.\n\nThere are 21 absentees from this school, all of whom are with their parents at the several scattered camps along the waterways of the coast.\n\nA complete change of conditions at this school, where numbers are concerned, is noticed as a result of industrial opportunities where the Indians find employment and are obliged to take their children with them away from the village. Unfortunately, however, the children are not benefitted by this change, for the school authorities at the places where the Indians find employment will not allow Indians admission to white schools.\n\nChas. C. Perry\nAgent.\nSir,\n\nFort Simpson School.\n\nI would also point out that some of this damage now repaired was done by school children and would appear to have been malicious, but Dominion Constable Watkinson has been unable to find out the names of the pupils responsible.\n\nWhile recommending the payment of the account I would suggest that no further accounts of this kind be paid in connection with this school, but that the teacher be expected to exercise closer supervision in the future than in the past. The management of this school has been shocking for some time past and there has been no discipline.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nCharles C. Perry,\nIndian Agent.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the Port Simpson Day School, October 6, 1919. Original on 119542-6\n\nREMARKS.\n\nThis day school at Port Simpson is not satisfactory. We have had several teachers try to make a success of this school during the last five years. Some of them were Normal graduates but all have failed to get satisfactory results.\n\nThe school year is short and even when the people are in the Village it is almost impossible to get regular attendance. The parents are not interested. The home is not organized with the school in view.\n\nThere were nine present the day of my visit. Two were in the second reader and two were in the first reader. These four were making very good progress. They understand English. The remaining five were struggling with word recognition.\n\nAnother teacher will be put in as soon as attendance calls for it.\n\nR. H. Cairns,\nInsp.\nOttawa, October 23, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, informing the Department that you have been transferred from the Gibson Reserve, Ontario, as teacher of the Port Simpson Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Rev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, who recently visited the Department, reported your transfer which is approved. It is hoped that you will meet with every success in your new sphere of duties.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nJames Oliver, M.A.,\nPort Simpson,\nB.C.\nIndian Day School,\nFort Simpson, British Columbia\nOctober 9, 1919\n\nSir,\n\nMr. R. H. Carus, Inspector of Indian Schools, was here on October 6, and advised me to write to you and inform you that I had been transferred by the Methodist Missionary Society from Gibson Reserve, Ontario, to B.C., for similar service here. I promised that this had already been done by the Society. However, I wish to take this opportunity of sincerely thanking you for your unvarying kindness and courteous consideration during the years I served in Ontario.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJames Oliver\nTeacher (Methodist)\n\nIndian Affairs.

Both are qualified teachers of experience. I visited the school during the month of February and found that both were doing excellent work and the outlook for the future is hopeful. The salary promised was for the senior teacher, $900.00 without war bonus, for the junior teacher $650.00 and war bonus expected. Mr. Oliver is occupying the dual position of Missionary-teacher and $600.00 is the amount from the Department with the expectation of a war bonus.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\n\nTF/GF\nOTTAWA, July 5th, 1921.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nMr. Agent Perry, Prince Rupert, informs the Department that Miss Roode, senior teacher at the Port Simpson Indian Day School, will not be returning after the holidays.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you will nominate a qualified teacher to succeed Miss Roode and take up duties when the school reopens after the holidays.\n\nThe name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated for the position should be forwarded for the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T.

Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, is being informed that Miss Roods, senior teacher, is giving up her duties, and he is being requested to endeavour to obtain the services of a qualified teacher to begin duties when the school reopens after the summer holidays. As soon as a teacher has been nominated, you will be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith the quarterly returns of the Port Simpson Indian Day School, for the quarter ended June 30th, 1921, and to inform you that the school has closed owing to the Indians having left their village for the canneries. I advised the teachers to send in their returns at school closing; and I would recommend that salaries be paid for this school for the whole quarter.\n\nThe report of Miss Tranter is for the Junior Division, and that of Miss Roode for the Senior.\n\nMy report of this school will follow the taking of the Census. Miss Roode will not be returning after the holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nSkeena River Agency, B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 12, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Rev. T.

The salary of Miss Roode will be paid at the rate of $750.00 per annum and Miss Archibald at the rate of $650.00 per annum, together with the bonus in each case during the period which it is payable to teachers of Indian day schools. Should this bonus not be continued after the end of the present fiscal year, the salary of Miss Roode will then be paid at the rate of $900.00 per annum to make up the difference in lieu of the bonus.\n\nYou will be good enough to see that the quarterly returns from these teachers are forwarded promptly at the end of each quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. O. Petry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, March 12, 1920.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant informing the Department that Miss Roode took charge of the senior room and Miss Archibald of the junior room at the Fort Simpson Day School at the beginning of the New Year, also that the salary promised Miss Roode was at the rate of $900.00 per annum, without bonus, and that of Miss Archibald $650.00 per year, with bonus.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the appointment of these two teachers is approved.\n\nWith reference to the salary I beg to say that the Department will pay Miss Roode salary at the rate of $750.00, with bonus at the rate of $150.00 during the time it is allowed to teachers, and will further guarantee that, should the bonus be discontinued at the end of the present fiscal year, she will receive a salary at the rate of $900.00. The salary of Miss Archibald will be at the rate of $650.00 per annum, with bonus during the time the same is provided. It is hoped that both these teachers will meet with every success in the work at Fort Simpson.\n\nIt is noted that Mr. Oliver, who recently taught this school, has been transferred to Kitegukia as teacher and missionary, with salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum and bonus. This also is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOTTAWA, October 26th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a request from the Rev. Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, concerning the appointment of Miss Kate Tranter as supervising teacher at the Port Simpson Day School.\n\nThe Department understands that Miss Tranter has been teaching the junior division of this school with marked success. Mr. Ferrier suggests that she continue to teach in the junior room but that she have a general supervision over the other division as well. He has secured the services of Miss M. B. Wright as the second teacher, at a salary of $750 and bonus.\n\nIf you are of the opinion that Miss Kate Tranter is a fit person to supervise the activities of this school, and to receive the $900 and bonus that has been paid to the senior teacher, would you be good enough to write us to that effect. If your answer is favourable to Miss Tranter, the Department will authorize her appointment as supervising teacher at a salary of $900 and bonus.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Miss Tranter was carrying on the work alone.\n\nOn my return to Prince Rupert after visiting all the schools along the Skeena River, I was informed that the Chairman of the District had engaged Miss M.B. Wright and that she was at work at Port Simpson.\n\nBoth Miss Tranter and Miss Wright are faithful in the discharge of their duties. They will do the best work of which they are capable. As a mark of appreciation for her long service among the Indians, the appointment of Miss Tranter as Principal would be very appropriate.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H.

The Department permits Miss Tranter to teach the junior room, if this arrangement is desired by her and if Miss M. B.

Wright, who taught the Senior Room at Fort Simpson, has been removed to Kitsegukla. I have secured the services of Annie H. Roode, who was two years in this classroom, previous to Miss Wright's term of service.\n\nInasmuch as this school does not require the services of two teachers for the full 200 days of the year, I would suggest that Miss Roode be paid $5.00 for each teaching day that she spends in the classroom.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, October 9th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nWe are informed by Rev.

Roode have been secured to succeed Miss Wright. Miss Roode had two years experience in this classroom previous to Miss Wright's term of service.\n\nAs this school will not require the services of two teachers for the full 200 teaching days in the year, the services of Miss Roode will only be required during the time there is sufficient attendance to warrant the employment of two teachers.\n\nMiss Roode will be allowed salary at the rate of $5.00 per day for each teaching day she spends in the classroom.\n\nMiss Roode has a Second Class Certificate and is qualified for the position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You will be good enough to see that, when quarterly returns are forwarded showing the attendance and days taught, it is clearly stated on the return the number of days each quarter Miss Roode was employed in teaching, in order that the correct amount of salary due her can be paid.\n\nMiss Roode has a Second Class Certificate and is qualified for the position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Roode to the position of senior teacher at the Pt. Simpson Indian Day School, with salary at the rate of $5 per day. The Department was under the impression that this appointment was to take care of a more or less seasonal activity when the services of a second teacher were required. I have examined the returns and I find that for the past calendar year Miss Roode drew salary for 199 days, which is practically a full academic year's activity. In view of the average attendance of 29.5 for both classrooms for this period, the Department is doubtful as to the need of the services of the second teacher permanently.

Miss Tranter entered the service of this Department as teacher of the Fort Essington Indian Day School November 1, 1890, and has been teaching continuously since that time at Fort Essington, Bella Bella, and Port Simpson, respectively. The following details with reference to her retirement are available:\n\nAge .................................................. 55 yrs.,\nDate of last appointment ......................... Nov. 1, 1890,\nDate of retirement ................................ July 1, 1924,\nLength of service .................................. 33 yrs. 7 mos.\nPresent salary ....................................... $900,\nAverage salary for last 3 yrs. ................. $900,\nRetirement allowance (3/50th of $900) ....... $495.\n\nDuring the past two years superannuation has been granted to three teachers, viz:\n\nMiss Isabella Melvor, Sidney Bay, Ont.,\nMiss A. M. Matthews, Sarnia, Ont.,\nMr. T. J. Wallace, French Bay, Ont.\n\nI would recommend, in view of Miss Tranter's long and faithful service, that the Civil Service Commission be requested to take the necessary action to retire her under the provisions of the above mentioned Act. It will be necessary, in the event of her retirement, to appoint a successor.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI had a conversation with Miss Kate Tranter when I was out at Port Simpson in April. Her doctor had written me previous to this stating her health was very poor and that she ought to be relieved of her duties at least for a time. I consequently arranged for her to take a holiday at the beginning of the Easter Holidays. While in Vancouver a couple of weeks ago I had a conversation with her. She has concluded to resign from the work. I advised her to put in an application for superannuation allowance, which I believe she has done.\n\nMiss Tranter has taught continuously for thirty-four years at Fort Simpson, Bella Bella and Port Simpson. I trust her case will receive favorable consideration from the Department. She has rendered faithful and conscientious service and will need some assistance for her future.\n\nIf the Department is desirous of any further information I will be glad to furnish the same.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\nOttawa, June 4th, 1924.\n\nRev.

Whilst this condition may be caused partly by the fact that the Indians are continually coming and going, the main reason is the apathy shown by the parents as to whether their children attend or not. I believe conditions would be improved if an experienced male teacher were placed in charge of this school assisted by a lady teacher for the junior classes.\n\nW. E. Collison,\nAgent.\nOttawa, May 4th, 1925.\n\nRev.

She is more than the average in order and discipline. It might be that a male teacher, if we could secure the right type, would improve the situation. A much larger salary would have to be provided for and it is better to have a good lady teacher than a poor male one.\n\nMiss Nightingale who has charge of the junior room is doing very well.

We thank you very heartily for the action you have taken in regard to an advance in her salary. We will inform Miss Gingrich.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAB.MT\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6408, file 837-1, part 1)\nPrince Rupert, B.C., Feb. 18, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report as follows for the months of December and January:\n\nX X X\n\nDAY SCHOOLS.\n\nSatisfactory reports have been received from all the day schools in the agency. Occasional complaints have been received from teachers regarding laxity in the attendance of some of the pupils. So far it has not been necessary to inflict penalties for truancy as provided in the Act though sometimes urged by teachers. I have always considered that better results could be obtained by teachers co-operating with the parents to ensure a better attendance.\n\nI would draw to the Department's attention the fact that the junior class room of the Fort Simpson school is at present overcrowded, during the winter months when the people are back in the village the teacher has over fifty children of different grades to manage and has been compelled to divide up the work taking the junior grades in the mornings and the more advanced in the afternoons. This is not satisfactory on account of the comparatively short time the parents are resident in the village, and it is important that the children should have all the attention possible whilst they have the opportunity of attending school. I would therefore recommend that an extra teacher be obtained for this school next winter.\n\nDuring my visit to Fort Simpson on December 20th, I was present at the closing exercises of the day school when a concert was put on by the pupils. Much credit is due to the teachers for the manner in which the pupils carried out their arts.\n\nW. H. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 26, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your report for the months of December and January, last, on the Port Simpson Indian Day School regarding the overcrowded condition of the junior classroom, I have to say that your recommendation that an extra teacher be obtained for this school during next winter has been noted. You should, in due time, draw this matter to the attention of the Department, giving full particulars as to the accommodation that could be provided for the extra classroom, the furnishings required, the approximate length of time the services of a teacher would be required and the salary you would recommend be paid. Particulars should also be given as to the number of children that would likely attend each of the classes in the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith requisition for school material for Port Simpson Indian Day School and shall be glad if you will kindly have the order filled in good time for the opening in September.\n\nReferring to Department's letter of Feb. 26th last, respecting the appointment of an extra teacher for the junior class-room, I beg to confirm my previous recommendation in the matter, and would suggest that an assistant teacher be engaged for the six months from October to March, at a salary of \u00a31000.00 per annum.\n\nDuring the quarter ended Dec. 1930, there were 68 pupils enrolled in the junior room, and in the March quarter 1930, 72 pupils. There are three grades in the junior division which is more than one teacher can manage with advantage. As there were 53 pupils enrolled during the last June quarter, it may be found necessary to engage the extra teacher for the whole school year, however, I think it will be better for the present to engage the teacher for the months above stated and if it is found advisable to extend the term of engagement when recommendation will be made to this effect as it may be difficult to obtain the services of a teacher for that period.\n\nI would suggest that this extra teacher take charge of Grade 1 which is composed of small children and is the largest class in the school, but no doubt this can be left to the discretion of the teachers.\n\nWith regard to the accommodation, I would state that there is a vacant class-room in the\nupstair part of the building which can be used for this purpose. Extra desks, stove etc. will be needed.\n\nFor the Department's information, a list of these requirements is enclosed.\n\nI shall be glad to hear as soon as possible so that the necessary arrangements to obtain the teacher can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 1, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th ultimo, relative to the appointment of an extra teacher for the junior classroom at the Port Simpson Indian Day School for the six months' period from October 1st to March 31, next.\n\nIn reply I regret that the Department has no funds available this present fiscal year to provide the salary and equipment required in fitting up an extra classroom. The present arrangements for carrying on the classroom work will have to be continued during the next school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, September 4th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nThe authorities of the United Church of Canada advise the Department that Miss Ruth Young, assistant teacher of the Port Simpson Indian Day School, has resigned and that the securing of a teacher to succeed her was placed in your hands. Please let the Department know, as soon as possible, the name of the teacher whom you have secured, also her qualifications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nSir-\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th inst. and in reply would state that Miss Gertrude Lawrence was appointed to take charge of the junior room of the Port Simpson Indian Day School, at a salary of $1000.00 per annum for ten teaching months, the appointment being subject to the Department's approval. Miss Lawrence is a capable teacher, having had previous experience in Indian schools, and holds second-class certificates for Ontario and Alberta.\n\nThrough an oversight, the Department was not advised of Miss Ruth Young's resignation, and I hope the new appointment will be satisfactory. Miss Lawrence commences her duties on September 15th.\n\nIt is regretted the Department is unable to authorize the appointment of another teacher for the second division of junior pupils. This class-room has been very much overcrowded and I am informed will be more so this winter.\n\nDuring the quarter ended March 31st, there were 101 pupils in the whole school, of these 72 belong to the junior room. From October 1929 to February 1930 the average daily attendance in the junior room was 45 which is more than one teacher can manage with satisfactory results.\n\nLast winter the teacher was obliged to take half the pupils alternately, mornings and afternoons. This arrangement brought several protests from the parents of the children, however, until\nanother teacher can be provided to assist during the heaviest part of the winter term nothing further can be done to relieve the present situation. I hope therefore, the Department will give this matter further consideration as it is most important that the Indian children should receive the full benefit of school teaching during the comparatively short time they are resident in the village.\n\nIt may interest the Department to know that at the recent Vancouver Exhibition, pupils of the Fort Simpson Indian Day School obtained 1st, 2nd and 3rd prizes for penmanship\u2014competing against all the other Indian schools in the Province. A number were also awarded prizes at the recent Prince Rupert Exhibition for general school work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWEC JJ\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 23, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, informing the Department that Miss Gertrude Lawrence has been appointed as teacher of the junior room at the Fort Simpson Indian Day School, and stating the qualifications and experience which she possesses.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that the Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Lawrence as assistant teacher, with salary at the rate of $100 per teaching month. It is noted that she began duties on the 15th instant. Please inform her of the approval granted for her appointment. The Department is informing the authorities of the United Church of Canada of the approval granted for the appointment of Miss Lawrence.\n\nAs you were advised in official letter of August 1st, last, the Department regrets that there are no funds available this fiscal year to provide the salary of a teacher and the equipment required in fitting up a third classroom.\n\nWe have noted with interest the success achieved by the pupils at the recent Vancouver and Prince Rupert exhibitions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nPort Simpson, B.C.,\nOct. 31st, 1930.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe books sent us have come together with the scribblers etc. We do wish to thank you just ever so much for the exchange of same \"Golden Steps.\" Another time we certainly shall endeavour to make matters more clearly.\n\nAlso the Janitor Cheque for the month of September did not arrive this mail even, and our expenses for work go right along. We trust it will come next mail now.\n\nAnother matter which I was going to ask you all last year\u2014Why was my salary so reduced when the teacher (Pini.) my predecessor, got $1150 per annum.\u2014Will there be yearly increase, as one stays? Kindly explain this, as recorded on the Fiscal Year Report of Mar. 1929.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nMary Gingrich.\n\nSchool continues most harmoniously\u2014thank you for co-operation all round.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6408, file 837-1, part 1)\nOttawa, November 13, 1930.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo. It is noted that the books, scribblers, etc., which you ordered were received.\n\nRelative to cheque for janitor's salary due you for the month of September, last, to the amount of $7, and also payment for the cleaning of the toilets by William Green to the amount of $5, I have to say that cheque No. 5130 for $12 in payment of these services was sent you on the 4th instant. It is hoped that this cheque has reached you before this date.\n\nRegarding the salary paid you as principal of the Port Simpson Indian Day School, I have to say that the United Church, under whose auspices this school is conducted, nominated you for the position as senior teacher, to begin duties September 1, 1929, at the rate of $95 per teaching month. The Department approved of your appointment, with salary at that rate. In December of the same year, the Church authorities requested that you be given an increase, and the Department approved of salary being paid you at the rate of $100 per teaching month from the 1st of January, 1930. I may say that the Department, in consultation with the Church authorities, agrees upon the salaries that will be paid the teachers of Indian schools conducted under the auspices of the United Church at the beginning of each school year, and last August when this question was being decided, no increase in salary was asked for by the Church authorities in your case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Mary Gingrich,\nPort Simpson, B.C.\nDecember 8th,\n1930.\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI have a letter from Miss Mary Gingrich of Port Simpson, asking if it will be possible to secure an increase in salary beginning with the last January. This I heartily recommend, as Miss Gingrich has been an unqualified success in her work at Port Simpson and she shows real initiative in her efforts for the advancement of the school.\n\nYou will remember that a year ago I made a request that her salary be increased and the Department kindly advanced it from $65.00 per teaching month to $100.00 per teaching month. If it is possible to accede to my request, I will leave the matter of the amount for your decision.\n\nI have been discussing with Miss Gingrich, who volunteered to go to Port Simpson for two years, the possibility of continuing longer in our work and I think it is very likely she will stay in British Columbia at least for another year after the close of the present school year.\n\nTrusting that I shall receive a favorable reply,\n\nI remain\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nArthur B. Burns\nOttawa, December 9, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Barner:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, regarding the request of Miss Mary Gingrich, senior teacher of the Port Simpson Indian Day School, for an increase in her salary.\n\nOur funds for the balance of the present fiscal year are entirely assigned and the earliest date from which an increase could be granted would be April 1, 1931. The Department will be pleased to allow Miss Gingrich an increase of $5 per teaching month from that date, making the total salary allowed her at the rate of $105 per teaching month. Mr. W. E. Collison, Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, is being informed accordingly and requested to notify Miss Gingrich of the increase allowed and the date from which it will commence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Arthur Barner,\nBoard of Home Missions,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, December 9, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department will allow Miss Mary Gingrich, senior teacher of the Port Simpson Indian Day School, an increase of $5 per teaching month in her salary from April 1, 1931. This will make the total salary allowed her from that date at the rate of $105 per teaching month. Our funds for the balance of the present fiscal year are entirely assigned, and it will not be possible to grant any increase until the date mentioned above. I shall be pleased if you will inform Miss Gingrich accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nPrince Rupert, B.C., Dec. 8th, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith, my daily journal and expense account and beg to report as follows for the months of October and November.\n\nMiss Lawrence, teacher of the junior room in the Port Simpson Day School has tendered her resignation as she finds the work too strenuous, there being 53 pupils in this room. I recommend the appointment of a second teacher, and I am afraid that unless one is appointed, it will be difficult to obtain the services of a suitable teacher.\n\nAt present I have, subject to the department's approval - engaged the services of Miss Ilma Beamish, who had previously applied for the post and has satisfactory qualifications.\n\nW. E. Collinson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 22, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your report of the 8th instant, transmitting your daily journal and expense account, in which you inform the Department of the resignation of Miss Gertrude Lawrence, teacher of the junior room in the Port Simpson Indian Day School, I have to say it is regretted that Miss Lawrence was not able to remain and complete the full academic year. It is noted that you have engaged the services of Miss Ilma Beamish for the balance of the present school year ending June 30th, next. The salary allowed her will be at the same rate as was paid Miss Lawrence, viz., $100 per teaching month. I have to request that you will state the date on which Miss Lawrence terminated her services and also the date on which Miss Beamish began duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Department's letter of Dec. 22nd last, I beg to state that Miss Ilma Beamish commenced her duties as teacher in the Junior classroom, Port Simpson Indian Day School, on Jan. 1st.\n\nThis is Miss Beamish's first school as she only recently completed her normal School course at Vancouver. She holds a second-class B.C. certificate and has other qualifications. Since her appointment I have had opportunities of observing her class-room work, she is capable and pains-taking and should make a successful teacher. Miss Gertrude Lawrence taught school until the end of the year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWEC, JJ\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nPrince Rupert, B.C., March 24, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report as follows for the month of February:\n\nWith regard to the Port Simpson Day School, I would again point out the need of a second teacher for the junior room. The present teacher, owing to the large number of pupils is unable to take them all at one time with the result that they have only half a day's schooling which is causing dissatisfaction with the Indian parents.\n\nW. E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 13, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Rev. Arthur Barner, dated the 9th instant, in further reference to the transfer of Miss M. Gingrich, at present senior teacher at Fort Simpson, as teacher of the Bella Bella Indian Day School for the coming school year and also regarding the salary that will be allowed.\n\nThe Department will be pleased to approve of the transfer of Miss Gingrich as teacher at Bella Bella and will allow her salary at the same rate as she has been receiving at Fort Simpson, viz.: $105 per teaching month.\n\nMr. Barner states that he is in correspondence with a young woman with splendid qualifications, who, he thinks, will accept the position at Fort Simpson at $95 per teaching month, and that there will therefore be no increase in the aggregate amount allowed for salaries owing to the transfer of Miss Gingrich.\n\nPlease inform Miss Gingrich of the approval granted for her transfer to Bella Bella and the salary that will be paid her. We are advising the local Indian Agent of the arrangements made for teaching services at Bella Bella for the next school year and the salary allowed and requesting him to give Miss Gingrich every assistance he can in her work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6408, file 837-1, part 1)\nVictoria, B.C., May 31, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to transmit herewith my travelling expense account and diary for the month of May.\n\nThe teacher of the junior class room, (Port Simpson), Miss Beamish, was being criticized by the local Missionaries who objected to her engaging in the organization of field sports amongst the half-breed people who live just outside the reserve while at the same time making no complaint as to her moral conduct and apparently manifesting no endeavour to do this kind of work themselves. The situation was discussed by Mr. Agent Collison and myself with Miss Beamish whose explanation seemed to us to be satisfactory. One of the sports affecting Miss Beamish was that she was seen in the school wood-shed in company with a half-breed named Begnon who had some time ago been ordered to keep away from the reserve. It was further alleged that one of the Nurses in training at Port Simpson Hospital was found to be pregnant as a result of familiarity with a half-breed Indian at Port Simpson. Seemingly these are the reasons for the opposition of the Missionaries to Miss Beamish and it seems probable that pressure will be exerted with a view to a change being made, although both Mr. Collison and I were impressed with the good intentions of this girl, who appeared keenly interested in clean sport and was anxious to exert her influence to this end in the community. Miss Beamish's work in the class-room is excellent and she has good discipline amongst the pupils.\n\nC. C. Perry.\nAsst.

Arthur Barnet, Superintendent of the Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada; the appointment was offered to Miss Ruth Young of Fort Simpson, subject to the Department's approval. Miss Young was formerly in charge of the junior classroom and gave every satisfaction.

He states that Miss Young was formerly in charge of this classroom and gave every satisfaction.

BOX 566\nVICTORIA, B.C.\n\nJuly 8, 1932.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of June 20th and in continuation of my 15/25462 of June 26th, I have the honor to make the following recommendations with regard to the appointment of teachers at Fort Simpson and Kitselas.\n\nAs teacher of the Senior Division at Port Simpson Indian Day School, I would recommend the appointment of Miss Ruth Levirs of 1412 Fernwood Avenue, Victoria.\n\nMiss Levirs is 21 years of age, was trained at the Victoria Normal School and holds a First Class (Interim) B.C. Teacher's Certificate. She has also had 2\u00bd years education at the Victoria College University of British Columbia. Miss Levirs is a regular attendant at the First United Church, Victoria, where she has taught in the Sunday School for the past six years. Her father, who was a member of the Military Foot Police, is dead, and her mother has only a small pension from the Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment Board. This girl is in my opinion very well qualified in every way for work in an Indian School. She is very fond of little children, and these little people love her and wish to help her whenever there is an opportunity to do so. The Reverend Mr. V. Sansum, Missionary at Port Simpson, particularly desires Miss Levirs' appointment in the school there. I have, of course, interviewed Miss Levirs, who is now taking Special Courses in Primary Work and Indian Work at the Provincial Summer School. I may add that Dr. Wilson, of the First United Church, has written to me strongly recommending the appointment of Miss Levirs in an Indian School.\n\nAs teacher in the Junior Division of the Port Simpson Indian Day School, I would recommend the appointment of Miss Florence L. Perry, 1558 Pembroke St., Victoria, who is 18 years of age and has just completed her professional training at the Victoria Normal School, as a result of which she is being granted a Second Class (Interim) Teacher's Certificate for British Columbia. Miss Perry is a member of the United Church of Canada, and attends the Belmont Street Church, where she has taken a very active part in the C.G.I.T. movement, and has taught for the past two years in the Sunday School.\n\nI have both interviewed Miss Perry and have inquired into her record while a student of the Normal School. I consider this girl's attitude towards her teaching work to be very good indeed. She is now taking Special Courses in Primary subjects and in the Indian Work at the Provincial Summer School for teachers. I have therefore an opportunity\n\nReverend A.

(RG 10, Volume 6408, file 837-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nof observing her work daily, and feel quite confident in recommending her appointment as teacher of the Junior Room at Fort Simpson.\n\nI may add that Miss Perry is the daughter of our Assistant Commissioner of Indian Affairs, has a number of friends in Fort Simpson, and is very highly recommended for the above appointment by the Reverend James Hood, of the Belmont Street United Church, Victoria.\n\nAs teacher of the Indian Day School at Kitselas the position left vacant through the death of Mr. MacKinnon, I would recommend the appointment of Mr. Percy H. Gladstone, 1080 Broughton St., Vancouver. Mr. Gladstone, as you know, is an Indian boy of 21 years of age, who has just completed his training at the Vancouver Normal School which entitles him to a Second Class (Interim) Teacher's Certificate for British Columbia, though this certificate may be changed to a First Class in September if Mr. Gladstone is successful in a supplementary examination which he hopes to write then.\n\nI have inquired very carefully into the record of this boy during the period while he was a student at Coqualeetza Residential School and the Provincial Normal School. As a result, I consider that Mr. Gladstone should be appointed on probation in the first instance. I shall be visiting the Kitselas Indian Day School during the latter part of September or early in October, and shall take extra care in inquiring into Mr. Gladstone's methods and success with the children of that village.\n\nIt may also be mentioned that Mr. Gladstone is highly recommended for appointment in an Indian School by Reverend G. H. Raley and officials of the United Church of Canada.\n\nMay I ask you to let me know at the earliest possible moment whether or no these recommendations are approved of by your Church. I am taking it for granted that you will make the necessary recommendations to the Department of Indian Affairs in Ottawa, and that these candidates will be informed of their appointments directly by the Department. A copy of this letter is attached, in order that you may forward it with a copy of your recommendations to the Department.\n\nI should be glad if you will acknowledge the receipt of this letter, as these candidates are holding themselves available to the above appointments and are not applying for any other vacant positions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H.

He is a first class man and opened my eyes as to what can be done with Indian children under a good teacher, and in my opinion, after hearing his methods in use, and what he expects the teacher to do, I think he will raise the standard of education in the Province very greatly amongst the Indians. He has two good teachers here. Unfortunately, he is not in the best of health, and should not try to rush things too quickly. He has a big task.\n\nG. S.

It is thought that the matter of engaging any new teachers that may be required for schools conducted under the auspices of the United Church in British Columbia is arranged by officials of the Church in that province. It might be well for them to consult Mr. G. H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, Victoria, before making a nomination.

In reply I beg to say that Inspector Barry is at present on an inspection trip to Port Simpson and the Nass River and will probably return to Victoria on or about June 12, instant, and your letter will be placed on his desk and called to his attention on his return.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nP/AC\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Appointment of Teacher to Senior Room, Fort Simpson.\n\nI have just arrived back in the office after six weeks in Western Canada and wish to thank you for your telegram addressed to me at Calgary and for your letter dated May 29th, approving the appointment of Miss Frances Patterson as Senior Teacher of the Port Simpson Day School. I am not satisfied, however, with the rate of salary which is allowed Miss Patterson. It seems strange that the Department should suggest the same salary for her, with her years of experience and her superior educational qualifications, as is being given to the Junior Teacher in the same school, who is under twenty years of age, has only a High School training, with Normal School certificate, and had no experience whatever when she went to Port Simpson. I sincerely hope that this rate may be revised so that Miss Patterson will be at least in receipt of $100.00 a month, less 10 per cent.\n\nI should like to remind you that Miss Patterson's initial salary at Island Lake was $100.00 a month, in a school which is considerably less important from the standpoint of the Department of Indian Affairs than the one at Port Simpson, which during the last three or four years has been a difficult problem for the Agent and the Church, and everybody concerned.\n\nHoping that this request may have favorable consideration in spite of the limited budget under which the Department is laboring this year,\n\nI am Yours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB.MLT\nOttawa, June 16th, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, with further reference to the appointment of Miss Frances Patterson as senior teacher of the Port Simpson Indian Day School.\n\nThe salary paid for the position of senior teacher at this school during the past year has been at the rate of $900, less 10%. Order-in-Council of June 14th, 1932, (extended by Order-in-Council of April 3rd, 1933) expressly provides that the salary rate of a position cannot be increased. Under these circumstances, I regret that it is only possible to allow Miss Patterson salary at the same rate as was paid the previous teacher, viz., $90 a teaching month, less 10%.\n\nI feel that you recognize the difficulties under which we are working at the present time and the Department trusts that Miss Patterson will accept the appointment as senior teacher at Port Simpson.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nSir;-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo concerning Miss Ruth Levirs, teacher of the senior class room in the Port Simpson Indian Day school and note that Miss Frances Patterson has been appointed to succeed her.\n\nWith regard to Miss Levirs I would state that she has had a nervous breakdown and was obliged to relinquish her school work on May 29th. She was advised by Dr. Perry to take complete rest and will not be leaving Port Simpson until the end of the present month. In view of the circumstances I would recommend that her salary be paid to the end of the present term, viz., June 30th.\n\nAs stated in my May report there are only a few children remaining in the village and Miss Perry, teacher of the Junior room was requested to take charge of the combined rooms until school closes for the summer vacation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Port Simpson Indian Day School,\nJunior Room.\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Home Missions, I wish to nominate as teacher of the Junior Room at Port Simpson Miss Ruby J.

Her father is one of our ministers and Secretary of the British Columbia Conference. In the summer of 1932, on a voluntary basis, she conducted vacation schools among the Indian children on Rivers Inlet.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you at the earliest possible date as to whether or not the Department approves this nomination and as to what salary will be allowed Miss Horton, if she is appointed.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J.

The location is by far the most suitable on the reserve, and has been endorsed by the village council.\n\nW.E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report as follows for the month of January.\n\nPORT SIMPSON DAY SCHOOL\n\nA complaint was made by Miss Leila M. Swartz, teacher of the junior division that there were too many pupils in her room. This matter has been taken up with Inspector Barry who has recommended amalgamation of some of the smaller classes for the time being. Miss Swartz has 75 pupils on her register with an average attendance of about 55, during the winter months.\n\nW.E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nDecember 23rd, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to report as follows for the month of November.\n\nThe teacher of the junior classroom of the Port Simpson day school reported a daily attendance of 52 pupils in her room and stated that she found it impossible to handle such a number satisfactorily. As this number of children is likely to be present until February, I would suggest that temporary assistance be engaged, and that the domestic science room be utilized to take care of the overflow. For this purpose, extra desks will have to be provided. For the present the half-day system is being carried out, but this is not satisfactory.\n\nW. E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 10, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is noted from your report for the month of November that there is a very large attendance at the junior class room at the Port Simpson Indian day school. No funds were provided for the engagement of a third teacher and your recommendation in this regard cannot be approved.\n\nProvision has been made in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1939-40 for the funds required to dismantle the old Port Simpson Indian day school and erect a new manual training unit out of the old but suitable material and such new lumber and other building materials that may be required. When this building is erected it is hoped to engage a vocational instructor for at least part of the year and as some of the children will be attending this class each day it should relieve the attendance in the regular class rooms.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

The teachers know this perfectly well and in fact I understand from other sources that this has been done.\n\nI consider that some 90 pupils can be taught in the two rooms and that the use of the Domestic Science classroom as a classroom for ordinary subjects should not be necessary. The Half Day System should only be used if the attendance is in excess of around 90 and even then only the very small children should be placed on the restricted school time.\n\nThere was seating for some 91 pupils when I last inspected at Port Simpson.

Barry is of the opinion that there is no need to use the Domestic Science classroom as a classroom for ordinary subjects.

Nothing was stolen. This is the third time that the teacher's quarters have been entered presumably by older boys of the school.\n\nI would again strongly recommend the appointment of a capable married man as teacher of the senior room who can handle the boys, and whose wife should be qualified to take charge of the junior classroom. Whilst the present lady teachers have given satisfactory service under conditions difficult at times, I am of the opinion that the senior class room should be under the supervision of a married teacher. In this arrangement, the same teacher's quarters would be utilized.\n\nW. D. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nThe Secretary:\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding the following report for the month of April.\n\nx x x\n\nThe day schools were all open and although quite a few of the people were away from the villages the attendance kept up fairly well.

Bunt, D.D.,\nSuperintendent of Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n411 Dominion Bank Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Bunt:\n\nOn my return to Vancouver this morning I found a letter from Mr. J. Gillett, Indian Agent at Prince Rupert, on my desk.\n\nMr. Gillett informs me that Miss Swartz, teacher of the junior class, at Fort Simpson Indian Day School, is in the Fort Simpson Hospital, suffering from a nervous breakdown. The probable duration of her stay in hospital is stated to be two weeks. This information was received by Mr. Gillett from Dr. Arnot of Fort Simpson.\n\nMrs. Colwell, a qualified teacher and of the United Church Missionary at Fort Simpson is in charge of Miss Swartz's class, I understand, but do not wish to continue this work for longer than one month.\n\nI do not know of any available substitute teachers in Vancouver at the present time, and would suggest that you discuss the situation with Mr. Gillett when you visit Prince Rupert about the 4th of February.\n\nI do not know just how ill Miss Swartz will be, but I much doubt that she will be able to take care of her large Primary Class, even if this were done under the half day system, for some time to come.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, is away for a day or two, but I am certain that he would be glad to have from you the name of a well qualified teacher to take the place of Miss Swartz till the latter is well enough to resume her duties at Fort Simpson.\n\nWe should be glad to hear from you at the earliest possible moment, as your nomination will be forwarded to the Department in Ottawa. Meanwhile, the Department is being informed of Miss Swartz's condition.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nInspector\n\nIndian Affairs.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am forwarding herewith a letter received from Mr. Gillett, Indian Agent at Prince Rupert, with regard to the illness of Miss Swartz.\n\nMiss Swartz is teacher of the Primary Class at the Port Simpson Indian Day School, Skeena River Agency. She has a very large number of little children in her room, particularly during two or three winter months. The regular inspection of this particular school will be made when I am inspecting coast schools immediately after Easter.\n\nThe Indians of Port Simpson wish for a man as teacher of the Senior Class in the Indian Day School. Miss How is at the moment in charge of that class, as Miss Swartz may be ill for some time, and is in any case quite unlikely to return to the school next September; it may become necessary to make several changes. Any necessary recommendations will of course be made after my next inspection.\n\nI do not consider that Mrs. Colwell, who taught certain days in the week at Cape Mudge Indian Day School a few years ago, is equal to the work at Port Simpson, and it is not likely that she would wish to substitute for very long there.\n\nAs you will see from my letter to the Superintendent of United Church Missions, a copy of which is attached, I have suggested that a qualified teacher be nominated to act as substitute till Miss Swartz is well enough to resume her duties at Port Simpson.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter dated January 23rd, addressed to Mr. Inspector Barry, by Mr. Indian Agent Gillett, of the Skeena River Agency, advising him that Miss L. Swartz, teacher of the Junior Room at Port Simpson Indian Day School, is suffering from an illness which is expected to be of at least two weeks' duration, and that temporarily Mrs. Colwell, wife of the United Church Missionary, at that point, is acting as substitute teacher.\n\nI am also attaching copy of Mr. Inspector Barry's report and copy of his letter addressed to the Superintendent of Missions, of the United Church of Canada, requesting nomination of a substitute until Miss Swartz has recovered sufficiently to resume her duties, and, if such a nomination is received, I will advise you further. In the meantime, there seems to be no alternative but to permit Mrs. Colwell to continue as at present.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Mrs. Colewell has now agreed to continue as teacher until the end of June.\n\nKindly advise the number of days sick leave allowed to a teacher.

Mr. Bunt became ill on January 26th and has not taught school since. Rev. Colewell substituted for him at his request for two weeks to February 6th.\"\n\nWith regard to the above quoted paragraph it is understood by Inspector Barry and myself, that the number of days sick leave allowed to a teacher would obviously vary in each particular case.\n\nFrom Mr. Gillett's statement it would appear that Mr. Bunt made some private arrangement with Reverend T.

This was followed by an attack of Septic Sore Throat and Broncho-pneumonia. Following a prolonged recovery he is much improved but not by any means in robust health.

I do, however, want to say, as I told you in Ottawa, that it is most difficult for the teachers to carry on when they have not only to teach the school and do all the work incidental thereto, but also to be responsible for attendance. I know perfectly well that legally they are not supposed to bother whether there is any attendance or not, but, unless they go to a great deal of trouble and have some concern about it, the attendance falls off. I wonder whether Mr. Gillett might be able to bring some pressure to bear on these people to send their children to school regularly. I presume he lives in Prince Rupert. I know of no man in the agency service who is more anxious to see progress made in education than Mr. Gillett, and consequently you will understand that, whilst I am asking that it be suggested that he bring some pressure to bear, it is by no means a criticism of his work in the past.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have compared the average attendance for September 1937, 38 and 39 with those of June 1937 to 42 inclusive, and in every case the September average is much higher than that of June. Apart from this the school never continues in session until the end of June, whereas in September the school would be open the full number of teaching days.

No teacher has been yet appointed for the Crosby Girls' Home but Rev. Wilding is substituting for the time being. The average attendance for the month of all the schools was low due to the families being away from the village at places of industry.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the\n18th instant regarding conditions at the Port Essington Indian\nDay School as reported by Provincial Inspector, Mr. B.\nThorsteinsson, I would advise that this was taken up with\nMr. Indian Agent Gillett and I enclose his reply of the 24th\ninstant herewith.\n\nMr. Gillett has already been informed that\nduring the shortage of teachers it will be necessary to give\npreference to those schools where the average rate of attendance\nwarrants consideration as against those schools where the\nattendance is very low or irregular.\n\nD.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nJune 24th, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. McKay, Indian Commissioner of B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI acknowledge receipt of the Commissioner's letter 215-8-4974 with the copy of the school inspector's report.\n\nThe reason for only three pupils being present on the day of the inspector's visit was that the children had gone with their mothers to gather sea-weed. Mrs. Fogson, the teacher, stated that they were likely to be away for three or four days.\n\nThe attendance at this school had never been satisfactory. I brought this matter to the attention of the parents at a public meeting in January. It appears that the people of the village take their children with them to the logging-camps and other places of industry. The number that should attend at this school is twenty-four. Averages for the various months have been as follows:\n\n| Month     | Average |\n|-----------|---------|\n| October   | 7.5     |\n| November  | 18.17   |\n| December  | 20.06   |\n| January   | 10.57   |\n| February  | 10.87   |\n| March     | 9.06    |\n| April     | 13.18   |\n| May       | 7.4     |\n| June      | not yet received |\n\nThe children attend regularly, however, when they are in the village.\n\nWith reference to the school walls and ceiling, I doubt if cleaning alone would improve the situation. I would recommend that they be painted. I will ascertain the approximate cost and report later.\n\nJ.
