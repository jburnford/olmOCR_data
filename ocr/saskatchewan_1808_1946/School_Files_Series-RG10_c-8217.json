Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nA few weeks ago I wrote to our agent about the drain from the kitchen sink which does not work. In past years this drain has had to be repaired several times a year. As he has not answered, I took upon myself to have men repair it before the frost. There is a great deal more work than I thought; as in digging it was found that the drain is higher a few feet from the house than near it.\nAt this point they struck rock when the drain was first laid; we concluded that it was better to raise the end near the house than to lower the other, though it was necessary to pierce the cellar wall in doing so. The work is not yet finished.\n\nI trust you will favour this repair which should be permanent.\n\nThe furnace smoked very badly. Even after a thorough cleaning and some repairs it doesn't give satisfaction.\n\nThere has been question of installing a bath which has been held for years. I believe it would be quite simple so far as the drain pipe is concerned; of course a force pump to put the water upstairs would be better.\n\nHoping for a favourable reply at your earliest convenience,\n\nYours respectfully,\nJulia Grody.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report that Miss Julia Goody has made requisition to this office for the following articles of groceries to enable her to serve the pupils in attendance at Shegwaning Indian School with hot lunch during the incoming winter months;\n\n10 pounds peas 1 case canned tomatoes\n15 \" beans 1 \" salt milk\n5 \" rice 1 bag salt\n25 \" sugar 1 box assorted biscuits\n25 \" flour 1 can baking powder\n15 \" salt pork\n\nThe total cost of the above articles should not exceed the sum of $29.00, and I would recommend that all these articles be supplied in order that the pupils may have a hot lunch at midday during the winter months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa,\nOctober 18, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant you may expend an amount not exceeding $20.00 in the purchase of supplies required to serve a midday meal at the Sheshagwaning Indian Day School during the coming winter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nR.

In an off-hand manner, he instructed her to go ahead and have the roof and fence repaired, but he claims no authority was given for painting the kitchen and cleaning up the school grounds. Miss Strain went ahead, ordered the paint and other materials from R. T. Jaffrey, Gore Bay, by telephone, and employed three Indians to do the work. Miss Strain kept the men's time and submitted the time sheet to Wm. H. Prestage, General Merchant, Silver Water, who advanced the Indians supplies to the amount earned and took a receipt from them.\n\nWhether or not the expenditure was excessive for the amount of work done, I cannot say; owing to snow blocked roads, it was impossible to get through to Sheshgwaning. Apparently Mr. Lewis was very careless in his instructions and Miss Strain took the cue and had all the work done she thought necessary.\n\nIt should be noted no preferred list has been supplied to the Agent for purchases in the Gore Bay district. The merchants concerned supplied the material on the strength of Miss Strain's order as an employee of this Branch, without knowledge of any irregularity. Even though the expenditure might be considered excessive, the fault obviously does not lie with them.\n\nIn view of the fact there were no instructions or preferred list given the Agent from whom to make purchases, and that most of the money went to the Indians for work, I think the accounts should be paid.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nOntario Inspectorate.\nOttawa, April 21st, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nWELFARE & TRAINING DIVISION\n\nRe Repairs Sheshgwaning Indian Day School.\n\nFormer Agent Lewis explains the unauthorized expenditure was made under the following circumstances:\n\nOn a visit to the school, Miss Strain drew his attention to the need for repairs to the roof, front fence and painting the kitchen.

The work consisted of fixing drain, emptying cistern and putting in new sewer pipes. A hole had to be pierced in the stone wall and a cement block made to raise tile in cellar in order to ensure proper drainage.\n\nThe drain had been in an unsatisfactory condition for some time, the tiles being tilted in the wrong direction and one end of them was entirely plugged with sediment.\n\nMiss Goody had this work done without special authorization, but as fall and winter was approaching, she proceeded to have the work done before the bad weather set in. The work has been satisfactorily completed. She has been out of her money for some time, and she really has no right to lose it. Therefore, I would recommend this account be paid without further delay.\n\nYou will find attached to the account, a statement of her account, receipts for monies paid out, a statement of days dates and hours on which work was performed, also, a personal explanatory letter from Miss Goody.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nCRJ / JH\nOttawa,\nJune 13, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo the Department finds it necessary to return the account which you have submitted in favour of Miss Julia Goody, teacher in charge of the Sheshegwaning R.C. school.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter the Department is prepared to pay the account but you should definitely inform Miss Goody, as well as all other teachers in your Agency, that in future unauthorized expenditures will not be recognized by the Department.\n\nI find it necessary, however, to return the account which you submitted as the statement shows that an amount of $3.38 earned by Leonard Wright was given to his father John Wright.

The teacher informs me, it smokes very bad at times, and was condemned two or three years ago. If funds are available at all, I think it would be advisable to install a new furnace rather than waste any more money trying to patch the old one, and possibly there is danger of fire. I think I should at least have it examined by an experienced man.\n\nThe Class room and kitchen walls and ceiling are badly in need of paint, which would cost around $50.00 for material and labour. The wood work is also getting bad, but could stand over another year.\n\nThe hall and upstairs rooms, should have marseco applied, which will cost about $15.00 for material and labour.\n\nThis teacher dispenses quite a lot of drugs and medicines to the Indians, as the doctor is so far away and would like a small cabinet made for keeping this material, as she hasn't any suitable place at present to store it. I think this could be obtained for about $10.00.\n\nThere is a bath tub in the school, which cannot be made much use of at present and I would suggest providing a drain pipe to connect with the drain from kitchen sink. The teacher would not mind carrying the water upstairs but is very difficult to get the water out. The cost of a drain pipe would be very small.\n\nShe also needs a new rope for flag pole; and there is eighteen storm windows and a few others that need putty, which will cost about $2.00 altogether.\n\nAs the cost of this work will not be great and will brighten up the school room, I would recommend the work be carried out. Nearly all this work can be done by Indian labour.\n\nOn my recent visit to Sheshawanning, I found the school pump out of commission and as there is no other water convenient, I engaged some Indians to pull the pump out to determine the trouble. I brought the worn and broken parts with me and had the necessary repairs made, which cost $1.50 for three feet of rod and coupling, plunger, valve leather and base for pump. The Indian labour for removing and replacing pump will amount to about $1.00. Will you please authorize payment of this as it was an emergency case.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6165, file 432-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th of June the following expenditures may be incurred in connection with the Sheshegwaning Indian day school:\n\n1. Paint class room, kitchen walls and ceiling at a cost of $35.00 for material and labour.\n\n2. Muresco hall and upstairs rooms at a cost of $15.00 for material and labour.\n\n3. Install drain pipe for bath tub. It is noted that this can be done at a small cost.\n\n4. Purchase new rope for flag pole, also putty the storm windows at a cost of $5.00.\n\n5. Repair pump for well at a cost of $9.50 for material and labour.\n\nIt is understood that Indian labour will be engaged for any work that is required.\n\nYou may arrange to have someone examine the furnace but as our funds are limited it is very unlikely that we will be able to favourable consider the installation of a new furnace this year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC.

School. The Department cannot understand why you have delayed answering official letter of July 20.\n\nIt is difficult to understand the second paragraph of your letter. It has taken you so long to answer our previous communication that you should have had time to visit the former Sheshegwaning C.E. School and ascertain definitely the condition of the furnace and the building itself. If the former C.E. School is in such condition that it cannot be used possibly it would be desirable to arrange for its demolition and allow those working to take the material for repairs to their own residences. Please let me have your recommendation in this regard.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. C. R. Johnston,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nSpanish, Ont.,\nSeptember 14, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nWhile at Sheshegwaning recently, the Chief told me you were considering using the Anglican school this year.\n\nIn your interests, the children's and ours I thought you might like to know a few facts.\n\nOver a year ago I was told that the furnace at the Anglican school smokes very badly and I believe repairs to the building would be necessary.\n\nAt the Catholic school there is a good supply of wood, about half of which is in the shed. The cost of transportation of the wood alone, not considering supplies etc., would be considerable. The walls and ceilings of the entire building were painted or murescod last year. If the place were left vacant for a winter I think the murescod and possible the paint would chip off.\n\nAs to the pupils, only three out of twenty-three live in that direction. All the others would have an extra half mile or more, part of which drifts badly. Of course attendance would be affected.\n\nAs to our interests, we always put in a large garden, more to encourage gardening than for the produce; moving would complicate matters for the garden both this fall and next spring.\n\nI hope this information will be of use to you.\n\nYours very truly\n\nJulia Godby\nTeacher at Sheshegwaning\n\nMr. P. Phelan,\nChief Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa\nOttawa,\nSeptember 20, 1940.\n\nDear Miss Goody:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant with reference to the proposal to use the Sheshegwaning C.E. School.\n\nNo definite decision has yet been made in this regard but we are still corresponding with the Agent. Our reason for suggesting this was due to the fact that apparently rather extensive improvements are required at the Sheshegwaning R.C. School and our funds are so limited that it is difficult to provide what is required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss Julia Goody,\nSpanish, Ont.\nManitowaning, Ontario.\n\nSeptember 20, 1940\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter No.12-3-5 dated September 17th, 1940, regarding the furnace and heating system of the Sheshegwaning R. C. School, I beg to reply, the first trip I made to Sheshegwaning to investigate the condition of the schools, I could not get into either one. Miss Goody, the former teacher, had taken the keys with her, for the R. C. School; and the Indian, who is reported to have the key for the C. E. School, was away also, but I could see from the outside, that it would take considerable to put in decent shape, and I was informed, the furnace in it is within four years of being as old as the other one, and was not giving good service when last used, however, it is too good a building to have demolished.\n\nI then had to write to Miss Goody to send me the keys for the R. C. School, before I could get an estimate on the repairs there.\n\nI estimated the C. E. School would possibly need a new furnace besides the other repairs; and that the R. C. School would need only a furnace, but when Mr. Bond, who is an experienced man, advised me, the old one, could be repaired to give several years service, that seemed to me, the logical and most economical thing to do, so I did not think it necessary to have him examine the furnace in the C. E. School.\n\nThis Reserve is about eighty five miles from Manitowaning, and with the extra work that has been thrust upon me this season, with the alterations in pay-lists, building of hospital, Registering of Indians etc., I just simply cannot keep right up to date on it.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCRJ / JH\nOttawa,\nSeptember 26, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant with further reference to repairing the furnace and heating system at the Sheshegwaning R.C. School. You may incur an expenditure not exceeding $126.30 for this purpose.\n\nThe teacher of the Sheshegwaning R.C. School should be informed that the key should not be taken home with her when she leaves for summer holidays. You should designate some reliable person on the Reserve with whom the key should be left.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. C. R.

This will cost from $18.00 to $20.00, and I would like to get authority to have the repairs made by October 1st.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nORJ / JH\nOttawa, Sept. 9, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant and to state that you are authorized to undertake the repairs necessary to the pump at the Sheshegwaning Indian Day School.

GREENING'S REPORT.\non the above school, dated May 17th, 1946.\n\n\"As I have always held that, in Indian Schools especially, a teacher's ability can be most accurately estimated by the attendance, (although this will now be affected by the Family Allowances), the attendance as shown above is just what I would expect.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that there are fifteen double desks and three single desks, providing seats, of sorts, for some twenty-six pupils. Two pupils are sitting on chairs which must be carried in and out of the residence. Double desks are most unsatisfactory for any school. For Indian pupils they are doubly unsatisfactory.\n\nAs previously remarked, the children attending this school speak English at home as little as the children at any school I visit! Somewho of them are fairly familiar with English and might perhaps be lead to an interest in reading if books sufficiently simple in language, could be supplied. The books available at Sheshewaning are not such as to lead these children to develop any great love of reading.\"\nOttawa, June 7th, 1946.\n\nMr. C. R. Johnston, Indian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ontario.\n\nIn a recent report from Inspector Greening, regarding his report on the Sheshegwaning Indian School, he writes as follows:\n\n\"In this connection it is noted that there are fifteen double desks and three single desks, providing seats, of sorts, for some twenty-six pupils. Two pupils are sitting on chairs which must be carried in and out of the residence. Double desks are most unsatisfactory for any school. For Indian pupils they are doubly unsatisfactory.\"\n\nIf there is sufficient room in the school for single desks, we are prepared to supply them. Desks are made in three sizes namely, large, medium and small, and you should let me know the number of each size that would be needed to provide seating accommodation for pupils who will be in attendance during the academic year 1946-47.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n## RETURN OF LABOUR on the R.

Several alterations have been made in the system of piping and registers and since the last alterations about four years ago, I had not had any complaints, however, it would be impossible to have any repairs or alterations made at this time of year and I would recommend the oil stoves be supplied as requested.\n\nA requisition is enclosed herewith quoting the prices Miss O'Driscoll has taken from Eaton's Catalogue.\n\nIf the Department can procure them more quickly or at lower cost elsewhere, I would suggest doing so.\n\nC.

Johnston,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, October 10, 1947.\n\nMr. C.R. Johnston, Indian Agent, Manitowaning, Ont.,\n\nWe have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to your voucher No. 47-356 for $21.51 in favour of T. Eaton Company, Toronto.\n\nOur records show that cheque No. 11144 was sent to the T. Eaton Company on April 6, 1947.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/HH.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI wish to refer to departmental letter No. 12-3-5 (WT 1) dated August 14th, 1947 with regard to requisition for Sheshegwaning School.\n\nThe school desks were recommended by the Inspector, I understand, as the desks in use are nearly all double. I would suggest ten each of small, medium and large sizes.\n\nRegarding the bed, I wish to advise the beds in use at Sheshegwaning School are an old type of Hospital bed supplied after the first great war. The present teacher does not object so much to the bed being so high if she could be furnished a new mattress for it. The teacher last year objected to the great height and used some sort of improvised bed.\n\nRegarding the extension ladder, I consider this a necessity. Sheshegwaning School is very high and if we were to get a home-made ladder long enough to reach the eave, it would be so cumbersome to handle.\n\nAt present there is no ladder at all and in case of fire, there is only the one exit from upper floor. I would therefore strongly recommend a ladder of some kind be provided.\n\nThe teacher has also requested a barrel of oil for use in the oil burners purchased last year.\n\nC. R.

School\nDear Kind Mr. MacLean,\n\nI am coming once more to annoy you with a little difficulty. I know you have too much of that kind of complaint, and I hate to act a fault-finder, but I think the matter deserves to be referred to your proverbial spirit of justice. I was begged to send this communication by twelve of the Indians of Sheshegwaning. It is about the location of the new school-house there.\n\nLast Tuesday, Mr. M.R. Thorburn, son of Mr. R. Thorburn the Agent, begged me to accompany him to Sheshegwaning, in order to help him locating the new school. I yielded hesitatingly to his request for I knew the Sheshegwaning Indians were very bitter on that question. Mrs. Clarke, the contractor and myself chose a spot near the village, having all requirements for drainage, digging and gardening, and especially very suitable to the Sisters, because it is the most central place. As the enclosed diagram exactly shows, the Sheshegwaning settlement is so arranged that...\nthat the village is situated almost exactly in the centre, and has on each side, to north and to south, a road leading to a group of farmers. The northern group of farmers is somewhat further and more numerous than the southern one.\n\nUpon hearing that the school was to be near the village, the chief John Nigaminina, David Lawson, John Binesinwabe, Mathieu Lawson and Paul Okeda, who form the northern group of farmers, all became indignant and proclaimed emphatically that the school would be built in the centre of the northern group of farmers, at the very extremity of the settlement. The chief threw all the blame on me, although I had only given my advice upon the persistent request of Mr. Thorburn, and abused me in language. Seeing that, Mr. Thorburn convened a meeting, to which the chief called only his friends, the farmers of the northern group, leaving aside the men of the village and the farmers of the southern group. The meeting was very noisy and bitter. The chief did not want to listen to any reason nor compromise\u2014I have indicated on the paradigm, the spot chosen by village people.\nand the southern farmers, who form majority 14,\nand the spot most bitterly advocated by the\nnorthern group, who are only 11.\nIt seems to me unjust to locate the school at\nthe extremity of the settlement. The selfish farmers\nof the northern group pretend that they have more children\nat school than the others. This is not exact for they\nhave only nine children of school age, whilst the village\nand southern people have twelve.\nThe chief proclaims every day his real hatred for the\nSisters. He knows these Sisters are not willing to go\nat the extremity of the settlement, and the hope that they\nwill not teach any more excites him to place the\nschool near his house, at the northern end.\nThe Sisters would at last make the sacrifice of going\nat the northern extremity rather than stop teaching\nbut it would be cruel to locate them so far\nfrom the village and the church. Sheshogaming\nis the most lonely village on Manitoulin.\nBefore our Sisters took the school, there, the lay\nteachers never remained more than five or six\nmonths. They could not stand it; and teachers were\nreplaced and changed twice or three times a year.\n\nApart from the real fact that the village is almost in the centre, the importance that our Sisters place in being located near the village should be a decisive reason to locate the school near the village.\n\nThe village will always have its importance. There, the Indians are more numerous than in any other group; they have their church, their boats, the post-office and soon a telephone office; it is the intellectual centre and naturally calls for the school in its neighborhood.\n\nThe village comprises seventeen habitations besides the school and the church; the northern group of farmers comprises only ten. It is natural that our Sisters insist on being located in the village than in the bush near a smaller group of farmers where life will be painfully tedious.\n\nIn fine, the strongest argument perhaps to place the school at least in the neighborhood of the village is the precedent of all other Indian settlements, where the school is in the village; such as Sagamok, White-Fish Lake, Wet-Bay (where some children are two and a half miles from school) South-Bay, Wikwemikong, Wikwemikong, Garden River, etc.\nThe magnificent school you have the generosity of building in Sheshegwaning will last many generations. It would be very sad to mislocate it, to satisfy the unreasonable caprice of a few hot heads.\n\nI begged Mr. Thorburn to take a firm stand in the question and impose his veto. But he does not, being intimidated by the troublesome chief John Nigamivina, who is almost entirely the cause of this quarrel, and who being essentially a bitter naughty critic will always cause disturbance as long as he is chief.\n\nAs I have been requested to take part in the decision, I beg to suggest my humble opinion in this semi-official report: namely the absolute removal of John Nigamivina from every office and the nomination of quiet Mr. Francis Jameson as his successor. John Nigamivina being an apostate from our Church, and practicing no religion at all, will never give peace to the catholic school of the catholic settlement of Sheshegwaning. I may truly say that he is not the man of the majority, because quite a few of his opponents were not in the village at the time of his election. \u2014 I always try to be as mild as possible with the Indians and they appreciate me as such.\nTHE OCEAN HOUSE\nR.

Papineau, S.J.\nManitowaning,\nManitoulin\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nTo The Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sirs:\u2014I have just been informed that the work on the Shiochigwaring school is to be begun very shortly; and in such a locality that I feel it is my duty to write you to protest against it.\n\nLast winter when the Agent came to the Reserve to have the Indians vote for money to build the school, I, suspecting that he was secretly agreeing with the farmers at the northern end to locate the school in their midst, spoke to him about it twice, but he did not seem to want me to say anything; he only smiled and answered that all would be satisfactory. He has now yielded to the stubborn chief and the few who live in the northern part of the Reserve to the great injustice of the village people and the farmers who live in the opposite direction. I do not know what these will do, they certainly should hold up their right to have the school in a more central locality. As for me, I shall not go there to teach, and I cannot recommend the place to any teacher.\n\nWhen the chief is a quiet, agreeable man who will listen to reasoning, one can overlook many defects and suffer the difficulties of being in an out of the way place and of living with people who appreciate so little.\nwhat is done for them. But John Maclean is a most contrary and ignorant man. He does not always work openly, but none the less perseveringly against everything that is right. I feel certain that he succeeded in bringing those who live in his direction to side with him, only by presenting to them the pleasing prospect of having the school near them. He also has on his side men who have no children and who are opposed to the expense of building a new school.\n\nThey blame me for lessening their annuities by asking for a new school. But it was Mr. Thorburn who asked for it; since 1803 when he was appointed to the office of Agent, he often spoke to me about a new building. I would rather stay where I am in the old school than to have so much trouble.\n\nGod only knows what I have had to bear these nine years that I have been teaching there; but I am willing to continue for His sake, still longer, if a little condescension is shown. I fully appreciate the extreme kindness of the Department in changing the first plans of the new school, so as to make it more comfortable for us, but I cannot go and live so far from the church. It would be a useless expense to build according to the present plans which are adapted to our needs and which perhaps would not suit others. I trust, however, that you will give due consideration to this important question and decide justly for all parties, and let me know your decision, that I may act accordingly.\nIn reply to your inquiring into the nature of the annoyances of the chief, I beg to say that he always finds fault with all that do in and out of schools says the school is no good and sets, as examples, the children whose names have been enrolled for some years, but who seldom attended school, his own children being about the worst. I gave you in my last report, the number of days of attendance of two of them. I can send you, if you wish, when I return to Shi\u2014 the exact number of days of attendance of the four I have had at different times. There are others almost as bad.\n\nOn May 6th the Agent paid the annuities in the class rooms; the chief sent for me and publicly reproved me and dictated tome what he wanted me to do. It was principally about obliging the children to talk English among themselves. This has always been my aim, but when children never hear a word of English at home, it is rather difficult, however, some do very well but those are not taken notice of. There is no comparison between those children and those who have been at an industrial and boarding school, where nothing but English is spoken, for they are never out of school and are constantly with the teachers.\n\nI regret the school Inspector did not come in the spring, I had many things to lay before him. I could give you more instances of annoyance but this will suffice to give you an idea of the chief; he is not so prompt in doing the work.\naround the school as he is in finding fault.\nYou may judge, too, from this what respect\nthe children of such parents can have for\na teacher; what must be their docility and\nobedience, especially in talking English.\nAn early reply will greatly oblige me,\nYours most sincerely,\nAd\u00e8le Ducharme.\nOttawa, August 11, 1911.\n\nR.

This appears quite reasonable to the Department and in view of this fact the above telegram has been sent you.\n\nIn regard to this matter it would appear that there has been considerable friction between the factions in the village as to the location of the school and this is a matter that should have been taken up by you with the Department in order that there might be no delay or trouble when the question of building was finally decided upon. The location of a building of this kind is of supreme importance.\n\nIt is to be hoped that the erection of the building will\n\nR.

It was thought the site had been decided on and arrangements made accordingly for the material and delivery. The Indians are of the opinion that the Village is not central and that the village site imposes on the whole farming section to travel the whole distance and the village no distance as per plan.\n\nThe distance of site from the Village is about 500 or 600 yards and has good drainage; good level ground, suitable for gardening and will meet with the approval of all the Indians. The site chosen by the chief was quite a distance further out the main road towards the farming section.\n\nThe Indians claim that they are nearly all living on their farms or will be in a short time and that the farmers have 44 children of school age and under and the village and vicinity is only; many of the families there having no children being too old and that the village site is not suitable in any way.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

From this it would appear that you as the representative of the Department were not consulted although you should have been the one most familiar with the requirements.\n\nA large sum is being expended on a building to accommodate the teacher and her companion who you say may not approve of the site. The folly of erecting a building specially for parties who may not inhabit it when completed must appeal to you.

This agency was requested to notify the Department when work was started. This was done in letter No. 14. Telegram from Chief regarding telegram No. 14 there could be no answer until the Chiefs Council were consulted. If they had changed their mind as they apparently were willing to do from instructions received in telegram No. 14, further action would be taken immediately until the Indians started work. You were immediately notified on my arrival by Chief that the change would not be allowed so far as the collection of the land is concerned. The Indians further indicated that it would be better to wait a few days before making any definite selection so that the Indians might be consulted this was done in telegram No. 14 in view of their cooperation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\nThe date is August 28th\n\nOttawa\n\n[Handwritten note]\nPoor Copy\nTo the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nI have just arrived here and find that in spite of my remonstrations the school is being built far away from the village about one mile from the church. I hasten to protest again and to tell you that I will not go there to teach there, and that it is useless to build according to those plans, as no doubt they\nwould not suit other teachers.\n\nI do not wish to infer that the Department is not at liberty to build any place, but I am free to accept or not. I heartily thank the Department for the great kindness shown me in changing plans to suit me and am sorry that I cannot make use of the building. I intend to write again before long.\n\nMost sincerely and gratefully yours,\n\nAd\u00e8le Dubamel.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing for your further information the text of interview with teacher and that of the chief and council and band explaining their views on the matter.\n\nI wish it to be clearly understood that as yet I have made no representations either for or against either site simply place the matter before the Department with any explanations deemed necessary but I must state that I labored under a misapprehension if any one other than the chief and council have the control of the affairs of the Indians and can make representations to the Department which will be entertained before the resolutions of the chief and council and band and certain their administration of the details of their own affairs as a band.\n\nThe chief and council as previously intimated had selected a site for the school on which they had spent considerable in preparing the ground and getting material. The architect and overseer started me going to the Reserve. I drove down the secured a tug to take up the tools and appliances necessary and the Department was immediately satisfied work was started and the foundation excavated and a portion of\nSir,\n\nThe wall built by Mr. Clark's estate he would be ready to start concreteing on Wednesday and could have the roof on by about the first of October with all the Indian labor he could handle.\n\nThe site selected by teacher is covered with a heavy growth of underwood and will cost to clear the ground necessary for the requirements of the school to remove the stumps and take off the stone and drain approximately 200' to excavate the foundation place 6' to 7' with a drainage drop of slightly over 4 feet which did not in Mr. Clark's opinion meet with the requirements of the Department.\n\nIn the mean time work is suspended. The Indians employed refuse to work on the new site and Mr. Clark's estate he does not think he can get sufficient help to complete the structure this fall on that site.\n\nPractically all the material is ordered. One load of cement is here half of it delivered at the reserve and all the hardware, flooring, frames etc., have been ordered and made awaiting your further instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

She stated that the site chosen by the Indians would be too far for her to walk to church 2 days when the missionary visited the band once a month or so.\n\nThe chief and council and band were called, and the council were unable to find any Indians who are opposed to the present site on which construction is stopped.\n\nThe band in council reaffirm their former resolutions and telegram, and request the agency to notify the Department that there is a misapprehension of their request and vote for construction of the school.\n\nThe building was intended to be erected in the interests of the band, for the better accommodation of the school children, and to centralise the site so as to equalise the distances of travel, which they were instructed to do in choosing a central site.\n\nThey further state that they are doing all they possibly can to make the teacher comfortable, but that they were not aware that the band and council and the agency and Department of Indian Affairs...\nSir,\n\nWe are to receive their instructions from the teacher as to what is in the best interests of the band regarding the selection of the site or other matters and that pending the time necessary to communicate with the department all work is to cease and if it is insisted that the school be erected on village site no construction to be proceeded with for the reason that the Indians find that they are forced to either move on to their farming lands and choose agricultural pursuits or be forced to go from place to place outside of the reserve to the mills and other occupations to obtain a livelihood and that they take their families with them and during that time return no school training.\n\nThey claim that they wish as far as possible to locate on the farm lands and follow agricultural pursuits and that the village is being rapidly depleted in this way and that the erection of the school at the new corner of the settled portion of the reserve will impose on the whole farming section an injustice for all time to come.\n\nThere has been some objection on the other hand that the school and church would be too far apart this can be easily remedied. The visiting missionary intends changing the site of the present church and it could then be placed where it would suit.\nSir,\n\nbest the convenience of those who are now objecting to the Indian Act.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary, Dept. Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa\nNorthwanganing, Ont., Sept. 3, 1911\n\nTo The Dept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sirs:\u2014Last Wednesday on my arrival here, I wrote you very hastily, to tell you that in spite of your telegram to the Agent, the school was being built at a distance of nearly a mile from the village. I had not intended to annoy you again about this question, but by what I hear from the people and from Mr. Thomson's own words, I see\nthat you have been misinformed\nand deem it my duty to tell you\nso. I will mention and refute\ntwo facts: \"Mr. Thorburn told\nme that the Indians are unan-\nimous in wanting the school\nwhere it is begun - The Indians\nof the village say that they are\nnot listened to when they\nspeak at their meetings and that\nthe interpreter does not repeat\nall they say, when he does listen.\nSome of the men who want the\nschool nearer are: Gabriel Ni-\nganivina, Joseph Mekategianisk,\nFrank Jawenashie, Joseph Sapihon\nNoel Dominic, P.M., John Gaboni\netc., in fact all those of the\nvillage. They are more timid than\nthe northern group of farmers, and do not dispute for their rights.\n\nThey have written you that there are forty-four children of school age and under, living on the farms and eleven in the village. To prove you how false this is I shall give you the names of the fathers with the number of children each has:\n\n1. Gabriel Rigamivina,\n2. Joseph Mekategaiaashk,\n3. Ignatius Mekategaiaashk,\n4. Frank Jawenashi,\n5. Mrs. Wabizone,\n6. John Gaboni,\n7. Louis Okeda,\n8. Antoine Wabizijig,\n9. Alex Wabizijig,\n10. Alex Vincent,\n11. William Cook,\n\nmaking in all 22. At the farms there are 37 and not 44, and among these are six\nwho are very tall and big who will probably not come to school, although they are 13 and 14 years of age; these are Agnes Sampson, Mary Wabzyig, Ida Sampson, Agnes Missessens, Mary Pegoniasang and Henry Nigamiwina. And of these farmers who live in the northern part, all except five families would be as near to the school, if it were built near the village, as those who live on the farms in the opposite direction, perhaps nearer.\n\nThere are also more young married people in the village than on the northern farms, and as the ground is all taken up\nin that direction, those who will get married in future will necessarily have to build to the south. Some of the northern farmers have also repeatedly said that they intend to send their children to the Shingwak home no matter where the school is. I assure you that I do not intend to be at variance with those people, all year, there are many places where I could exercise my zeal and energy. However, I am not bitter against them and am most willing to make concessions, in order to have peace.\u2014Mr. Shortburn was here last Wednesday evening and asked me if I would be\nwilling to go to the new school\nif the Indians would build\nthe church nearer to it; they\nneed a new and larger church.\nAs one of my objections is to\nbe far from the church, this\narrangement would suit me\nvery well, for I don't think\nthe village people would\nobject having the church built\nabout half way between the\npresent church and the new\nschool. But before I give my\nfull consent, I would re-\nquire a written promise, sign\nby the band, to build the church\nwithin that time, as I would\nnot trust John Sigaminiwa's\nword, nor some of the others.\nbecause they do not practice any religion proclaim that the actual small church is large enough, and their work would only be a sham.\n\nTherefore, if the Department will take upon itself the responsibility of erecting a new church in the neighborhood of the school, I shall gladly go and enjoy the comforts you have so kindly provided for me.\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\nAd\u00e8le Ducharme\nMadam,-\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant with further reference to the site of the school-house at Sheashgwaning. In reply I beg to say that information in the possession of the Department leads it to believe that the site now chosen as most central is satisfactory to a majority of the Indians. As it is their funds that is being used in the construction their wishes with regard to the site must of course be respected. With regard to the erection of the Church the Department has no responsibility and cannot make any promise whatever. It must be remembered, too, that the school-house is being erected primarily for the secular education of the children and it is only indirectly that its proximity to the Church building has any bearing whatever on the question.\n\nAuthority has been given to proceed with the work on the site now chosen and if upon the completion of the building, you do not wish to remain in charge I would ask you to let the Department have due notice in order that a successor may be appointed.

Baxter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nOttawa, July 22, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nIn anticipation of conducting a garden in connection with the Sheshewaning School next season, the Department wishes to take up at once the question of fencing the grounds and I have to ask you to be good enough to submit an estimate of having the grounds cleared and fenced, with a description of the fence.\n\nOn November 7th last, you were authorized, if you could obtain a reasonable price per foot for sinking a well, to have the matter attended to at once, and also to have the well covered and a pump placed in position. Apparently no action was taken in this matter as far as the records of the Department show.\n\nIt is reported that no tower was placed on the outside of the walls of this building and consequently water is leaking in, also that the grounds around the building are not properly graded, that the roof was leaking and that the furnace was not working properly.\n\nYou were asked on May 26th to report in regard to the heating system, but up to the present time you have not done so and the Department cannot permit any further delay in dealing with these matters.\n\nAn officer of the Department, who recently visited Guelph\n\nF. W. Baxter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nGuelph, saw the teacher who stated that sometime ago she sent in a requisition for furniture for the building to you. The Department does not appear to have any record of this being received. You will be good enough to report with regard to this also.\n\nYou should have the grading of the grounds attended to at once and the roof should be fixed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nOur Indian Agent, Mr. Baxter, promised to come as soon as the frost was out of the ground to attend to the clearing, grading, fencing, well digging etc., on our school grounds which would have to done before the garden work could be commenced. He has not come yet and as it is getting rather late I thought it advisable to write to the Department.\n\nOn April 1st. last, Mr. Baxter brought school report for last quarter, a requisition for school material and one for seed and garden tools but have not received anything asked for.\n\nI would be most grateful if you could attend to the matter.\n\nThanking you in advance, I remain,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nElizabeth Beaudet,\nTeacher.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, May 20, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Miss Leusch in reference to certain tools and seeds required for the Sheeshewaning school garden. Mr. Agent Baxter was authorized on the 11th instant to purchase the articles enumerated in the letter to him of that date. If these have not already been furnished the Department would like you to see that they are sent to Miss Leusch with as little delay as possible.\n\nYou will also be good enough to see that Mr. Baxter has the ground prepared for a garden. A well should be sunk in the school grounds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. McKay, Esq.,\nc/o Indian Office,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nOttawa, May 22, 1914.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant stating that Mr. Agent Baxter has not yet had the land in connection with the Sheshegwaning school prepared for a garden and also that you sent in a requisition on April 1st for school material and seeds and garden tools and have not received anything asked for.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that on the 11th instant Mr. Agent Baxter was authorized to purchase the garden tools and seeds and the school material was ordered from the Government Stationery Office. An officer of the Department is at present at Gore Bay and he has been instructed to see that the ground is prepared and the seeds and tools sent you with as little delay as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Elizabeth Leusch,\nTeacher,\nSheshegwaning Indian School,\nMorrisville P.O., Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to Department letter number 157713/5 under date of July 23rd 1913 I have taken up the matter with the land and find that to put a wire fence around the grounds and clear and grade up the lot will cost about two hundred and fifty dollars and there will be a lot of work in leveling up the grounds and I think that it would be less expensive and more work could be got for the money by having a white man to oversee the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ. W. Baxter\nIndian agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indians Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, June 15, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 8th instant I beg to say that you may have the grounds in connection with the Sheshawangan Indian school cleared and fenced and the cost should not exceed your estimate of $250.00. The Department approves of your suggestion to have a white man to oversee the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLellan\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. W.

School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Miss Leusch, the teacher, forwarded a copy of this requisition to the department and seeds asked for were ordered from Messrs. Kenneth McDonald & Sons, Ottawa, on the 17th ultimo to be shipped to her address by parcel post.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. MOLAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. W. Baxter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nTIMOTHY, CLOVERS AND GRASSES\n\nAround January the first when we go to press with copy of this catalogue, there is always a good deal of uncertainty as to prevailing prices for spring delivery of Timothy and Clover Seeds. Therefore, in making the following recommendations, we are basing prices on stock now actually on hand. These prices we will endeavor to maintain just as far as we can reasonably do so. It must be remembered however, that prices are always subject to market fluctuations. Seed will therefore, be sent to the value of remittance according as market values may be higher or lower.\n\nTo assure safe delivery, Timothy and Clover Seeds should always be shipped in good strong cotton bags. ADD TO YOUR REMITTANCE 25c EACH TO COVER COST OF COTTON BAGS. 25 lbs. or more supplied at 100 lb. rate.\n\nMEDIUM OR EARLY RED CLOVER\n\nThis is considered the most valuable of the Red Clover family, sometimes called June Clover, and is everywhere in great demand. Price: \"Mount\" brand, No. 1, 10 lbs. $3.10; 100 lbs. $30.00. Price: \"Meadow\" brand, No. 2, 10 lbs., $2.90; 100 lbs. $28.00.\n\nMAMMOTH OR LARGE LATE RED CLOVER\n\nOf taller and ranker growth than the preceding sort. Valuable for restoring fertility to depleted soils. The foliage, flower and stem are darker in color than the Early Red. It ripens later and makes only one crop. Price: \"Mount\" brand, No. 1, 10 lbs. $3.20; 100 lbs. $31.00. Price: \"Meadow\" brand, No. 2, 10 lbs. $3.00; 100 lbs. $29.00.\n\nALSIKE CLOVER\n\nA valuable sort which resembles Red Clover in growth and habit. Desirable in grasses for hay and permanent pasture. Thrives well on soils that are cold and wet, being hardy and not easily winter killed. Price: \"Mount\" brand No. 1, 10 lbs. $2.70; 100 lbs. $26.00. Price: \"Meadow\" brand No. 2, 10 lbs. $2.30; 100 lbs. $22.00.\n\nWHITE OR DUTCH CLOVER\n\nA small spreading perennial variety, valuable for pasture and lawns. Price, 50c. to 60c. per lb. according to quality.\n\nTIMOTHY SEED\n\nInferior grades of Timothy Seed are quite often low in vitality and germination, and frequently contain a large percentage of weed seeds. As a protection to our customers, we have adopted the following brands:\n\n\"GOLD MEDAL\" BRAND\n\nThis brand represents the very highest grade obtainable, the cream of the crop. It is seldom that more than 5% of the entire crop, at an outside estimate, is of suitable quality to be sold under this brand, which at once means that we are not always in a position to offer \"Gold Medal\" in large quantity, even at the extra premium price we are obliged to ask for it. Price: Ib. 20c; 10 lbs. $1.70; 100 lbs. $16.00.\n\n\"MOUNT\" BRAND\n\nAn extra select seed of strictly No. 1 grade, carefully reclained and uniformly graded. Can always be relied upon for high standard of purity and germination. We recommend \"Mount\" to customers wanting a reliable high-grade seed. Price: Ib. 18c; 10 lbs. $1.55; 100 lbs. $14.50.\n\n\"MEADOW\" BRAND\n\nThis brand is sold year after year to many of the best farmers, and not without good reason, because while a No. 3 Government standard, the seed is of large size and shows a purity test of 99\u00bd%. We feel sure for the fact that this seed is slightly dark in color and frequently a little hullled, it could be called a No. 2 grade. It is certainly a serviceable grade of seed and desirable for both purity and germination. Price: Ib. 16c; 10 lbs. $1.45; 100 lbs. $13.50.\n\n\"PINE TREE\" BRAND\n\nWe offer in \"Pine Tree\" a good dependable seed at a moderate price, showing an average purity of 99\u00bc%. While not a fancy grade, it is just of that nice middle quality which makes it desirable to the man who studies economy, with an eye to purity and strong germination. Price: Ib., 16c; 10 lbs. $1.40; 100 lbs. $13.00.\nMINNESOTA KING.\u2014One of the most valuable corns for growing in Northern sections as it possesses a remarkably healthy and vigorous constitution, thus enabling it to withstand all extremes in the weather. The ears are of medium size with eight rows of broad yellow kernels, half way between Flint and Dent. It matures a week earlier than any of the Dent sorts and is just the right for wet, cold seasons. **Bushel $1.75.**\n\nLEAMING FODDER.\u2014Very extensively used for green and dry fodder, but is too late in maturing to produce a sufficiency of cobs to make it equal to Improved Leaming. **Bushel $1.85.**\n\nMARSHALL'S SOUTHERN SWIFT OR PARAGON WHITE.\u2014This variety is always in great demand, owing to its ability to yield enormous crops of remarkably sweet and nutritious fodder, which is highly prized, particularly for feeding in its green state. **Bushel $1.50.**\n\nREYNOLDS' RED.\u2014An old-time favorite with large, close-jointed stalks, producing an abundance of fodder, which is sweet, tender, juicy and much liked for either green or dry feed. **Bushel $1.50.**\n\nEVERGREEN SWEET FODDER.\u2014We consider this one of the most valuable fodder plants in existence for the feeding of dairy cattle. The stalks are becoming sweeter, juicier and very nutritious. Dairy farmers claim this superior to all other varieties for the production of milk. **Cal. 40\u00a2; pint 75\u00a2; bush. $2.75.**\n\nEXTRA EARLY FLINT VARIETIES.\n\nCOMPTON'S EARLY.\u2014This is one of the earliest and especially adapted to Northern conditions; there are twelve rows to the cob; grains small, round and heavy. Some growers use this in preference to the Dents for silo purposes. **Bushel $1.90.**\n\nLONGFELLOW.\u2014An eight rowed sort and perhaps the most popular of all the varieties. The ears are from 10 to 14 inches in length and well filled with large, hard, golden-yellow kernels. **Bushel $1.90.**\n\nANGEL OF MIDNIGHT.\u2014A superior early eight rowed yellow Flint corn. The ears are long, straight and evenly filled from butt to tip with rich, golden-yellow kernels of medium size. **Bushel $1.90.**\n\nIMPROVED KING FLINT.\u2014This is an extra early Flint and for this reason particularly desirable for Northern sections, matured in about 60 days. Ears are eight rows and from 9 to 12 inches long. **Bushel $1.90.**\n\nSANFORD WHITE FLINT.\u2014Not only does this corn produce a large crop of fodder, but also a generous yield of long handsome ears, measuring from 12 to 15 inches. The plant is of strong, vigorous growth, and the stalks and leaves of most desirable appearance. **Bushel $1.90.**\n\nNORTH DAKOTA WHITE FLINT.\u2014A valuable sort and very highly esteemed by many growers because of the leafy character of the close jointed stalks. The ears are of large size; kernels broad, and the grain of a dusky white color. Yields enormous crops. **Bushel, $1.90.**\n\nKaffir Corn.\n\nExcellent Fodder Whether in Green or Dry State\n\nWeather conditions seem to have little effect on this corn; it grows from start to finish whether dry or wet. The plants grow straight and upright, attaining a height of six feet more or less. The stalks are not so stalky tendency and produce numerous wide leaves. The stalks do not harbor disease in fodder crops but keeps green, brittle and juicy. The grain is highly desirable as a food for poultry. Cultivate same as common corn. For fodder sow in drills at the rate of \u00bd bushel per acre. Price, by mail, postpaid, 20c lb. By express, at purchaser's expense: lb. 10c; 10 lbs. 75c; 100 lbs. $4.50.\n\nSorghum or Early Amber Sugar Cane.\n\nA Good Feed for Dairy Cattle\n\nFrom the increasing demand it would seem that Sorghum is attracting more attention, particularly among dairy farmers as a green cutting crop. It is greedily eaten by all stock, being sweet, tender and very nutritious. Dairymen claim that it greatly increases the flow and quality of the milk. Sow 15 pounds per acre in drills and cultivate same as corn. The seed is also a profitable crop for feeding the poultry. Price by mail, postpaid, 25c per lb. By express or freight, at purchaser's expense: lb. 10c; 10 lbs. 75c; 100 lbs. $6.00.\nINSECTICIDES AND FUNGICIDES\n\nAphis Punkt.\u2014A special preparation of nicotine for the extermination of green and black fly, thrip, etc., in greenhouses and conservatories. Price, 75c.\n\nArsenic Powder.\u2014An effective insecticide used for codling moth, potato bug and all leaf eating insects. While being equally as powerful on pastures, it is far more injurious to the plants. Price, 1 lb. jar 25c; 5 lbs. crock 90c; 10 lbs. keg $1.50; 20 lbs. keg $2.75; 50 lbs. keg $6.00.\n\n\"Bug Death Powder.\"\u2014A concentrated solution of nicotine sulphate, an excellent spray for all kinds of sucking insects. For sheep and cattle dipper (to destroy scale) it is unsurpassed. Full directions on tin. Per 1-2 lbs. $1.00.\n\nBordeaux Mixture.\u2014The most efficient spray for mildew, rust, curled leaf, etc. Prepared all ready for use. Price, quart size, 50c.\n\nCut Worm Food.\u2014The cut worm eats this poison food in preference to plants. One pound sufficient for up to 100 plants. Per lb. carton 30c; 5 lbs. $1.10.\n\nBordeaux Mixture (Grasselli).\u2014The most efficient spray for blight, mildew, curled leaf, etc. Prepared all ready for use. Price, quart size 65c; 1 gal. $1.50.\n\nFires Oil.\u2014Destroys all plant insects without injuring the plant. Recommended for all house plants. Price, 1-3 pint 50c.\n\nFormic Hydride.\u2014Prevents smut and other fungus diseases on wheat, barley, oats and other grains and scab on potatoes. Pint 50c; quart 75c; gallon $2.25.\n\nGlauber's Salt (Templeton).\u2014For destroying red spider, scale, mealy bug, etc. Price, box 40c.\n\nGrape Dust (Hammonds).\u2014Excellent for preventing and destruction of mildew on roses, grapes, gooseberries, etc. Per pkg. 25c.\n\nHellebore.\u2014For destruction of slug and snail caterpillars. Much less poisonous than Paris Green, and safer to use when fruits or vegetables are nearly ripe. Can be used as a powder or dissolved 1 oz. per gal. of water. Price, 1-lb. pkg. 15c; 3 lbs. pkg. 35c; 5 lbs. pkg. 50c; 10 lbs. keg $1.00; 20 lbs. keg $1.80; 100 lbs. keg $7.50.

Use 1 lb. to the acre, dusting it on with a fine sieve, or open burlap bag. Price, 10 lbs. 30c; 25 lbs. 60c; 100 lbs. $2.00; 300 lbs. bbl. $4.50.\n\nCopper Sulphate or Bluestone.\u2014Extensively used in preparation of Bordeaux Mixture.

D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. Russell McGregor, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nSpanish, Ont.\nJuly 22, 1916.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find accounts for poultry netting, tools, lime etc., which I purchased for the Sheddenaning R.C. School in accordance with the authorization received through your letter of April 6th No. 157713/1.\n\nAll the articles mentioned on bills have been received and the prices are fair and just. The accounts were delayed as one parcel was lost and had to be traced.\n\nOn the bill of W.H. Hawkins & Co. you will find 3 padlocks which I had not asked for in my requisition and which I intended to pay for myself. But as the merchant made a mistake and placed them on this account I left them.\n\nOne of the locks was for the garden, the second for the hen house and the\nthird for the shed containing the gasoline tank and pump for the school lamp.\n\nI left them at the Department's pleasure, to be paid by them or not.\n\nI also enclosed the account for caretaking of the Shingwauk R.C. School and one in favor of Joel Domenic for work done. Both have been sent to Mr. Baptist's office some time ago.\n\nThe tool house was the outcry attached to the teacher's former residence at the bay store. It had to have a front put in and repaired. The lumber used was taken from the old residence.\n\nThe hours of labor, putting up poultry netting was large because the ground was very uneven, making a great deal of work necessary to keep the hens from getting out from underneath the fence.\n\nHoping that all is satisfactory, I remain,\n\nVery gratefully yours,\n\nElizabeth Lewis,\nTeacher\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nReferring to your letter of July 27th re clearing grounds west of school, Miss Leusch wanted to have part of it cleared so she could grow corn there next year, as this part of the grounds has the makings of a nice grove and playground for the girls I could not recommend that this be done and explained to Miss Leusch that as the School was closed at the time when the garden needed the most attention and that if the ground was underbrushed and only dead and undesirable trees cut out the maples being left, ploughed, stoned as much as can be done for the money allowed and next spring when the roots are dead it can be finished and seeded and a good grove be there, am satisfied that they have plenty of garden land and all that they can take of. Miss Leusch has agreed with me in the matter, and she asks for a crow bar for taking out stones, they have always used one from the village but it has disappeared.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 11, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that you may, as you suggest, have the dead and undesirable trees cut out from the grounds on the west side of the Sheshawangan (R.C.) school and the land ploughed and stoned this fall and next spring have the work finished and the land seeded.\n\nYou may purchase a crow bar for taking out the stones.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It should be of sufficient size to provide ample playgrounds and also room for a school garden. In the blank for the description in the deed you should then state the size of and dimensions of the lot.

A few of them have not, as I tell them\u2014become civilized enough to play as they should\u2014but insist on running after each other and, in consequence, trampling down the plants in the flower plot.\n\nI have put up, time and again, small posts with wire attached to form a fence, but as the posts have to be so very thin so as not to be too unsightly, they are soon broken.\n\nI would be most grateful if the Department would send 1 dozen steel\nfence posts 72 inches long.\n\nI bought last fall about $10 worth of bulbs and roots and would be much pleased if I could keep them from being spoiled.\n\nAs I was afraid that Mr. McGeary might not explain matters I have written to you direct. If necessary I will send in application through him.\n\nHoping for a favorable reply, I remain\n\nMost respectfully yours,\n\nElizabeth Leacock\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 1, 1921.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo requesting that one dozen steel fence posts be supplied for the erection of a fence to protect the flower beds at the Sheshegwaning (R.C.)

Indian Day School, to be supplied with one dozen steel fence posts, 72\" long, in order to erect a fence around the flower beds at the school.\n\nAs Miss Leusch is taking a great interest in the school grounds and the establishment of flower beds, the Department will approve of an expenditure for the purchase of the fence posts required. I have, therefore, to request that you will arrange for the purchase of these posts and having them delivered to the school. Competitive prices should be obtained, if possible, and the purchase made from the firm quoting the lowest price. You should give this matter your early attention, in order that these posts will arrive for use as soon as the frost is out of the ground. You should furnish properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the posts. It might be well to consult Miss Leusch before making the purchase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ.

I would also respectfully refer you to Mr. Blandening and to the enclosed testimonials.\n\nMy professional certificate expires with this year, but I shall be none the less qualified to teach after having had the three years experience.\n\nHoping you will give my application your favorable consideration. I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nAnnie K. Carson.\nWiariton Ont. Oct 25th '900.\n\nThis certifies that Miss Annie Carson has been an assistant teacher in the Wiariton Public School, and she has during her three years' teaching here performed her duties to the satisfaction of all concerned. By her kindness she has endeared herself to her pupils, and as a disciplinarian she is unsurpassed. In short any school board that secures her services will find her an efficient painstaking and exemplary teacher and one under whom pupils are sure to advance.\n\nR.W. Bright\nPrincipal Pub. Schoo\nOwen Sound Model Public Schools,\nJ.A. Reid Principal\n\nOwen Sound Oct 13 1900.\n\nThis is to state that Miss A. Carson received her professional training at the Owen Sound Model School three years ago, and after a very successful course was appointed to a responsible position on the Wiarton staff of public school teachers, filling it with unqualified satisfaction to the present term.\n\nDuring her training I found her in every way far above average in natural endowments and she entered so heartily.\nIn the work that at the end of the course I was able to report to the Board of Examiners, that both young teacher trained at this institution for years gave greater promise than Miss Barson, an opinion I am now able to say has been fully endorsed by her work in the present charge.\n\nMiss Barson has just such personal qualities as are most desirable in a teacher, and I can most unhesitatingly recommend her to any Board of Trustees, especially as a primary teacher.\n\nJ.H. Reid\nSir,\n\nI enclose herein the application of Miss Annie D Carson together with testimonials and her third class certificate which you will notice expires at the end of this year. However she will be quite competent to teach any of the Indian schools as none of them have any pupils further advanced than then the 4th grade and 6th School Inspector Clendening who was here the other day on his professional visits at the schools, informs me that he knows of no teacher available that could better fill the position that will be vacant at Sidney Bay at the end of this quarter by the resignation of Miss Laubille who is now in the hands of the Department.\n\nI am of the same opinion as the Inspector Miss Carson has given entire satisfaction to the Western School Board during the 3 years she has taught there besides her further the Reverend Dr. Carson was the Methodist Missionary at this place for 4 years in her younger days she therefore understands something of the Indian language and Indian ways and manners. Miss Carson's reputation is first-class in every way and her desire to improve the Indian children and people good.\n\nI therefore take pleasure in recommending Miss Annie D Carson for the position of teacher at the Sidney Bay school. I may add that suitable teachers for school in this section is scarce and it is not very certain that is suitable or likes the work in such an school and while her certificate expires at the end of this year she is capable of the work here and I am sure can get it renewed.

She is the same person that had this same school in charge for so many years, as well as French Bay school at Langley, and has had all the schools on this Reserve at different times. I strongly recommend her appointment as teacher. She understands the work well, but writes me that on account of her having had the Sidney Bay school so long, and it being such an advanced place to get to, obliges. She would prefer one of the other schools when a vacancy occurs. Which is likely to be the case at Port Elgin in September and likely October in January. There is no doubt but that Sidney Bay and Port Elgin schools should always have their teachers united there would be more convenient places of abode for teachers.\n\nReferring to Miss Carson's claim for pay during holiday time, I think it is not very good, but if the Department would be willing this might be divided between the teachers, there is no other applications for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary Department of Indian Affairs\n\nIndian Affairs.

The resolution states for itself.\n\nI may say that the Indian Council have been talking along these lines regarding the past being too much in connection with the white schools. We told them, and I know it to be the case, that it will be impossible to get qualified teachers at a reduction of salaries at such a place as this, where suitable accommodation can only be obtained by a great effort, the teachers having to perform a little miles to their Boarding House, and it means that all the teachers at present here will resign as soon as their salaries are lowered. And the department now does not know that salaries have gone up in almost every branch, and I am aware of the fact that in nearly all the white schools in the inspection of the Country on the Peninsula that teachers are getting all the way from five hundred more than they were five years ago.\n\nHowever if the Department see fit to approve of this resolution I am willing to guarantee if instructed to do so, as it may be possible to get people who have only passed the entrance, and the Council said these would do.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the case of Port Elgin it is over three miles out at Sydney Bay over two miles.

I have been encouraged to write to you by the description my brother, John McIver, Indian Agent, Cape Croker Reserve, gave of you, he having had the honor of meeting you at Ottawa.\n\nLet me tell you my history, and I hope you will then grant the request I wish to make of you.\n\nIn the year 1873, when I was a girl of sixteen, my parents moved to the wilds of Bruce Co. That same year I began teaching school on the Cape Croker Indian Reserve. The country was wild; the Indians were almost uncivilized. I endured many hardships. Ever since then I have been actively engaged teaching in Indian schools. I taught 24 years on Cape Croker Reserve (and)\nand 9 years on Saugoon Reserve. I have done pioneer work on both these reserves. I have seen great changes in the condition of these schools, all for the better, till now they compare favorably with white schools. I have always been, and am still, an enthusiast in the Indian work, and hope to resume it after a short rest. My record is at the Indian Department, Ottawa, and you may inquire there.\n\nBut I have always thought there should be some superannuation scheme in the Indian Department, for teachers who have served so long and faithfully in the work as I have done. Is there any such scheme? I have never heard of any such, and I fear there is none.\n\nBut there used to be one in the Education Department. I do not think it is open to teachers at present, excepting those who were\non before 1884. Now, being away in\nthe wilds, as it were, the knowledge\nof the existence of this fund, came to\nme too late. However, pleading my\nignorance, I am going to make an\neffort to get on the list by paying\nback dues. And so I come to the\nfavor I wish to ask of you, as\nrepresenting the Indian Dep. I think\nif I had a recommendation from\nyou I would have a better chance\nof being successful. Will you give me\nsuch a recommendation to the Education\nDep.\n\nI enclose copies of testimonials from\nmy school inspectors.\n\nI await your reply with hope\nand anxiety. I have been a faithful\nservant of the Indian Dep. for many\nyears. Will you help me in this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIsabella McIver.\n\nHon Frank Redley\nIndian Department,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 31, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nMiss Isabella McIver, who has been in the Indian school service since 1874 continuously up to December 31, last, when she resigned, has written the Department for a recommendation, which she wishes to make use of to assist her in obtaining a superannuation allowance from the Ontario Educational Department.\n\nThere is no provision for superannuation of Indian school teachers in this Department and I doubt whether her claim would be recognized by the Ontario Government, but from her long and favourable service and good record while in the employment of the Department, I consider that you would be quite justified in giving her a testimonial to this effect.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It will likely be alright when the time of the Easter holidays, and we can get a teacher to commence then. There is only a small number of pupils who could attend in the winter, none of the children at this school are very far advanced as they are nearly all young. I have an application from Miss Danielle McDevitt of Owen Head, the former teacher here, which speaks for itself, also one from Miss May Davenport of Wildcat which I endorse and if I had not better of these two Misses would take the school.

I have been wondering if there were any rise for one to apply for the position of Teacher for Sidney Bay School. If I could get it for six months or a year it would help me pay up all my debts. Of course I do not wish to stand in the way of anyone that is better qualified. Only I heard that perhaps the School would be closed up. Would you please let me know if you can spare a few minutes of your valuable time. Perhaps you have already got someone to fill the position. I thought there would be no harm to ask you anyway. Hoping to hear from you soon.\n\nI remain your humble servant,\n\nEliza A. Jones\nReferring to your letter of December 23, 1905\n\nNo. 15818/1\n\nWith further reference to the question of keeping the Sydney Bay School open during the winter months, I beg to say that in the first quarter of the year very little good can be accomplished by keeping it open, as there are scarcely any children in the vicinity who would attend during the rough weather.\n\nI interviewed Mr. Jones, who is now on his Xmas holidays from Albert College. His qualifications would be good enough, there are no advanced pupils in the school. There are none past the 3rd Reader. Mr. Jones does not want to move his term of studies at the College, but says he would like to get the school after April 1st so as to earn some money, as he intends going West about next July. He would have the best qualifications of any person I know of.\n\nI enclose a letter or application from Mrs. Eliza A. Jones who it appears taught at the Port Elgin School a number of years ago. The Chief Red Keeship, would like to have her if she stays here, but they have very little qualification and are too young.\n\nIf the Department wishes the school kept open this winter, either Mr. Jones or one of the Chiefs may\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo.\n\ntears are the only ones I know of that can be got.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn M.

All applications should be forwarded to the Department.\n\nYour remarks with reference to Mr. George R. Jones have been noted, as well as the application of Miss Jones.

It seems to be just the right way to teach thrift to the Indians,\u2014to begin with the children.\n\nSince the introduction in June,\u2014$6.65 has been brought to school by the children, the highest in any week being, $1.26.\n\nReport dated, \u2014 September 28th, 1916.\nOttawa, May 11, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your recent report on the River Settlement School I beg to say that Mr. Agent Janes is being written to in regard to a new floor and new desks for this school. A new blackboard is being ordered from the Government Stationery Office. The Agent is being instructed to see that the garden is ploughed at once and to inform the truant officer that he must see that all the children of school age attend school regularly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. H. Abraham, Esq., B. S. A.,\nR. R. No. 1,\nChatham, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter No. 152044/1 of May 1917 in regard to River Settlement School supplied. In this letter it is stated that a metal plate blackboard is being ordered for this school. Please have this blackboard shipped to Muncey Station which is on a branch of the M.G.R. running from St Thomas. As this station is near the school it will save shipping or extra expense of hauling with a team from London if it is shipped directly to Muncey.\n\nI would estimate that it would cost about forty dollars to put a new blackboard on the River Settlement School.\n\nI do not think there is any pressing need for new desks at present as there appears to be plenty of seat accommodation for the present attendance. About half of the desks in use are practically new and up to date. The balance are old fashioned but are in very good condition.\n\nThat I engaged a man to plough the garden but he failed to do it and I have made arrangements with another man to do the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSt. James,\n3rd Agent.\nOttawa, May 22, 1917\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant asking that the blackboard frame for the River Settlement school be shipped direct to Muncey, and stating that it would cost about $40.00 to put a new maple floor in this school, that you do not think there is any need for new desks there at present and that you have made arrangements to have the garden ploughed.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the blackboard for this school will be shipped direct to the teacher's address at Muncey Station.\n\nYou are hereby authorized to have a new floor placed in this school during the holidays and the cost should not exceed the amount of your estimate, viz., $40.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

James, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDelaware, Ont.\nReferring to some of the pupils not having sufficient lunches, especially in the winter; though I have often given them something from my own store, yet on my salary am not able to do this constantly. I have often wished that the Department would make it possible for me to supply those who need it with a simple lunch, say a cup of soup, or cocoa and some bread and butter. As my school is so small, & thinks I could manage the extra work, at least during the winter. Would be very willing to try for the sake of the children, and would keep expense as low as possible.\n\nIsabelle McEvoy\nTeacher\n\nThis was attached to the annual report of Miss McEvoy written by Sidney Boyce.\nOttawa, March 10, 1919.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn reference to that portion of your report on the Sidney Bay School for the year ended December 31st, last, in regard to some of the pupils not having sufficient lunches and stating that you have often wished that the Department would make it possible for you to supply those who need it with a simple lunch, I beg to say that Mr. Agent Lennox is being authorized to expend a sum not exceeding $10.00 in the purchase of supplies for this purpose. He is being instructed to consult you before making the purchase.\n\nWhen these supplies are used you should make a requisition through the Agent for authority to purchase more, and you should state the number of meals given with the supplies furnished.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

No. 5,\nWiarton, Ont.\nChatham, Ont., October 11, 1920.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to say that Miss McIver, who has been teacher in the Sydney Bay School at the Cape Crocker Reserve for the last thirty-five years, is only receiving Four hundred and Fifty dollars ($450.00) a year, with a bonus of One hundred and fifty, which brings it to Six hundred dollars ($600.00) per year. Miss McIver states that this is not sufficient for her to live on at the present time, and that she feels that she should have at least as much money as they pay in other schools.\n\nShe states that although the attendance at the school is small that she has to be there each day, and that she has to prepare lessons etc., for the small school in the same proportion as she would in a large school. She states that she has given to the Department of Indian Affairs, and the pupils at the school, in the last thirty-five years past, the best of her life in service, and that the least that the Department could do, at the present time, is to pay her sufficient salary that she might be able to live on.\n\nIn view of this, and of the very excellent way in which the school is being conducted, especially the school garden,\nI beg to recommend that her case be given consideration, and that a substantial increase be made.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. J. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Sec.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, October 15, 1920.\n\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Abraham, Agricultural Representative of the Department, requests that an increase in salary be granted Miss Isabella McIvor, teacher of the Sydney Bay Day School on the Cape Croker Reserve. Miss McIvor at present receives a salary of $450.00 a year, with bonus additional of $150.00. A similar request was made by Miss McIvor in February, last, but was not granted.\n\nMiss McIvor has had 45 years' experience in Indian schools. She has a permanent third class certificate for Ontario and a non-professional second class. The attendance at this school is small, there being an enrolment of 11 pupils with an average attendance of 7. Miss McIvor applied for superannuation in September, 1919, but was informed that there was no provision made by the government for superannuation or retiring allowance for teachers. The members of the band in council by resolution agreed to give her an allowance of $150.00 per annum, but she stated that, as she would be unable to live on that amount, she desired to continue as teacher.\n\nThe Public School Inspector states that the success in her school is very marked. The pupils show the result of individual teaching in a high degree. He stated that it was hard to judge which is the better school, the Cape Croker or Sydney Bay, as both are so excellently kept. He stated that it would be well worth while for the Department to pay a teacher a good salary for even the few who attend, in view of the results being attained.\n\nMiss McIvor has had no increase in salary for several years. There is no doubt that the amount of salary and bonus she now receives is inadequate, as she has an invalid sister to support. Her salary is paid from band funds and I would recommend that she be granted an increase of $100.00 from the first of the present school year. I shall be pleased to have your decision in the matter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This will allow her a salary from that date at the rate of $550.00 per annum and she will also receive the bonus additional at the rate of $150.00 during the period which it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools.

The temporary appointment of this girl is approved.\n\nYou have not stated the salary Miss Jones is to receive, but, from the qualifications which she possesses, we could only allow her salary at the rate of $500 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law, during the time she teaches this school.\n\nIt is noted that the Public School Inspector has an applicant in view for the position at this school. We desire, if possible, to obtain a qualified teacher. After you have discussed the matter of obtaining a teacher with the Inspector, you should report fully as to the name, qualifications and experience of the applicant recommended by him.\n\nAt the end of the current quarter a return should be prepared by the present teacher showing the total number of days taught by her and also the number of days taught by Miss McIvor, in order that the amount of salary and bonus due each can be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCape Croker, Ont.\nMEMO.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWhile at Cape Croker recently I was approached by Mabel Jones, daughter of Ex-chief Charles Jones, she wished to be employed as teacher at the Sydney Bay School, and she stated that she had made application some time ago for a loan to be expended in attending High School, but this loan was refused by the Department. She was able from her resources to attend High School for part of two years. She asks to be employed in the school until next midsummer in order that she might earn money to continue at High School. The Agent Mr. Moore has placed her in temporary charge of the school as no other teacher was available at the time.\n\nI beg to recommend that she be employed until next midsummer. There are only about four pupils attending this school at the present time.\n\nR.H. Abraham,\nAgr. Rep. Dept. of Ind. Aff.\n\nOttawa, September 26, 1923.\nCape Croker, Oct.\nSept 23rd 1922.\n\nRev.

I am a married man age 32 with four children. While in the army in England, I attended the College of Art and feel quite able to teach at Sydney Bay School.\n\nI trust by your Department to give me a permit to teach.

I shall try to visit the Cape Croker schools early next week and have a talk with you. I have had a letter from Miss Stankley who has a letter from a young man seeking a school for a young man. As this is better to have two to get a good qualified teacher and as the attendance at Sidney Bay is small, the young man mentioned in Miss Stankley's letter ought to be a year and you would have a better chance and you would have a better chance.

He has just passed his upper school examinations and was accepted at the University. His father failed in business and was unable to finance his son's education any longer. The young man wants to go on in medicine and wants to teach in some country district where he can earn and study at the same time. He is a young chap.\nto you sometime soon and I hope you will get this letter before he phones. He was thinking of going up to the lumber camps working.\n\nNow I was wondering if there were any schools without teachers, would there be any chance for him. I thought maybe there would be. I know that most inspectors do not like this kind of letter but I feel as though it might help a little.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nHelen S. Harkley\n\nof about twenty, of good character and a prominent man in the various organizations of the Methodist church.\n\nHe has a job now which he will soon have to give up on account of the breaks in the time. He is very ambitious, a good athlete and seems to be only too glad to work at anything but would rather try teaching in order to keep up his reading study.\n\nI was wondering if you could help him in any way by having him teach up north. I am not asking this for any good for myself, but he was a student here last year & I am interested in his ambition. He will phone\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you I had a visit from Mr McCool, the Public School inspector for this district, on Sept 26th and that he visited all the Schools on the reserve during his stay here.\n\nIn regards to Miss Jones who is substituting in Miss McIvor's place at Sidney Bay School he gave a very creditable report, and seems to think that she would be satisfactory until an older and more experienced teacher could be obtained, and also states that this is a very bad time of the year to get teachers and there would be more chance to get one in June or July than at present.\n\nI might state that I have had some of parents of children going to Sidney Bay School to me, with complaints that the teacher there now is too severe, in punishing the children, and are talking of removing their children unless a new teacher is secured. That is one good point for the teacher, as some of the children are as big as her and have had their own way for too long, and come to School just when they feel like and do not behave when they are at School.\n\nI am inclosing the letters sent me by the inspector, which refer to a young man down the country a bit, whom I don't think would be suitable for here, as his intention would be to make enough money to take him through College, and he would not stay long and would not take an interest if only remaining a short time.\n\nI also inclose the application of John McLeod of this reserve, a married man and a soldier. This man has served a term in jail for making liquor and also has had his Soldier Loan taken from him, he is a R.C. and all the children going to Sidney Bay School are Protestants and I would not recommend him and believe the girl there at present would be more satisfactory than either of these men.\n\nI have not advertised for a teacher as yet.\n\nSecretary.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDept of Ind.Affs.\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 5, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, regarding the continuing of the services of Miss Mabel Jones as Teacher of the Sidney Bay Indian Bay School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say, in view of the opinion of the public school inspector and yourself that Miss Jones is able to perform satisfactory work, the Department approves of her appointment for the present school year. As you were informed in official letter of the 27th ultimo, we can only allow her salary at the rate of $500 per annum plus any bonus provided by law. The bonus, for the present fiscal year only, ending March 31, 1923, will be at the rate of $15 per month for each teaching month.\n\nThe applications which you enclosed from Helen S.

An application was received from Mr. McLeod at that time. As he was a returned soldier, we would have been pleased to offer him the position, but the Sidney Bay School is a Protestant cause and we were unable to offer Mr. McLeod the work.\n\nMiss Jones has been inspected by the Public School Inspector for the district, and he gives a very satisfactory report.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ. Malcolm, Esq., M. P.,\nKincardine,\nOnt.\nJanuary 24, 1923.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Featherston:\n\nWith reference to the attached memorandum, I have to inform you that the teacher of the Sidney Bay Indian Day School, Cape Croker Agency, resigned last September. Miss Mabel Jones was appointed, temporarily, by the Indian agent, and the Department approved of his action. The Provincial Public School Inspector visited Miss Jones at the school, shortly after she commenced duties, and gave a very satisfactory report. The Department then engaged the services of Miss Jones for the present academic year (ending June 30, 1923).\n\nMr. John M. McLeod applied, through Mr. Indian Agent Moore, for the position. Mr. Moore reports as follows: \"I also enclose the application of John McLeod of this reserve, a married man and a soldier. This man has served a term in jail for making liquor and also has had his soldier's loan taken from him. He is R.C. and all the children going to Sidney Bay School are Protestant, and I would not recommend him.\"\n\nLast month the Hon. Mr. Malcolm, member for North Bruce, wrote to me as follows (in part): \"There is a returned man by the name of John M. McLeod, whom I happen to know, at the Cape Croker Reserve, who is recommended by Rev. Father Cadieux. McLeod has a good war record and is a bright chap. I do not believe, however, that he has a teacher's certificate. He is, on the other hand, the type of man who would stay on the reserve and, if Father Cadieux is satisfied with his qualifications, he must have the ability.\"\n\nI replied to Mr. Malcolm in the following terms: \"In September, last, a vacancy occurred at this school and Miss Mabel Jones was appointed by this Department at a salary of $500 per annum. An application was received from Mr. McLeod at that time. As he was a returned soldier, we would have been pleased to offer him the position; but the Sidney Bay is a Protestant cause, and we were unable to offer Mr. McLeod the work. Miss Jones has been visited by the Public School Inspector for the district and he gives a very satisfactory report.\"\n\nThe Hon. member replied as follows: \"I am in receipt of your esteemed favour of the 11th instant, relative to Mr. John M. McLeod, and must say the reason for not giving him the Sidney Bay school should be satisfactory. I have written him by this mail and I hope that this will be the end of his complaint.\"\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nI beg to bring to your notice a few facts in regards to the Sidney Bay Day School on this Reserve.\n\nAt the time of Miss McIvor's resigning and giving up the School in Sept 1922, it was necessary to get a substitute for the School and after getting three applicants, none of whom were properly qualified School teachers, Miss Mabel Jones of this Reserve was appointed as teacher for the rest of the term, and as the time of Miss McIvor leaving (directly after the Summer holidays) it was impossible to get a proper qualified teacher.\n\nSince Miss Jones has been at the School, I have had complaints from some of the residents at that part of the Reserve that she is not teaching the children and that she has not had sufficient education to teach and that being only 16 yrs old she has not the age that demands obedience from children and also that being an Indian girl the children are to familiar and do not learn.\n\nThe residents of Sidney Bay brought a petition to the Council at the last Meeting, asking for the teachers dismissal and a qualified teacher obtained, threatening to remove their children to other School's if this was not granted.\n\nI thoroughly explained to them that at the time of Miss McIvor leaving, it was not possible to secure a more qualified teacher than Miss Jones and that her appointment was confirmed till the end of the term and if a more qualified teacher could be obtained then, it would be done.\n\nThe whole trouble seems to be the age of the teacher and that she is an Indian girl and spite held by one section of the Reserve against another.\n\nI have been visiting the School's here, nearly every week and find a lot of the children absent through illness and not having sufficient clothing for the cold weather, and I visited Sidney Bay School on Feb 8th and there were no children there at all and that they were all sick and also the teacher was sick and sent her home and closed the School for this week, as the teacher is worse and confined to bed. (I would state that the Wiarton Public School, McIvors School, Lion Head School and others have been closed for over ten days through the teachers and children being laid up with the Flu.)\n\nIn regards the complaint against the teacher, I shall have Inspector McCool, who shall be here shortly, report on the progress of the children and also on the qualifications of the teacher, especially on the advancement of the children from the time of his last visit, last Fall, as he is the only one to know if the children are learning or not, and if need be he could give the teacher an examination as well.\n\nIf the teacher is well enough and the weather permits, I shall open the School on the 14th of Feb., 1923, as for the last part of last week and the fore part of this week it has been so bad that the mail cannot get up and all roads are blocked, and impossible for children to get to School.\n\nI shall send a further report after Mr McCools visit.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDept of Ind. Affs.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Feb. 21, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to complaints which are being made regarding the services of Miss Mabel Jones, who was appointed temporary teacher of the Sidney Bay Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we understand these complaints are occasioned by local jealousies among the Indians. We will await the report of Mr. Inspector McCool, after his next visit to this school, regarding the work which Miss Jones is performing. If his report should be unfavourable, we will have to discontinue her services and endeavour to obtain another teacher.\n\nWe note that this school has been closed, on account of the illness of the teacher and sickness among the children on the reserve, but that you expected to have classes resumed on the 19th instant.\n\nWe will look forward to receiving the report of the Inspector, on the work being performed by the teacher at this school. In the meantime, no action will be taken upon any protests that may be received from the Indians regarding Miss Jones' services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian agent,\nCape Croker, Ont.\nNote\n\nPaper & Miss Wilson's\nSuperscription. See\n375592\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the SIDNEY BAY School. March 21, 1923.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\nThe Indian agent, Mr. Moore, had requested the Inspector to be careful in inspecting the school so as to be able to report on the merits of Miss Jones. Miss Jones gives promise of being a good teacher. As the attendance for some years at Sidney Bay has not been large, only seven being enrolled at present, if Miss Jones were encouraged and the parents had the wisdom to support her loyally, good work could be done. It is quite true that she is young and has not had much experience but she is quite bright and intelligent and might succeed fairly well in a small school. Even a short summer course at Bracebridge or Gore Bay would help her very much.\n\nOf course if the Department advertises for a regular qualified teacher, it may be difficult to get one. It seems to the inspector that work would proceed satisfactorily under present conditions until June.\n\nThe children are given hot drinks at the noon hour a very commendable practice.\n\nJohn McCool,\n\nInsp.\nOttawa, April 5th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector McCool, in a report on his recent inspection of the Sidney Bay Indian Day School, states that the services of the teacher, Miss Jones, will be satisfactory under present conditions until the end of the school year, viz: June 30th, next. He also states that if she receives the encouragement and support of the parents good work will be done. He recommends that she take a short summer course at either Bracebridge or Gore Bay, and considers that this would help her very much.\n\nMiss Jones may remain as teacher until the end of the present school year, and you should consult her regarding the advisability of taking a short course at the summer school at either of the above named centres. It will be difficult to obtain the services of a properly qualified teacher for the next school year, and if Miss Jones has the advantage of training at a summer school, her services might be quite satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. D. Moore Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCape Croker, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you in reference to your letter 8-2-1 of April 5th that Miss Jenes has put in an application to the Deputy Minister of Education, Parliament Buildings Toronto for a course at a Summer Model School during the Summer vacation time, that she shall have to spare this Summer.\n\nMiss Jenes is quite anxious to improve her schooling and also willing to do anything that will assist her in bettering her teaching, and had forwarded the application some time ago, but up to the present has had no answer as to whether they will accept her application or that there will be room for her at one of these model schools.\n\nTrusting you will take this matter up with the Educational Dept in regards to her application.\n\nSecretary.\n\nyour obedient servant.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDept of Ind. Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 5th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, requesting that we communicate with the Provincial Department of Education in connection with the application made by Miss Mabel Jones, teacher of the Sidney Bay Indian Day School, who desires to take a course at a summer model school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we do not desire to communicate officially with the Provincial Department in this matter. Miss Jones is an Indian girl, and it may be that the Department feels that it is under no obligation to grant her application, and, besides, her qualifications may not entitle her to the privileges of the summer school.\n\nI would advise that Miss Jones again communicate with the Department in regard to the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCape Croker, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you with further reference to Miss Mabel Jones, the present teacher at #2 Sidney Bay School who applied to the Deputy Minister of Education at Toronto for a Summer course at a Model School, that Miss Jones has been informed that she is too young to take this course as she shall not be 17 yrs old until March 1924, and that 17 yrs is the age that a pupil must be.\n\nI should like to know if an exception could be made for her in this case as the girl is very anxious to improve her teaching and would benefit a great deal if she could receive this course, and in lieu of her not being able to get the course, whether the Dept intends advertising for a more qualified teacher or still retain her as teacher for the coming term.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 9th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, in further reference to the application of Miss Mabel Jones, teacher of the Sidney Bay Indian Day School, to take a course at a summer model school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as you were advised by our letter of the 5th instant, we do not desire to request the provincial authorities to make an exception in the case of this girl, and allow her to take the course.\n\nRegarding her retention as teacher for the next school year, I shall be pleased if you will inform the Department as to whether the Indian parents would be satisfied to have her remain. We understand that there were some complaints last year occasioned by local jealousies, and it might be, if we re-appointed her for next year, that some of the parents would refuse to send their children to school. Before we can decide whether her appointment will be approved, we would be pleased to have your opinion as to whether you would advise that she be retained, or the services of a qualified teacher engaged instead.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6166, file 433-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter 8-2-1 of July 9th in regards to the retention of Miss Mabel Jones as teacher at the Sidney Bay School on this reserve I would beg to inform you that there still seems to be a lot of dissatisfaction with this girl at the School.\n\nThere is one fourth form pupil going there whose parents maintain that Miss Jones' education is not sufficient to prepare her for the entrance examination or she would have tried the entrance this Summer, this being the second year she has been unable to try this examination.\n\nTherefore two parents who have told me they will not send their children to the School after the holidays, if the teacher is retained.\n\nSince the trouble this Spring? I have been looking around and trying to find a qualified teacher who would consider taking the School if it was necessary to get another teacher, but have not yet met anyone that would come up here.\n\nI firmly believe that a stranger and an elder and more qualified teacher would do more satisfactory work and would recommend the change if it is at all possible to get one with the proper qualifications, on account of Miss Jones being so very young and also on account of her only having one year at High School, also on account of her being so well known to the pupils, which tends to cause insubordination on the pupils part.\n\nSecretary\n\nyour obedient servant.\n\nDept of Ind. Affs.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 19th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to the continuing of the services of Miss Mable Jones as teacher of the Sidney Bay Indian Day School for the next school year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department agrees with you that it would be better to dispense with her services and engage another teacher. You may, therefore, inform her that her services will not be required for the next school year.\n\nI have to request that you will make a survey as to the number of children of school age living within two miles of the school. This information is required in order that the Department will be in a position to decide the expenditure that would be warranted in the obtaining of the services of a qualified teacher, and the continuing of the school. The returns received show that there are only about nine children enrolled, with an irregular attendance. If a qualified teacher is obtained, it will be necessary, no doubt, to pay a much higher salary than we have allowed. I shall also be pleased if you will state whether you would be able to secure the services of a suitable teacher. There are good living quarters provided, and it might be that this would attract a teacher, and that one could be secured at a reasonable salary. You might consult the Public School Inspector, and he may be able to recommend someone having suitable qualifications. The salary allowed will depend upon the qualifications possessed, and also taking into consideration the number of children who would attend. If you and the Inspector are unable to obtain a teacher, please advise whether you would recommend that an advertisement be placed in one or more daily papers for the same.\n\nKindly give this letter your attention, and inform the Department as to the number of children available, and whether you can recommend a suitable teacher or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I also stated to him the number of pupils in the district, which is nine, and that the School has a good living residence.\n\nI shall inclose his letter, in which he states it would be advisable to advertise for a teacher, and also the application of a young man who is at present taking a Model School course at Bracebridge and who is desirous of securing a School. I also shall inclose his letter to me with the amount of salary he is asking and the qualifications he states he has.\n\nI am of the opinion that a lady teacher would be more satisfactory, on account of the teaching of sewing at the Schools and more so that a middle aged lady would give better results.\n\nI would recommend that an add be put in the Daily papers, to try and secure a lady teacher, and in case a lady properly qualified could not be secured, this young man's application would then be considered as there is no doubt he would be more qualified than Miss Jones to teach, and any one strange to the residents here seem to satisfy them better than one of themselves.\n\nSecretary.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nDept of Ind.

I may say that this Department has in the past advanced a small grant towards the expenses of teachers taking the summer course in model schools, and if Miss McGarvey takes the course, we would be prepared to make her an advance, which could be deducted from her salary in quarterly instalments. I shall be pleased to hear at a later date as to what she decides to do in the matter, and whether she can arrange to take the course, also if she would require an advance towards her expenses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCape Croker, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter 8-2-1 of March 4th, in reference to the report of Public School Inspector McCool on Miss McGarvey, teacher of Sidney Bay School of this reserve.\n\nOn my last visit to this School, I approached Miss McGarvey on the possibility of her taking a model school course this coming Summer and she informed me that she had already made arrangements to take another course at Bracebridge Model School during the Summer holidays as it was at this school she attended last Summer and through which school she procured her permit to teach and she informs me also that this year she will secure her 3rd class certificate. She also says she can pay her own tuition fee.\n\nUpon asking her of her intentions in regards to continuing teaching at this school, she informs me that she has already secured a better offer outside and that she did not think she would remain at the salary that is at present being paid, but she has taken no decided action as yet.\n\nThere were nine children present at my last visit and there will be three small children starting after the snow goes, which will make a total of twelve and the most that has ever been in attendance there.\n\nDuring the period Miss McGarvey has taught at Sidney Bay she has boarded out in the white settlement and has not availed herself of the residence at the School as she found it to lonesome and this would mean an added expenditure for her and would use up a good deal of her salary, which she maintains is hardly sufficient, according to that paid by the surrounding schools.\n\nSecretary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDept of Ind. Affs.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 28th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, in which you state that it is the intention of Miss McGarvey, teacher of the Sidney Bay Indian Day School, to take a model school course this coming summer at the Bracebridge Model School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that Miss McGarvey can pay her own tuition fees, and that it will not be necessary to make an advance for the purpose. If she does not intend to remain for the next school year, she should give you notice in due time before the school closes for the summer holidays, and you should inform the Department definitely as to her intentions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCape Croker, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI would wish to bring to your attention the request of Miss Mary McGarvey, teacher of Sidney Bay School on this reserve for an increase in salary for the term commencing after the 1924 Summer Holidays and upon the decision of the Dept in granting an increase depend the continuance of this teacher's services for the next term.\n\nMiss McGarvey as she states to me intends going to Brackbridge Model School at her own expense during the Summer holidays and is quite confident of obtaining a 2nd class certificate and is under the impression upon getting the certificate she can command a larger salary, either here or in a rural white School and would be willing to remain at her School here if she was to receive an increase.\n\nAt the time Miss McGarvey took over the School there were 8 pupils on the roll and it has increased to 13 at present and she has an attendance of around 10 pupils each day and the residents of that district are quite satisfied with her services and desire that she remain, and according to the Inspector's report she is satisfactory for another term.\n\nOwing to the fact that this teacher does not use the residence at the School, it saves the Band in the neighborhood of $50.00 a year for wood and other necessaries and owing to the increased attendance and satisfied public as well, I would recommend that consideration be given to her request for an increase in salary to the extent of $75.00 to $100.00, which would mean that she would receive $650.00 along with the living bonus. The teachers in the neighboring white schools receive $800.00 and $1,000.00 and one has not so many pupils as is going to Sidney Bay and the teaching of white children is not as hard as the Indian children.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind. Affs.\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 13th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, requesting an increase in salary for Miss Mary McGarvey, teacher of the Sidney Bay Indian Day School, for the next school year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, if Miss McGarvey attends the summer course at the Bracebridge Model School, the Department will allow an increase of $50 in her present salary. If she succeeds in obtaining a second class certificate, an increase of $100 will be allowed. You will be good enough to inform her accordingly. She should make application in due time to take the course at the Model School. You will be good enough to inform the Department as soon as she completes the course as to the results obtained by her, in order that we can definitely decide the increase that will be allowed, as any such increase will be based on the results achieved.\n\nIt is noted that both the enrolment and average attendance at this school has increased since Miss McGarvey took charge, and that the parents are satisfied with her services and desire that she remain for another term.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCape Croker, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose school Quarterly Returns for the three schools on this reserve, for quarter ending Sept 30th 1924.\n\nWith further reference to your letter 9-2-1 8 June 13th re Miss McGarvey, teacher of Sidney Bay School I would report that Miss McGarvey completed her course at Bracebridge Model School during the holidays and that she obtained a third Class Certificate for five years.\n\nI was under the impression when writing you regarding an increase of salary for this teacher that she would get a 2nd Class Certificate, but have latter been informed that having a permit for the first year teaching, she could only obtain a 2nd during last summer, which she did.\n\nOwing to the good recommendation, Mr. McCool gave me regarding this teacher, I would strongly urge that she be given $650.00 a year plus bonus & the attendance at the school in Nov 16 and the balance as specified.\n\nSecretary\n\nDept of Ind Affs.\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.

This will make her salary from that date at the rate of $600 per annum, which will be supplemented by the bonus provided by law. Payment of both salary and bonus is based on ten teaching months in the year. Please inform Miss McGarvey of the increase in salary granted her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCape Croker, Ont.\nI beg to inform you that Miss Mary McGarvey has stated that she will return as teacher of Sidney Bay School on this Reserve, for the next term commencing Sept 1st and has requested that the Dept consider her application for an increase in salary.\n\nMiss McGarvey last term received an increase of $50.00 from what she previously received and as she does not use the residence attached to the School and thereby saves in the vicinity of $50.00 a year for the Band, I would recommend that her request for a raise be given consideration, as she appears to be a good teacher and has the approval of the residents of the Reserve.\n\nSecretary,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nDept of Ind.

This will allow her a total salary at the rate of $80 per month for the ten teaching months in the year. This increase is based on the favourable reports received from the Public School Inspector and yourself regarding her services. Payment at the above rate is the maximum amount that can be made to teachers having the qualifications which Miss McGarvey possesses.\n\nPlease inform her of the approval granted for her re-appointment and the increase in salary allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

She is Roman Catholic by religion and the pupils attending Sidney Bay are at present three-quarters Protestant and if the Dept would consider her application communications to her could be addressed to 24 Beatrice Street, Toronto, Ont.\n\nThere is also in Wiarton, a Mrs Warder, who has been deserted by her husband, holds a 2nd class certificate, is Protestant, has three children to support who might make a good teacher for this School and is badly in need of support.\n\nIf you wish me to advertise this position kindly advise the salary offered qualifications needed etc as soon as possible so that I may be able to secure a teacher for the opening of School after the Xmas holidays.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind.

A new teacher, to commence duties on January 2nd, will have to be secured. You might have an interview with Mrs. Warder, of Wiarton, and let me have a further recommendation in her case. Would she need to take her three children with her? Ask her to have recommendations regarding her success as a teacher and her character. You might find out her age and the ages of her children. The Department will await a further letter from you in her case.\n\nI note that Miss Violet Nadjiwon is desirous of securing a school. The Department would prefer to consider her for one of our Roman Catholic schools. Vacancies are occurring from time to time, and it might be advisable for Miss Nadjiwon to let the Department have an application, indicating what salary she would expect and whether she would be willing to go west of Sudbury.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

She holds a second class interim certificate and has taught one year at Ferndale School, year 1911-12 and was shortly after married, Mr. McCool being her inspector. Of late she has taught occasionally at Warton Public School as relief teacher. I enclose two references as to character. She is a woman that has had a hard time to raise her children and I would believe would be diligent in her work and is looking for such an opportunity and I believe would be a success if appointed and on account of living in the School would be much better than a single teacher and her children would be an aid to the Indian children in mixing in the play-grounds. The question of salary would be left in your hands.\n\nMiss Irene Jones, daughter of Chief Jones, 18 years of age has handed me her application for this vacancy. She has had three years High School, would not live in the School, but board with her sister and I do not consider her matured enough for this School, nor experienced and has not the confidence of some of the Indians that a white teacher would give. In my opinion this girl if desiring to teach as a profession, should continue her education to Normal and obtain a certificate, when consideration could be given to secure a school.\n\nIf unable to appoint Mrs Warder, kindly advise soon so that I may advertise in Owen Sound paper to secure applicants.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind. Affs.,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 19, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, relative to the application of Mrs. Margaret Warder for the position as teacher of the Sidney Bay Indian Day School and furnishing particulars as to her qualifications and experience. In reply I have to say that the Department will approve of her appointment, to begin duties when the school re-opens after the Christmas holidays, on or about January 3rd, next. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $80 per teaching month. Please inform Mrs. Warder of her appointment and arrange with her to take up duties on the date mentioned. I have to request that you will give her any assistance you can in her work at this school. Should any classroom supplies or furnishings be required for the teacher's residence, a requisition should be forwarded for the articles necessary. It is hoped that Mrs. Warder will meet with every success in her work.\n\nThe Department was unable to consider the application of Miss Irene Jones, a young Indian girl, who has no professional qualifications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCape Croker, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI would wish to bring to your attention that considerable ill feeling has been aroused over the fact that Miss Violet Nadjiwon is unable to be considered for the appointment as teacher at Sidney Bay School on this Reserve on account of being a Roman Catholic and the pupils as at present are a majority Protestant. I have been approached by both denominations, for and against her appointment, and taking the stand that a Protestant teacher should be appointed because of the pupils of that religion being in majority and a suitable teacher of that religion can be obtained and the other side claiming that as religion is not taught in a School it should make no difference and she is well qualified, having a second class certificate and also is a local girl that should be given preference after the Band having spent considerable money on her for education.\n\nI do not wish to be the centre of a religious squabble on this reserve and would wish to know if it is always the policy of the Dept to appoint a teacher from the religion of the majority of the School children, even if the Schools are classified as undenominational as these are, for if so Miss Nadjiwon then cannot be considered in this appointment, but if it is not a set policy then Miss Nadjiwon would be entitled to consideration for the appointment.\n\nAny one of the three applicants for this School namely, Miss Nadjiwon, Mrs Warder or Miss Jones would do and according to qualifications rank in that order, but if the religion and local talent are issues then Miss Nadjiwon and Mrs Warder would be eliminated although best qualified. I shall await your reply before doing anything further in reference the appointment of a teacher at this School.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind.

The Department wrote you on the 19th instant approving of the appointment of Mrs. Warder, but, in view of your recent letter, the following night telegram was sent you today:\n\n\"Reference your letter 20th, if you have not appointed Mrs. Warder you may appoint Violet Madjimon teacher Sidney Bay School if you consider this in best interests of all concerned. In the event of Miss Madjimon's appointment it should be distinctly understood that her retention will depend on her successful conduct of the school.\"\n\nIt has been the experience of the Department, in appointing an Indian girl as teacher of a school on her own Reserve, that there is generally considerable difficulty in her obtaining proper discipline in the school.\n\nPlease advise the Department as soon as possible whom you have appointed to take charge of this school.

I would wish to be advised as to what extent a missionary's duties are in regards Schools and to what control or charge have they ever Schools during School hours?

These schools are denominational and some solely under the control of the Department. Missionaries have no responsibility for the children during school hours. You may grant permission to the Catholic and Protestant missionaries among the Indians to give religious instruction to the children of their own faith, once a week, after school hours - if such permission is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCape Croker, Ont.\nSidney Bay, June 3.\n\nMr. A.D. Moore,\nCape Croker.\n\nDear Mr. Moore:\n\nCould my salary be garnished? The reason I ask is this: When my husband cleared out in November 1926, he left a great many business debts. The only creditor who sued was Charles Eldridge. As the business was in my name, he sued me for $100, and obtained judgment, as I did not attempt to defend myself.\n\nEldridge has now engaged the new lawyer, Mr. Snider, and instructed him to collect that money from me. I do not consider that I owe the money at all, and certainly do not feel like paying it. I was in to see Mr. Snider on Saturday, and he hinted at making things very unpleasant for me by notifying the Department. What is your advice?\n\nSincerely,\n\n(Mrs.) Margaret Warner\nSir,-\n\nI would beg to enclose a letter I received from Mrs Margaret Warder, teacher of Sidney Bay School on this Reserve asking my advice in matters pertaining her salary as teacher for that School and as I am not familiar with this question I would request that you advise her in answering her letter.\n\nIf you so desire you might give me the information and I will advise Mrs Warder, as I feel that this is no great sin on this woman's part, knowing the conditions and the state of her affairs at the time her husband left his family.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 12, 1929.\n\nMadam:\n\nMr. Indian Agent Moore has forwarded your letter of the 3rd instant to him which has reference to a suit against you on account of a debt incurred by your husband. I may say that salary payable by the Department is not subject to garnishes. The Department is not a collecting agency, and as long as you give satisfactory services as teacher of the Sidney Bay Indian Day School, and keep faith with the business community, the Department is not interested in an old account against your husband.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLennan,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. Margaret Warder,\nTeacher, Sidney Bay Indian Day School,\nR. R. No. 5, Wiarton, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI would beg to report to you regarding Mrs Margaret Warder, teacher of No 2, Sydney Bay School.\n\nAs the Department is no doubt aware, Mrs Warder is living apart from her husband. Some weeks ago, I had reason to seriously caution her regarding the company she was keeping. I thought this would be sufficient warning, but recent events have proved this was not the case. Complaints are still being received at my office, regarding the company she still associates with, also I have received complaints from the local missionary, Rev. A. Edington, that she associates with No 239, Lawrence Keeshig., an Indian of this Reserve.\n\nIt is well known that Keeshig is a married man, and his wife is living apart from him. He is frequently seen at the teachers residence, and these doings are being very much talked about among the Indian people.\n\nOnly last week, I again cautioned Mrs Warder, but according to report, she has taken no notice. Under circumstances, I would think it advisable that this teacher be asked to resign her position on this Reserve, and I would request the approval of the Department in this procedure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 20, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to Mrs. Margaret Warder, teacher of the Sidney Bay Indian Day School. Please inform her that it is necessary for the Department to dispense with her services and you should let me have a recommendation concerning a successor. You might consult the public school inspector. I suggest a salary of $80 or $85 per teaching month for a qualified teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

(RG 10, Volume 6166, file 433-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sirs:\n\nHaving telegraphed you today requesting an extension of time re my dismissal as teacher at Sidney Bay, I wish to explain my reason for doing so.\n\nWith your permission, I shall proceed to give a short account of the events leading up to the present situation. I came here on Jan. 1st, of the present year, with my two children, having been recommended by Mr. A.D. Moore, who was Agent at that time. My teaching has been satisfactory as far as I know, at any rate I have been praised by P.S. Inspector McCool at each of his visits, my pupils have made a good showing in their school garden and school fair work, and have also acquitted themselves creditably in our recent Christmas entertainment. When Mr. Moore left here in June, he wrote me a very nice letter, expressing satisfaction with my work here, and wishing me continued success.\n\nWhen Mr. Poste entered upon his duties as Agent, our relations were quite pleasant and continued so until a few weeks ago. I had been writing the Sidney Bay news for the Warton Echo, and included the minutes of the last town council meeting, which had been given me by one of the councillors, Mr. Lawrence Keeshig. On Saturday, Dec. 14th, Mr. Poste called at my home in a very agitated mood, asked me if I had seen the said news, and when I frankly admitted it, accused me of sticking my nose into his business. He also asked me where I had obtained the council news, and when I told him, he made some very nasty remarks and warned me to cease associating with Lawrence Keeshig if I wished to hold my position.\n\nJust here let me say that I became acquainted with this man shortly after I came here, as he has done the repairing around the schoolhouse and residence. I have found him to be at all times a gentleman, educated, cultured and of congenial personality, and I am quite willing to admit that I have treated him as a friend and equal, and have upon different occasions during the past three months entertained him at my home, in the presence of my mother and children. We have also visited at his mother's home. During a week and a half that I was ill in bed the latter part of November, Mr. Keeshig had charge of the school, being a qualified teacher, and as winter had set in, he boarded in our home. Mr. Poste called here at the time, and offered no objections. I might say that I have also entertained others of my Indian neighbors occasionally, and have visited in their homes and associated with them to a certain extent.\n\nTo resume: Mr. Poste called here on Monday, Dec. 23rd, for the monthly report, and made no further reference to his former threats. On Christmas night my two children and I went to Cape Croker with a sleighload of neighbors to attend the community entertainment and dance. Here we met Mr. Keeshig, who had been off the Reserve working and had just returned. We danced together once, then shortly afterwards, my children and I returned home as we had come. The following afternoon, Mr. Poste appeared on the scene with a letter of dismissal from me, but no explanation except that he was done \"monkeying with me,\" to use his own elegant expression.\n\nI am under the impression that a teacher is entitled to due notice before being dismissed, also for a reason for dismissal. Moreover, is a tenant not entitled to more than six days' notice before being forced to vacate a house? My house in Warton is occupied, and my tenants demand thirty days' notice.\n\nIf I am in the wrong, I am certainly not aware of it. I do not wish to sail under any false colours. I have tried to tell you the facts as they are. I am willing to abide by your decision regarding my case, whatever that decision may be, but I do not feel that I should meekly take what I consider to be the Agent's unfair treatment, without making some effort to defend myself and present my side of the case.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Mrs.) Margaret Warden\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa, January 5, 1930.\n\nArthur C.

As he had twice come here in a very ugly temper and had used abusive and insulting language towards me, I feared what he might do upon this occasion, and therefore told him that I would talk to him through the glass in the door. He asked me if I refused him admission to this house, and I said yes, unless he could produce papers giving him the right to enter. He immediately left without a word, and shortly afterwards Elias Chegahno, constable, arrived. I opened the door to him at once, as he has always acted courteously and respectfully towards me. He handed me a letter from the agent, saying as he did so, that I was to open school Monday. Upon reading the letter, I found that the Department had advised Mr. Poste that an investigation was proceeding, and that I was to be allowed to teach during January.\n\nThanking you again for your promptness and leniency,\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Mrs.) Margaret Warder.\nCape Croker, Ont\nJan 7/1930\n\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nDear Sir:\n\nBy resolution of\nthe Cape Croker Indian Council\nsupported by the entire Indian\nBand of this Reserve, you\nare hereby appealed to, for\nyour advice and counsel\nrespecting the injustice, which\nwe believe, is being imposed\non one of our best and\nefficient school teachers on\nour Reserve, namely:\nMrs Margaret Warder of\nour Sidney Bay Indian Day\nSchool, who has been\ndismissed, by our Indian\nAgent Mr Arthur Post, from\nher position here for no\nreason at all whatever other\nthan a sheer gossip of the\nmost groundless character and of which said Mrs. Warder was not even given a chance to defend herself against. Neither, we believe, was the proper procedure taken by our Indian agent in taking such action, without consulting the Indian Council, the school trustee of our Reserve, which had he done so, would have without a doubt resulted in holding or conducting an investigation regarding Mrs. Warder's alleged misconduct. This, to our belief, is British justice, and other than such cannot be tolerated by the said Indian Council and the people it represents.\n\nMrs. Warder has elevated the standard of the school in her care to such an extent that the people of that community has earnestly appealed to this\ncouncil to have her retained till, at least, the end of the term, July 1st, if not longer.\n\nWe therefore hereby earnestly appeal to you for your support to this end and we sincerely hope that you will grant the appeal of this council.\n\nSigned on behalf of the Cape Croker Indian Council and the Band.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature for Council]\nJanuary 7, 1930.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith letter of O.

I am told that the Indians generally are very much satisfied with Mrs. Warder and anything the Department can do in the matter will be greatly appreciated by them.\n\nKindly send your reply to this letter to me when it will be forwarded to Mr. Johnston.\n\nWill you please acknowledge receipt of this letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nLeigh H.

In this connection I have to say that Mrs. Warder has forwarded her resignation to take effect February 1st, next. The department is writing her accepting her resignation from the date mentioned.\n\nIt will be necessary for you to take immediate steps to endeavour to secure a teacher to succeed Mrs. Warder in time, if possible, to begin duties on the 3rd proxime. You should consult the Public School Inspector who may be able to recommend a teacher. I may say that the Department has on file an application from Miss Evelyn Watchorn, R.R. No. 4, Wiarton, for this position. She has no professional qualifications, but, in the event of not obtaining a qualified teacher, her application might be considered by yourself and the Inspector for temporary appointment for the balance of the present school year.

Jones, Councillors Thomas Solomon, Alex. Johnson and Wilfred Lamorandiere, also the Rev. Father Cadot and Rev. Andrew Edington, Indian Missionaries.\n\nWithout going fully into the details of the different views expressed by these men, I have no hesitation in reporting that I find Mrs. Warder has acted in a most indiscreet manner in her associations with Lawrence Kesshig, an Indian of the band who bears a very unsavoury reputation on the reserve. This friendship with Kesshig which Mrs. Warder freely admits, has led to a great deal of nasty gossip and insinuations among the people of the reserve and also in the neighbouring white communities.\n\nI am not prepared to say what truth there may be in this gossip, but it is very evident that she is under suspicion by a great number of the Indian people, and her influence for the betterment of moral conditions among the Indians is not at all what we expect from our teachers in Indian Schools.\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIt was brought to my attention that certain resolutions in favour of retaining Mrs. Warder as teacher were passed by the Council at the January meeting on the 6th instant. In this connection I might say that some of the movers and seconders of these resolutions came to see me at the Agency office on Thursday and stated that it was owing to the explanations offered by Lawrence Kesshig - who is himself a Councillor - that they took this action and that they regretted having done so and would take no further action on behalf of Mrs. Warder.\n\nI had a long talk with Mrs. Warder and at the close she decided to resign, owing to the unfriendly attitude of a number of parents in her school section and to forward her resignation to the Department to take effect on the 31st instant.\n\nIf considered necessary a more detailed report on this matter is available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector.\nKINGSVILLE, ONT.

She received her permanent second class certificate Oct. 26-1925.\n\nOn August 18th 1924 she was engaged as teacher in a rural ungraded school, S.S.No.I.Bond, at Shillington, Ont., in the District of Cochrane. She did fairly satisfactory work in this, her first school, for 1 year.\n\nFrom Sept. 6th 1925 until the end of June 1926, she taught the junior room of a two-room school in S.S.No.I.Whitney, at Porcupine, Ontario. Her work in S.S.No.I.Whitney was very satisfactory to all concerned. I consider her to be a young lady of excellent morals and high ideals, with a very kind and agreeable disposition. She was conscientious and diligent, and her work showed improvement consistent with her experience. I can recommend her as a teacher who may be depended upon to do good average work or better.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL.A. Marlin,\nPublic School Inspector.\n\nMr. Arthur C. Poste\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOffice of Indian Agent,\nCape Croker,\nOntario.\nCape Croker, Ont.\nJan. 20, 1930.\n\nMr. J. C. Paste,\nIndian Agent,\nCape Croker, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI understand that after February 1st you will require a teacher for Sydney Bay School and hereby make application.\n\nI am a graduate of North Bay Normal School and hold a Permanent Second Class Certificate having five years teaching experience, three years in the Junior Room of a semi-graded school and two years in ungraded schools. I also hold a Grade B Strathcona Certificate in Physical Training.\n\nMy religion is Protestant.\n\nSalary expected is $80 a month.\nMr. L. A. Martin, H.S. Cochran, Ont.,\nand Mr. W. L. Cowden, Kingsville, Ont.,\nunder whom I taught, have given me\nthe privilege of using their names for reference.\n\nShould I be successful in obtaining this position at your school I would do all in my power to further the interests and work of the pupils and school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeorgina Edington,\nCape Croker, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to reply to your letter No 3-2-1, dated Jan. 16th inst., regarding a teacher for No 2, Sidney Bay School.\n\nWhen I first received instructions from the Department, that they wished to dispense with the services of Mrs Warder as teacher of Sidney Bay School, I engaged as a substitute teacher, Miss Georgina Edington, of Cape Breton. There was little time to do anything else, and as Miss Edington possesses a permanent second class certificate, I considered her qualified to take charge of this school as a substitute teacher until the summer holidays.\n\nI have written to Mr McCool, Public School Inspector for East Bruce, and have received a reply from him to the effect that he knows of no teacher at present whom he could recommend for the school at Sidney Bay.\n\nEnclosed please find an application from Miss Edington, with her credentials, and I recommend that she be engaged as a substitute teacher for No 2, Sidney Bay Day School, until the summer holidays. After this term, the position could be advertised, and a permanent teacher engaged. If the Department approves or sanctions this, will you please send permission for a Mrs Robertson, to live with Miss Edington, at Sidney Bay School, as a companion.\n\nSecretary,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 23, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, nominating the services of Miss Georgina Edington for the position as teacher of the Sidney Bay Indian Day School to succeed Mrs. Warder who has resigned, and enclosing Miss Edington's application, together with testimonials regarding her previous experience.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Edington, to begin duties February 3rd, next. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $80 per teaching month. It is noted that she possesses a permanent second class certificate and has had previous teaching experience. Her appointment is for the balance of the present school year only, and her retention in the position after that time will depend entirely upon the success with which she meets in her work. Please inform her of her appointment and arrange with her to take up duties on the date mentioned. I have to request that you will give her every assistance you can in her work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. C.

I would wish to know if there is an error in regards the amount of this cheque before I hand it to her, for if there is there will not be much chance of getting a refund on an overpayment.\n\nSecretary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDept of Ind. Affs.\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 19, 1923.\n\nSir,-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 13th instant, I beg to say that the salary allowed the teacher of the Sidney Bay Indian day school for the past school year was at the rate of $500.00.\n\nThe school year commences on September 1st, and ends on June 30th. For the September quarter last, Miss McIver was allowed $16.00 for the six days she taught the school during the month of September, 1922, and Miss Jones was allowed $30.00 for the period she was in charge during the same month. For both the December and March quarters Miss Jones was paid one-quarter of her yearly salary or $125.00. When the June quarter return was received the number of days taught by Miss Jones since the time she took charge of the school was checked and it was considered that she was entitled to the balance of the annual salary allowed the teacher of this school.\n\nAs stated above, $46.00 was paid for the month of September, 1922, and $125.00 for both December and March quarters, making a total of $296.00. We, therefore, issued a cheque in favour of Miss Jones for $204.00 which completes the full amount due her to June 30, 1923.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

If she succeeds in obtaining a second class certificate, an increase of $100 will be allowed. You will be good enough to inform her accordingly. She should make application in due time to take the course at the Model School. You will be good enough to inform the Department as soon as she completes the course as to the results obtained by her, in order that we can definitely decide the increase that will be allowed, as any such increase will be based on the results achieved.\n\nIt is noted that both the enrolment and average attendance at this school has increased since Miss McGarvey took charge, and that the parents are satisfied with her services and desire that she remain for another term.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

When in Wiarton today I interviewed the mailman who delivers on the rural route that Mrs Warder gets her mail and he has no recollection of any certain letter.\n\nDuring the month of April, owing to bad roads the mailman did not go by way of Sidney Bay School and a resident from that section used to meet him at Port Elgin and get the mail, but there were days the man did not meet the mail and it was left in another Indians mail box and it appears to me that this letter must have been taken away by some Indian who has opened it and is now afraid to give it up and it is also impossible for me to find who would take it.\n\nI have instructed the constable to enquire among the Indians to see if it can be traced and in the mean time another cheque should be issued Mrs Warder and addressed to her as R.R.No 5 Wiarton, Ont. instead of R.R. 2 as stated in your letter. This cheque could be sent in my care and if any trace can be found of the other I will return it to you, so there would not be a duplicate cut.

In your letter of the 4th of June last, No. 1895, you advised me to purchase several articles which was necessary, and also get some repairs made.\n\nI have those matters was attended to as soon as possible afterwards. I now enclose you the bills for payment, and also one from Mr. G. Sinclair for combined seats and desks for Sidney Bay School.\n\nThis was necessary as there has been a good attendance of pupils at this school. With regard to taking in more ground at this Brodie School I may say it is impossible to do so as there is a road in front of the building, and another along side of it, and on the other side is quite a large orchard of fruit-trees belonging to the Quadjiwon family. Where this school is situated is a very bad site. It is nearly impossible to keep the fence up as the rock is near the surface and cannot put the posts down deep, then the frost raises them in the winter. However, we are doing the best we can under the circumstances, I may say, and somewhat at a loss to know what advise.\nI should give you with regard to enforcing the compulsory attendance of pupils at the schools. After receiving a copy of the regulations at the first council meeting I laid the matter before them and explained to them if there was not better attendance I would be forced to put this act in force. I think it had some effect as there was better attendance afterwards. You will observe there is a large decrease in the children here, as some fifteen or eighteen went to Muncey and Wikwemikong industrial schools. This causes a great falling off in the attendance about schools here. All things considered I think it may be as well to let matters stand as they are at present. Everything this will be satisfactory.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHayton Reed Esqr.\nD. V. G. I.

Inspector.\n\nIn the copy of the Inspector's report received by me, he recommends a wood shed for each of the three schools viz: Cape Croker, Port Elgin and the only Bay. I am of the same opinion as the Inspector, as these schools each require a suitable wood shed and also all the Indians I have spoken to, want a shed at each school.\n\nWhile the subject of wood shed building is in hand I would be equally interested at the Council House. I think that these four sheds could be built having shingle roofs for a little more than one hundred dollars. If board roofs were used the cost would be less. Certainly the shingle roof would pay in the long run. As regards Indians I think it should be advisable to give the Indians the same privilege as whites as we have several carpenters among these Indians here who do good work in this respect.\n\nCouncil meets Monday May 26th. I will lay the matter before their meeting.\n\n(Signed) Dept. Indian Affairs\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nOttawa\n\nJohn M.

OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nNOV 25 1908\nARCHITECT.\nMemorandum:\n\nFor the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRe Sydney Bay School, Cape Croker Agency.\n\nThis school (from the reports submitted) appears to have been built either on soft uncertain ground, foundation of insufficient depth, lack of proper bonding in the foundation or insufficient drainage around foundation allowing the frost to lift the building when soil becomes frozen to a sufficient depth. The building is evidently in a bad condition, if not dangerous, as shown by the report of Agent McIver dated November 4th, and also by resolution of the band November 2nd last, and should be put in good condition as soon as possible.\n\nIt is impossible to determine the reason for the defect in the building without a personal examination, and as the season has so far advanced that good work this year is uncertain, I therefore advise that temporary supports be put in to prevent collapse of any portion of the walls at this time and an inspection of the building and permanent repairs made in the spring as soon as weather is favourable for the work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the meantime supports of timber will be placed against the wall so as to keep the stones in place as shown on the accompanying sketch.\n\nYou will be good enough to have this bracing put in without delay so that the building may sustain no further damage until permanent repairs are made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJohn McIver, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMcIver,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of December 1st\n\nNo. 153-818-5\n\nReferring to the resolution of the Cape Breton Council last fall and the dangerous condition of the Sydney Bay School walls, as reported by me in communications of that time and the lateness of the season it was left over to done the first of spring. This should be attended too at once as the snow and frost has all disappeared.\n\nIn the blue print, with sketch, showing how to have the bracing put in, upon close examination I found it was not necessary to put any expenses on last fall. I consulted Mr. Robertson a good stone mason who lives in the town of Windsor who has every thing necessary for doing the work good and cheaply. I showed him the work last fall and he agreed with me that it was best to leave it off until spring until the snow and frost had gone. He is ready to come now and do the reclining work. It is hard to make an exact estimation but the cost will not be high as the material such as stone used is\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo.\n\nright close at hand but the line will have to hauled from Newton a distance of 14 miles.

The bell has to be fixed in it properly, as some of the little iron are loose and the wooden parts are rotten off at the bottom.

H. Robertson of Wiarton, will take down the whole wall, where it is cracked, on both sides as far back as the first windows and a considerable way towards the door, at the front, on both sides, digging out and making a thorough foundation, and re-building it, leaving everything complete, plastering and everything, for from $200 to $250. He will bring everything in good order, plastering and patching and re-commissioning. He said it is hard to estimate, slowly till the wall is pulled down. But this estimate will be fair. But this estimate will be fair.\n\nRegarding the Carpenter work for building a good belfry on this school house, subject to Departments plans, he will build a good one for about\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo.\n\nTwenty dollars, $20.00 furnishing everything and guaranteeing a good job.\n\nThe first Belfry which was put on all the schools of this Reserve were a very plain affair and the bells were always getting out of order.\n\nThen about the closets for the school, the carpenter, Mr. Chas Logan tells me it is impossible to repair the old closet to make any kind of a job of it, and I think he is right. If the Department has suitable plans he would like to have them. He asks $20.00 each for separate closets, and if a double one was built with a partition he could do it for less, but according to the school laws of Ontario we had better have them according to the school regulations and be up to date. He will take down the old one and fill up the pit.\n\nThere are a great number of large stones in this school yard which should be taken out, as the school yard is too rough for the children to play in, the smallest pupils.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nespecially often falling over the stone while playing and hurting themselves. The teachers have often complained about this to me. It also needs levelling and filling in front of the school house and gate so it is a regular mud hole in the fall and spring. The school board said it should be attended to. The stone mason could attend to this work, and he could engage some Indians to help him at it. A good deal could be done to it for from $10 to $20. It would need graveling from the door to the gate.\n\nIf these improvements were made the school and its surroundings would be in a condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nDep. Ind.

I am the opinion however that owing to its present very dangerous condition it will be better to demolish and rebuild using the same materials (providing it is the intention of the Department to maintain a school at this point) as there is no certainty that after building up the walls and corners now falling out and buttressing the bulging walls that the building will remain safe for any length of time.\n\n(Signed) Robert M.

In the meantime the Department would like to have the views of the band with reference to erecting a new structure, and whether there is any building available where the school might be temporarily conducted. The attendance during the past year was very small and it would not require a large building to accommodate the children.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJohn MoIver, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMoIver, Ont.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\n\nNo.\n\nALSO TO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nRef.: Your Letter July 27th 1909 No./53818/5\n\nSIR:\n\nReplying to the Department's Correspondence regarding the Sidney Post School and the unsafe state of the present structure we are not supposed to take risks of this nature and the Department steps are in hand wise in not occupying it, a good many of the Council and leading men are absent at present and it will require some time to get the Indians to decide as to where find of building etc., etc.\n\nIn the mean time I can arrange for a small and suitable building at a rental of about from $1.50 to $2.00 per month from Mr. John Angus.

And the one they have now would want more salary.\n\nAs a suitable place to build the schoolhouse, I thought say that in company with liberal Indians I went to find a place. And they decided to buy an acre of land from John P. Waikay South West corner of lot 2 Con 2. Now this is a good place for the school and there is a good well close at hand which will furnish water for the children.\n\nWaikay wants $15.00 for the land.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. E. Parker\nOttawa, May 19, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, in which you enclose a resolution passed at the meeting of the Cape Croker Council, in which they ask that a stone building 36 feet by 28 feet to accommodate 25 pupils be built in the Sidney Bay section, the cost not to exceed $1600.00.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department desires to have further information on this matter. In the first place this school is considerably larger than is necessary to accommodate 25 pupils. It is not thought that a building of this description can be erected for the sum voted by the Band, unless it is proposed to use the material in the old school-house. The Council may have had this in view when forming their estimate. You should also state whether a stone building would cost more than a frame and, if so, how much, also whether the Indians would be agreeable to the erection of a frame building.\n\nThese matters must be decided before any time is spent in the preparation. There may be available in the Department plans for a frame building of sufficient size which can be erected for the sum mentioned, if such a building would be satisfactory.\n\nIt is thought that a building 24 feet by 30 feet\n\nG. E. E. Parke, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWiarton, Ont.\nwould be of sufficient size for 25 pupils, if this is the full number it is necessary to provide for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of May 19\n\nNo. 183818/5\n\nRe schoolhouse at Sidney Bay. The Indians thought that a stone school could be built cheaper than frame, but on making inquiries from both masons and carpenters they say one would cost as much as the other. Only a stone building would last, need painting after it was up, and a frame would require paint every two or three years. Both stone and frame could be easily got at Sidney Bay.\n\nIn regard to size of school one 26 x 32 would be about the right size. I might refer you to a letter received by me dated April 8th 1910 3818/5 in which you say you have a suitable plan to accommodate 25 pupils. How if you would mail it to me I could get a man to figure out the cost.\n\nThe Indians seem to think $600 ought to build a school, but both material and labor are a good deal higher now, and all the lumber will have to be hauled from Warton to Sidney Bay.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is seated to hold 24 pupils, but a few more can be accommodated without inconvenience. It is heated by a stove and provision is made to bring in fresh air from outside and have it heated before distribution in the school-room.\n\nThis would probably be a suitable plan for the Sidney Bay Section and you will be good enough to obtain an approximate estimate of the cost of erecting this building both in frame and stone. The plan is for a frame building, but the required alterations can be made in both plans and specifications should it be decided to use stone. It would also be well to place this building on a stone foundation if constructed of frame.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. E. E.

The Indians of the Band in May, last, passed a Resolution authorizing the expenditure of a sum not exceeding $1600.00 from their funds to erect a stone building to accommodate 25 pupils. The Department has a plan prepared by Mr. Ogilvie which, it was thought, might be suitable and this plan was submitted to the Agent, who obtained an estimate from a local contractor. It is thought that a stone building in accordance with this plan can be erected for the sum voted by the Council. The new building should be put up, if possible, this season and I would recommend that Mr. Ogilvie be asked to prepare, at his earliest convenience, the necessary plans and specifications, so that tenders may be called for.\n\nH.J.

In view of the fact that the proposal to furnish water by pipe from the spring at Sydney Bay has been given consideration, it is not thought well to go to any expense of erecting a pump house there until such time as a final decision is reached.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAust.

I sent most of these accounts to the Dept some time ago. The account for $15.50 was paid for fencing the land bought from Paul Haffron, at the No. 1 Depot. There is also an account for $7.50. This is for a large plate glass 2 ft 2 in. x 3 ft. As the glass was about 1/2 in. thick, it had to be bevelled on all sides to fit the grooves in the door. As the glass in the door was broken accidentally, I had to get a new one.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Office\n\nP.O.

He did not come, and I hear that he is away from the Reserve at present, so thought it as well to forward them myself, as I may not see him for some time to make the necessary explanations.

There is also a chance to teach table manners.\n\nBeans are saved from the school gardens for winter soup.\n\nThe hot cocoa is a great favorite. Also scanty lunches are helped on by more substantial fare.\n\nI think the $10 granted by the Department for school lunches is a good thing, and should be continued.\n\nOf course it makes more work and supervision for the teachers but it pays in the increased welfare of the children.\n\nIsabella McEwen\nTeacher\n\nFor\nThe Indian Department\nOttawa\nOttawa, January 5, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has received a request from Miss McIvor for a continuation of the grant to provide a mid-day meal for the pupils of the Sidney Bay Indian Day School.\n\nYou may, after consulting Miss McIvor as to the supplies which she will require for this purpose, expend an amount not to exceed $10.00 in the purchase of the same, and you should forward properly itemized accounts, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

No authority was given you to have these repairs made. This well is not the property of the Department and you had no authority to have these repairs undertaken. This account will not be paid until a full explanation is received from you as to why you exceeded your authority and authorized these repairs being made without having first obtained the consent of the Department. You will be good enough to furnish a full explanation as to your action in this matter. It should be distinctly understood that no expenditure should be incurred by you until you have advised the Department as to the cost of the same and have received explicit instructions to have the work carried out. If you adhere to these instructions in the future it will save both yourself and the Department unnecessary trouble and expense.\n\nYou will be good enough to furnish at once your explanations for having this work completed without authority, as the Department cannot consider payment of the account until these are received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

I came out to get a requisition form for school material from the Indian Agent here at the end of June to ask for drawing material, which the school needed for exhibition purposes for the school fair. So when school opened in Sept. 20 the time was too short then to get it.\nfrom the Indian Dep. Rent to Wheaton for some. What was sent me was more expensive than what I ordered or wished. But we need some of it for our school fair drawing. What is on hand will do for the future for some time.\n\nAnother matter\u2014my dwelling at the school was entered in summer vacation, and sheets, towels, some winter wearing apparel was stolen; also a pair of stockings torn by a third class pupil to show at the fair. Keys had been used to unlock the doors. I mentioned this matter to the agent, but he made no answer. The articles (except the knitting) were my own property, as the Dep. did not furnish any bedding, towels, dishes, or kitchen utensils, when I came into residence here.\nI would ask the Department, in view of the loss which I have sustained, to kindly furnish me with a couple pair flannel-like sheets or blankets for winter use; the same to remain the property of the Dep. so house furnishings here.\n\nI ask for your kind help in this matter.\n\nWith kind and respectful greetings,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nIsabella McInerney\n\nTeacher\n| Item Description                        | Quantity | Price |\n|----------------------------------------|----------|-------|\n| 2-12 Sheet Drawing Paper               |          | 2.40  |\n| 1 Box Water Color Paints               |          | .50   |\n| 3 Paint Brushes (Brushes)              |          | .60   |\n|                                        |          | 3.50  |\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is too low and the refuse from animals watered there runs back in the well and it needs raising about 1\u00bd feet and about five yards of gravel put around the pump so that it will be considerably higher than the ground level. It would mean an expenditure of around $20.00 for the piping necessary to raise the pump and the gravel and I would recommend its repair.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) A. D.

The whole exterior woodwork of the School needs painting as well as the Verandah of the residence needs floor and pillar repairs. The ceiling in the kitchen of the teachers residence needs plastering as it was not put on heavy enough when done originally and is peeling off. I am not prepared to state the cost of these repairs, unless I secured tenders, but would estimate it in the vicinity of $100.00 for a complete overhauling as I have stated above.\n\nI would not recommend that this work be done during the cold weather or by inexperienced workmen and from all appearances it could well wait until next Summer vacation time, when I would recommend it be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 28, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, relative to the repairs required to the ceiling, the cleaning of the interior walls and the painting of the exterior woodwork at the Sidney Bay Indian Day School. The work which you state should be carried out at this school is noted, but, as stated by you, as the season is now late, this work can stand over until the summer holidays. You should draw the matter of any repairs, painting, etc., required at this school to the attention of the Department early next spring, when consideration will then be given to authorizing having the work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The ceiling of the School room needs plastering as well as one wall, one cloak room and they are badly cracked and in some places the plaster is off or very loose. One cloak room needs murescuing again. The interior woodwork needs varnishing, the kitchen in the residence needs plastering and painting on the ceiling, the outside stone work needs pointing in some places, the whole exterior woodwork needs painting badly with two coats, the residence verandah needs repairs to the pillars and floor, the wood shed needs a new roof, some boards on the walls and a coat of shingle stain on the whole shed, the outerhouses need some small repairs to doors and seats as well as new boxes and then painted, some windows need fresh puttying and two panes of glass replaced.\n\nBy the looks of the plaster used on this School it was of an inferior quality and not properly done and a good man should do this work and I believe it would be best to let the whole job by tender to a properly qualified person and the total cost would run in the vicinity of $250.00\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind.

Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCape Croker, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that I have asked for tenders for the repairs to be done to Sidney Bay and Port Elgin Schools on this Reserve and that the tender made by the C.E.Whicher Ltd has been accepted and work to commence at once. The C.E.Whicher tenders being, for Sidney Bay School $435.00 and for Port Elgin School $289.00. The tender submitted by the Hunter Hardware Co Warton was for Sidney Bay School $455.00 and Port Elgin School $329.50 and of the two I accepted the lowest tenders.\n\nThe work to be done is as follows:\n\n**Sidney Bay School**\n- Woodshed, one door 2' X 6' with hinges and latch.\n- 100 ft of hemlock lumber and repaired.\n- Roof 17' X 19' to be roofed with arrollock shingles, old shingles to be taken off and roof papered.\n- Verandah, 8 posts 6' X 6', 8 feet 2 inches high to be replaced.\n- Paint veranda, size 9' X 24' two coats.\n- Repair veranda floor 26 inches by 9 feet.\n- Outer houses, arrollock shingles on both roof, size 7' X 11'.\n- One coat of School house red on buildings and board screens. 4 panes 7\" X 7\", 1 pr of 4 inch hinges, one board 6\" X 10\", one sash with four lights 7\" X 7\" complete.\n\n**School proper**\n- Arrollock shingles on building 26' X 59'.\n- 200 feet of ridge board. Paint whole exterior including windows, storm windows, porches, etc.\n- Two coats, re-glaze all storm windows and others needing same, replace 1 pane 24\" X 24\", 2, 18\" X 30\", 7 panes 18\" X 24\", put storm windows on with screws instead of nails.\n\n**School room**\n- Remove plaster and gyproc ceiling 20' X 24', west wall 8' x 20', paint interior two coats, one coat of varnish on woodwork and desks tops.\n- Paint windows one coat, repair plaster in cloak rooms and give one coat of murocco, new lock on front door.\n\n**Kitchen**\n- Gyproc ceiling and paint ceiling and walls one coat, size 11' X 12' and replace 4 panes 3\" X 12\".\nPort Elgin School.\n\nSchool house proper.\n\nArro lock shingles on building 41' X 52', with 230 feet of ridge board.\nPaint whole exterior including, two porches, all windows and storm windows\nwoodshed etc two coats, glaze storm windows, and repair others. replace\n4 panes 12\" X 14\", 1.6\" X 12\", 1.14\" X 26\".\n\nOuterh uses.\n\nPaint with one coat, including screens\nand replace one board 6\" X 8 feet.\n\nThese repairs are more extensive than at first\nexpected and I was very much out in my estimates and in\nboth cases the arrolocks shingles alone would nearly\nmake up my totals. The closeness of the orders in their\ntotals shows that this work was figured closely by the\nmen tendering and that the amounts is conservative.\n\nI propose doing Cape Croker School under my own\nsupervision and by Indian labor and have the furnace\nrepairs done by a Wiarton mechanic after the teachers\nreturn.\n\nSecretary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 13th, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the repairs and painting required at the Sidney Bay and Port Elgin Indian Day Schools and stating, in detail, the work that is to be performed. In this connection it is noted that you have obtained quotations from two parties and that you have accepted the lowest quotation, that of C. E. Whisher, viz., $435 for the work at Sidney Bay and $289 for the work at Port Elgin. Your action in this matter is approved. It is noted that considerably more work has to be performed than was at first expected but it is hoped that all the work as mentioned by you at each of these schools will be finished before the schools re-open after the present summer holidays. You should see that the work is satisfactorily completed and that a good grade of material is used. It is understood that Mr. Whisher will supply all material and labour for the prices quoted. You should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of the work for each school separately. These vouchers should state, in detail, the work performed at each school.\n\nIt is noted that you intend having the work required at the Cape Croker School carried out under your supervision, employing Indian labour, and that the furnace will be repaired later, after the teacher returns.

The wood for this stove is cut, and would probably not fit a new stove.\n\nThe cook stove in the teachers residence is very unsatisfactory. To begin with, it is a coal stove and smokes badly. It is a very old stove, and practically burnt out, and I would recommend that a new cook stove be bought for the teacher's residence.\n\nI found that the wood supply is insufficient for next winter's use, and that about five more cords of wood will be required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Ind. Affs.\nOttawa.\n\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa, August 16, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, relative to the condition of the stoves in the school and teacher's residence at the Sidney Bay Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that you consider the box stove in the school would be satisfactory for another year. If any repairs are needed to this stove to make it satisfactory for the coming winter, you may arrange to have same carried out. The Department will approve of your purchasing a cook stove of a type considered suitable for the use of the residence. It is not intended that you incur any large expenditure for this purpose. You should obtain a suitable stove at as reasonable a cost as possible.

Some of the posts have rotted and the wire is sagging.\n\n\"Both the boys' and girls' closets should have the entrance step replaced; these have been broken and carried away.

These repairs should receive your early attention and, when the work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should forward accounts in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of any material required and for the labour in having the work carried out.\n\nThe Inspector further states that a teacher's desk is required as the one at present in use is badly worn and should be replaced. Please state if you would recommend that this equipment be furnished and, also, whether a teacher's chair is required. If you will furnish the necessary shipping directions, the order for the above could be placed here.\n\nMr. McGookin also reports that the interior of the teacher's residence requires redecoration but that this could stand over until next year.

I assisted the mechanic in every way possible, and it was also necessary to hire an Indian for some of the labour.\n\nAs the school, and adjoining section, depend on this pump for drinking water, I considered it necessary to have it repaired without delay. We experienced great difficulty in taking the pump out, as the cylinder parted in the well. It was an extremely delicate matter to raise this again, as if it had fallen, the well would have been ruined. The mechanic refused to stay on the job to take the responsibility unless I remained with him, to assist.\n\nI am unable to find records here whether this pump is Band, or School property, so do not know to which the charges should be made. There will be an account from the Hunter Hardware, for equipment necessary for the pump repairs, which I will forward to the Department, on receipt of same.\n\nEnclosed please find voucher forms, one in favour of myself, for $2.00, which I paid Wm. Preulx for wages for labour, and one for Walt Wright, the mechanic, for $20.00.\n\nEncls.\n\nSecretary,\n\nIndian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nIN ACCOUNT WITH\n\nHunter Hardware Company Ltd.\n\nHardware, Plumbing, Stoves, Paints, Oils, Bicycles and Auto Accessories.

(RG 10, Volume 6166, file 433-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, October 6, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of a requisition from the teacher of the Sydney Bay Indian Day School for supplies for the use of the residence, a manual training bench with the necessary tools and a small heater for the living-room of the residence.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase of two panes of glass of the size required for the residence, also one small tea kettle. Owing to the cost, we are not prepared at the present time to supply \"Comstock's Hand Book of Nature Study\". Regarding a small heater for the living-room, I have to say that, if you consider this is absolutely necessary, you may arrange for the purchase and installation of a heater that would be satisfactory for the purpose for which it is required by the teacher.\n\nRegarding the manual training bench and tools, I shall be pleased to have a report from you as to whether you consider this equipment is absolutely necessary. Our funds this year are extremely limited and only the most urgent requirements can be authorized. However, when we have your report regarding this equipment, further consideration will be given as to whether same can be supplied or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Poste, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCape Croker, Ont.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nCape Croker, Ont.\nOctober 12th, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to reply to the latter paragraph of your letter No 8-2-5, dated October 6th, inst., with reference to the necessity for a manual training bench and tools, for No 2, Sidney Bay School, on this Reserve.\n\nIn reply, I beg to state to the Department, that I do not consider there is immediate necessity for this equipment, as there are but two boys in the school who are old enough to take up the manual training work. I am informed by the teacher, Miss Edington, that next Spring, there will probably be two more pupils for this work, and if the Department approves, I beg to suggest that this matter be again taken up at a future date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 15, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, regarding the request that was made by the teacher of the Sidney Bay Indian Day School to be supplied with a manual training bench and tools.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that there is no immediate necessity for this equipment, and the Department is, therefore, not prepared to supply same at the present time. Should there be a sufficient number of boys who are old enough to take up manual training work next year, the matter of supplying a bench and tools could again be drawn to the attention of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

As there are several boy pupils, old enough to take the manual training at Sidney Bay school, I consider this might prove to be the best plan of supplying them with a bench.\n\nIn the event of the Department approving of this loan from the Cape Croker School, to Sidney Bay School, it would be necessary to transfer the bench by means of a truck.\n\nSecretary,\n\nDept. of Ind.

In this connection it is noted that there are five of these benches on hand at the Cape Croker Indian Day School, one of which the teacher there is willing to have loaned to the Sidney Bay School.\n\nThe Department will approve of the transfer of one bench from the Cape Croker to the Sidney Bay School. It is presumed that the Cape Croker School will also be able to provide the tools required, and these should be forwarded with the desk. You may have the bench and tools transferred by truck and forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the charges. It is understood that there is ample room in the school at Sidney Bay for the use of the desk by the pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nA. C.

They require decorating inside and out. I might say as I opened the door to enter number two school, a large piece of plaster fell down on my head. This is not a very commendable state of affairs. I quite realize that probably the inspectors do not appreciate my criticism, but as they are part of my constituents, and also that I am interested in the Indian affairs, I do like to visit them and point out the need of certain improvements. I find also that these pupils do not receive the proper text books for social studies. I see no reason why they should not receive the same courses that our provincial schools have.\n\nI would be pleased if you would take this up with the Minister and write me. I did not wish to mention this on the floor of the House, as I feel that they can be discussed much better in this matter.\n\nThanking you for your interest in these different matters, and with kindest personal regards,\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nW.R.

You might also have a report furnished by the Branch.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt\nPrivate Secretary\n\nEncl.\n\nDr. McGill -\n\nFor report and draft reply as requested.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6166, file 433-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 20, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA report has reached the Department that the teachers in charge of the Indian Day Schools No. 2 and No. 3, Cape Croker, are anxious to secure additional textbooks for social studies.\n\nI am anxious that you should secure from these teachers a list of the textbooks they have in mind. I may add that all the textbooks recommended by the Public School Inspector, Mr. J. M. Game, in his letter to the Department dated October 28, 1938, have been sent forward to these schools.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will remind these teachers that all requests for supplies, repairs to buildings, textbooks, etc., should reach the Department through the Indian Agent. I feel confident if the teachers observe this rule little difficulty will be experienced in securing either repairs to buildings or textbooks in the future. Teachers in Indian day schools, of course, are under no obligation to follow strictly the Ontario course of study. In this regard, may I remind the teachers, through you, of a circular sent out in January, 1927, in which the teachers were reminded that approximately one third of the study period might be devoted to manual training or vocational instruction.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nF. W. Tuffnell, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nR. R. #5, Wiarton, Ont.\nOttawa, November 19, 1928.\n\nRe: Indian Schools Nos. 2 and 3,\nCape Croker, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Tomlinson:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of November 18, in which you intimate that, in your judgment, the above noted schools are urgently in need of repairs. I note, also, your reference to the necessity for supplying certain text books to these schools.\n\nThe officials of the Indian Affairs Branch inform me that certain repairs were undertaken at the No. 2, Sidney Bay School, in April of this year. This work was undertaken by James Sims, of Warton. The supplies were provided by C. E. Whicher, Limited, of Colpoys Bay, Ontario. Inasmuch as no request for additional repairs to these schools has reached the Department from the Agent, the officials had the impression that both these schools were in reasonably good condition. However, instructions have been issued to Mr. T. McCookin, Inspector of Indian Agencies for Ontario, to make a special inspection of these schools and report to the Department, just as soon as he can conveniently do so. In the rules and regulations governing the operation of day schools, teachers are asked to send in requests for supplies, repairs to buildings, etc., to the Indian agent. It seems exceedingly difficult, however, in a number of cases, to get the teachers in charge of our schools to follow this practice.\n\nIt is not the policy of the Department to have the teachers in charge of our day schools adopt\n\nF.

I note, also, your reference to the necessity for supplying certain text books to these schools.\n\nThe officials of the Indian Affairs Branch inform me that certain repairs were undertaken at the No. 2, Sidney Bay School, in April of this year. This work was undertaken by James Sims, of Wiarton. The supplies were provided by C. E. Whitcher, Limited, of Colpoy's Bay, Ontario. Inasmuch as no request for additional repairs to these schools has reached the Department from the Agent, the officials had the impression that both these schools were in reasonably good condition. However, instructions have been issued to Mr. T. McGookin, Inspector of Indian Agencies for Ontario, to make a special inspection of these schools and report to the Department, just as soon as he can conveniently do so. In the rules and regulations governing the operation of day schools, teachers are asked to send in requests for supplies, repairs to buildings, etc., to the Indian agent. It seems exceedingly difficult, however, in a number of cases, to get the teachers in charge of our schools to follow this practice.\n\nIt is not the policy of the Department to have the teachers in charge of our day schools adopt\n\nW.

He says there is no use trying to drill on the old well any more as it caves in as fast as he drills it out.\n\nWould the Department approve of a new well being drilled. This old well was drilled many years ago and is not on the school property, if a new well were to be drilled I would recommend that it be on the school grounds.\n\nTo drill a new well cost per foot would be $1.50 and board for the drillers.\n\nInspector McGoakin could explain to the Department the situation of the pump as he looked it over when he was on the Cpaes Cropper Reserve.\n\nA immediate reply would be appreciated as this pump is badly needed for the school as there is no other water near by at all and it would be impossible to drill a well when the cold weather sets in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nOctober 12, 1939.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant it is presumed that you have already stopped work in drilling the old well near the Sidney Bay school.\n\nWhy did you not inform the Department previously that the well you were drilling was not on the school property?\n\nAre you aware, or can you ascertain from persons living in the vicinity, whether or not it is likely that water could be secured by drilling a well on the school property? How deep would the well have to be drilled? This information is required in order that we may compute the cost of the well. The only information you give in your letter is that the cost of drilling would be at the rate of $1.50 a foot.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. W. Tuffnell,\nIndian Agent,\nR.R. #5,\nWiarton, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI beg to reply to Departmental letter of October 12th, regarding well at Sidney Bay school.\n\nThe Department asks why I did not inform them before that the well being drilled was not on school property. I have to advise the Department that I had no intentions of drilling a well. The man who I engaged to repair the old pump tried to lift the cylinder but was unable to therefore decided if he used the drill he would probably be able to do something with it but as I explained in my letter of October 6th, it was of no use. I was only trying to repair the old pump.\n\nThis old well was drilled some forty years ago by three or four Indian family's and after the new school was built the Department apparently agreed to bear the expense of repairs to pump for the use of the water for the school but as these Indian family's are now either dead or have moved away was the reason I recommended the new well be drilled on school property, the old well is about 175 feet from school property.\n\nAs to how deep the well would have to be drilled is a very hard thing to estimate it may be anywhere from twenty five feet to one hundred and twenty five feet more or less but the driller guarantees water.\n\nI trust I have made this clear to the Department.\n\nA early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Aff's Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources.\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If it was necessary to drill 125 ft. it would mean an expenditure of almost $200. Our funds at the present time are reduced and we are unable to consider such a probable heavy expenditure. Under these circumstances no authority can be given for drilling a well at this time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F. W. Tuffnell,\nIndian Agent,\nR.

Money for drilling to come out of their band funds.\n\nThe water for use at the school has to be carried about a mile and up a very steep hill, this will almost be impossible when stormy cold weather sets in as the hill is very dangerous at times, and as I wrote the Department on October 17th, I can not estimate the approximate cost as it very uncertain how deep they will have to drill but would cost between $200.00 or $300.00.\n\nIf the Department approves of the well being drilled I would be pleased to be notified immediately so the work could be commenced as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I made requests through the Indian Agent to the Department to supply the necessary furniture for the dwelling. As I have been boarding all my life, I had no furniture on hand. After a long delay, the Agent at last informed me that the Dept. had granted $100 or for furnishing the dwelling. As you are well aware the buying power of a dollar is not even half of what it was some years ago.\n\nI went with the Agent to Wainston to help purchase the articles. Most of what we got is second-hand articles, as new was away beyond our means in price. But even then we could not get the necessary articles for the sum granted.\n\nI asked the Agent to\ngo a little beyond, feeling sure the Department would spend a little more where the cost of things at the present time is considered.\n\nThe bedding, blankets, towels, dishes, cutlery, and many other necessary articles in even the simplest housekeeping, I bought with my own money.\n\nLast year at Fort Elgin school, No. 3, on this reserve, when the teacher's residence was furnished, not only was\nmore and better furniture supplied, but every detail was supplied, even to table linens, rugs and curtains. Why this distinction in the schools? My salary is the smallest, only $450 of the three schools on the reserve. I know I deserve more, at least $500. But because I get the smallest salary I am supposed to buy for myself what is supplied to the other schools.\n\nI feel grateful to the Department for building this dwelling in which I am writing this night.\nI feel that I can do better work than living off the reserve, as I have been heretofore.\n\nNow, sir, I shall await your reply, and I hope the Department will pay for the few necessary simple articles of furniture which we have bought, if not, which to return to the dealer will be a puzzle. The cook stove is necessary, as also the table and few chairs, also the few articles of bedroom furniture. I cannot pay for them myself, as I could not move them away should I leave, and have no place to put them should I do so.\n\nI have never troubled the Department with letters or complaints, and in the present instance it is only that I feel that an injustice is being done to me, that I do so. I have given my most faithful service, all my life, and shall continue to do so, while a servant of the Department.\nAny period of adjustment is trying, and we settling settled in this residence I am smoothing the way for my successors.

Aff.\nOTTAWA, October 13th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, regarding the placing of eve-troughing on the teacher's residence at the Sydney Indian Day School, and also the replacing of the broken panes of glass.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Agent Garland is being instructed to have the broken glass replaced, and to furnish an estimate of the cost of the material and labour required in installing the eve-troughing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. H. Abraham, Esq.,\nAgricultural Representative,\nChatham, Ont.\nOTTAWA, October 13th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nThe attention of the Department has again been drawn to the necessity of having eve-troughing placed on the teacher's residence at the Sidney Bay Indian Day School; also to the matter of having some panes of glass, which are broken in the windows and door, replaced.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you will take the necessary steps as soon as possible to have the broken panes of glass replaced, and you should have this work done as cheaply as possible.\n\nRegarding the eve-troughing, it is desired that this work be carried out, if possible, this Fall, and you should state the cost of supplying the material, and the labour in having the work done.\n\nYour early attention to these matters will oblige\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. G. Garland, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCape Croker, Ont.\nSir,\n\nVisited Sidney Grey School\n\nYesterday.\n\nPatented 2 men employed at redecorating class-rooms. Each of these is being paid $3.50 a day. They expected to have finished this work about Tuesday or Wednesday, having started work on the 14th instant. The approximate cost of these rooms for this work would therefore be about $51.00. In addition there is the cost of material they are using\u2014which I understand will be between $5.00 and $10.00.\n\nGarland had also authorized redecoration of teacher's rooms. This certainly requires it\u2014but this I am informed will not be done. The old store is succeeding so badly\u2014in fact the place was filled with smoke when I was there\u2014so I told them not to do this decorating until I was advanced further.\n\nThe cookhouse she is now using is several years old and was bought second-hand. As the teacher has two stove for both her own cooking and preparing the mid-day meal\u2014I would strongly recommend\nSir,\n\nThe purchase of a new store at an approximate cost of $35.00 if the purchase is authorized as would be likely to proceed with the redecoration of the storehouse. The workmen state this would require about one week and the cost of the labor would be about $36.00. Material etc. would cost about $15.00 or $20.00. I would also recommend stores as it is certainly needed.\n\nAs the class-room will be finished about 27th instant - I would be pleased to receive reply by wire to the above recommendation - also if the repairs are to be done - as I should be obliged to advise the workmen before they leave the school. I expect to go over to Sydney Bay again Wednesday of next week Thursday morning.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nPhilip Palmer\n\nAddressing of Toronto Oct 17th\n\n[Signature]\n\nD. M.

I fully reported to you under cover of February 10th last, recommending that a school be erected at Elliott's Corners. No action appears to have been taken by you. The attendance at the Ohsweken School has been altogether too large, notwithstanding a large school building is there, it is not large enough to accommodate all. It is therefore most necessary that a school be opened to accommodate that section where Thomas School was held before the new Ohsweken School was erected.\n\nOur school Board recommended to the Chiefs at this Council meeting that Thomas' School be re-opened after the summer vacation, and as soon as it can be arranged a new school building be erected 1\u00bd miles north of the former Thomas School building. The Chiefs unanimously decided to re-open Thomas School after the summer vacation.\n\nI consider it most important to have a school in that section. This will greatly relieve the Ohsweken School attendance, and therefore beg to recommend that you at once notify me of your decision.\n\nI beg to recommend that you approve of the Chiefs' decision to re-open Thomas' School next month after the summer vacation.\n\nIt will be necessary to have your decision with as little delay as possible in order to secure a teacher. I am most anxious to have this done. If you think wise the Chiefs can control this school at least until you decide.\nuntil you decide as to there being but one School Board on the Reserve.\n\n(sgd) E.D.Cameron,\nInd.Supt.\nExtract from letter of E. D. Cameron, Indian Superintendent, Brantford, dated 15th December, 1906, to Secretary Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nFor some time a male teacher has been at No. 1 School. The present teacher of this school is Mr. Hubbard who has been most satisfactory to the board and all concerned until it has been noticed at times he is very peculiar and has shown signs of insanity. Before he was engaged on the Reserve he was a patient in the Hamilton Asylum. He was relieved of duties for the month of October during which time he was acting rather strangely. During his absence, Miss Jamieson who is a successful teacher and highly recommended had charge of the school; but could not manage it. The board therefore decided to advertise in the Toronto papers for teachers, as the Model schools are now closing, it is expected that several young men will be available. I beg to recommend that same receive your approval.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of your letter of the 13th inst., in which you state that the School Board has decided to advertise in the Toronto papers for a teacher for No. 1 school, Six Nation Reserve, to take the place of Mr. Hubbard, I beg to say that the action of the Board is approved.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nM.

He also refers to the qualifications of teachers as not being satisfactory. I have a large number of applications before me now for the filling of vacancies in the schools, they all ask salaries of from $650.00 to $700.00 and the School Board feel that they can afford to pay about that figure on account of the increased grant given by the Council.

The local Institute branch appointed a committee composed of Mrs. Greenwood, Mrs. Hardell, Mrs. Enos Hill, Mrs. F. D. Johnson and myself, to see if such a medical survey might not be arranged for soon and if a permanent system of medical school inspection for the reserve might not be in some way eventually established.\n\nWe have been to Mr. Standing for advice and he says that he will make the necessary application to the Dept. if you will authorize him so to do. Please authorize him and advise us as to what course to pursue to try to secure permanent regular inspection. Dr. Greenwood thinks it can be done by if\na high enough salary is offered for an assistant Dr. who could help him inspect the children regularly.

We have to face a deficit of some four thousand dollars on last year's working expenses, and at present no funds are available to enable us to wipe it out. Our farm has never done much more than pay its way and provide the institution with milk, butter, eggs, and vegetables. Prior to this, this institution practically existed on the Government grant paid by the Department, and the children were underfed and inadequately clothed. We were compelled on humanitarian grounds to increase the amount of food and clothing issued to the pupils. Since we came out food and clothing have practically doubled in cost and wages have had to be increased. This great increase in the cost of management has had to be met by inadequate, irregular and very\ngraduating remittances from England. The Treasurer of the New England Company now tells me that the Company is not in a position to send me the money I ask for, and that I must make ends meet by making more out of the farm.\n\nAnd ensuring strict economy in the conduct of the Institution. Without capital it is impossible to develop the farm, though we have done all in our power to improve the quality of the stock, and any further economies in the housekeeping department will be detrimental to the well being of the children and the efficiency of the Institution. In my opinion we ought to spend considerably more than we do, not less. I am writing very frankly because I know how greatly you are interested in Indian educational work. Like the Israelites of old we are being compelled to make bricks without straw. I am afraid the New England Company's aims have outgrown its resources, and the building schemes at this time are absorbing all their available funds. Possibly all the money deposited in the Bank here - the proceeds of the sale of part of the Globe - has been sent to Mr. Dawson, and consequently there are no reserve funds to\nThis much larger and more needed institution. We are always full and never have to answer for pupils. In fact there are + many children in the neighborhood who would be here had we the accommodation available for them. In the face of this it would be a shame to have to close down for lack of funds, but I do not see how we can possibly manage another year under present financial conditions. Personally I am of the opinion that we must never have proper administration and efficiency until the Department owns and manages the Indian Industrial Schools all through the Dominion. vested interests generally clash with the common weal, and sectarianism has much to answer for so far as child welfare is concerned. I must however ask you to treat this letter as confidential. The New England Company object to my writing to the Department on \"my own account\" and have requested me to furnish copies of all the correspondence that passes between us. However, as I hold no personal objects to serve and I am not afraid of being dismissed as an unmanageable servant who has a mind of his own, I feel it my duty to write.\nvery frankly to you in all matters concerning the wellbeing of\nthe work that has been entrusted to me.\n\nI am\nyour very truly\n\nC. V. Turner\n\nJ. B. Scott, Esq.\nIndian Dept.\nOttawa.\nJanuary 28, 1918.\n\nDear Mr. Turnell:\n\nI have your letter of January 22, regarding the present financial position of the Mohawk Institute. I intend as soon as I possibly can do so to bring the whole question of the financial position of our residential schools to the attention of the Minister. I am receiving like applications from many quarters, and we must take cognizance of the position and give it grave consideration.\n\nI shall, of course, consider your note as confidential.\n\nWith kind regards to Mrs. Turnell,\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

We need an assured income and one adequate to meet the demands made upon it. Salaries must be paid, the children must be properly fed and properly clothed, household equipment constantly needs replacing, and the premises must be kept in a state of decent repair.

We do all we can to keep down expenses and even pay the fees of visiting domestic science and music teachers ourselves as the Company is too mean to sanction such unnecessary luxuries. It seems to think that anything is good enough for Indian children. Small wonder that its efforts in the past have borne such little fruit. This place used to be a punitive hell under the Athion regime. Cells, dark rooms, leg irons, and whipping blocks were in frequent use whilst the diet given the children was most insufficient. We like the work and are deeply interested in the moral and physical well being of the children. It seems hard to be thrown aside just as soon as we were getting convenient with the many problems connected with the training of Indian children to make room for inexperienced new women sent to fill our places merely out of petty spite. As the income of the New England Company is certainly not sufficient to maintain\nMohawk Institution\nBrantford, Ontario\nCanada\n\nThis School in a condition of efficiency now insisted upon by present day educationalists has not the time come for the Department to take command of the situation? We have practically no modern equipment. Everything is practically worn out. The interior of the building has not been painted since it was built. All our income goes in clothes, food, fuel and wages and even with regard to these I am called extravagant and held responsible for the situation I am said to have created because we have not sufficient funds to pay the tradesmen's bills. Our own hands are plenty enough and have the same fuel as the rest of the staff. My position has been intolerable for a long time. I know what is needed. But I cannot do anything as my hands are tied. When I\nSpent out I am called insolent and get dismissed.\n\nThe Company has not forgiven the attitude of the department on the Glebe Question and intends to carry on in the same old way with its own property, resenting bitterly any outside interference.\n\nIt is a difficult problem, but I want you to give it your careful consideration, not so much to help me in a lucrative job\u2014it is anything but that\u2014but for the sake of future of Indian education in these parts.\n\nI suppose we shall have to go in any case, since I would like to know your views before I start looking for other employment.

I have to pay the penalty for putting the welfare of the children entrusted to me before my own personal interests. Can you do anything to save the situation? I think you know enough about us to realize that we are devoted to our work and are doing our best under circumstances of exceptional difficulty. The New England Company refuse to provide sufficient funds to enable us to feed or clothe the children in the very simplest way let alone maintain the premises and equipment in a state of decent repair.\n\nAny suggestions in the way of improvements made by officials of the Department are promptly turned down.

Smith,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nI fear Mr. Turner has been too outspoken in regard to his opinion of the habits, customs and actions of his predecessors in office.

Co's representation in Canada by a certain is perhaps moving in the matter.\nIndian Office, Brantford,\nMarch 20th., 1916.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have received your letter of the 15th inst. stating that Rev. Mr. Turnell has been given six months notice and that his services were to be dispensed with by the New England Company and asking my opinion in regard to it. I think it would be a most calamitous decision on the part of the Company to make any change in the principalship of the Mohawk Institute at the present time. For a great number of years there has been great antagonism between the officials of the Institute and the Council and other not Indians on the reserve which has resulted in the best interest of the children who go to the Institute. Since Mr. Turnell and his wife have taken charge, there has been a great change for the better, more parents are anxious to send their children than there is accommodation for, there is very much less truancy and absconding by the pupils than in former days, the children appear much happier look better cared for and better fed and there appears to be a more personal interest taken in the welfare of the children than in former years. I have gathered these impressions from my observations made when I make my periodical visits\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nvisits to the Institute and I sincerely hope that matters may be so arranged that Rev. Mr. Turnell may remain in charge.\n\nThe special knowledge, training and adaptability which Mr. Turnell possesses is also an added great value.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt.\nMay 17, 1918.\n\nDear Major Smith,\n\nRe dismissal of Mr. Turnell:\n\nI quote from a letter that I wrote to the New England Company on the 1st of May, 1918:\n\n\"I trust that the Company will not carry out the contemplated action without further consideration. It is my opinion that no change whatever should be made in the administration of the Institute until a properly qualified representative of the New England Company visits Canada and has an opportunity of discussing the present position and the future of the school with me. Unless this is done the Department cannot continue to pledge its financial support to the school in its present location.\"\n\nI do not know what the result will be.\n\nThere will be no objection for you to mention the matter to Mr. Turnell confidentially.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGordon J. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent General,\nBrantford, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 17th inst., regarding Mohawk Institute affairs I beg to state that this morning Mr. Turnell called me up to say that he had just received a cable to the effect that an investigation was to be made by the Adjutant-General, who when in civil life was Dr. E.C. Ashton, the eldest son of a former Superintendent of the Institute.\n\nMr. Turnell says he welcomes an investigation but at the same time he wants fair play, which he thinks he will not get under these conditions. He asked me to advise you on the matter.\n\nI doubt very much that such an investigation would be sufficiently free from tradition and bias to meet with your requirements.\n\nGeneral Ashton met me in the street the other day and asked me what was the trouble at the Mohawks. I replied that under war conditions the N.E.Co. did not furnish enough money even to feed the children sufficiently, let alone absolutely necessary repairs to the buildings.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C.

Ashton to make an investigation at the Mohawk industrial school, has been received here.

In addition to being \"extravagant\" I appear to have been discontented, dissatisfied, and in league with the department against my venerable employers. I am afraid it is a matter of personal unacceptability and therefore investigations are useless. Under the circumstances I have no desire to remain in the employment of the New England Company. The Bishop of Jamaica has offered me\nboth of a missionary character in his diocese and have decided to accept his offer. I protested against summary dismissal when acknowledging the formal notice given me by the company and my sentence has been altered into \"accepting my resignation.\" I have therefore resigned and expect to leave here in August for my new sphere of work where I hope to find the spiritual less dominated by the material. I must thank you and the officials of the department for the sympathetic support I have always received. Believe me I have tried to do what is right under peculiarly difficult circumstances. My predecessors bitterly resented changes and improvements here, as they reflected upon their own regime, and so they still have the ear of the company, a progressive policy on my part has met with little sympathy.\nMohawk Institution\nBrantford, Ontario\nCanada\n\nMay 30, 1918\n\nFor this reason the appointment of Major General Ashton as commissioner to represent the company is, to say the least, disastrous to any plans for improving conditions here. He is a product of the old system which in his eyes was ideal and will give little consideration to the wishes of the Department whose interference was always resented by the Ashtons.\n\nFrankly speaking I have been reaping the harvest sown by my predecessors whose cheap feeding economy at the expense of the children has resulted in the present situation.\n\nWith our united kind regards,\n\nI am\n\nDuncan C.

It was alleged that more than twenty children had run away this fall for that reason.\n\nOn my return here I consulted Mr. Ferrier, who assured me that this was gross exaggeration, that very few had run off, no more than usual at this time of year.\n\nI reached the conclusion that rumour, as usual, had greatly exaggerated the facts, and so did not consider any special reference to the Institute in my Report as either necessary or advisable.\n\nOf course, if you take a different view, I am most anxious to meet it, but I shall discuss this with you shortly, as I have some pressing matters on hand which are tying me up to-day, and will probably do so tomorrow,\u2014in fact, it is because I am even now awaiting an appointment that I am writing you this letter.\n\nThe investigation has already taken a good deal more time than we anticipated. I did not know until to-day just how long, but I have had a look at the ledger, and I find that I have been occupied for some forty-seven days. Wherever I was occupied for a full day I\ncharged it as such, and where for less I entered the exact number of hours involved. My account shows 27\u00bd days (I see I charged one half day as such), and 156 hours in addition, which at eight hours per day amounts to 19\u00bd days, or a total of 47 days.\n\nIn addition to this my disbursements for travelling expenses, hotel bills, etc., amount to $296.00, and I have made no charge whatever for living expenses apart therefrom. The usual allowance for \"living expenses\" is $15.00 per day, these including everything, so you see were I to put in my bill on that basis the disbursements would be $705.00, instead of the $296.00, which I propose to charge.\u2014I state this to show you that I am not trying to swell my bill.\n\nYou have already paid sums for witness fees, rent of hall, stenographer's services, etc., to an amount which your books will show, but which I have not got. Taking everything into consideration it would appear that the Parliamentary appropriation has already been somewhat exceeded.\n\nI suppose that the Mohawk investigation would take about three days more, including taking the evidence in Brantford, travelling back and forth, and preparing the supplementary Report.\n\nI earnestly desire to be of service to you and to the Department, and so I shall do this work for you if you finally conclude that it is necessary, even if I must perform it gratis, but this is a busy time of year for me, and it is always dangerous, from the business point of view, to be away from the office, as nearly all my clients are out of town people, and by being absent I stand a chance of losing valuable retainers in connection with projected Parliamentary legislation.\n\nI am sending this over by messenger, so that you may have time to consider it before I see you, which I shall try to do sometime tomorrow.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Morgan, Your obedient servant.\n\nHH/B.\n\nENG. 1.\n\nSupt. Six Nations.\nOttawa, July 18, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing the report of Dr. W. Davis on his examination of the children of Schools Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 on the Six Nations Reserve. In this connection it is noted that the Doctor has communicated with the parents of the children who have defects, in order to have the children given the treatment their case demands and that several of them have already received the necessary attention. It is further noted that there is a large number of unvaccinated children in the school, but that the vaccinating will be done, as far as possible, when the schools re-open after the holidays. It is considered that the parents should, in all cases where they are able to do so, pay any costs involved in giving the necessary medical attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nLt. Col. G. E. Morgan,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir:- \"Your 32-1-1 of July 18th. re payment of part costs of medical attendance by the patients themselves on the Six Nations Reserve\".\n\nI see by the financial return for 1923-24, which I received from you today that medical salaries, asylum, ambulance, drugs, medical accounts and hospitals for that period amount to $5616.55.\n\nAt present there is no ruling, of which I know, whereby any part of this can be recovered from patients who receive attendance from the Medical Officer. Indians, well to do and poor alike receive free attendance as a right established by long usage.\n\nWhile I am entirely in accord with the suggestion contained in the last paragraph of your letter that those who can afford to do so should contribute to the heavy medical expenses of the Reserve but I do not see how this can be enforced.\nThere is no interest money from which such fees can be stopped. I do not think that I can look to the Council for assistance in collecting them and having no ruling or precedent to lay before a Magistrate as to why fees should be payable by some and not others I am doubtful if a judgment could be obtained in the local Court.\n\nI should however like some definite ruling on this question upon which action could be taken as those who can afford to do so should undeniably pay.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nLt. Col. Cecil E. Morgan,\nSupt. Six Nations.\n\nGM/B.\nOttawa, July 28, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, with reference to the payment, by the parents who are able, of the costs involved in the giving of any medical attention required, and requesting that a ruling be given you regarding what action you should take to collect from those who can afford to pay. In reply I have to say that it is not intended to make any change in the existing arrangements for the providing of medical attention to the Indians of the Six Nations Band.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nLt. Col. G. E. Morgan,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour 32-1-1 July 28th.\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter as above.\n\nI recently received notification from the Department that a portion of the cost of medical attendance on the Reserve is to be borne by the parents of child patients and I asked how this was to be collected.\n\nI note your reply that \"it is not intended to make any change in existing arrangements and would point out that I was not suggesting that any change should be made but asking what these existing arrangements are and also in view of the absence of interest money if payment by patients or parents of child patients is part of these existing arrangements how collection is to be made.\n\nI am,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt.

The fact was overlooked that a medical superintendent and an assistant are employed to give the necessary medical attention in all cases requiring same and that they are paid salary from Band funds. The Indians of the Six Nations Band are therefore entitled to receive medical attention as required without cost.\n\nRegarding your enquiry as to the existing arrangements for medical attendance, I beg to refer you to official letter of March 21st, last, our file No. 9-32B containing a copy of instructions to Dr. Davis.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Further, the Superintendent's office should keep a list of all material that is sent to each school so that there will be no duplication or careless requisitioning.\n\n(3) **REPAIRS:** If comprehensive, the Superintendent should forward Indian Council's recommendation with his opinion as to advisability and need. Department will then determine whether authority is to be given or not. Minor repairs should be dealt with locally.

I spoke to the Council with reference to the Department's aims and wishes and then sat with the School Board for some hours. We discussed the best methods of improving the eleven day schools on the reserve and gave prominence in our deliberations to the problem of attendance. Later in the afternoon, I again spoke to the Council with reference to a programme suggested to the School Board and tried to give them a message of helpful encouragement. I also had the privilege of speaking to the Chawaken Women's Institute, which was meeting in the home of Mrs. (Dr.) Davis. These women apparently take a keen interest in reserve affairs.\n\nThe School Board, including the Chairman, Col. Morgan, and myself, discussed the best methods of carrying on the details of their work. I promised to draft a new set of Regulations at my convenience and submit it to the Board and Indian Council for their concurrence. I shall place my initial efforts in this connection before you in due course, for your approval.\n\nI asked the School Board and Indian Council to pass a Resolution with reference to compulsory attendance. I promised that the Department would cooperate if the responsible Indian organizations believed it now timely for an enforcing of the Act.\n\nIn our deliberations, prominence and time were given to ways and means of making the day schools on the reserve more attractive and it is proposed to undertake, with your approval, the following:\n\n1. The engagement of an extra teacher, whose sole duties will be the organization of the 11 schools for group games, physical instruction and an annual tournament and field day. A suitable school banner will be put up for competition, as well as prizes for the individual winners.\n\n2. The establishment of a central school library at the Indian office and a periodical distribution of the books to the individual schools.\n\n3. The provision of school and individual pupil's rewards for best attendance records.\n\n4. The engagement of only fully qualified teachers when possible - Indian applicants to have the preference, all other things being equal.\n\nWhen speaking to the different Indian organizations, I referred to the three-fold nature of the educational work among the Six Nation children: day schools, Mohawk Institute and secondary education. The aims and work of the Mohawk Indian Residential School were explained and a cordial invitation given to the members to visit the institution. (I discussed this with the Principal upon my return to Brantford that evening). I urged the Council and\n\n-School Board-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6167, file 434-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSchool Board to widen the scope of the tuition grants to include those that were taking vocational training, and I suggested that they give serious consideration to increasing the amount of the grant in the case of bright pupils of poor or destitute parents.\n\nIn my talks, I was careful to explain how the various educational schemes for the children of the reserve were financed. I promised, subject to your approval, that the funds for the extra school worker would be taken from Appropriation. (I believe it advisable to give the Mohawk workers no opportunity to blame the present School Board and Council with careless handling of Band Funds.) I shall be pleased to have your authority to pay towards salaries $6,000 per annum in place of $3,700. This increase will enable us to effect certain definite improvements in our day schools which, I believe, will result in better attendance and better physical development of the pupils.\n\nI propose to spend some days on the reserve in May to continue this present effort.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, February 10, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nPursuant to your request, I am recapitulating the financial expenditure from Parliamentary Appropriation in connection with Six Nation Indian boys and girls. This expenditure is over and above that met from Band Funds.\n\nDay Schools:\nGrant of $3,700 per year to Band Funds, for the purpose of assisting with salaries. The Deputy Superintendent General has approved of an increase to $6,000, commencing April 1, 1925. (Band Funds $6,500 per year and between $1,500 and $2,000 per year for books, fuel, janitor, repairs, replacements, and incidentals).\n\nMohawk Institute:\nCurrent expense approximately $29,000 per annum, met as follows: Parliamentary Appropriation $24,000; New England Company $5,000. Capital expense at the Mohawk Institute during the past three years has been approximately $56,000, met as follows: Parliamentary Appropriation $47,500; New England Company $7,500.\n\nTuition Grants:\nThe Department maintains from ten to fourteen pupils per annum at business college, university, etc., at a cost of approximately $1,400 per annum, which is met by Parliamentary Appropriation. (Band Funds are responsible at this time for 36 grants of $100 each and approximately $2,000 per annum for school board fees).\n\nTo recapitulate, approximate current expenditure per annum: Band Funds $18,850; Parliamentary Appropriation $29,100. In the matter of capital expense, Parliamentary Appropriation has been averaging $17,500 for each of the past three years; whereas Band Funds have been responsible for a very inconsiderable amount, as there have been no new day school buildings erected.\n\nYou will understand that these figures are approximate and should not be incorporated in any official letters of yours. They are offered to you so that you will be familiar with the situation. It would take me many hours to get out exact figures for each fiscal year; but these approximate amounts will, I trust, serve your purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Mr. T. Ferguson, regional superintendent of the Department, explained at a meeting of the Reserve School Board today. The money raised for the school on the reserve will be appropriated with money from the Department for the purchase of equipment and the provision of prizes for the scholars.

The teachers tell me that they understood from Mr. Ferrier's address that it was intended to give two or three prizes to each school and a shield or some similar award to the best school. It seems this would be appreciated and I would suggest three prizes\nfor each room say of $3.00, $2.00 and $1.00.\n\nIf this is approved the presentation of these prizes might be made a separate little individual function for each school and the money presented in time to be of use to the winners in the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt. Col. C.E. Morgan,\nSupt. Six Nations.\n\nCM/B.\nOttawa, May 11, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 10B/26/544 of the 3rd instant, with reference to rewards for attendance at the Six Nations Schools. The Department approves of three prizes, of $3.00; $2.00; and $1.00, for the best record in each classroom on the reserve. Each teacher should determine what pupils are entitled to the rewards, and, if any question arises, the matter should be brought to your attention for decision.\n\nI believe it advisable to limit the competition to the period September first to May 14th. This will give an opportunity for proper awards and a little function at each school, when the money should be presented to the winners by yourself. A voucher, in duplicate, covering the expenditure, should be in favour of yourself and should show to whom the prizes have been awarded (name of pupil and amount and number of school in each case).\n\nYou should secure prizes on an inexpensive shield, to be awarded to the classroom with the best attendance record. Submit these, with a recommendation concerning purchase, to the Department. In connection with the school award, I do not believe it advisable to consider tardiness - the sole basis of award to be percentage of attendance. The Department has records for the September, December and March quarters and I should be pleased if you would ascertain from each teacher and incorporate in a letter the enrolment and average attendance of each classroom, separately, for the period April first to May 14th, inclusive. Submit this to the Department in a special letter and I shall inform you what school should receive the shield.\n\nLt. Col. C. E. Morgan,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\n\n- I also believe -\nI also believe it advisable to recognize the best individual pupil's record on the reserve. You should secure from each teacher the complete record for the year to May 14th of the recipient of the first prize in each classroom. These should be submitted to the Department for a decision as to the best individual record of attendance on the reserve. The record of these best pupils should show the number of days the classroom was open, the number of days' attendance, the reasons for absence and the record of tardiness. A special award will be granted to the most successful pupil.\n\nAll vouchers in connection with the attendance prizes should be marked \"From Account 33.\" Band Funds are not actually meeting the expense, however, as an extra grant of $1500 from Parliamentary Appropriation will care for these special costs. You will remember that the Vote for Indian Education now includes a $5,000 grant to Account 33.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I have, therefore decided to hold a school board meeting on Friday the 11th, when the School Board, Mr. Hill and myself will visit each school on the Reserve and it seems that this will be a suitable opportunity to present the prizes to the individual holders of the best records.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I also travelled extensively over the reserve, interviewing men and women of all classes of the community, observing the condition of the schools and homes, and also carefully studying the roads and drainage system.\n\nSome days previous to the first hearing a large bill notice was widely posted up throughout the reserve, in the following words:\u2014\n\n(Coat of Arms)\n\nNOTICE\n\nUnder and by virtue of the authority vested in him by\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL OF CANADA IN COUNCIL\nLIEUT.-COLONEL ANDREW T. THOMPSON\nwill proceed to investigate and inquire into the affairs of the\nSix Nations Indians\nincluding matters relating to\nEducation Election of Chiefs\nHealth Powers Assumed by Council\nMorality Soldier Settlement\nAdministration of Justice\nand any other matter affecting the management, life and progress\nof the said Indians as may be required by the Superintendent\nGeneral of Indian Affairs.\n\n85656\u20142\nLieutenant-Colonel Thompson will commence his investigation at Ohsweken at Eleven O\u2019clock in the morning of Tuesday, September 18, at which time and place all those interested in the above matter are cordially invited to be present that they may be heard with reference to the same.\n\nAndrew T. Thompson,\nCommissioner.\n\nIn my personal interviews above referred to, I found that a number of Indians, while anxious to give evidence, were very timid about doing so, because of acute political differences existing upon the reserve, and the consequent fear that a frank statement of facts and expression of opinion might lead to serious results. I was urged to take all evidence submitted under oath in camera, and this suggestion I adopted.\n\nTo complement the information so obtained, a number of open meetings were held at Ohsweken, at which all were invited to express their views. The invitation was widely accepted. No man or woman was denied a hearing, and the open meetings were not discontinued until all desirous of a hearing had been heard.\n\nI shall now deal with the questions submitted to me in the order in which they are named in my Commission.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nThere can be no doubt that the Six Nations Indians have made very substantial progress in the matter of education during the last twenty-five years. There are a period of very quick intelligence, and quite as capable of assimilating education as any other white fellow. However, it must never be forgotten that they have not enjoyed the opportunities of the whites for a lengthy period, and are still working under decided handicaps.\n\nA large number of the Indians, both men and women, are keenly alive to the benefits of education, and ready and willing to make sacrifices to obtain it. They are, none the less, poor people, and so find themselves quite unable to give to their children that higher education so easily obtained in white communities.\n\nIn spite of all their disadvantages, quite a number among them have become qualified school teachers; a few have graduated from universities, and others have become members of the learned professions.\n\nThere are at present eleven schools upon the reserve, with the Mohawk Institute, situated in Brantford, serving as a residence, vocational and academic school, training up the most part, orphan children, deserted children, and the children of the extreme poor.\n\nLet me deal first with the question of the schools on the reserve.\n\nThey are at present managed by a school board, consisting of five Indian members, appointed by the Council of Chiefs, two white members, one representing the Board of Education Company, and one doing missionary work upon the reserve, with the agent at Brantford acting as chairman.\n\nFrom my investigation I am quite convinced that this Board is inefficient, and should be abolished.\n\nI recommend that each school section elect a board of school trustees, to manage the affairs of the section, with the agent at Brantford to supervise the whole. I am convinced that in this way keen local interest will be aroused, with a corresponding improvement in present conditions.\n\nThe attendance of children at the schools is entirely unsatisfactory. This I learned from the evidence of the school teachers themselves, from the evidence of the truant officer, and from personal observation. I believe that at the present time this condition is very much worse than it was some time or three years ago. This is no doubt attributable to the unrest which has been so prevalent during that period, an unrest which has brought in its train quite widespread disregard for authority. Truancy laws have not been enforced\u2014no doubt a few prosecutions, by way of example, would produce a most valuable result.\n\nThe present truant officer, Mr. John Lickers, is a capable and earnest official, but conditions have been too much for him. Even under normal circumstances, I consider the whole reserve far too large a territory to be administered by one man alone. In my opinion each school section should have a truant officer of its own. A small school section secures the attention of the teacher, and the thing the trouble would be much increased by the proposed change. In this connection I wish to say that the suggestion was made to appoint some women as truant officers. It was pointed out that the mothers of the children have really more to do with the attendance than do the fathers, on the reserve, and that a woman truant officer could do more for the welfare of her support than could a man. The suggestion seems to have some merit, and it might be well to give it a trial, should an officer for each section be appointed.\n\nSanitary conveniences are not at all what they should be. It appears that at some of the schools neighbouring farmers water their cattle at the school well or cistern during the rainy months, fouling the ground, and leading to serious dangers of water contamination.\n\nSome system of individual drinking cups should undoubtedly be provided. At present, in several of the schools at least, one drinking cup does service for all the children, with an inevitable spread of disease. The lavatory accommodation is also largely inadequate. Such facilities should be provided for country people for individual residences at a cost of a few hundred dollars each. I think it would be quite possible to install similar conveniences in the various schools.\n\nWhen I deal with the question of health I shall have something to say as to the appointment of a qualified nurse to work in conjunction with the resident physician at Ohsweken. Should such an one be appointed, I strongly recommend regular periodical visits by her to the various schools, that she may keep a constant eye upon the sanitary conditions and upon the health of the children attending. Such supervision would undoubtedly lead to the cure of many troubles in its early stages, which, if neglected, would become chronic, and lead in due course to unhealthy men and women. In addition, it would be a protection to healthy children from the dangers of infection.\n\nThe question of duly qualified teachers is one of great importance. In this connection it must be noted that conditions on the reserve are not so attractive as in the major centres of population throughout rural Ontario. The roads are bad during the winter months, and almost impassable during the late fall and early spring. There are no large towns or villages upon the reserve, and resident teachers are, in consequence, cut off from the social advantages which such supply. There are not, as yet, sufficient qualified Indian teachers to supply all the schools, and increasing numbers of Indians are becoming enrolled in an Indian community as they would be among people of their own blood.\n\nBoarding accommodation, too, in some of the school sections, is not at all of the best, and in two or three of them, is not to be had. These two or three sections are in contiguous localities. The suggestion has been made that one teacher\u2019s house might be erected for the residence of the teachers in these sections; the matter seems worthy of consideration.\n\nTaking these various handicaps into account, the teaching staff on the reserve might be very much worse. Because of them, it has been impossible to\nengage duly qualified teachers throughout, but the majority of them hold the proper certificates; and are an earnest and capable lot of men and women.\n\nIt was alleged at the inquiry that the salaries paid were lower than those received by teachers in white rural communities. I have looked into this matter since the close of the public hearing, and do not find the allegation sustained.\n\nSeveral teachers complained of the impossibility of obtaining teaching books and equipment promptly. I understand that the supplies are sent from Ottawa on requisitions approved and forwarded by the agent at Brantford, and it is said that vexations delays result. On the other hand, it is but fair to state that officials of the Indian Department say the trouble arises because teachers do not fill their requisition blanks ahead of their needs, but wait until their actual need is upon them, before doing so. I have not been able to reach a conclusion as to the rights of the matter, but some friction undoubtedly exists, and I recommend that an ample supply be maintained in the Indian office at Brantford for immediate issue on receipt of requisitions.\n\nSchools fail also. The newwork is being steadily enlarged and extended, as should also school sports. All healthy competition and movement tending to increase the pleasure of the children at the schools will have most beneficial results, and is a much better method of procuring satisfactory attendance than is the threat of a truant officer.\n\nI come next to the question of education subsequent to that at the reserve schools. This is a matter of very considerable difficulty. As I have already pointed out, there is no large village or town upon the reserve, and there is no high school situated there. As a consequence, children seeking higher education must perform the school work in the neighbouring white centres\u2014Hagersville, Caledonia and Brantford. Most of these are too far away for these points to go back and forth daily, and that means the necessity of boarding where the school is. The people on the reserve are not well off, and but very few of them could afford this outlay if unaided. At the present time a grant of $100 is made to each child attending high school. Even with that assistance the Indian parents must pay $200 more, to make up total expense. With many, eagerly anxious to give their children every benefit, this is an impossible sum; many more can afford to send but one child, where they would gladly send more.\n\nTo meet the situation it has been suggested that a continuation school be established upon the reserve. By reason of its location, Ohsweken would seem to be the only place for such an institution. But this place is a very small village, and almost totally without accommodation for boarding school children. The majority of those who would attend such an institution are too poor to drive back and forth daily, so, unless residence accommodation were also provided, this would be an impracticable scheme.\n\nI have obtained a careful estimate of the probable expense of a continuation school with residence upon the reserve. The annual expense of operating such an institution would be about as follows: Salaries, $5,500; upkeep of plant, $1,500; fuel, food, etc., $8,500, a total of $15,500. These figures are based on a three term school, with one matron, and fifty pupils in attendance, and provide for a residence for girls only. In order to operate a residence for boys would be equally necessary, and that would very largely increase the above expenses. The capital expenditure for the erection of the necessary buildings would be very considerable indeed. Of course, the parents of resident pupils might contribute something toward their support, but even allowing for such a source of revenue, the net expense appears prohibitive.\n\nThere is another important feature to be considered. The Indians themselves, who discussed with me this question of a continuation school, were unanimously of the opinion that it was very much to the advantage of their children to attend the white schools, and there to mingle with the white children. As one Indian put it, \"We do not wish to be a people apart, we want our children to grow up good Canadians like the rest.\"\n\nThis seems to be a point well taken. The Indians cannot live advantageously as a separate community. They are a small handful of people, only some four-six hundred in number, surrounded by densely settled white districts with which they must necessarily have dealings. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance to them that their young people should grow up on terms of friendly intimacy with the young white folk of their neighbourhood, and to this end the attendance at the white schools materially contributes.\n\nI do not think that the present grant of $100 per pupil for Indian children attending high schools, is sufficient. I think it should be materially increased. Nor should the grant be limited to pupils attending Six Nations schools; children are close enough to the white schools to go back and forth daily; these should not receive as much assistance as those who are compelled to board in the towns.\n\nAt the present time thirty-five Indian children are in receipt of these grants for high school education, and an addition $1,600 is paid to the Boards of the high schools attended, besides the fourteen pupils undergoing vocational training, totalling $2,300 for vocational training. The expense is divided between Parliamentary appropriation and Six Nations funds, and it will be seen that the forty-nine students are at present costing $7,400 per annum. I understand that no consideration is made for Indian funds towards the fourteen pupils undergoing vocational training. To my mind, this vocational training is quite as important as the high school instruction, and the former should be charged separately.\n\nIt will be seen from the above figures that a substantial increase could be made to the present aid granted, and that the total expenditure would still be very considerably less than that entailed by the establishment of a continuation school, with residence upon the reserve.\n\nThe Mohawk Institute, situated in Brantford, already referred to, performs a function quite apart from the general educational system. As I have stated, it provides vocational and academic training for orphans, for deserted children, and for the children of the very poor. This function is necessary, and must not be interfered with. At the present time its accommodation is nearly all taken up by children of this class. However, it might be advisable to construct a dormitory wing for the use of high school pupils attending in Brantford. A very small addition to the present staff would no doubt be quite sufficient to manage these new residents of the Institute. Such a dormitory would accommodate promising children of the very poor who, at present, even with the Government aid, are quite unable to attend high schools.\n\nHEALTH\n\nThe health of the Six Nations Indians is very far from being as good as it should be.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that these Indians are, in the main, a poor people, and good health and poverty never travel hand in hand. With a majority proper sanitary conveniences are entirely lacking, while ignorance of sanitation and indifference to it are widespread.\n\nThe Indian is by nature a Stoic, and will much more willingly endure the discomfort and pain caused by disease than go to the trouble of seeking remedies to defeat it.\n\nIn spite of all this many of the Indians have cleanly and sanitary homes, and there is a strong and growing desire upon the reserve for better conditions all round. The time appears very favourable for an advanced policy in matters pertaining to health. Asked as to the most prevalent diseases among the Indians, a number of women present expressed themselves among them replied: Pneumonia, tuberculosis, and some venereal diseases, rheumatism, neuralgia, and auto-intoxication; there is also a lot of communicable skin diseases largely caused by uncleannessness.\" It will at once be apparent that better sanitary conditions would go far to abate a number of these troubles.\n\n88656-3\nThe same physician deposed that \"It is difficult to get them to carry out prescribed treatment, and to observe quarantine. For instance, last fall I treated six cases of diphtheria, and in my opinion there need only have been two, but for visiting back and forth... I think if some example were made for breach of quarantine and other health laws it would have a good effect. I also think that instructions given to schools already in high schools have not been acted upon. He was asked, \"Do you think that lectures given from time to time by the reserve doctors on such subjects as infection, sanitation, first aid, care of infants etc., would be of advantage?\", to which he replied \"To some extent, yes. I know there are a number of intelligent Indians anxious to profit by information of this kind.\"\n\nI am of the opinion that lectures of the kind suggested as a part of a general health propaganda would be of considerable benefit. Some years ago tuberculosis was much more prevalent than at present. An active campaign was undertaken to instruct the people in the best means of combating this dread disease. Overcrowding in houses was vigorously attacked; cleanliness urged, the advisability of precautions pointed out; the value of constant personal hygiene, suggestions made as to proper food, etc., with the fortunate result above indicated. I fear that the fight against the great white plague has somewhat slackened, its novelty having worn off, and I strongly urge that steps be taken once more to arouse the interest of the people in this struggle against the great scourge of American aborigines.\n\nDr. Greenwood, until very recently the resident Government physician upon the reserve, and who for some years held that post, pointed out that venereal disease, especially syphilis, was far more prevalent than in white communities. He ascribed this in large part, to the unwillingness of the Indians to understand the danger involved in promiscuity, to fail in a certain cleanliness, and to gross disregard of all means to prevent contagion. He stated that he had brought about some prosecutions under various health laws in this connection, but that the magistrates trying the cases seemed quite oblivious to the seriousness of the matter, dismissing the accused with penalties so light as to destroy what effect they may have had beneficially on the proceedings. The matter is one of grave importance not only to the Indians themselves, but also to the people of the neighbouring white communities. I strongly recommend that steps be taken to enforce the health regulations to the full. In this connection I think that the Indian agent at Brantford should keep in close touch with the resident physician upon the reserve, and institute prosecutions when informed by the latter that the law as to health is being violated. If done, I am sure a few examples would have an excellent effect. The suggestion is made not only in the interest of the diseased themselves, but also for the benefit of the innocent who are in constant danger of contamination. Communicable skin disease has already been mentioned as prevalent on our reserve. From this very many of the school children suffer, as do they from infected venereal wounds. In my remarks upon education I pointed out the lack of proper sanitary conveniences in the schools. One can readily imagine the spread of disease where all the children drink from a common cup, and where there is a complete lack of facilities for washing and general cleansing.\n\nI recommend that a properly qualified nurse be appointed with residence at Ohsweken, to assist the resident physician there, one of whose duties it shall be to visit the schools at brief intervals, supervising sanitary conditions, and examining into the health of the children in attendance. Such an instructed visitor would do away many a trouble in its early stages, and by reporting to the physician not only the case of each of the sufferers, but also any contagious cases, prevent the spread of the disease. In my opinion this is a matter absolutely vital to improved health conditions on the Six Nations Reserve.\n\nI do not consider the present medical staff sufficient for its purpose. It consists of one resident physician, living at Ohsweken, with one assistant, the latter not a fully qualified practitioner, while at times this assistant is not to be had. It is quite impossible for such a personnel adequately to attend to forty-six hundred people, scattered over a wide area, in a country where the roads in the late fall and early spring are almost impassable for horse-vehicles, let alone motors. As a matter of fact Indians living remote from Ohsweken and near Hagersville and Caledonia usually employ physicians from those towns at their own expense. Since the resident physician resides from the limits of the whole band this is an unfair discrimination. It has been suggested that a physician be appointed in each of these places to do Indian practice, not upon a fixed salary, but to be paid for work actually done. The scheme undoubtedly presents difficulties, but is worthy of consideration; it should not be impossible to secure a physician who will give better and more specific attendance, and remove the unfair discrimination at present existing. Should the patient and the Government each be required to pay a part of the expense, there would at least be some check upon unnecessary calls upon the physician.\n\nMORALITY\n\nStandards of morality vary with time and with peoples. Webster gives a broad definition\u2014\"Conforming to the standard of right\"\u2014but what one community may regard as a \"standard of right\" another may regard as a standard of wrong. For instance, Indians, before they were converted, regarded revenge as a sacred duty, a doctrine quite contrary to Christian teaching. There are some eight hundred non-Christian Indians on the Six Nations Reserve. These are commonly called \"Pagans,\" and they resent this strongly. They call themselves \"Dests,\" whose blessings they invoke, and to whom they return thanks.\n\nBut the views of this minority, on some subjects at least, could not be considered \"moral,\" from the Christian standpoint, and especially is this the case with regard to marital relations. The influence of so considerable a minority in a comparatively small population is necessarily large, and no doubt contributes not a little to loose living between the sexes.\n\nIn consequence married people frequently separate and take up with others, rearing families of illegitimate children. One or two of the witnesses referred to the prevalence of bigamy upon the Reserve, and advocated prosecution of the guilty. But I do not think that bigamy is so common, mainly on the reason that the husband or wife who has deserted his or her legal partner seldom takes the trouble to go through the form of marriage with the new companion. One of the missionaries living on the reserve gave evidence that many Indians live together as man and wife without ever having contracted marital relations with any one. This is not bigamy, though immoral, according to Christian ethics.\n\nI believe that the clergymen living upon the reserve, commonly called \"missionaries\" there, are doing what they can to abate this practice, but it is so prevalent and has been so long in existence that they seem to be making little progress in this direction.\n\nThere is abundant proof that the Council of Chiefs is quite indifferent to this unfortunate state of affairs, and as their influence is great, it makes the work of the missionaries in this regard all the harder, and largely tends to destroy it altogether.\n\nThe better element upon the reserve, and it is by no means small, feels keenly the moral degradation of the people, and is anxious for betterment. Indian after Indian referred to it with regret, and various suggestions were made looking toward improvement. To one of the Indians examined this question was put: \"Do you think the morality of the people, especially with regard to the relations between the sexes, can be improved?\", to which he replied:\n\nS8656\u201434\n\"Yes, it is a very bad example to the rising generation to see men deserting their law-\nfor wives and children, and taking up with other women and raising illegitimate children. \nI think men who do this should be followed up sharply and made to support those whom \nthey have deserted. This would not stop the practice altogether, but it would tend to \nlessen it.\"\n\nAnother Indian, himself a chief, and of high standing in the community, \non being asked the same question replied as follows:\u2014\n\n\"We have some eight hundred non-Christian Indians on the reserve. Their ideas as \nto marriage are very different from the Christian ones, and the example they set has a \nconsiderable influence upon the balance of the population. As it is now, when a couple \nproperly married separate and take another partner they are placed upon the list, provided they are the offspring of Indians who are members of the Band. I believe \nthat if this matter were properly looked into, and henceforth children born out of wedlock \nwere not placed upon the list, but were treated as decidedly undesirable, and in the \ncase of marital unhappiness I believe many of our people would get divorced in the regular \nway like the white people do, if they could afford the expense, but they cannot, and so \nthey remain together. If we could make them think this the right course of any law \ncould force the people to improve in this connection. It is a matter of improving \nthe moral ideas of our people, and our clergymen are doing all they can upon that line.\"\n\nStill another witness, dealing with this subject, expressed himself thus:\u2014\n\n\"There are a great many glaring examples of immorality within my own knowledge. \nIt is quite a common thing for a husband to abandon his wife, and to leave her to support \ntheir children while she lives off of her lives with another woman and has a second family \nby her. I think if men who act in this manner were following up strictly and severely \nand made to support their legal children, or to go to jail in the alternative, conditions would \nbe improved. I further think it is a very bad thing to place children born out of wedlock \non the Indian list. Should this practice be discontinued it would have a beneficial result.\"\n\nA further statement made at the inquiry reads as follows:\u2014\n\n\"First of all, I do not think illegitimate children should be placed on the list of the \nBand. If there are all kinds of children born out of wedlock, it is to the advantage to go to the \nCouncil and declare that the child is the child of an Indian mother. Even a married woman \nwho is the mother of a child by a man other than her husband can have that child placed \nupon the list. This is simply an encouragement to vice. I think some of our \nministers are too anxious to accept the immoral conditions they find around them.\"\n\nOn the other hand, speaking of the question of placing of illegitimate \nchildren on the strength of the band, a witness pointed out that their exclusion \nwould be hard on the children themselves, surely a point worthy of considera-\ntion. And what would become of such unfortunates, should they be deserted \nby their parents, and the band released of all responsibility?\n\n\"I have very serious doubts of the advisability of the course suggested. In \nmy opinion, such exclusion from registration on the list of the band would not \ngreatly improve moral conditions upon the reserve, while it might very easily \nplace the unfortunate illegitimate children in a position of great hardship.\n\nHowever, I am heartily in accord with the suggestion that the fathers of \nillegitimate children wherever ascertainable, should be made to support them, \nwith provision also for the mothers also that fathers deserting their wives and \nlegitimate children should be shouldered with the same responsibility, with the \nsame alternative.\n\nWhile people may honestly differ as to what constitutes morality, surely \nall will agree that a premeditated violation of the law is such, and this leads me \nto the subject of Sunday lacrosse games held for profit on the reserve.\n\nThese have been the common practice during the past season. The \nmajority of Indians know perfectly well that such exhibitions, with admission \ncharged, are not allowed in white communities, and that they are against the \nlaw. Their continuance breeds a contempt for law, and encourages the cam-\npaign for defiance of it.\n\nHundreds of whites, many of them of the extremely rough element, flock \nto these exhibitions. Sales of goods are openly carried on, till the gathering \nassumes almost the appearance of a market, and liquor is smuggled in.\n\nThe law-abiding Indians strongly protest against these games, and demand \nenforcement of the law. Some go so far as to say that the reserve is no longer \nsafe for their children on Sundays, lest that they are in constant fear of violence \nto their young women, and even of kidnappings.\n\nI recommend that Sunday lacrosse games, where held for gain, be stopped.\n\nELECTION OF CHIEFS\n\nThe Council of Chiefs is composed of men not \"elected,\" but appointed. \nThe right to a seat in the Council is vested in certain families.\n\nThe chieftainship does not go to any particular male member of the \nfamily, but to some of these, selected for the purpose.\n\nIn their form of government the Six Nations have no written constitution. \nTheir procedure rests upon long established custom, but as the knowledge of \nthis has been transmitted by word of mouth only from generation to genera-\ntion, it is impossible to ascertain the facts with exactness.\n\nThat the right to chieftainship is confined to a few families, and is predomi-\nnantly male, people are agreed; but further that the nomination of the chief \nis a prerogative of the women of the family concerned. At this point, however, \nthe evidence of the witnesses varied somewhat. Some maintained that the right \nof nomination belongs to all women of the family, with the final say, in case \nof disagreement, in the oldest woman thereof. Others maintained that the \noldest woman alone has the right to nominate. The difference is not of very \nmuch importance for as long as the oldest woman of the family has the say, \nwhether with or without consultation with the other women.\n\nThis family right to a seat in the Council is much cherished, and jealously \nguarded. It not infrequently happens that the number of males in the family \nconcerned has become very small, with a limited choice in consequence. As a \nresult men are sometimes sent to the Council who are grossly ignorant, and \nmore than one witness alleged that even those mentally unsound had been sent \nthere, in order that the chieftainship should be maintained in the family con-\ncerned.\n\nIt follows that a comparatively small number of old women have the \nselection of those who are entrusted with the transaction of the business of the \nSix Nations Indians, while the vast majority of the people have nothing what-\never to say in the choice of their public servants.\n\nThe appointment of the chief is for life, and he can only be removed if \nguilty of some serious offence, such as a crime. Utter incompetence is no bar \nto an appointment, and no reason for a dismissal.\n\nThere can be no doubt that so long as the people cling to this ancient form \nof government, the Six Nations Indians have a wonderful history, and they \nare surprisingly well acquainted with its main features. They know that their \nconfederacy, though numerically small as compared with the total Indian popu-\nlation, dominated America from the Great Lakes almost to the gulf of Mexico, \nand from the Mississippi to the Atlantic. They know that they were the power-\nful and much sought after allies of the British Crown in its struggle with the \nFrench for the possession of this continent, and that in courage and statescraft \nthey were the superiors of all the other red races.\n\nTo-day they find themselves confined to a territory the size of a township, \nand with a total population less than that of a small Canadian city. They feel \nbitterly the loss of status. Their greatness and their influence are gone. Their \nhistory alone remains to them.\n\nUnder these conditions it is not surprising that many of them adhere to the \nform of government which served them in the days of their prosperity, even\nthough they must know in their innermost hearts that it has long outlived its usefulness.\n\nOne Indian proudly remarked, \"Ours is the oldest form of government on the American continent.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the better educated and more progressive Indians, in whom the hope of the future lies, are keenly anxious for the same democratic form of government as is enjoyed by their white fellow-citizens.\n\nWitness after witness pointed out the following objections to the present system:\n\n1) The people as a whole have no voice in the selection of their councillors.\n2) The present Council is absolutely unwieldy. It consists of some sixty chiefs, charged with the conduct of the business of less than five thousand people. This leads to great delay in the transaction of even simple matters.\n3) Owing to the method of appointment a great many of the chiefs are ignorant men. Many of them are unable even to read and write, and totally incapable of transacting business.\n4) The present Council is unnecessarily expensive. An expense allowance is made to each chief for attendance at Council meetings, and while the individual payment is not large, the aggregate is said to amount to at least $1,000 per annum.\n\nI am convinced that those advocating a change in the system of government have fully established their contention, and that an elective system should be inaugurated at the earliest possible date.\n\nThe franchise should be given to all male Indians of the Band, twenty-one years of age or over. The consensus of opinion was that for the time being the franchise should not be extended to women, and since education is not yet very much advanced on the reserve, in this I concur.\n\nThe question of the number of councillors to be elected, and the method of election, in the event of a change being made, was fully considered during my investigation. As the reserve is now but one year old, it will be needed for it to function smoothly. No doubt within a few years the proposed new form of government will be so well established that a small Council, say of five members, will be sufficient for the purpose, but for the present I think a larger number advisable. This larger number, giving an opportunity for more men to sit in Council would secure more widespread interest, and would give an education to those elected, and would ensure the return of some capable men. I am of opinion that a Council of fourteen, with a chairman, corresponding to the reeve of a rural municipality, fifteen in all, would not be excessive.\n\nThe suggestion was made that each of the tribes should elect two councillors.\n\nAs the Delawares are now a part of the Six Nations, making in reality seven nations in this reserve, it gives the Six Nations the right to elect the Delawares by tribes would I think, be inexplicable. The latest figures available give the Mohawks as numbering eighteen hundred and ninety-three, and the Delawares one hundred and sixty-seven. To give equal representation to each would be inequitable. Further than that, the difficulty in voting by tribes would be almost insurmountable. The tribes are not confined to separate localities, but are scattered over the reserve, and to arrange a voting list with polls for each tribe under such conditions, would lead to the greatest confusion.\n\nI recommend that the reserve be divided into seven wards, each ward running from north to south the full distance of the reserve, the area depending as far as possible upon equality of population, and that each should select two councillors. I further recommend that the electors as a whole should choose the chief councillor.\n\nPerhaps, sir, it is not my function to pursue this matter too far into the future, but I shall at least venture a few further brief remarks.\n\nThe Six Nations Indians have progressed notably in civilization. They are amongst the most advanced, if not the most advanced, of the Indian tribes, and the Indian Act might very well be amended with respect to them, in consequence.\n\nI realize that you imagine an elective system of council is an early stage in functions of that body. I have to determine what the Indian Act, as it at present exists, I would say, however, that after the new Council has reached a stage of settled efficiency the Indian Act be changed to enlarge its functions, so that it may more and more approximate to the Council of a white municipality.\n\nPOWERS ASSUMED BY COUNCIL\n\nThe powers of the Council of Chiefs are strictly limited by the Indian Act. Under that Act the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs is given the control and management of the lands and property of the Indians in Canada.\n\nIt is clear from evidence submitted by a number of witnesses at the inquiry that the Council of Chiefs has, in several instances, undertaken to deal with the property of the Six Nations quite independently of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nFor some considerable time past there has been a strong agitation to have the Six Nations constituted as a separate and sovereign people. Those supporting this course allege that by the wording of certain early treaties the Six Nations are not subjects but are allies of the British Crown.\n\nTo investigate the merits of this contention was not one of the duties assigned to me, and I merely mention it in connection with the subject. \"Powers assumed by Council,\" which I may say, is a strange one.\n\nThe question of power of I may so describe it, is exceptionally strong in the Council of Chiefs, in fact it is completely dominant there. Its members maintain, and it is a logical sequence from the position assumed, that not being British subjects they are not bound by Canadian law, and that, in consequence, the Indian Act does not apply to the Six Nations Indians.\n\nNo doubt it has been desirable for what under the Indian Act is undoubtedly an assumption of powers by the Council.\n\nSome specific instances were called to my attention, and these I feel it proper to bring to your notice.\n\nA house, a part of the property of the Six Nations Indians, which had been used for school purposes, was disposed of by the Council of Chiefs, and the money then realized has never been accounted for either to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, or to the Six Nations Indians themselves.\n\nIt was alleged by the witnesses, who testified to this transaction, that the money was handed over to one Levi General (Chief Deskaheh), the speaker of the Council, that he might use the same in support of the campaign for independence. These witnesses could not swear positively of their own knowledge to this fact, but they did swear that this was a matter of common notoriety among the people.\n\nThe Council of Chiefs issued bonds, alleged to be secured upon the trust funds of the Six Nations Indians, and sold some of them. The proceeds of these sales have been unaccounted for either to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, or to the people of the Six Nations Indians, and here again it is alleged that the money was handed over to Chief Deskaheh in support of the separatist campaign.\n\nSo much for the powers assumed by Council, as they directly affect the Government of Canada.\n\nBut it is further alleged that the Council has arrogated to itself powers previously vested in those who had the right to nominate chiefs.\nIn a preceding part of my report, under the heading \"Election of Chiefs,\" will be found a description of the manner in which Six Nations Indians are made chiefs. There can be no doubt that the ancient usage of this people was on nomination by the women of certain families, in which the right to chieftainship was hereditary. There is abundant evidence to show that while the letter of this institution has been observed, its spirit is now constantly broken. The Council undoubtedly brings pressure to bear upon the women and to nominate whom they desire, so that the chief nominated is in reality their choice, and not the free and unfettered choice of the woman herself.\n\nThe Council appears further to have usurped authority as to dismissal. On this point very positive evidence was tendered by an Indian who was himself a Chief, who has been so for a period of some forty-five years, and who appeared to be extremely well posted in the customs and traditions of his people. In answer to the question, \"How is a chief dismissed from Council?\" he replied as follows:\n\n\"If the chief's desire his dismissal they so advise the woman who has nominated him. She then admonishes him, and he remains a chief. If, however, this occurs three times, he is ejected, and the woman nominating a new chief. This was the old system, but the chief who exercised the right of the woman has a large extent of land been known to dismiss a chief from the Council without consulting the woman who nominated him. They have exercised their power in a tyrannical manner to go against the opinions of the majority. The Council did not favour Indians participating in the Great War. Chief J. S. Johnson announced that he was going overseas to fight, and was dismissed in consequence. Chief Thomas John actually did go, and he too, was dismissed. In my opinion the proceedings of the Council is a usurpation, and quite contrary to the ancient custom of our people.\"\n\nAnother witness deposed that he was a chief, but had been dismissed by the Council. He said that he requested Council to \"lay a charge\" against him, but that this they had refused to do.\n\nI am fully convinced that the present Council has undoubtedly been guilty of a serious usurpation of power, with regard to the Government of Canada on the one hand, and the people of the Six Nations Indians on the other, and that for a considerable time they have been acting very much as a law unto themselves.\n\nSOLDIERS' SETTLEMENT\n\nThe Six Nations Indians sent some two hundred soldiers to the Great War. These men performed their duties admirably. Seven of them were commissioned officers, and two of these, both serving in the Air Force, lost their lives. One of the seven, Major George Smith, received three decorations, and his brother, Lieutenant Charles Smith, the Military Cross.\n\nA number of the men in the ranks were also decorated for service in the field.\n\nAlthough not strictly relative to the inquiry I take pleasure in stating these facts as an evidence of the patriotism and courage of the Six Nations Indians, and also of their efficiency as fighting men. The blood of the Iroquois has not grown thin.\n\nSince these Indians are almost entirely an agricultural people, it is not surprising that a large number sought the benefits of the Soldiers' Settlement scheme. I understand that one hundred and thirty made application for its benefits, and of these about eighty were accepted. The remainder were rejected after careful enquiry, as not likely to make good, and I heard no complaint whatever on this score.\n\nOf the eighty accepted applicants some seventy-five are \"in good standing.\" By this is meant that they are still on the official books, kept there because it is considered that they have a fair chance to win through.\n\nNo man has been sold out, or \"salvaged,\" to use the official term, with the exception of two, one of whom burned his barn for firewood, and the other of whom sold nearly $3,000 worth of timber without applying one cent of the proceeds in reduction of his loan.\n\nMr. Robert E. Abbott, the agricultural representative of the Indian Department, who is the official charged with the administration of the scheme, pointed out in his evidence that while only ten or twelve of the soldier settlers had made all their payments up to date, the remainder had reasonable excuses for default, and that he expected seventy-five per cent of the payments due this fall to be met.\n\nThe \"reasonable excuses\" referred to lay in two partial crop failures, and in the fact that the farm stock and implements had been purchased when prices were high, and had since greatly depreciated in value.\n\nLieutenant Frank W. Montour, himself an Indian soldier settler, in giving evidence, made the following observation:\n\n\"I think if anything, the department is a little too easy on the men for their own good. Most of them have had no means at all, and they would respond to better supervision. For example, after hay harvest and again after grain harvest, some of them sell their produce and the money is just frittered away. I think it would be a good thing to have a Canadian man visit the settlers during these two periods to encourage them to pay in as much money as possible on account of their instalments, even if the exact day for payments had not fallen due.\"\n\nMr. Montour knows practically every soldier settler on the reserve, and is highly thought of by them. Asked whether these had, to his knowledge, any complaint as to the treatment they were receiving, he replied, \"I think not; I think the board has done everything reasonable so far.\" Mr. Montour stated, however, that, \"We all bought our stock and implements when prices were high, and about the time payment became due the price of everything had dropped to about half.\"\n\nOther soldier settlers also stressed this point, and urged that a revaluation, under the circumstances, would be only fair. One of them pointed out that at a salvage sale the chattels brought very low prices indeed, and that they were bought largely by men who had not gone to the war. He pointed out that in this way the Government made quite as big a loss as it would have done had the goods never been given a revaluation. However, while this was done in one case it would have to be done in all, and if for Indian soldiers, then for white ones. The question thus becomes a very large one involving in the aggregate millions of dollars, and is one of general policy not to be considered within the purview of this Report.\n\nIt is satisfactory to note that though many soldier settlers were examined, not one had any fault to find with the way in which the officials are administering the scheme.\n\nADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE\n\nThis may be considered under two heads.\n\nIn the first place, the Council of Chiefs has jurisdiction in certain matters of rather minor import between Indians.\n\nA number of witnesses made serious complaints against the methods of the Council in this particular.\n\nIt was generally alleged that delays were frequent, lengthy and most vexatious. It was quite as freely stated that decisions went by favour, and not according to the merits, and that an applicant politically at variance with the Council had no chance of success if opposed by a man who supported the views of the chiefs. It was further declared that the majority of the councillors were totally without business experience, and lacking in education that many of them could neither read nor write. One witness put it, \"How can men unfit to manage their own affairs manage the affairs of other people?\"\nOne witness openly stated that to his personal knowledge there was corruption in the Council, while a number of others expressed their personal belief that this was so, but could not swear to it positively.\n\nIn the next place, there is the question of carrying out of the process of the courts.\n\nAbout this there has been considerable difficulty, certain of the chiefs encouraging their followers to resist the officers of the law in the prosecution of their duties, on the ground, disseminated among them in this Report, that the Six Nations Indians are an independent people, and not subject to Canadian laws.\n\nThe matter came to a head some months ago when two constables of the county of Brant proceeded to enforce a warrant of ejectment. A number of armed Indians gathered and resisted their efforts, finally driving them away under threat of violence. The Indians had sent a detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who carried out the process, and who have ever since controlled the reserve, and enforced the law's decrees. In this connection I wish to state that these men have carried out their duties with admirable tact and prudence, and seem to have aroused no feeling of personal animosity whatever.\n\nTheir presence on the reserve, however, is deplored, not resented, by the law-abiding Indians, who constitute a vast majority of the population, for they feel that it stamps them in the eyes of the white community as a lawless people.\n\nWhile strongly sympathizing with this view, it will be necessary, in my opinion, to continue the service of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police force until matters have once more become normal upon the reserve, which I think will be in the not very distant future.\n\nROADS AND DRAINAGE\n\nWhile roads and drainage are not specifically mentioned in the subjects assigned to me for investigation, they touch so closely upon some of these that it is necessary to consider them.\n\nIn more than one place I have called your attention, Sir, to the fact that the Indians are a poor people, and that this is a serious handicap to their progress. The Indians are almost entirely agriculturalists, and better market facilities would do largely to increase their wealth.\n\nEven the heart of the reserve is but a few miles removed from the city of Brantford, and from the flourishing towns of Hagersville and Caledonia.\n\nHowever, during several months of the year, the Indian farmer is practically cut off from these centres by reason of impassable, and often flooded, clay roads, and this at the very period when many of his produce command the best prices.\n\nThe same difficulty presents itself with regard to health. The sick person is frequently unable to reach his doctor, while the doctor's ability to minister to his patients is for long periods almost frustrated.\n\nIn my report relating to education I have referred to the unsatisfactory state of attendance. For this, again, bad roads are partly responsible.\n\nThe present clay roads are fairly well graded and drained. There is a good plant of road machinery upon the reserve, so that conditions are favourable for improvement.\n\nOn this one subject of good roads there was an absolute unanimity of opinion during my inquiry. They were more spoken of than any other one thing, and all were most anxious to obtain them.\n\nAn expensive system of roads is out of the question, nor is it necessary. Gravelled roads would fully meet the situation.\n\nI made careful inquiry as to the gravel deposits on the reserve, and am quite convinced that they are ample and fairly well placed.\n\nThe consensus of opinion was that a main road should be gravelled, beginning at what is known as the Couchiching Road on the north, and running south through the central portion via Ohsweken to the Hagersville-Caledonia road at Willow Grove. This should be followed later by another gravelled road, bisecting the reserve from east to west. I feel quite sure that with these two main highways constructed, connecting links would follow, in co-operation of the people themselves, and further delay would be unavailable.\n\nNo doubt, Sir, you could arrange with the Ontario Government to bear a proportion of the expense in connection with the general road system of the province. There is plenty of Indian labour available, and the engineering vision could be furnished by officers of the Indian Department. Should further money be required, I have the generally expressed opinion that the Indians themselves would gladly sanction a grant of the same from their principal fund.\n\nI recommend that a start upon gravelled roads be made next spring, or even sooner, should that be possible, and that the main road above indicated be pushed to completion at the earliest possible moment.\n\nA good system of drainage has been planned for the reserve, and about one-half of it carried out, with very beneficial results.\n\nIn consequence, a considerable area of low lying land has become productive, while the health of the community has also materially benefitted.\n\nI am told that a completion of the system would not cost more than $20,000, and I am of opinion that this expenditure should be made, and the work completed without delay.\n\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS\n\nThough not strictly within the class of subjects submitted to me for consideration, some matters were so frequently called to my attention that I think it advisable to make brief reference to them.\n\nSEED GRAIN\n\nThere is evidently a misunderstanding as to the distribution of seed grain upon the reserve. Witness after witness deposed that this was a \"free\" distribution, that is, free to the recipient, and that the cost of the seed was charged against the funds of the Band.\n\nI find on investigation of the department that this is not so. In every case the Band signed for its grain and undertook to pay for it. The earlier distributions were, as is true, financed from the funds of the Band, but almost this entire amount has been repaid.\n\nThe distribution of 1922 was financed from a Parliamentary vote, and not from Indian funds. The greater part has not been repaid. Should default continue, it will be to the people of Canada as a whole, and not to the Six Nations Indians.\n\nI have reached the conclusion, from evidence submitted, that a distribution of seed grain, even on promise of repayment, is unnecessary. Any Indian requiring such can readily obtain it from some neighbour on a share basis.\n\nI recommend that the practice be discontinued.\n\nSTATEMENT OF RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES\n\nThe Indians do not feel that they receive sufficient information as to receipts and expenditures in connection with their own fund. They claim that the general report of the department is too complicated for their understanding, and that they should have, half-yearly, a simple statement as to moneys received and expenditures made on their behalf; a statement similar to that issued annually in the majority of white municipalities.\nI feel that the adoption of this suggestion would do away with much misunderstanding and some mistrust, and I strongly recommend that it be followed.\n\nWhile on the subject of accounts, I desire to deal briefly with two items brought up by Mr. Albert Edward Hill who has evidence to submit:\n\n\"A vote of Parliament was passed for bonuses to teachers paid in 1920-21, and afterwards the money was not received by us, as shown on page 107 of the Auditor General's report for 1920-21. If this money were voted by Parliament I do not see why it should have been charged back to us. While on the question of accounts I desire to call attention to a further item on page 107, showing a payment of more than $15,000 to forty-seven enfranchised Indians. As far as I know $15,000 was the highest paid to any individual. We would really like an explanation.\"\n\nWith regard to the bonus for Indian teachers, it appears that certain Indian Bands in Ontario, including the Six Nations, pay the salaries of their own teachers, and in these cases the Auditor General requires a bonus to teachers to be met from the same source. While the salary is paid from parliamentary appropriation the bonus is paid therefrom also, but not otherwise.\n\nAs to payments for enfranchisement, the explanation is as follows: The total amount paid for enfranchisement is $15,709.98. The Auditor General shows this as being a payment to forty-seven Indians, but the payment was really made to one-hundred Indians at a per capita rate of $157.99. The Auditor General's report is misleading inasmuch as it shows a payment to forty-seven Indians instead of to forty-seven families consisting of one-hundred individuals. As a matter of fact the payment was to forty-five heads of families representing the one-hundred individuals, and not to forty-seven Indians as stated.\n\nWEEDS ON HIGHWAYS\n\nComplaint was made to me that no effort was made to cut noxious weeds on the highways before they ripen. One farmer stated that he kept the weeds cut on his own frontage, only to lose the benefit of his industry through seed blown on to his farm from neighbouring weed patches on the highway.\n\nI recommend that the cutting of weeds upon the highways be made a part of the care of roads system upon the reserve.\n\nGRAND RIVER NAVIGATION COMPANY\n\nThis matter was frequently called to my attention, and is considered a real grievance by the Indians and by the Indians.\n\nIt was alleged, and a perusal of a file I have made seems to bear out the main facts, that from the year 1834 to the year 1842, both inclusive, almost $160,000 of Six Nations Funds were invested in the stock of the Grand River Navigation Company, quite without the approval of the Indians, and without compensation to them.\n\nThe investment was a total loss. Ever since it became so the Indians have been constantly seeking reparation.\n\nIn answer to appeals made, the Canadian Government took the stand that the transaction occurred before there was responsible government in Canada, and that, therefore, no responsibility rests upon it.\n\nThe matter was then sent forward through the Government of Canada, an appeal to the Imperial Government. The Imperial Government replied, in effect, that this was a matter for the Government of Canada, and disclaimed all liability.\n\nThe fact remains that these trust funds have been lost, and that the Indians have been injured seriously by both Governments to which they have appealed.\n\nI suggest that the Canadian Government should negotiate with the Imperial Government to the end that an agreement may be reached between the two to appoint a jurist of repute, a citizen of some foreign country, to whom shall be submitted the whole question, with power to find whether the Six Nations Indians are entitled to a return of their money, and if so the amount thereof, and which Government should make the payment.\n\nThis question undoubtedly constitutes a real grievance and should finally be dealt with in some way. It is a constant irritation to the Indians, and, as one of them put it, shakes their confidence in British justice.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nANDREW T. THOMPSON,\nCommissioner.\nRE SIX NATIONS INDIANS\nSUPPLEMENTARY REPORT\nOF\nANDREW T. THOMPSON, ESQ., K.C.\n\nOTTAWA, December 5, 1923.\n\nTo the Honourable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Canada:\n\nSir,\u2014On November 22, I submitted to you my report upon the Six Nations Indians in which I referred, in general terms only to the Mohawk Institute.\n\nAlmost immediately thereafter my attention was called to serious charges which had then just recently appeared in the public press, made against this institution.\n\nHaving discussed these criticisms with you, Sir, you instructed me to proceed to Brantford, and there to make a thorough investigation into the affairs of this school.\n\nThis inquiry I have since concluded, but before reporting upon it I shall state briefly the general character of the charges made against the institution.\n\nThese refer mainly to food and discipline. It is also asserted that truancy has been unusually prevalent, while suggestions have been made that the Institute should be changed somewhat from its present operation, which is that of an academic and industrial boarding school for both sexes.\n\nI arrived at the Institute on the morning of Thursday, November 29. I had given no previous intimation of my purpose, visit, and was absolutely unexpected by any member of the staff or by any one else within the institution.\n\nI took this course that I might be able to make my inspection under the ordinary everyday working conditions of the school.\n\nI spent the whole day in a careful inspection of the premises; in attendance in the class and industrial rooms, where book work and manual labour were in progress; in the stable and farm buildings, where gardening and farm work was going on; in watching the children at play, in talking to a number of them; in inspecting the food served at the dinner hour, and the supplies held in store; in interviewing nearly every member of the staff, and in taking the oath under oath from Mrs. Alice Rogers, the Assistant Principal; Miss Floretta Elliott; Principal of the school; Mr. H. Knowles, Boys' Master; Miss Emma Persall, Sewing Teacher; Miss Susan Cummins, the housekeeper; Mrs. Emma Persall, Sewing Teacher; Mrs. Neva Knowles, Junior Governess; Miss Carrie Crowe; and Miss Susan Hardie, senior teacher of the school.\n\nThree of these were themselves Indians, and formerly, for many years, pupils of the institute.\n\nFOOD\n\nI found the food of good quality, and that served at the dinner meal, which I most carefully inspected, clean and well cooked. The reserve stores were well and neatly housed, and appeared to be of ordinary good quality.\n\nAt this dinner meal the quantities served to the children were certainly ample.\n\nIn conducting my examination under oath, above referred to, I paid special attention to the question of food. As this is a matter of importance I beg to submit the following extracts from the sworn testimony of the witnesses:\n\nPercy Henry Knowles: \"I have been here eight months. I preside in the dining room each breakfast, and so far I have never seen anything I would not willingly eat myself. To the best of my knowledge no child has ever left the dining room hungry. They are allowed further helpings if they ask for them.\"\n\nFloretta Elliott: \"I am on the staff of the Mohawk Institute, and have been since the end of June, 1922. Previous to that I lived here as a child for more than eight years. I was brought up on institutional food, and had to say that it was good. All the children get all they want to eat, and are given further helpings if they ask for them.\"\n\nAlice Mary Ashton Rogers: \"It is and always has been of the best quality, and sufficient in quantity.\"\n\nMiss Cummins: \"The food is very good, and the children are really well fed. They have all they can eat, and usually there is food left over. The food is as good as in any other institute I have seen.\"\n\nMiss Cummins is the housekeeper at the Institute, and she detailed her duties as follows: \"To arrange the children's meals; and to keep stock of the supplies; and generally to supervise all kitchen matters.\" While she has been at the school only since October 13, 1923, she is a woman of experience, having served in the Liverpool Sheltering Home and the Belleville, Ontario, Marchmont Home.\n\nI asked, \"Have any of the children ever complained to you about their food as to either quality or quantity?\" and she replied, \"Never; they have sometimes stunted me it was very good. I taste all the food that ever goes in to the children. Mrs. Rogers has never stinted me in my requirements for the children's food, and I always ask for plenty.\"\n\nEmma Persall:\u2014\"I take the suppers every night.\" Asked as to the quantity of the food, she replied, \"It is splendid; quite as good as I would give my own children. They are never allowed to go away hungry. They can have further helpings if they ask for them, and very often they do.\"\n\nNeva Knowles:\u2014\"I preside at the serving of the dinners every day.\" In reply to the question, \"What have you to say about the food?\" she replied, \"I have always found it plentiful, and of good quality; the children get all they want.\" She further deposed that margarine is used instead of butter, and declared it to be of good quality, saying, \"As I know from having eaten it myself.\"\n\nCarrie Crowe:\u2014\"It is good, pure and substantial, and they always get plenty of it at their meals. They are allowed extra food when they ask for it, and they do, at almost every meal.\"\n\nSusan Hardie:\u2014\"During all the time I have been here the food has been abundant and wholesome, but of late years the variety has increased, which is an improvement. You have only to look at the boys and girls to see that they are well fed.\"\n\nI would like to point out that Miss Hardie is herself one of the Six Nations, and has been on the staff of this Institute for thirty-six years. She further deposed that the children get fresh separated milk, but not fresh whole milk.\n\nFrom personal inspection and from the evidence of the witnesses above quoted, I feel absolutely certain that the children at the Mohawk Institute are well and abundantly fed.\n\nI would, however, call your attention, sir, to the fact that margarine is used instead of fresh separated milk instead of whole milk.\n\nThe Institute maintains some twenty milk cows, and while margarine may be a wholesome food in itself it can hardly be maintained that it is as nutritious as butter. In the same way separated milk is wholesome, but it lacks certain important nutritive qualities which are found in whole milk.\nMany of the children at the Institute are quite young, ranging from nine years upward. I recommend that butter be substituted for margarine, and I very strongly urge that whole milk be given instead of separated milk, especially in the case of all children up to fourteen years of age.\n\n**DISCIPLINE**\n\nIn articles appearing in the public press comment has been made upon the stern discipline of former times. I conceived it to be my duty to inquire into present conditions, and not into what may or may not have happened in years gone by.\n\nHowever, so serious were the allegations made as to past severity, carrying with them implication of present excessive strictness, that I think I cannot do better than to quote again from the evidence of the sworn witnesses.\n\n**PERCY HENRY KNOWLES**\u2014\u201cThe children are not severely handled; just enough punishment administered to maintain a fair amount of discipline.\u201d\n\nIn answer to the question, \u201cAre the boys contented at the Institute?\u201d he replied, \u201cThere is a very good spirit among the boys; I hardly know how else to put it. Their doors are not locked at night; in fact they are never locked in. I have lived in the city for twenty-five years, and in my opinion these boys have more advantages than those living in the city. The boys are supplied with all the bats and balls they can use up, both baseball and football, and they play with good spirits in both the boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 schools.\u201d\n\n**FLORETTA ELLIOTT**\u2014In answer to the question, \u201cIs the discipline severe?\u201d Miss Elliott replied, \u201cNo, just enough to keep order,\u201d and in answer to the further question, \u201cAre the pupils contented?\u201d she said, \u201cYes, as much as any would be away from their homes, I think. Mrs. Rogers is very thoughtful, and looks carefully after their health, too.\u201d\n\n**ALICE MARIE ASHTON ROGERS**\u2014In answer to the question, \u201cHow do you maintain discipline in the Institute?\u201d Mrs. Rogers replied, \u201cIn cases of extreme breach we use the utmost moderation. Only the regulation school strap is used, and whipping is confined to the hands. Whippings are only very occasionally administered. Quite frequently whole weeks pass without a single whipping.\u201d In answer to the question, \u201cDo you ever use a dark or semi-dark room for punishments?\u201d she replied, \u201cNever. To the best of my recollection I have never restricted diet as a punishment, but she said, \u201cOnly once in the years I have been here, and that only for one month. Even then, the restriction being to bread and water, unlimited bread was allowed. I do not believe in such a form of punishment, as it would injure the health of the children.\u201d\n\n**CARRIE CROWE**\u2014In answer to the question, \u201cDo you consider the discipline severe?\u201d Miss Crowe replied, \u201cI do not; when I was a pupil I found that I was always treated well. Of course, when the children misbehave, they are punished, but not severely.\u201d\n\n**SUSAN HARDIE**\u2014In answer to the question, \u201cWhat is the discipline imposed?\u201d Miss Hardie replied, \u201cIt is not severe,\u201d and to the question, \u201cIs whipping used?\u201d she said, \u201cYes, and I have done it on all the girls. I do not have to whip more than once a month on an average, and I use a rubber strap and seldom give more than six or seven strokes on the hands.\u201d To the question, \u201cDo you ever confine in a dark or semi-dark room?\u201d she replied, \u201cNo. This practice was abolished almost ten years ago.\u201d\n\nI most carefully observed the deportment and appearance of the children both at work and play. I saw no evidence of balkiness or unhappiness in any of them. At their dinner meal they talked and laughed constantly. They appeared to me to be acting as white children of the same ages would do under normal conditions. They showed no signs, whatever, of being under severe restraint.\n\nFrom this my personal observation, and from the evidence of the witnesses above set forth, I am fully convinced that the discipline at the Mohawk Institute is not at all harsh, and that criticism levelled against it is entirely unjust and unwarranted.\n\n**HEALTH**\n\nAt the time of my visit the health of the children impressed me as extremely good.\n\nThey are comfortably clad, and cleanly in appearance. Bath-room accommodation was ample, and I learned that all the children are under careful supervision and obliged to bathe frequently.\n\nMrs. Rogers, the Assistant Principal, is a graduate nurse of the Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, and also a trained and staff service worker of Bellevue Hospital, New York; she has held several important hospital positions, and has been on the staff of the Institute itself for nearly seven years.\n\nIn her examination I asked, \u201cWhat have you to say as to the health of the children?\u201d, to which she replied, \u201cAbsolutely good. They are a healthy lot of children on the whole. Years ago we had great trouble with typhoid, but to-day we only accept healthy children. Should tuberculosis or other disease subsequently appear, we have the child removed. I use my own professional judgment in watching over the children. When I think a doctor necessary I send for Dr. Palmer, our regular physician. I have not had to call him in since last August. If a child develops eye trouble we send him to an eye specialist. We do everything possible to make the children healthy, and to keep them so.\u201d\n\nI found the residence clean, well ventilated, well heated and with plenty of light. The improvements carried on during the last three years, at a large expenditure of public money, have been most beneficial, and I have nothing further to suggest in this particular.\n\n**TRUANCY**\n\nThere must always be a certain amount of truancy from an institution such as this.\n\nThe majority of the pupils are orphans or neglected children. In many cases, in consequence, they have grown up in a wild, undisciplined way. To such even the mild restraint of the Institute is irritating, and the reserve from which they have been let to savour is few.\n\nIt is an admitted fact that truancy has been more prevalent during the last two years than formerly. In my main report I pointed out that exactly the same condition has obtained during that period in the day schools upon the Six Nations Reserve, and I gave it as my opinion that the cause lay primarily in the state of unrest upon the reserve, with its consequent disrespect for order and authority.\n\nI do not think that the Mohawk Institute is suffering more in proportion than are the day schools, and I cherish the belief that when conditions upon the reserve once more become normal, truancy will almost disappear at the Mohawk Institute.\n\n**FINANCE**\n\nI desire to correct a misapprehension existing in some of the Six Nations Indians.\n\nDuring my inquiry held upon the reserve last summer more than one witness spoke of the funds of the Band as going towards the support of the Mohawk Institute.\nI have examined into this question and for the information of the Indians wish to state that none of their funds are expended in the support of this school, but every dollar is found by the Government of Canada from the funds of the Canadian people, through the New England Company. This New England Company was the oldest English Missionary Society, having been chartered by King Charles II in 1661-1662. It was founded for the work of propagating the gospel among the Indians of New England, but ever since 1829 the work has been confined to the Indians of Canada. Previous to that time, however, in fact from 1661 on, the activities of the company included Canada as well as New England.\n\nSUGGESTED CHANGE IN SCHOOL\n\nAt the present time the land used in connection with the school consists of ten acres, owned by the New England Company, most of which is in orchards, gardens and playgrounds, and a two hundred acre farm, upon which the agricultural work of the institution is done.\n\nOf the latter I would say that so long as it is maintained as a manual training farm, with reversion to the Six Nations Indians.\n\nBecause of its close proximity to the city of Brantford, this two hundred acre farm is of large value, and consequently much more capital is tied up than is warranted for agricultural use.\n\nIt would in my opinion be advisable to continue the school for girl pupils only, retaining the ten acres in connection therewith.\n\nAt the present time the accommodation for girls is fully taken up. Should the boys be removed from fifty to seventy-five more female pupils could be accommodated and from inquiries I make I am convinced not only that this number could be readily obtained, but also that there is a necessity for this extra accommodation for Indian school girls.\n\nA new agricultural school and a farm in conjunction therewith, would then become necessary. The land could be purchased at a reasonable figure in the neighbourhood of the reserve, should this be thought desirable, but the necessary capital would be somewhat expensive.\n\nThe difference between the selling price of the present farm and the purchase price of the proposed new farm would go very far towards paying for the new buildings.\n\nI realize that the proposed sale and disposition of the funds arising therefrom could only be made with the consent of the Council of Chiefs, but the proposal seems so full of advantage for the Indian children, to wit: more accommodation for the girls, and better accommodation for the boys, that it might be possible to obtain this.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\nIn conclusion I wish to say that I was unable to see Mr. Rogers, the Principal, as he is away on leave of absence in England.\n\nThe following facts will I think prove of interest, and will show conclusively that the Mohawk Institute has the careful management and generous financial support of the Canadian Government, very kindly assisted in the latter respect by the New England Company, the founder of the school.\n\nFISCAL\n\nIn January, 1922, the Mohawk Institute was leased by the New England Company to the department at a nominal rental for a period of twenty-one years. This change in management became necessary because of the diminution in the revenue of the New England Company. The company grants \u00a31,000 per annum for current expenses, and, when they can find funds, they are assisting the Department of Indian Affairs with capital expense. In the past two years the New England Company has granted $7,015.25, which has been used for alterations and additions.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs, before leasing the Mohawk Institute, made per capita grants for current expenditure each fiscal year. For the past few years the per capita grant has amounted to:\n\n| Year | Grant |\n|------|-------|\n| 1914-15 | $12,003.00 |\n| 1915-16 | $12,006.00 |\n| 1916-17 | $12,002.00 |\n| 1917-18 | $13,231.37 |\n| 1918-19 | $12,642.44 |\n| 1919-20 | $14,151.10 |\n| 1920-21 | $22,830.27 |\n\nDuring these years no grants were made from parliamentary appropriation, for buildings or equipment.\n\nSince leasing the institution, the department has not only paid from parliamentary appropriation a per capita grant for current expenses:\n\n| Year | Grant |\n|------|-------|\n| 1921-22 | $20,843.98 |\n| 1922-23 | $18,772.10 |\n| 1923-24 | $20,000.00 (estimated) |\n\nbut also grants for buildings and replacements, as follows:\n\n| Year | Grant |\n|------|-------|\n| 1921-22 | $1,486.00 |\n| 1922-23 | $36,958.13 |\n| 1923-24 | $6,500.00 (estimated) |\n\nSince leasing the Mohawk Institute from the New England Company, the department has met, roughly, 82 per cent of the current expense and has appropriated, roughly, 85 per cent of the moneys needed for the alterations and repairs that have been undertaken in the past three years.\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nUnder the terms of the lease, the department is to maintain the Mohawk as an educational institution for Indian boys or girls, or for both, and the pupils are to be drawn, as far as possible, from the Six Nations Indians. It should be noted that the responsibility for the management of the Mohawk Institution is practically entirely with the department.\n\nINSPECTION\n\nThe Brantford representative of the department visits the Mohawk Institute each month and reports to the department. The new agent, Colonel Morgan, has already paid some eight visits. The public school inspector for the county inspects the class-room activities twice each year and reports to the department concerning the progress of the pupils and the pedagogy of the teachers. The date of the last inspection by the public school inspector was the 7th of November, 1923. Superintendent of Indian Education has paid two official visits to the Mohawk Institute during the past two years. The department architect has visited the school at frequent intervals during the alterations and additions to the buildings.\n\nRELIGIOUS\n\nChurch services are conducted regularly each week by an Anglican clergyman, communion services being held each quarter. The Bishop of Huron is the official church visitor.\nINSTRUCTION\n\nThe department requires each pupil in residence to be held in the class-room at least five half days per week. The older boys and girls spend the other school hours in one of the departments, for the purpose of assisting with the domestic duties and the farm and garden activities and to receive instruction along vocational lines. The department expects the younger pupils up to eleven and twelve, to be in the class-room during the whole of each school day.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nANDREW T. THOMPSON,\nCommissioner.\nDecember 29, 1926.\n\nMr. Ferrier\n\nHave we succeeded in carrying out Colonel Thompson's recommendations as regards schools and education generally for Six Nation Indians?\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nDecember 29, 1926.\n\nMr. Ferris,\n\nHave we succeeded in carrying out Colonel Thompson's recommendations as regards schools and education generally for Six Nation Indians?\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nWith reference to your memorandum concerning Colonel Thompson's recommendations regarding Six Nations schools, I wish to report as follows:\n\n(1) The Commissioner recommended that the school board be replaced by trustees at each school and that each school section have a truant officer. I discussed this proposal personally with the Indian council and with the school board, and I strongly recommended a truant officer for each school, even if they would not concur in the recommendation that the general school board be abolished. I drafted a new set of regulations for the management of the Six Nations schools, and this has not yet been returned to me by the school board and Indian council. I have lately asked Colonel Morgan for action in this connection. The new regulations suggest that the school board, with minor changes, be continued. I believe we will not be successful in arranging for a truant officer for each school until John R. Lickers retires. Special effort has been made lately to secure better attendance at the day schools. Prizes and awards for both schools and individuals have been given; a circulating library has been arranged and the enforcing of the Act, with the consequent removal of certain delinquents to Chapleau, have all had a very salutary effect.\n\n(2) Colonel Thompson recommended individual drinking cups and Kaustine lavatories. Individual drinking cups and individual towels have been supplied, and I understand are being properly used. The Band In Council would not approve of an expenditure of approximately $5,000 for the Kaustine lavatories, and on May 15, 1924, you directed that the matter stand for the time being.\n(3) The Commissioner recommended that teachers' residences be provided, so that more white workers could be employed. Whenever buildings have to be replaced, the advisability of having a residence attached is being considered. Living quarters for three teachers have been provided during the past three fiscal years.\n\n(4) The Commissioner recommended that an ample supply of classroom stationery, books and other equipment be stocked in Brantford, so that there could be immediate delivery upon requisition by the teacher. This action was taken shortly after the Commissioner's report was presented, and complaints of the teachers in this matter have practically ceased.\n\n(5) Colonel Thompson recommended that emphasis be placed on school fairs and similar activities. This has been done, but I regret that an annual athletic meet has not yet materialized. This has fallen through largely because no suitable worker has been available to organize the activity, as, you will understand, organization is the main difficulty in this connection.\n\n(6) Colonel Thompson recommended that tuition grants of $100 be allowed in the case of students of poor parents, and that the grants be made for vocational training as well as academic instruction. Both of these recommendations have been carried out.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. Of Indian Education.\nMr. Maclean,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWould you be good enough to furnish me with a list of the schools and secretaries and principals thereof embraced within Tuscarora Township, County of Brant, Ontario.\n\nI understand this is an Indian reservation, and as such its schools are not under the jurisdiction of the Ontario Department of Education. In any case, I have been unable to secure a list of the schools from the Department here, and I would very much appreciate such a list from your Department, as I have occasion to get into touch with each school.\n\nThanking you for your early attention to this request,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nNational Publishing Syndicate\nOttawa, September 16, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, requesting to be furnished with a list of Indian schools, and the secretaries and principals thereof, in the County of Brant. There are eleven Indian day schools on the Six Nations' Reserve and the Mohawk Institute at Brantford. The day schools are administered under the control of the Six Nations' School Board. If you will apply to the Chairman of the Board, Lt. Col. C. E. Morgan, Brantford, Ont., he will, no doubt, furnish you with the information you desire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

However, where the requirements are deemed to be within the financial ability of the Board and of sufficient importance to the protection and progress of the pupils, the Board, whether rural or urban, is expected to bring its accommodations up to a higher standard within a reasonable time.\n\n(3) Four grades of the accommodations are recognized in the Inspector's report; the differentiation of the grading according to the following regulations being left to his judgment. This grading and the details of the requirements set forth below should guide Boards both in improving existing accommodations and in selecting sites and erecting new buildings.\n\n(4) All new school sites and all additions to old ones and all plans of new schools or of additions to old ones, and all other proposed school accommodations, shall be first approved by the Inspector, or by the local Chief or Senior Inspector, as the case may be, who shall be guided by the instructions contained herein.

Therefore the School Board has recommended to this Council and the Council now recommends to the Department that this will be altered to read \"A teacher at the completion of four years continuous service shall with the approval of the School...\"\nand the Department be entitled to receive an increase of salary for the fifth year of $100.00 and on the completion of the fifth year a further increase of a $100.00 when she will then have reached the maximum salary of $1200.00 per year\".

In reply I have to say that it is noted that the School Board has recommended to the Council that a teacher, on the completion of four years' continuous service, be entitled to receive an increase in salary of $100 and, on completion of the fifth year, a further increase of $100., when she will then have reached the maximum salary allowed, viz., $1,200 per year. In this connection, the Department suggests, for the consideration of the School Board, the Council and yourself, that these increases be spread over a term of four years, viz., a teacher, after completing say two years' continuous service, be granted an increase of $50 in salary for the third year and, also, $50 for each of the following years' services until the maximum is reached. It is thought that the granting of an annual increase would be more satisfactory and encouraging to the teachers. After you have had an opportunity to further discuss this matter with the School Board and the Council, you might advise whether they would approve of the arrangement suggested or prefer to grant the increases in the manner as recommended by the resolution above referred to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nLt. Col. C.E. Morgan,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nMinutes of Council Meeting.\n\nMoved by Samuel Lickers seconded by Frank Miller, that as it is felt by the Six Nations School Board that the good work of some of our more senior teachers in passing the children from their schools should be recognized and that, at present, no matter how outstanding the work of a teacher may be, she can receive no advance of salary until she has completed five years continuous service. Therefore the School Board has recommended to this Council and the Council now recommends to the Department that this will be altered to read \"A teacher at the completion of four years continuous service shall with the approval of the School Board and the Department be entitled to receive an increase of salary for the fifth year of $100.00 and on the completion of the fifth year a further increase of a $100.00 when she will then have reached the maximum salary of $1200.00 per year.\"\n\nCarried.\n\nBrantford, Ont.,\nAugust 12, 1930.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have reported on this minute under my 10B/30/647 of August 5th 10B/30/673 of August 11th.\n\nC. E. Morgan,\nSupt. Six Nations.\nAugust 16th, 1930\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir:\n\n\"School Teachers Salary Increase\"\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 32-1-1 of the 15th instant.\n\nAs there has been a School Board meeting recently and the harvest is now in progress I do not think it advisable to call another meeting simply to consider the $50.00 a year rise, but will do so shortly.\n\nI conclude that the suggestion of the Department is retroactive although this is not stated, the idea is excellent and will be encouragement to teachers and tend to longer service.\n\nAs a matter of fact the suggestion was mine in the first instance and, unless the Department wishes, it does not seem necessary to refer it again to the School Board and the Council.\n\nAs the Department has already approved the increases of Miss Miller and Miss Frohman on conclusion of their fourth year (No. 7825-4 August 12th) and the money is from appropriation, perhaps a further letter from the Department that $50.00 a year at the expiration of the first year until the maximum of $1200.00 is reached would suffice?\nI have already notified the two teachers concerned of their increase at the expiration of their fourth year.\n\nHow will this effect a teacher who is not fully qualified as to service, like Sylvia Jamieson? She has completed her first year and undertook to write the subjects in which she failed this summer but I do not think she did. I would suggest that such non-qualified service should come in the event of her qualifying within two years failing which I think that she would be discharged to pass her examinations and having done so and again being given a school should start her service again, prior service not to count.\n\nI would point out two errors in the salary list furnished in the Departmental letter of 12th instant quoted. Mr. Loft receives $120.00 a month not $100.00 as stated, and Miss Violet Hill (third year) is shown at $120.00. Miss Violet Hill's salary rise, however, is possibly intended on the assumption of a senior room as in the case of Miss Vera Davis?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt. Col. C.F. Morgan,\nSupt., Six Nations.\nOttawa, August 20, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, in further reference to salary increases to teachers on the Six Nations Reserve. It is noted that the suggestion made by the Department that these increases be spread over a term of years until the maximum salary is reached is satisfactory. These increases will be retroactive as regards length of service, but will not apply in the case of teachers that are not fully qualified. In the case of teachers who are not fully qualified, it is considered that the maximum salary should not exceed $1000 per year.\n\nThe Department has noted the errors in the salary list furnished in Letter of the 12th instant. The salary of Winton Loft, teacher of the No. 6 School, will be at the rate of $120 a month, not $100 as stated. The salary of Miss Violet Hill, teacher of the senior room at the No. 11 School, will be at the rate of $100 per teaching month, unless her length of service as outlined in letter of the 15th instant entitles her to an increase. I have to request that you will prepare a new list of the names of the teachers, the salary paid in each case last year, and the salary to which each is entitled for the coming school year under the arrangement for salary increases. I shall be pleased to have this list at your early convenience. The maximum salary in any case under the new rating is not to exceed $1200.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Secretary.\n\nLt. Col. C. E. Morgan,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nOhsweken, Ont., Aug. 26 '30\n\nI hereby certify that I have examined Miss Garnette Athies and find her suffering from deranged heart action. She would be unable to carry on as teacher of a very heavy school but could possibly manage a school of not more than 20 or 25 pupils.\n\nSigned,\n\nW. Davis M.B.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nSir:-\n\n\"Six Nation School Teachers' salaries\nDepartment letter 32-1-1 August 15th\"\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter as above and\nbeg to furnish, herewith a statement of the teachers at various\nschools, the salaries they received last year and the salary to\nwhich each will be entitled under the new scheme of a $50.00\nrise, up to $200.00 per annum after completion of the second\nyear's service.\n\nIt will be seen that Miss Atkins has been changed from No. 9\nto No. 8 and Mr. Sunseith from No. 8 to No. 9. Miss Atkins is\nnot strong, having strained her heart playing baseball and I feel\nthat so large a school as No. 9 which has been allowed to get\nrather out of hand owing to the desertion by Miss General and\nthe indifferent discipline of Miss Green would be too much for\nher. Garnette Atkins is a good girl and only needs a rest to\nrecuperate which she can obtain at the smaller well disciplined\nschool lately presided over by Miss Wilma Smith. It is also\nbest that there should be a man at No. 9.\nI have seen Miss Atkins who is pleased at the change, for which she asked, as, although No. 8 is a little further from her home, there is a fine gravelled highway all the way which will bring her school within half an hour in her pontiac car.\n\nI attach to this letter Dr. Davis's certificate re Miss Atkin's health.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt. Col. C.E. Morgan,\nSup't Six Nations.\nOttawa, January 7, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Orr informs me that you have discussed with him the advisability of making improvements to the day school system on the Six Nation Reserve. It is his impression that you believe additional classroom space is required. If new or larger buildings are really needed, it might be advisable for your office or the School Board to prepare a map of the reserve, showing the location of the schools and school sections and indicating the enrolment in each section. You will know whether this is necessary or whether each school can be considered on its own merits.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nLt. Col. C. E.

Dr. MacGill\nOttawa --- Ontario\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nI was for many years an Anglican Missionary on the Six Nations Reserve near Brantford, & as I am still a very close friend of the Six Nations Indians. I have the honour to write to you re:- Miss Mary Anderson, an Indian school teacher, of that reserve, who has a First Class certificate but unfortunately owing to a little jealousy, has not got a square deal, & we have to ask you to kindly take the matter up with the acting superintendent of the Six Nations reserve. Last fall Mr. Wm. MacGill of Purford wrote to you about this Miss Mary Anderson, & soon after she was given four months employment as an relieving teacher, & she gave very good satisfaction, & she was promised the next opening, but on the retirement of Col. C. E. Morgan, she was passed over for an inexperienced teacher, who has no claim on the Six Nations reserve. The Six Nations Indians as a whole will be greatly pleased, if you will be so kind as to ask the acting superintendent to see that Miss Mary Anderson (Tuscarora Indian) gets a square deal.\n\nAnd while I am writing may I also mention Mr. Melvin Johnson (an Indian) whose father distinguished himself at the front, the young man taught school for some years, & then went to McMaster University, & has just graduated, & he would like to be replaced on the teaching staff, as soon as there is an opening, & with his university training he should be quite an benefit to the staff.\n\nBelieve me, yours faithfully,\n\nH.J. Bondell\n\nFormerly Indian Missionary\nAugust 30, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, recommending the services of Miss Mary Anderson and Mr. Melvin Johnson for positions as teachers in the Indian schools on the Six Nations Reserve.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that arrangements have been completed for the teaching services for the coming school year at the Six Nations Day Schools. While the Department is aware of the qualifications of the two teachers recommended by you, it is regretted that there will be no vacancies to which they could be appointed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. H. J. Condell,\n30 Brant Street,\nBrantford, Ont.\nMr. Hilton L. Hill  \nIndian Office  \nBrantford Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been instructed by the Six Nations Council to write the Department of Indian Affairs, through you, protesting against the appointment of outside teachers on our Reserve when we have at least six qualified native teachers, at the present time, who are without schools.\n\nThe first consideration that should be given by the Department to this serious situation is the fact that the Department and this Council have given the parents of these teachers every encouragement to prepare their children for positions as teachers and the parents have, in some cases that I know of personally, denied themselves the necessities of life in order to do so. And now that we have these teachers, who are being supplanted by outsiders, they cannot possibly obtain schools off the Reserve on account of being Indians, consequently the parents and teachers are wondering why the Department's officials have stated publicly that it is their aim to advance the educational interests of the Indians of Canada, should discourage our people in the manner above stated.\n\nIt appears to me and the members of the Council that political influence is playing a prominent part in the selection\nof outside teachers for our Reserve, the latest appointment being of one who has had no previous teaching experience, and I believe that if these facts were brought to the attention of the proper authorities and the discrimination against our own qualified teachers disclosed, that a revision of policy would take place.\n\nI may add that the Council feels its position very keenly in this matter due to the fact that it realizes that teachers salaries are not paid from Band funds and that therefore it has no jurisdiction over the selection or appointment of teachers and on the other hand the teachers themselves and their parents are looking to the Council that urged and encouraged them for assistance out of their difficulty.\n\nTrusting that I have made the Council's point of view clear\n\nI remain\n\nRespectfully yours\n\n[Signature]\n\nSec'y, Six Nations Council.\nSIX NATIONS MINUTES OF COUNCIL MEETING HELD SEPT. 5th, 1935.\n\nNo.4.\n\nMoved by Robert Hill seconded by John Lickers, that the Secretary be instructed to forward to the Indian Department, through the proper channels, a letter protesting against the appointment of white teachers to our public schools when we have, at the present time, six qualified teachers, members of the band, who are without schools.\n\nCarried unanimously.\n\nThe secretary of the Council was instructed to write a letter protesting against the appointment of white teacher to the schools on the reserve.

Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nEnclosures (2).\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn receiving the information that two of the lady teachers on the Six Nations Reserve are planning on resigning from their positions in the schools in order to be married, and in expectation that vacancies on the staff may occur I am again sending in my application as I did last year for re-appointment to the Reserve staff.\n\nActing on the urge of many people and the fact that other teachers have been placed back on the Reserve, and also that I was promised in nineteen thirty-three that I would soon be taken back, I am seeking your consideration.\nThis promise was made by Lt. Col. C.E. Mayan because I gave in without unpleasant resistance although several glaringly false charges were acted upon by the School Board and I was given no trial or hearing.\n\nThese charges were trumped up in order to justify certain political arrangements.\n\nI admit frankly that my teaching was below par in the spring of nineteen thirty-three but it was due to a nervous disability, and I sent in my physician's certificate to the Indian Office also a petition prepared by the parents in the school section where I taught. This petition represented over ninety per cent of the parents but neither it nor the certificate was allowed to be taken up or considered.\n\nIt is my desire and the desire of the majority of the people on this Reserve that I should be given a chance to re-establish myself and my reputation as a teacher and remain a source of usefulness and educational influence.\namong my fellow Indians. I therefore appeal to your ability to extend justice and fair play, to allow me to regain what I have lost and I assure you of my heartiest and fullest cooperation in achieving the high standard of education and teaching desired by the Department. I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nWinton Loft.\nTo the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nBaptist Parsonage,\nOhsweken, Ont.\nJune 3rd, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am given to understand that Mr Winton Loft of Ohsweken is applying for a position as Teacher in one of the Public Schools on The Six Nations Reserve. I sincerely desire to say a word in favour of this young married man with the hope that you will look upon his application with favorable consideration.\n\nMr Loft has two young children and has no direct source of income. To apply for a school off the Reserve would no doubt mean disappointment as there are too many White Teachers looking for a position, hence his main opportunity lies on the Reserve.\n\nFor practically five years I have known this young man to be a exemplary Christian young man. He has been faithful in his Christian profession through those years and many before my time. He is a member of the Anglican Church, not a Baptist, but I have no hesitation in saying that I believe he is a true Christian and his influence is ever for good in the community. Such young men who are natives I do think should receive every encouragement that we can give them.\n\nAs far as his intellectual attainments are concerned I think you will be better posted in that direction than I am, at the same time I am sure all who know him will agree with me that he is well equipped mentally, morally, physically as well as spiritually to be a guiding hand in the training of our young people.\n\nI am not ignorant of what has happened in the past, but I do believe that if Mr Loft is again tried he will prove worthy of the trust reposed in him.\n\nThen for the sake of his family, for the sake of his good influence that he would have upon the rising generation I sincerely plead that you will favorably consider his application for a position as Teacher in one of our public schools.\n\nTrusting you will pardon any seeming presumption.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\nFred Ashton,\nBaptist Missionary to The Six Nations Indians.\nOttawa, June 5, 1936.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, addressed to Honourable T. A. Crear, enclosing resolutions passed at a joint meeting of the Ohsweken and Sour Springs Woman's Institutes of the Six Nations Reserve and of the New Credit Women's Institute of the Mississaugas - requesting that Indian teachers who are qualified be given positions in Indian schools.\n\nIn this connection I would point out that, of the 13 teachers employed at present in the schools on the Six Nations Indian reserve, 11 are Indians, one an enfranchised Indian and one a white person. Besides, we have Indian teachers on other reserves. The Department gives every consideration to the appointment of qualified Indian teachers, but it is not always possible to have vacancies at which it could be satisfactory for an Indian girl, especially, to carry out the teaching duties. I am not aware what vacancies there will be for teachers for the coming school year. There are a number of Indian teachers who have applied, and they will be kept in mind when filling any vacancies for the coming academic year.\n\nRegarding the appointment of Indian teachers at residential schools, I would say that these schools are conducted under the auspices of one or other of the religious denominations, and, provided the teacher is qualified, the Department allows them to make the appointment. The salary in such case is paid by the school authorities, from their per capita allowances or other receipts.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMrs. Ada Martin,\nOhsweken,\nOnt.\nOttawa, June 5, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant, applying for a position as teacher of an Indian school on the Six Nations reserve.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department is not aware, at the present time, of what vacancies, if any, there will be for teachers in the schools on this reserve for the coming academic year. I would suggest that you apply to Colonel E. P. Randle, Indian Superintendent, Brantford, Ont., as he will be notified by any teachers who intend to resign and he would likely recommend a teacher for any vacancy.

Winton Loft is making application for a school. I wish to state that I have known Mr. Loft intimately, for a period of six years, and have found him to be of a high moral standard. I have not before in the twenty-three years that I have served the Church of England as a parish priest, met anyone with so many talents that make for a good school teacher. He is a splendid teacher, a talented musician, a good public speaker and organizer, and an exceptionally good artist. This seems a good deal to say with reference to one man, but I know from personal contact with Mr. Loft during the six years that I have known him, that I am simply speaking the truth when I say this.\n\nHe has also a wife and two children, and needs the employment to be self-supporting. He is also the son of one of the Hereditary Chiefs and yet loyal to the present system of municipal government.\n\nTrusting that you will consider his application for re-instatement on the teaching staff of the Reserve with favour,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours for the good of the Indian Race,\n\nE.

Johnson seconded by Fred Hill, that this Council request the Indian Department that all White teachers and enfranchised Indian teachers on this Reserve be replaced by our own qualified teachers. Carried.\n\n18. This resolution is an attempt to secure the immediate dismissal of all White and Enfranchised Indian teachers. It is my opinion that the principle of engaging only Indian teachers in future, should be observed, at the same time, I feel in fairness to those who would be involved by such an action that it was the duty of the Six Nations Council, if they contemplated such action as this, to have done so at a much earlier Council possibly in May, then those teachers concerned would have known the likelihood of their services being dispensed with and had every opportunity to apply for the various schools advertised as vacant throughout the Province the last few weeks. As it is now, we are within three weeks of the commencement of the new school year and it would hardly be just or decent for them to be dismissed at the last moment without any previous idea of what was contemplated.\n\nIn view of this, I hope the Department will not approve of the Council's request but suggest it be postponed to enable those teachers affected to secure other positions, perhaps with a more reasonable chance of success than they would have if this change is made in the course of a week or so.\n\nMajor E.

Randle,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nOttawa, July 16, 1937.\n\nDear Major Randle:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Miss Alice Menture, in which she renewes her application for the position of music instructor at the Six Nations Reserve.\n\nYou may remember that Miss Menture communicated with you on December 23rd, 1936, and that her application was referred by you to the Department at that time but was not considered, owing to the fact that no funds had been provided in the Estimates for such instruction.\n\nIt is going to be exceedingly difficult to justify the appointment of a music teacher at the Six Nations Reserve this year, for several reasons. You are aware, of course, that we recently appointed a farm instructor and, in addition to this, decided to purchase certain farm equipment. I should like, however, to have you give the matter careful consideration and let me have any recommendations you may care to make. I understand that special emphasis is being placed upon music and musical appreciation in the revised curriculum of the province of Ontario. Musical instruction has been emphasized in the Western Provinces for a number of years. This instruction is given by the ordinary teachers, without outside assistance, except in the larger cities. Would it be possible to have Miss Menture give a certain amount of instruction and direction on, say, a half-time basis? Should she decide to give this instruction, what provision could be made for her transportation from school to school, particularly during the winter months?\n\nAny information with which you can supply me would be deeply appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor E. P. Randle,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nHon. T. C. Carter,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\n\nSchools Hon Sir,\n\nI understand some changes have been made in the School Curriculum of the Indian reserve.\n\nI wanted to know if the changes include music.\n\nIt might be of interest for you to know that the Six Nation Indians are very musical and considerable work has been done toward their Education privately.\n\nMiss Montour is one of the tribe and is very clever at music having taken vocal courses.\n\nMay I say I believe if your department can give you some information with regard to this important matter.\n\nIf music is included I trust you will consider Miss Montour.\n\nThanking you for past favors\n\nYours Truly,\n\nFrank Vaillant\n\nValdeman, Co. Ont.\nOttawa, July 27th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nA letter addressed by Mr. Frank Laidlaw of the Six Nations Reserve to the Minister of the Department has been passed on to me for consideration and reply.\n\nIn this letter, Mr. Laidlaw is anxious to secure the appointment of a music instructor at the reserve and suggests the name of Miss Montour.\n\nI am anxious that you should assure Mr. Laidlaw that his letter has been received by the Minister and that the matter to which he refers will be given careful consideration by the Department just as soon as we obtain your recommendation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor E. P. Randle,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThis is to report that Mr. D. S. Pitts has resigned as senior teacher here and that I have engaged Mr. Kinrade, a fully qualified teacher with three years experience to fill the position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHorace W. Smith,\nPrincipal.\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your enquiry in file 32-1-1 of the 16th of July with regard to the application of Miss Alice Monture for the position of Music Instructor on this Reserve, I beg to submit the following information and recommendation.\n\nAs you comment, musical instruction is increasingly becoming general throughout the schools of this Province and it would appear fitting to give the Indians of this Superintendency some direction along this line, as not only do they appear mostly to have a natural ear for music, but their singing is pleasing to hear and it is a simple and reasonably easily attained pleasure from which they derive much delight.\n\nMost school authorities I have discussed the matter with are wholeheartedly in favour of a curriculum that includes musical instruction, feeling it is beneficial and interesting for the children in every way, and it is reasonable to suppose such an idea would apply equally to Indian children.\n\nIt appears that this instruction is limited to about 30 minutes a class at a time and it is considered that in the course of a school year it should amount to about 40 hours per class.\n\nApparently in this Province at the present time, teachers have to qualify by a special course before they can give this type of musical instruction, and they are then paid at the rate of $60.00 per annum per school. These courses are held during July and August each year and I would suggest if Miss Monture is given this position it should be understood she takes this qualifying course next summer.\n\nMiss Monture is of course, an accomplished musician, which does not necessarily mean she is fitted for this type of instructional\nwork though I would say she is, and such a course is bound to help and assist her to obtain the best results.\n\nIn view of the information outlined and all other circumstances I am of the opinion that if at all possible Miss Monture should receive the appointment of Musical Instructor in this Superintendency.\n\nAs the Department is aware it is not easy for an Indian, male or female, to obtain a situation in the more select vocations of life off a Reserve and here is an Indian girl who has worked hard to attain some means to a decent livelihood and it would be a fitting recognition of her efforts to allow her to carry on a useful work among her own people.\n\nThere are twelve schools in this Superintendency, two of them being two roomed schools, and it would probably be the best plan to maintain separate classes for musical instruction in these two schools, which would mean there would be 14 classes to teach.\n\nIn view of the Road difficulties, some parts of the year, if this appointment is made, I would suggest instruction be limited to three schools a day, two in the morning and one in the afternoon, and the salary might be $600.00 for the year, rising to $960.00, if satisfactory services are rendered.\n\nAs far as transportation goes, I think if Miss Monture is appointed she should be prepared to provide her own, as she and her mother own a car, and if the schools are grouped conveniently the distance, to travel any one day is not great and except on rare occasions, it is possible to reach any school, as except for one they have approach by gravel from one direction.\n\nIf such an appointment is made I can call the teachers together and this additional instruction can be fitted in to the curriculum in the most convenient way to all concerned.\n\nWith reference to your comment on the difficulty of justifying such an appointment, may I be permitted to bring some facts to your attention. This Reserve in numbers is easily the largest in the Dominion and the Indians of it have been associated with the white man closely for over two hundred years, and being so near to a modern City, live in many ways very little differently to our own population.\n\nThey are observant and not slow to note all that is going on around them, and quite rightly desire to keep up with the modern progress in any way it brings them particularly, educational advantages.\nAs far as Agriculture goes and considering the size and numbers on this Reserve, it has for many years lacked any agricultural direction, being allowed to drift, until the problem of reviving the life of the farming community is a grave and difficult one. The appointment of a Farm Instructor recently was certainly timely, and something which should have been done many years ago, especially in view of the fact some Reserves seem to have two.\n\nMay I also point out that this superintendency throughout the years of the depression has made no calls on the Public purse for relief appropriations, like many Reserves, but has more or less been self-supporting, which is greatly to the credit of the 5000 odd people who live on this Reserve.\n\nMany thousands of people on and off Reserves have cost thousands upon thousands to maintain on relief in recent years, so it is my opinion it is more sound to put a person into a position which will achieve something for the community at large and give reasonably gainful employment, than to possibly maintain the individual on relief, or the depressing effect of just existing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. P. Randle\n\nMajor E. P. Randle.\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, August 21, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant and to thank you very heartily for the information contained therein.\n\nI may state that I have discussed, with a number of men who are reasonably familiar with the provision made for music in the schools of Ontario, the desirability of having a director of musical instruction at the Six Nations Reserve. These men inform me that special direction of musical studies is scarcely necessary during the first months of the school year when the classes are being organized, nor is it advisable to continue it during the last month of the school year when the pupils are preparing for examinations. It would appear, therefore, that, if provision is made for the appointment of a music teacher, it would be only necessary to employ her for a eight month period.\n\nI have been wondering if it would be possible to engage Miss Menture at a salary of approximately $600.00 per annum, on the understanding that $300.00 of this amount would be contributed by the Six Nations Council from Band Funds. I am prompted to make this suggestion for a number of reasons. There are still in Canada hundreds of Indian pupils for whom no educational facilities whatever have been provided. These boys and girls, I feel, have a real claim on the Department for consideration. In addition to this, there is a number of schools in the province of Saskatchewan particularly\n\nMajor E. P. Randle,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nparticularly in the drought area, where we shall be called upon to provide noonday lunches and clothing for pupils during the coming year. I am also disposed to think that the parents of the children in attendance at the schools on your reserve might become more interested in the progress of the pupils in their musical studies if they, themselves, were contributing in part to the cost. You might discuss this matter with the members of the Council and let me have your reply in due course.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nR. A. Hoyt, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 21st of August in connection with the suggested appointment of Miss Alice Monture as music instructor on this Reserve, I am pleased to advise you, that as instructed in your letter the matter was laid before the Six Nations Council, and under Resolution 3, of the Council of the 2nd instant, they have approved of your suggestion and voted $300.00 towards Miss Monture's salary providing the Department pay the remaining $300.00.\n\nIf this appointment is now finally approved, may please be instructed as to the duties the Department wish Miss Monture to carry out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. P. Randle\n\nMajor E. P. Randle.\nEPR/CB.\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, September 9, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 8th instant, in which you inform us that the members of the Council of the Six Nations are prepared to make a contribution of $300.00 toward the salary of a director of musical studies for the school year 1937-38. This resolution has been passed on the understanding that the Department would also contribute the sum of $300.00 toward the salary of this teacher.\n\nThis arrangement is satisfactory to the Department, and you should notify all the teachers on the reserve of Miss Monture's appointment. I am of the opinion that Miss Monture should discuss her work with the teachers and, with them, work out a programme that will enable her to visit each school regularly. I think she would also be well advised to discuss her work with the school inspector for the district. The inspector is, doubtless, familiar with the duties and responsibilities assumed by the teachers in charge of musical studies at other schools throughout the province.\n\nIt should be understood that, should a disagreement arise between Miss Monture and the teachers as to the time that should be given her for her work, the matter should be referred to you and that your decision will be final on the matter.\n\nThe employment of Miss Monture by the Department\n\nMajor E. P. Randle,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nDepartment, in cooperation with the Six Nations Council, is undertaken largely by way of experiment. Her work can be carefully reviewed at the end of the year and a decision reached at that time as to the advisability of employing a teacher for this work permanently at the reserve.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

Miss Monture was forwarded cheque No. 13179 for $60.00. This cheque has been cashed and returned here.

Monture as Director of Musical Studies for the schools on the Six Nations Reserve for the academic year 1937-38. When Miss Monture was appointed it was understood that her duties would commence on October 1, 1937, and continue until May 31/38, a period of 8 months. For this period of time she was to be allowed a total salary of $600.00. This would mean that she would be paid $75.00 a month.\n\nActing on the request contained in my memorandum of October 11th, Miss Monture was paid $60.00 at the end of October.\n\nOn the November paylist, I would appreciate if you would arrange to have her paid $90.00 ($15.00 balance on October and $75.00 for the month of November.\n\nOn the December paylist and on subsequent paylists until the end of May 1938, she should be paid $75.00 a month.\n\nYou will note from my memorandum of October 11th that half of the salary or $300.00 is paid from Trust Account No. 33 and the other half is paid from the appropriation for Indian education.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, November 19, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 15th, arrangements are being made to adjust the salary of Miss Monture, Director of Musical Studies on the Six Nations Reserve.\n\nShe will be paid $90.00 at the end of the current month, viz: $15.00 balance at October, and $75.00 for November.
