The atmosphere was thick with smoke on Saturday night, beginning near the proximity of Prairie House.\n\nIndications are good and the large number of buildings going up indicate that Regina, like the Leader, is flourishing.\n\nA gang of thieves, consisting of Mr. W. Macdonald and an employee of contractor Mclean left last week for Wood Mountain where they will soon be heard from.\n\nThis has been a season of mammals equalling the North-West as well as Manitoba. We expect that the vegeta- tive shows more than ever before to old residents of the Territories.\n\nA correspondent writing from Wapella says: \"On Saturday the 24th, about 11 a.m., a party of three white men, armed with revolvers, came into the brigantine settlement, its course being N.E. by S.W. They approached with intent to rob the settlers of their wagons and stores. When seen our party were 15 miles south of Elkhorn. Should any young man be interested in this affair, he will perhaps say where they saw it.\"\n\n**EDMONTON**\n\n*From the Bulletin, Sept. 17.*\n\nW.
