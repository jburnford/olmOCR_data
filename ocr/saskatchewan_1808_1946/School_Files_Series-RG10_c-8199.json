It is probable that the resolution has been forwarded to you through another channel, but lest they may have neglected to do so I enclose a copy of Mr. Sahanatien's letter. I have informed him that while the final authority in the appointment of a teacher rests with the Department at Ottawa, yet they have accorded to us the privilege of nominating suitable persons, and that where the qualifications are regarded as satisfactory our nominations are always confirmed.\n\nI am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 5, 1909.\n\nRev.

A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\nrestricted from interfering, so long as the school is properly conducted. If he has any fault to find, he should report the matter to you and not take it upon himself to censure the teacher.\n\nIn this case the person performing the duties has been ancillary to Mr. Kendall, who signs all returns as if he was the actual teacher.

(RG 10, Volume 6132, File 393-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPoor Copy\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 6th instant #152195/1 respecting the Indian School at Gibson, I would say that in all probability some of the complications have arisen from the fact that the missionary, Mr. Kendall, was not familiar with the course of procedure that ought to be taken. As the number of Indians at Gibson is so small we have always felt that the duties of missionary and teacher should be discharged by one and the same person, and this was the expectation when Mr. Kendall was appointed. But either because he did not consider himself qualified as a teacher, or more probably because he disliked the routine of a teacher's work, he employed a teacher, whom he paid out of his own pocket, and took upon himself the responsibility of making the reports, etc.\n\nIt is among the possibilities that Mr. Kendall may be transferred to another field in June next, but in the meantime I will communicate with him respecting his relation to the teacher with a view to avoid future complications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 14, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th inst., in further reference to the Gibson school, and in reply I beg to say that the Department will be pleased to hear from you again on this subject as soon as a decision is arrived at.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, May 26, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 37th ult., in further reference to the nomination by the Methodist Church of the teacher of the Gibson school and the petition received from certain Indians of the band, asking that the school be removed from the charge of that Church.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is in communication with the Rev. Dr. Sutherland, and it is hoped that a solution satisfactory to all concerned will be arrived at.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMr. Louis Sahaniati,\nSahaniati P.O.,\nOnt.\nDear Sir,\n\nAt the present time there are four Indian Schools located on Missions connected with the Methodist Church where experienced teachers are required, namely, Gibson, Moraviantown, Chemong Lake and Christian Island, which latter school will be vacant at the end of the present calendar year.\n\nI have applications from some four or five different parties, some of whom, I think, would make good supplies for the schools in question. Before submitting their names for appointment, however, it is important that I should know what will be the limit in regard to salary. The parties I speak of are married men, and most of them have had a number of years' experience as teachers in Public Schools. I do not know as yet what salaries they have been receiving, but I doubt if it would be practicable to secure teachers of their class for less than $500 (Five Hundred Dollars) with a house to live in.\n\nHoping to make satisfactory nominations in the near future, I am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Scott\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, 22nd July, 1908.\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant asking what will be the limit in regard to the salary of teachers for the schools at Gibson, Moraviantown, Chemong Lake, and Christian Island. In reply I beg to say that the salary will of course depend on the qualifications. The Department will be prepared to pay $400. to Gibson, $500. to Moraviantown, $450. to Chemong Lake, and $400. to Christian Island. The Department has no means of providing a residence at any of these places, with the exception of Chemong Lake, in regard to which you are being communicated with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nA. Sutherland, Esq., D.D.,\nGen'l Secy., Methodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto, Ont.\nCOPY,\n\nFor eight years Mr. J. Buchanan taught the Senior department of Moosomin Public School during which time our school stood among the highest in the District.\n\nMr. Buchanan had not only his own department in charge, but he also taught the mathematics and the commercial subjects in the High School.\n\nHis pupils always passed their examinations very creditably.\n\nHe is not only a first-class teacher but a citizen whose moral character is above reproach.\n\n(Sgd.) A. Saxis,\nSec. School Board.\n\nMoosomin, Ap. 6/02.\n\nCOPY\n\nMr. Buchanan held the position of Principal of Belmore School for over four years, and to say that he gave satisfaction is saying only a small part of what should be said in his favor. He is remarkably well adapted for the duties of his profession and seems to have the faculty of instilling into his pupils a love for work.\n\nWe regret exceedingly that he has severed his connection with our school.\n\n(Sgd.) P! Ross,\nBelmore, Aug 12/89. Sec. School Board.\nCOPY.\n\nThis is to certify that Mr. J. Buchanan taught for several years in my Inspectorate and although he had a very large school I always found his pupils well up to the standard.\n\nMr. Buchanan is an earnest, faithful, and skilful teacher, and I take great pleasure in recommending him to any Board of Trustees, with the assurance that he is sure to succeed.\n\n(Sgd) A. Campbell,\nInspector.\n\nKincardine, Sep.10/90.\nDictated - Dr. S. Toronto, July 22, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that we have an application from Mr. John Buchanan, of Toronto, for appointment as teacher at the Indian School at Gibson. Mr. Buchanan is a married man, forty-eight years of age, has but one daughter, 21 years of age who, I suppose, will not reside on the Reserve should the appointment be made. Mr. Buchanan holds a second class certificate grade A, obtained in 1880 from the Normal School at Toronto. He has had eighteen years' experience as a teacher in various public schools though not engaged in that profession at the present time. I am informed also, that Mr. Buchanan's wife has been a very successful worker among young people, and is an excellent singer and player. I enclose copies of some of Mr. Buchanan's testimonials, and need only say further that all the information I have received concerning him is of a favorable character.\n\nAn important matter remains to be settled, however, namely, the amount of salary that we will be authorized to promise Mr. Buchanan should his appointment be approved by the Department. I presume it is fully understood that competent teachers cannot be secured at the present time on the same scale of salaries that were paid ten or even five years ago.\n\nMr. Buchanan's name is the only one that I am prepared to submit at this date. I am in correspondence with several others but do not think that any one of them would be more suitable than the person in question. I am your obedient servant,\n\nSecretary, Dept.

On the strength of the advice from the Department that the salary should be $400.00 I stated so in my advertisements. Now I am told they will accept Miss Taylor at a salary of $250.00. Miss Taylor resides the school, however, and I have reason to think she was a very good teacher. I wired Mrs. Yarwood, of Mount Elgin Institute, and she would go on the 15th of November, but she had previously stated that she would not accept less than $400.00. I cannot do any better and neither, I am satisfied, can the Department. Salaries of teachers are as high or higher in the small schools of the district. Now, I don't know what to do or where to look for a teacher, and if the Department declines to my appointment I will cheerfully hand over the appointment to them.\"\n\nA few days ago I sent to the Department Mrs. Yarwood's application and a copy of a testimonial.

Mr. Watch that Mrs. Yarwood objects to a temporary appointment to this position.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the object of the Department in making all new appointments temporary is to protect the interests of the Indians. If the services of a teacher so appointed prove satisfactory the Department is only too pleased to retain them. The word \"provisionally\" might more accurately designate the meaning the Department wished to convey than the word \"temporarily\".\n\nThe Department would be pleased to have Mrs. Yarwood take charge of the school and her retention in the position will be assured, provided she gives satisfaction.

Mr. Hailstone (the missionary) is doing splendidly, and in justice to him I could not send him adrift.

I am ignorant of the teacher's qualifications whether she is teaching on a Provincial Certificate or on County papers, or on happy go lucky permit from the Methodist Missionary Society.

The Department cannot understand why you should have closed this school for Election Day, September 21st.\n\nYou are expected to keep school open every teaching day and without this is done or a satisfactory explanation furnished the Department can have no recourse but to disallow your salary for any unauthorized holidays taken by you in future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMiss Mary L.

Sir,\n\nThe Department is advised by Mr. Macdonald, Indian Superintendent Parry Sound, that Mrs. Yarwood, who intended to send in her resignation as teacher of the Gibson Indian School at the end of the year, has agreed to take charge of the Ryerson School. This is a more convenient situation for Mrs. Yarwood and the Department has agreed to her transfer. It will, therefore, be necessary to obtain a successor at the Gibson School and I would ask you to take the necessary steps. If you consider that it will probably be sometime before you will be able to make a nomination it is thought that arrangements can be made to have Miss Dewasha, who has had some little experience and who lives close to the school, take charge temporarily. I shall be glad to hear from you at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. E. E. Shore,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, December 21, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 16th instant I beg to say that your explanation with regard to transfer of Mrs. Yarwood from the Gibson to the Ryerson School is quite satisfactory. Rev. T. H. E. Shore, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, is being asked to nominate a successor.\n\nIn the meantime the Department does not wish to have the Gibson School closed and it is thought that you may be able to arrange with Miss Dewasha, who has had some previous experience at the school, to re-open classes on January 2nd unless a satisfactory nomination is made before that date. If you do not hear from the Department in the course of a few days you may arrange to have Miss Dewasha take charge of the school and the Department will pay her at the rate of $300.00 per annum, it to be understood that she will give up the position immediately upon the receipt of notice to do so. If Miss Dewasha will not accept it you may engage Miss Deaire, but, as the former is much closer to the school, it is considered preferable to give her the temporary appointment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nD.

Sir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of January 4th, last, and previous correspondence in reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Gibson School and to state that the Department hopes that you will be able to nominate a competent teacher for this school to take charge after the approaching summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. E. Egerton Shore,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nI regret the difficulty regarding the school vacancy on the Gibson Reserve. I have felt very foolish in the matter. We requested Miss Yardwood come up for an interview. She was induced to come by the late Agent, with the promise of increased salary. I received no notice of this, other than the resignation, which I thought was altogether for another reason.\n\nI did my best to secure a teacher at the salary offered, but it was not sufficient. I determined to secure the class of teacher we desired.\n\nI then heard casually that the School was opened. I had received no notice. I could not turn aside an appointment as the one made, though the young woman was of excellent character; she was not capable of teaching. I was asked regarding Miss Dewartha, but she was also competent. I felt that as the School was opened by the Agent, that he would be able to secure a teacher, and that he would be able to secure a teacher with experience, but I still felt I would not upset any arrangement made by the Agent.\n\nIn the meantime, I had been spending money getting a teacher, and had some good applications, but no appointments of teachers depended upon somewhat after-hand regarding salary, and we had thirty schools without teachers around this District, and more than half the schools occupied had teachers without certificates, who were expected to secure an appointment.\n\nWe kept Mrs. Yardwood as long as we did by agreeing to board her...\nat the Mission House for $102 a month, when the lowest price board was $45 weekly. All teachers wished to be boarding at the Mission House and we have been pleased our Missionary for this privilege.\n\nI have heard from the Board that the School is vacant again, and I was going to write them. Because when Mr. Logan visited here that he was instructed to appoint her at $300. I have no objection to this, yet I suggested to him that she had better write her appointment with the approval of the Department. The Indians will accept it, I am sure, in a better spirit if it is done this way. She has written her, subject to two weeks notice when a qualified teacher is found. I am not sure if she will accept the salary offered.\n\nI should like to know if I am to nominate another, representing me do the Missionary Board? This will be the Society's business the appointment to pass out your hands altogether. Still I am willing to do what I can to solve the difficulty. They should suggest it is next to impossible to hold an application for a few days subject to approval, but we have been able teachers largely by telegrams in this country, the demand is so great.\n\nPlease give me the opportunity of explanation, although it better to inform you of the situation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.W. Walter\nOttawa, April 15, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant in reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Gibson school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has been in correspondence with the General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society with a view to securing the services of a competent teacher for this school and on January 4th, last Mr. Shore approved of the temporary appointment of Miss Dewashm, pending the securing of a suitable person to take charge permanently. On the 6th of this month Mr. Logan, the Indian Superintendent, was asked to communicate with Miss Decaire with a view to having her take charge of the school temporarily and on the same date Rev. Mr. Shore was again written to and asked to try and nominate a competent teacher for this school, to take charge after the summer holidays. It would be well for you to communicate with him and the Department hopes that by that time the supply of teachers will not be so limited and that the Missionary Society will be in a position to nominate some satisfactory person. I may say that to a person with some qualifications a more liberal salary will be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. C. W.

I am awfully sorry for taking away the previous teacher we had and it was a good one and well liked by everybody she was a good industrious teacher and good decent character. I had three children who went to school when the previous teacher was in operation my children progressed more faster than the teachers we had in previous years in history but now the one that the department appointed we do not like it everybody does not like her at all or I might better say that we don't want her in\nthe place she is holding.\n\nEven the children don't like her how they can learn when the school teacher are not welcomed to their ideas. I have kept my children back away from school as they told me that the present teacher they did not like for they would study their lessons so what's the use of their pushing them to school.\n\nNow if the Department decided to change the school teacher why it did not send one from outside without putting and appointing one which was disliked by everyone. She is no good to teach anybody.\n\nMr. D.F. Metcalfe wrote to her last fall if she would take the position to teach Gibson School.\nAnd she flatly refused to take it; she would not want it. But now she fought for to get the place and she got it only to crowd out somebody that was doing the work. I dare say that this is very unfair.\n\nThe previous teacher should remain teaching till June 30th at least and then it was lots of time to look for a high class one.\n\nNo doubt the party of the present teacher must have wrote to the Department to the very best that they could put in and put up to be the best teacher that could be got. But I would say to such point that I expect the best story. I do not say that character to be bad no. I think she has a good one.\nBut on account of teaching school it's against our satisfaction. Now please tell me can we get back our good desirable teacher again? I am in dead earnest to get her back to school. If not, I would sooner see and have the school shut up till the holidays, as the other children they won't learn anything. It's no use paying her money for the coming two months as she will not do a bit of good to the children.\n\nPlease inform me very soon as to the result of my request. I think I am in the right to make such request as I am a member of the Band and know all about what's needed.\n\nI remain Yours Truly,\n\nMr. Wm. Ronnie\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the appointment of Miss Decaire as teacher of the Gibson School was only temporary. The Department trusts that a qualified teacher will be available after the summer holidays. In the meantime there is no doubt that your children will get some benefit by attending the school and you should see that they do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. Wm. Rennie,\nSahaniien, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Appointment of Teacher for Gowan Indian Reserve\n\nIn view of the fact that there are no satisfactory responses to our ad for teachers in this school, I shall appreciate it if you will give me your advice regarding the following:\n\nThe first proposal is an applicant. She has desired her name be added.\n\n1. Miss Mary Desire the present teacher, she desires to continue, her salary is $500. She has said nothing about any necessary work. The school needs a regularly qualified teacher, for an Indian teacher without qualification she has done fairly well.\n\n2. Miss Edna Atkinson aged 20 (March 21) - With Model School Certificate, a very bright girl. She can easily secure a position. She would require a salary of $400, and I think more is worth it.\n\nHave an application of a Normal School Certificate teacher for January next. If the appointment is made in our district, the minimum salary paid in the district for qualified Normal School teachers is $500.\n\nPlease not sent in the formal application etc., but make it by the mind of the Dept. first.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.W.

Sir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant in reference to a teacher for the Gibson school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your communication should be directed to the Rev. T. E. E. Shore, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, Toronto, in whose hands the nomination for this position rests. I may say that the Department is not in favour of placing the school under the charge of an Indian again, but would prefer a qualified teacher. Miss Atkinson's application will be considered promptly with any others that may be received. It is desired that the school should be reopened if possible on the 3rd of September.

He wanted to know whether his office in some way partook the nature of the work of a truant officer. He seems to think that as a school trustee his work, if any, lay in the direction of encouraging parents to send their children to school and to see that the attendance of school is maintained to the highest possible mark. If this is what is expected of him he desires to know the regulations governing school attendance, and what steps are necessary to take in order to place the band under the operations of the compulsory school attendance regulations.\n\nI would suggest that Samuel Commandant be advised along these lines and a copy of the Department's School Regulations be sent him.\n\nChas.

No application was made to him nor received by the Department for her appointment and he stated that he wrote to the Methodist Missionary Society, but received no satisfactory answer from them about her. As she was in charge of the school she was allowed to remain on temporarily at a salary of $450.00 a year.\n\nIn April, last, Mr. Logan reported that all the schools in his agency were quite satisfactory, excepting Watha (Gibson), where the attendance should be better. He stated that the trouble is that the teacher, who is over 70 years old, is very cranky and a lot of the parents want to\nto get rid of her. He stated that he was sure the school would be run better if it were taken out of the control of the Methodist Missionary Society in choosing a teacher. On the strength of Mr. Logan's report Rev. Mr. Arnup, Assistant Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, was informed that Miss Stephenson's services were not satisfactory and that a younger teacher should replace her after the summer holidays and he was requested to be good enough to take the necessary steps to secure a qualified person of suitable age to take charge of this school and give Miss Stephenson timely notice that her services would not be required after the end of this term.\n\nMr. Arnup acknowledged the receipt of this letter on the 29th of April, last, and stated that he would undertake to give Miss Stephenson due notice and take the usual steps to secure a teacher in good time for the re-opening of the school after the summer holidays.\n\nThere have been no specific charges made against Miss Stephenson; the only apparent objection the Indians have to her is her age and uncertain disposition. There is no question of her qualifications, which are ample for the position. Mr. Arnup made no objection to her removal at the time and there is no doubt that a younger teacher would be more suitable for this school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

She however did not receive my letter in time to complete our arrangements even by wire and the school is now closed. Miss Stephenson will be in my office within a few days and I shall now postpone my visit to the Reserve and final recommendation until after that time.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reference to Watha School on the Gibson Reserve, Miss Stephenson has today intimated her acceptance of the Department's offer to continue as teacher of this school for another year.\n\nFrom all that I can learn, Miss Stephenson's work as teacher in this school and her services to the Indians through what she has been able to do for the children have been above the average. She is undoubtedly well thought of by the inspector and all other information which I can gather concerning her work is exceedingly favorable. It would seem that an unfortunate disagreement which arose between her and members of the band over a matter which really did not affect her conduct of the school at all is responsible for the trouble that has arisen. The source of this disagreement has now been removed and Miss Stephenson feels that she can go back with a reasonable expectation that her return will be acceptable to the Indians.\n\nIn view of this fact it seems reasonable to call the attention of the Department to the fact that the salary paid at Gibson seems rather low in comparison with that of other schools. $400.00 I think was the amount Miss Stephenson received last year. I am therefore taking the liberty of asking on her behalf for the favorable consideration of the Department in this matter in order that if possible an increase in salary may be granted for this year.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJ.

There is a specific reason why no definite nomination has been submitted to the Department.\n\nThe combined grant from the Indian Department and the Missionary Society now being paid for the work at Gibson would furnish a reasonably adequate salary for a married man. At the same time, the situation at Georgina Island is unsatisfactory from the standpoint of the Missionary Society, although I believe that the lady who is supplying there has rendered fairly good service as day school teacher. It was my hope that we might secure an efficient married man for the school at Gibson and end the temporary arrangement at Georgina Island by placing Mr. Oliver there as missionary teacher. I think that he would prefer the situation, although somewhat less remunerative, because it is more accessible and comparatively adjacent to Toronto. In the meantime, the position of the Department is secure in that both positions are covered. If we do not secure a married man whom we can recommend for the position of missionary teacher at Gibson, Mr. Oliver will be nominated for that school and the present or some similar arrangement continued at Georgina Island.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJ.

In an accompanying letter I am submitting a nomination for Georgina Island.\n\nI therefore beg to nominate Mr. Oliver as teacher for the day school on the Gibson Reserve.\n\nIn this connection I beg to call your attention to the fact that the salary paid in the past for this school has been only $400. As a result it has been difficult and usually impossible to secure properly certificated teachers. Mr. Oliver is not only a man with a university education, but a teacher of many years experience. Moreover, he has shown himself particularly well adapted to the management of an Indian School and affairs on the Reserve. In view of his superior qualifications, I hope that it will be possible for the Department to offer him a salary of not less than $500.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJHA/M.\n\nJ. D.

(RG 10, Volume 6132, File 393-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nSir,\n\nAs indicated in my report for the Quarter ending Dec., 1916, I am sending you a short supplementary letter re the attendance at this school since I took charge in the latter part of 1916.\n\nThe first thing I noticed on my arrival here in September last was the distance from both school & Church of most of the Indians' houses. This I at once inferred would militate greatly in unfavorable weather against a good attendance, especially in the case of the School, which of course depends on the younger members of the community, and always numbers a fair proportion of girls among its pupils. My inference proved only too correct; though I little anticipated then the dreadful state into which the roads quickly fell during even a short period of wet weather. During such a time, and also in the bitter days of winter, which is very severe on these uplands, it is almost impossible for any save the more robust children to travel often to School. Little children (and there are many on the roll) can't come; and it is hard on the elders ones to do so.\n\nDuring the warmer days of the Fall the attendance was much better. In one week (Oct. 7-12 inclusive) it ran as follows: Oct. 12, Th. 13, Wed. 16, Th. 18, Sat. 20 - the last day being an uneventful one - and so on till Winter came, when the attendance fell with the thermometer and the snow till the usual attendance read as low as 10-15. Oct. 27-31, Nov. 3-7, Wed. 11, Th. 13, Th. 15, Th. 17, Sat. 19 - a very worse. Then \"bad roads\" and \"bad frosts\" in a short time became in the parents' mouths...\nthe stock excuse in a schoolhouse continued absence from school during the season of bad weather above indicated.\n\nOf course my excuse serves as Indians as a reason for his or her child's absence from school. I have yet to meet an Indian with a real excuse of honour or duty, so you cannot use this as a cover. Children is either non-existent or spoiled, and hence at best when handled with a very tender hand. We have no truant officer, and unless the Indian Act were strictly carried out, we are just as well without one.\n\nI have spoken in almost with extreme earnestness on the duty of parents as to the education of children; but it seems only waste of breath; for every Indian's own inclination is a law unto them in matters where no punishment follows the offense.\n\nThe sluggish, inert, spasmodic nature of these Indians, young and old, lies as a serious barrier in the way of all progress. Morality is a humorous factor in the life of these people, who are Indians to the finger-tips, despite the fact that most of them have almost white skins. The skin is the only thing white about them, I regret to say, in most cases.\n\nI am writing healthily and pessimistically; for I am doing my best for my charges here. I gave ten prizes of books at the Christmas gathering, and also candy, &c. I wrote to the agent to ask if there were any fond to do this year; but got no reply.\n\nI gave three books, &c., to encourage the scholars\u2014only nine who attended only.\n\nI am sorry I had to delay my report; but all the holidays I have been ill.\n\nIllness of my wife\u2014an attack of pleurisy coupled with a touch of influenza usually passes all defects of voice.\n\n(Signed)\n\nIndian Affairs.

Brooke,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe the undersigned parents of children living in the vicinity of Black Lake, Gibson Reserve; beg to ask you to make strong representation on our behalf to the Indian Department; to consider the need of opening a school in our locality during the winter & spring months only.\n\nThe distance is so great coupled with the impassable condition of the road during these months that it is next to impossibility for the small children to attend school.\n\nWe parents are anxious to have our little ones to continue in an uninterrupted schooling during the year. As you are acquainted with\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, 191\n\nthe needs and conditions of our peculiar position we trust that you will present our request to the department with effect.\n\nKindly submit our request to the department and let us know as soon as possible.\n\nWe are your petitioners.\n\nChief P. Strong\nMrs Paul White\nWinne Commandant\nCharles White\nMrs H. Koda Commandant\nMiss Thompson\nMrs James S. Johnson\nJohn White Jr\nMrs Esther White\nOttawa, December 2nd, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nIn connection with the subject matter of the enclosed petition I beg to report that while there last week I looked into the merits of the case.\n\nThe settlement of the Gibson reserve is divided into two, one known as the \"Black Lake\" situated on the western part, and the other as the \"School-house\" Settlement. The children of the former settlement have now to travel over 2 miles to get to the regular school across a wilderness of forest and rocks, traversing of which, even at best of seasons, is a source of anxiety to the parents as to the safety of their children, but during the inclement weather the trip is more hazardous for the little ones. There are 15 children of school age in the Black Lake Settlement. (List enclosed).\n\nIf the Department considers the advisability of granting the request of these Indians, a school could be opened in the home of Chief Peter Strength who is prepared to allow the use of one of his rooms, 21 x 10, well lighted with four windows and has an entrance of its own, for $8.00 a month, which will cover heating, sweeping the room and the use of an organ. The benches now in the old abandoned Methodist Church nearby could be utilized for the use of the pupils and teacher. The Chief's place is about as convenient a place as any for that purpose in the vicinity. Miss Mary Strength, age 18, daughter of the Chief, and an ex-pupil of Mount Algin Institute, could be engaged for the\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nfor the 4 months beginning 1st January, next, for $25.00\na month, as assistant to the regular teacher, Mr. Jones,\nwho is willing to supervise her work. As most of the child-\nren are small, young and in the primary grades, it is thought\nthat anyone having an ordinary public school education, like\nMiss Strength, who I may add is also quite a musician, could\nsatisfactorily fill the position for the time being. The\nschool material, excepting a blackboard, would not have to\nbe purchased as the supply on hand at the regular school\ncould be used. The school in fact will be a subsidiary to\nthe regular one. The total expenditure involved in such a\nmove would not exceed $135.00 for the 4 months.\n\nYears ago the school on the reserve used to be\nheld alternately every six months on these two settlements,\nbut was found unsatisfactory and the practice discontinued.\nThe present school is doing splendid work and is apparently\nappreciated by the Indians, as shown by the attendance of the\nchildren considering the distance and awful roads they have\nto travel to get to the school. Last year one of the pupils,\nAlex Desaire, passed the entrance examinations with honors,\nand is now continuing his studies in the high School at\nBarry Sound. The only complaint offered by the teacher was\nlack of punctuality on the part of the pupils in getting to\nschool in time for the opening exercises and he thinks that\nif the school had a large bell and rung regularly half an\nhour before opening, this would be remedied to a large extent.\n\nThe teacher, Mr. Jones, an Englishman, about 40,\nappears to take keen interest in his work as teacher and\nmissionary. He evidently has the confidence and support\nof the Indians. The practice of appointing teachers on\nthis reserve, as well as on some of the other reserves, in\nthe dual capacity of teacher and missionary, may have some\ncommendable points in its favour. It, however, seems to\nme to be a source of handicap to the attainment of anything like full measure of success in either sphere, and should be discouraged as much as possible. This opinion I may add, is shared by all those engaged in that capacity, in the case of Mr. Jones, while he appears to be attached to the religious side of his work, yet I cannot help thinking that were his efforts wholly given to one line of work, he would attain far greater success. Mr. Jones is engaged in teaching the boys in manual training and his wife is gratuitously giving her services to teaching the girls in domestic science. Mrs. Jones, a refined English lady and worthy of better environment, feels extremely out of her element on the reserve, and for the sake of her husband's usefulness it would appear advisable to give him every consideration in the matter of transfer to another school, not so isolated as Gibson on the occasion when the Missionary Society releases him from his present incumbency.\n\nI have gathered the following observations from the remarks made by different Indians during the discussion on the timber question and it can be seen that they have grasped the situation rightly. They have learned the value of education; realized that it is the only means available with which their children can confidently expect to make good for themselves; that they now have to live like white people; face the struggle of life with the same equipment as the whiteman and that the greatest asset in this struggle is the acquisition of practical knowledge of the English language. These Indians have got beyond the childish notion so popularly current in the minds of Misoka brethren, viz: that an Indian with his imaginary \"treaty rights\", will be an Indian as long as the sun shines, etc. From every indication such a delusion is a thing of the past with these people.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

They claim that the distance which the children have to travel in the present season and the state of the roads does not warrant them in letting their children travel the distance during the winter. Mr. Cooke states that he consulted you regarding this matter.\n\nThe Department is disposed to accede to the request of the Indian parents and give the school a trial during the present winter.\n\nArrangements have been made with Chief Peter Strength, who will allow the use of one of his rooms, which is well lighted and has an entrance of its own, at a rental of $8.00 per month, which will cover the heating, the sweeping of the room and the use of an organ. The benches in the old Methodist Church nearby can be utilized for the use of the proposed teacher. This school will be subsidiary to your school and conducted under your direction and supervision. The Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Mary Strength as teacher at a salary of $25.00 per month for the four months, beginning the first of January, next. The Department understands that there is sufficient school material, with the exception of a blackboard, on hand in your school.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to make the necessary arrangements to have the room in the Chief's house fitted up, the benches transferred from the church and the necessary supply of school material handed over to the teacher.\n\nMr. Cooke states that there are fifteen children of school age who reside in the vicinity. It is hoped that the parents will see that they are well regulated in order that this school may meet with success.

The school will be conducted in a room in the home of Chief Peter Strength, who has agreed to allow the use of the room at a rental of $6.00 per month, which will cover the cost of heating, sweeping the room and the use of an organ. Mr. W. E. Jones, the teacher of the Gibson School, is being requested to attend to the fitting up of the room for school purposes and to have the benches in the old Methodist Church nearby transferred for the use of the pupils and teacher.\n\nMary Strength, daughter of the Chief, and an ex-pupil of the Mount Elgin Institute, has been appointed teacher at a salary of $25.00 per month.\n\nThis school is to be open for the winter and spring months only and to start on or about the first of January, next. It will be subsidiary to the present school and the teaching will be carried on by Miss Strength under the direction and supervision of Mr. Jones. There is a sufficient supply of school material on hand at the present school which can be used. Mr. Jones is willing to supervise the work of the teacher and to assist her in every way he can, and the Indians have promised to send their children regularly to school, there being fifteen of school age who should attend.\n\nIt is hoped that this school will meet with every success and be of benefit to the Indian children residing on the Black Lake portion of the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst.

It is hoped that it will continue to meet with every success for the period which it is carried on during the winter months.\n\nWith reference to the school supplies I beg to say that the blackboard and other articles asked for were ordered from the Government Stationery Office, to be forwarded to your address, on the 29th of December, last. The Stationery Office is now being asked to have these supplies forwarded as soon as possible. Inquiry should be made at Bala regarding the blackboard, as that is the nearest express office to the school.\n\nA wall map of Ontario and also a map of the District of Muskoka will be ordered, as requested. These maps will be sent addressed to you at Bala, Ont.\n\nAn order is being placed with the Geo. M. Hendry Co., Toronto, to ship two single desks No. 6 and one single desk No. 5. These desks will also be shipped to you addressed to Bala. You will be good enough to arrange to have the above material delivered at the school. Any expenses incurred by you for this purpose will be paid upon receipt of properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure. The Geo. M. Hendry Co. are being instructed, when shipping the desks, to also send you their account, in duplicate, which, upon receipt of the desks, you will be good enough to certify and forward to the Department for payment.\n\nWith reference to your request that a night school be conducted for the adults on the reserve I have to request that you will be good enough to state where it is proposed to carry on the work, also the probable cost of the same. The Department has, in the past, authorized the conducting of night schools, and will pay the teacher for his services at the rate of fifty cents per hour for a period of six hours per night for three nights each week. You will be good enough to furnish further particulars regarding the night school, with any suggestions you care to make, and also state whether, if this school is authorized, the above rate of remuneration would be satisfactory.

Her salary is at the rate of $25.00 a month.\n\nI enclose herewith a couple of voucher forms which I would request that you would fill in for the amount which you recommend she should be advanced on her salary.\n\nAs you are aware the salary of teachers is only paid quarterly upon receipt of the quarterly returns, but, in this instance the Department will allow her an advance.\n\nYou will be good enough to state the amount she should now be allowed.

The chief himself has stated that if opened he will attend.\n\nI am of the opinion that if started at an early date during the progress of the forward movement which is going on here, such an enterprise would be heartily welcomed & a new sense of the importance of sending the children to the regular school would be awakened in the parents.\n\nAlso the foundation would be laid for a larger effort in the coming year.\n\nI have already mentioned the matter of an Institute to the chief & he said a frame building 2 storey could be erected ready for next winter to be used for School & Institutional purposes, such as Gymnasium, Reading, Recreations, Lectures etc.\n\nPersonally I would support the school as previously mentioned for this winter & would ask permission to make arrangements for the larger effort for September next.\n\nIn regard to the salary you offer, I beg leave to say this is quite\nsatisfactory to myself.\n\nIn regard to the cost, I presume the expenditure would just be as follows:\n\nAn allowance of say $1.50 weekly to caretaker.\n\nThe expenditure for two lamps (Hanging)\n\nThe equipment as follows:\n\n12 Arithmetics\n12 Grammars\n2 Geographies\n12 Spellers\n12 English & Histories\n12 Education\n12 The Story of the British People\n12 The Story of the Earth & its People\n12 Hygiene\n\n1 each of the 5 Numbers of Out Copy Books\n12 Composition\n24 Scribblers\n24 Exercise Books\n24 Lead Pencils\n12 Penholders\n1780 Sy pointed, Blue Points\n1 Pointers\n1 Black Board Set (as complete)\n1 Plotting Paper\n1 Wall Map of Hemispheres\n1 \" \" British Isles\n1 \" \" North America\n1 \" \" States\n1 \" \" U.S. America\n1 Set for Square & Cubic Measures\nOther material can be used from our present school.\n\nIn reference to the Blackboard (or ordered for the Hub School) I am glad to inform you that everything has now arrived & has been sent to the school with the exception of the Books & maps.

The school should be kept in operation three nights per week, two hours per night.\n\nYou may arrange to purchase the two hanging lamps required for lighting purposes.

It is hoped, however, that you will remain until the end of the present school year, namely, till the 30th of June, next, and perhaps by that time the present agitation against you will disappear.\n\nI think it would be well for you to discontinue the night school from the end of the present month.

The former teacher, Miss Mary Strength, is prepared to take charge again at $55.00 a month, which is an increase of $10.00 a month over her former rate's salary. I would recommend that the school be reopened and that Miss Strength be given the salary asked for by her.\n\nChief Strength, in whose house the school is conducted, also asked for an increased allowance for the use of the room which includes heating, caretaking &c., from $6.00 to $10.00 a month. I do not think there is any reason just now for granting the request of the Chief.\n\nIf any funds are available for this school, I should like to see it expended towards equipping it with 4 or 5 small double desks. It is certainly in need of such equipment. There are only 3 single desks and some long wooden benches in the school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He would not obey and the school was very much disturbed when he was present. I wrote to his father to have him placed in a school where he could attend regularly to get a good education to fit him to take his place in the world as a good citizen.\n\nI believe this boy has good ability and perhaps might be a better boy under better influences. I do not consider him a bad boy but an untrained boy with good possibilities which I felt could not be developed under present existing conditions.\n\nThe distance from school with bad roads when it is bad weather...\nMother cannot talk English.\n\n3rd child to school irregularly.

Catholic in religion.\nMother kept them out of school all the month of June.\nLouis Keller disagrees with the teacher. Besides Celester's cap had been hid and could not be found for a day. Mother was annoyed. Things happen when children disobey rules and Celester is to blame for caps or rather hat disappearing.\nIn regard to children who attended my school taught by Mary Strong. Not many of them attended after school closed. This was owing to the long distance and not having some older person to guard going & coming to school. As there are dangers and sometimes the boys are not so gentle nor as thoughtful as they should be. There should either be two schools or proper arrangement for the safe supervision of little children going & coming along the roads at such long distances.\n\nIn regard to pupils who were supposed to attend my school. The following did not attend as regularly as they should for proper progress\u2014\nAlbert Martin - 14 yrs.\nThomas Lock 12\nBella Salmon 10\nFannie Reeves 10\nMitchell White 7 yrs kept at home because he was learning bad words at-\nThis school was in a very disorganized condition when I came here to teach. Pupils are somewhat subdued and better disciplined with more respect for authority. They are not up to the mark yet.\n\nParents think I was not strict enough but for a time they were very disobedient and almost incorrigible but with God's help they are much better now except a few who have not been at school sufficiently long enough to be disciplined. For example Russell White, Alfred White, Thomas Stock.\n\nRussell White & Thomas Stock would be better placed in an industrial school.\n\nWith pupils who have attended pretty regularly I have been able to lay a foundation where next year they can go ahead more quickly. They were very much behind in a knowledge of the primary principles. All this success...\nfrom God working along with you and blessing your efforts.\n\nSome want a new teacher put in here who can control the children better than I have done. Changing teachers is not always for the best. It takes the first year to know your school, pupils, parents, also homes well and to get a start. Here is a Missionary Preacher Rev. Mr. Jenner from Peterborough who supervises the Church work here and comes to preach every third Sunday. This was the best arrangement. The Conference could make all present.\n\nIf you want me to continue teaching here next year let me know when you send me my money.\n\nIf you think it better to put another teacher in it is a matter for your prayerful consideration as to what is for the best interests of these people spiritually & intellectually.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nMarty A.

There is one other case, viz: Russell White who should also be placed in an Industrial School, and if it is possible for you to arrange to have him sent to a school of the denomination to which he belongs, it would be advisable to do so.\n\nThe Department will be pleased to retain the services of Miss Black for another year at the same salary as is now paid her.

Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEsteemed Sir,\n\nLet me take the liberty in writing a few lines to our Honorable Sir, to explain the state of affairs in our School concerning the incompetency of the school teacher.\n\nI do not doubt that Miss Black, our school teacher, is a good and educated woman. But she cannot keep order in the school. Children does what they like, sing and whistle and play. She cannot hold them into submission. And on account of this they cannot learn\u2014in the least.\nShe cries and weeps more than the children. Can keep over her scolding and then she will turn the child out doors to go home. The child's parent would keep them at home in a few days after she will report this child's absence for staying away from school. Who is going to get the blame not the children and not the parent but herself. And another thing she does not look after the children from using bad language I passed alongside the school house one day. I listened to the noise inside. I thought the children had the recess. No. I overheard one pupil reading his lesson between the intervals of the din of laughter and whistling and yelling and running around the room.\nNow your Honorable Sirs consider these facts carefully and recognize that what I am telling is the truth and anybody can corroborate my statements just the same. I am not running the school teacher down any other way, only save these facts, what I already stated.\n\nWhat is the use, what is the sense of spending several hundred dollars year in and year out in employing unsuitable teachers and get none of the least benefit to the children, only money wasting useless. The talk of the majority of parents decided to keep their children at home if the same teacher is going to remain for the next term and regardless of the truant law which is going to be ignored, and trouble is certain to brew thereafter.\nSo I resort this way to apply to the Deptt of what I cannot do myself. Several families are not able to fix for themselves as they cannot write. So I write this on their behalf and also for myself.\n\nI will now anticipate favorable results of my request and forthwith in employing a new teacher good and honest that can keep order in school and subdue unruly pupils. I will guarantee nobody will raise a kick that two parents will be governed strictly by the Juvenile law.\n\nLet me hear from you soon\n\nI remain Yours Truly\n\nWilliam Remie No.42.\nOTTAWA, July 14th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant regarding the teacher of the Gibson Indian Day School, and requesting that the services of another teacher be secured for the coming school year.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the services of the present teacher, Miss Black, are reported by the Public School Inspector to be satisfactory, and she has been engaged for another year. The Department understands that several of the children which she was unable to control are being placed in Industrial Schools, and it is hoped that there will be no further cause for complaint on the part of the Indians regarding the discipline in the school, and that Miss Black will make a success in the work during the next school year.\n\nIt is hoped that the Indian parents will see that their children of school age attend regularly, and that they give Miss Black every assistance they can in her efforts to carry on the work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This school will re-open on the last of November next, to be continued until the end of March next.\n\nMiss Mary Strength has been appointed teacher, at a salary of $35.00 per month, supplemented by the bonus allowed teachers of Indian day schools.\n\nThis school will be conducted in the same quarters as last winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Aast. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nAlex. Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI feel that a number of the children are not taking advantage of the educational opportunity afforded them.\n\nI have now twelve who attend pretty regular and they are the only...\nI have been able to give a start - to lay a good foundation well - there are others who are not getting the education and time is going and they will grow up illiterate like some of the young men around here now I know some of them live very far off never the less something ought to be done to urge the parents to do their utmost to educate their children and promote regularity of attendance.\nMrs. Logan suggested having a vehicle call for the children who live far off, bring them to school and take them home, and then have only one school. This is what should be done for the best interests of the pupils and Mrs. Logan's suggestion was the right one but it apparently cannot yet be carried out\u2014nobody is willing yet to take up the task.\nHowever, if the question of attendance were more fully investigated, matters adjusted properly, it might last for a few years and bring forth good results.\n\nThe Chief has not visited the school this term.\n\nMr. Dewar did not do the outside work. He handed over the books & stove polish for the new caretaker Mr. Laforce to put on and to do the work outside.\n\nMr. Laforce put on one lock.\nand that - on the outside -\nwood shed door - that is all\nthat is done outside in the\nway of repair -\nThe school needs banking\naround the foundation to\nkeep the floor warm\nfor winter.\n\nMr. Laforce resumed his\nduties (Oct 18th).\nIt is no wonder I closed\nschool a short time ago\nwhen no cleaning had\nbeen done all holidays\nand started in to teach\nin a dirty school. also\nseals window panes broken\nthe cold blowing in but\nthese are mended now\nMrs. Dewar gave the school\nA good scrubbing\u2014but\nthe walls were not\ncluttered down.\nThe caretaker should be\nprovided with a wall\ndust mop.\n\nI have been trying to\nget things improved\nand set on a good\nsolid basis so that\nthe educational problem\naround here may be\ngreatly improved.\n\nYours respectfully,\nMarie A. Black\nSahanatien P.O.,\nMuskoka, Nov. 3, 1921.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAnd another thing about the money that is spent on Sub-school is it the band's money. If it is, the people don't want it to have the school opened again. If it is, let me know soon as possible as the school will not open until you answer this letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nChief Peter Strength.\n\nThis school teachers salary as well as Mr. Gibson is from vote R.F.\nOttawa, November 9, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 3rd instant, referring to the payment of teacher's salary and expenses in connection with the sub-school that is to be held in your home on the Gibson reserve. In reply I beg to state that the salary to Miss Mary Strength, as well as the expenses of the main school on the Gibson reserve, are being paid from the Government Vote for School Purposes.\n\nI have noted that the people of your band do not want this sub-school open again if the expense is to fall upon the band fund. This is a very short-sighted policy and the Department is convinced that the Indians of the Gibson reserve are not very much interested in the education of their children. However, it has always been the intention to pay the expenses from our own sources.\n\nIf the attendance at the sub-school, as well as at the main school on the Gibson reserve, is not a cause for satisfaction, the Department will seriously consider withdrawing our offer of a sub-school in your home. We look to you to get this school open immediately and we would like you to instruct your daughter, Miss Mary Strength, to this effect. For further instructions refer to our letter of the 6th ultimo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nChief Peter Strength,\nSahaniatien P.O.,\nOnt.\nOttawa, November 9, 1921.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 3rd instant with reference to school matters on the Gibson reserve.\n\nThe Department has decided to open the sub-school at Chief Peter Strength's home in the immediate future. Miss Mary Strength has been appointed teacher at a salary of $55.00 per month. I have written to Chief Strength and advised him that, if the attendance does not keep up in both schools, some other arrangement will be made and the sub-school discontinued.\n\nIf, at any time, the Department can assist you in your work, by instructions to Mr. Logan, the Indian Superintendent at Parry Sound, or to Chief Strength, we will be glad for suggestions from you.\n\nRegarding any minor repairs and regular caretaker's duties, I am sure that, if you use a little tact with Mr. Laforce, who has resumed his duties according to your letter, matters will go along smoothly.\n\nI trust that your efforts to make this school of value will meet with success.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Mary Black,\nSahanatien P. O., Ont.\nSupplementary.\n\nBracebridge, March 18, 1922.\n\nIndian Dept.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nPerhaps you will pardon me for referring to a condition of affairs which I stumbled upon when I visited the Reserve on Tuesday of last week. I was wending my way along, intending to call on Miss Strength for a while before dinner. When I got as far as Miss Black's school, I called for a minute to tell her that she would likely have company that afternoon. It was then that I learned that Miss Strength was not teaching and that her school was closed.\n\nI drove on as far as Mrs. Commandant's, where I had dinner. I got some more particulars there about the trouble in the school. It seems that it was all over Miss Strength's own brother. He thought he could do as he liked since it was only his sister that was teaching. But she thought that he had as much right to obey her as the other pupils had, and whenever she undertook to chastise him, he simply made his way into the other part of the house, where he found ample protection at the hands of his mother. Miss Strength, seeing the folly of trying to control a school under these conditions, and having a certain amount of desirable spunk, closed the school, left home, and took up the duties of cook in a camp some distance away.\n\nI did not call upon the Strength's as Mr. Strength was not at home, Miss Strength was away, and Mrs. S. cannot speak English.\n\nAn early settlement of the difficulty is earnestly desired by the parents, and the Chief, it is thought, should take immediate action.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nH.R. Scovell, J.P.S.\n\nIndian Affairs.

As our agent is somewhat removed from the Gibson school, we have relied largely on Chief Peter Strength to keep us in touch with conditions.\n\nI have to inform you that, as this sub-school, held in the Chief's home on the Gibson reserve, was but an experiment, we are now officially closing the room for the time being.\n\nThe Department is grateful for your interest.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nH. R. Scovell, Esq.,\nPublic School Inspector,\nBracebridge, Ont.\nOttawa, March 28, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nThe Department is informed that the sub-school held in your home on the Gibson reserve is closed. I understand the reason for such action is that your daughter, the teacher, did not receive the proper support in the matter of disciplining a member of your family.\n\nI wish to refer to official communication of the 9th of November, of this file number, in which you were informed that this sub-school, presided over by your daughter, Miss Mary Strength, was more or less in the nature of an experiment. In view of the information that is now to hand, the Department is forced to close the school for the time being.\n\nMiss Mary Strength should prepare a report, showing the number of days for which the school was open, and forward the same to the Department, when payment can be made for her services. Your account for rent and caretaking, at the rate of $8.00 per month, should also be sent to this Department.\n\nThe Department expects you to store the desks and school equipment and look after the same until further instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nChief Peter Strength,\nSahanatien P.O.,\nOnt.\nOttawa, March 28, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the sub-school on the Gibson reserve has been closed. This action was necessary a few weeks earlier than was anticipated, because of lack of discipline in the school. Miss Mary Strength, the teacher, was, I believe, not altogether responsible for this trouble.\n\nThe Department has communicated with Chief Peter Strength, asking him to have a return prepared by his daughter, the teacher, showing the number of days taught, and an account in his own favour for rent for the room in which the classes were held.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nAlex. Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to notify you that the sub school on Gibson Reserve has been closed since end of February. The teacher Miss Strength, having left her home and has gone to live on another part of the reserve.\n\nThe attendance at the main school under Miss Black is improving, some sixteen in attendance. The day I was there, and they seem to be making good progress and if I can get them to attend regularly I think it would be better to encourage only one school. The truant officer, Chief Strength, is simply no good and I would like to make a change. The roads will soon be better and I think the attendance might be improved if we had a good live truant officer.\n\nI am Your Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6132, File 393-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPoor Copy\nOTTAWA, July 22nd, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to the case of Miss Frances Saunders, teacher of the Oka Country School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the dissatisfaction as to her services was expressed by the Indians only, but, in view of the fact that they have taken a rather decided stand in their request that another teacher be appointed, it is advisable, in the interest of the work, that another teacher be secured. The nomination of Miss Saunders for some other Indian school conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church will receive consideration.\n\nWe have no teacher in view for the Georgina Island Indian Day School. Miss Grace Martin, who taught this school last year, is taking charge of the New Credit school after the summer holidays. It will be necessary to secure the services of a teacher to replace her at Georgina Island, and I shall be pleased if you will nominate a teacher for this school. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department.\n\nRegarding the Gibson Indian Day School, I beg to say that insofar as we are aware Miss Black will again resume duties when the school re-opens after the holidays. We have had no intimation that she intends to resign.\n\nRegarding a teacher for the Chumong (Mud Lake) Indian Day School, I beg to say that the services of Miss Brown will be satisfactory, and the Department will approve of her re-engagement for another year.\n\nWe have not yet appointed a teacher for the Christian Island school. This matter has been left in the hands of the Band in Council, and we hope that they will very shortly succeed in obtaining the services of a qualified teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

They must have been intended for some other school and the wrong address put on the parcel. I received the invoice of mine but not the parcel. Enclose the invoice. Would you please send me a mop for dusting walls. You can.\nget them at Eaton's. It is made of cards and has a long handle. I want it not only for my own use on the walls at school and get the children to use it, but I can be used by the caretaker. This is a necessity.\n\nI also need another broom and a medium sized granite spud.\n\nI forgot to state in my previous letter that the blackboards need a new coat. They are hyloplated. I am sorry I did not get the work made ship for last fall when school was closed for repairs/cleaning. I intended to do post Easter but could not as so many were ill & such bad roads.\n\nI am aware of some mistakes of some of the reports, not intentional, but I wish to correct where fathers are white but mothers Indian.

Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMrs. Dinah Commandant,\nSahanatien P.O.,\nOmt.\nSir,\u2014 On my visit to Gibson Reserve I found, on making inquiries why there was so few children attending school. The reasons are as follows:\n\n1. There is a general complaint from all the members of the Band that the teacher Miss Black is not able to control the children of ten years and upward. The members of the Band claimed that there was no use of sending the children as they almost always did as they liked and worried Miss Black so much that she often cried at the way they carried on.\n\n2. Most of the parents admit that Miss Black is a good teacher but they claim that she lacks the power to enforce her authority.\n\nThe members of the council and the mothers with whom I have talked are of the belief that a younger teacher is required. I feel very keenly about the situation as Miss Black didn't seem to me to be any too well and she seems to me to be rather too nervous for the position which she holds. As a matter of very strict duty I must recommend that a change be made as otherwise the education of the majority of the children will be badly neglected. I have the honour to be, Sir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, Nov. 29, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that our agent at Parry Sound, who recently visited the Gibson Reserve, found that there were very few children attending school. On making inquiries, he found that the reasons therefor were as follows:\n\n1. There is a general complaint from all the members of the band that the teacher, Miss Black, is not able to control the children of 10 years and upward.\n\n2. The members of the band claimed that there was no use in sending their children as they did as they liked and worried the teacher so much that she often cried at the way they carried on.\n\n3. A number of the parents admitted to the agent that Miss Black is a good teacher, but they claimed that she lacked the power to enforce her authority. The members of the council requested that a younger teacher be engaged. The agent states that Miss Black seemed to be in poor health and too nervous for the position she holds. He recommends that a change be made, otherwise the education of the majority of the children will be badly neglected.\n\nAs this school is conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church, I am submitting the above for your consideration. We do not desire to be unfair to Miss Black, but reports as to her lack of control of the children have been received at intervals during the time she has been teaching at this school, and it is considered advisable, in view of the interests of the work, to dispense with her services if another teacher can be secured.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your views in the matter, also, if a change of teachers is made, whether a qualified successor to Miss Black can be obtained. Your early attention to this matter will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. G. S.

Miss Black was nominated for the position by the Church authorities and her appointment approved by the Department. We are referring this matter to Rev. C. E. Manning, S.A., D.D., General Secretary of Home Missions for the Methodist Missionary Society, Toronto, and pointing out to him the complaint made by the Indian parents and the request that another teacher be engaged.

E. Manning\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Sir:-\n\nSince receiving your letter of November 29th, re a successor to Miss Black, as teacher of the school on the Gibson Indian Reserve, I have been trying to secure the services of another teacher - preferably a Missionary Teacher - but up to the present have failed to get in touch with anyone whom I think would meet the requirements.\n\nIn a communication from the Rev. Arthur Barner, received this morning, he says that he would move slowly in dismissing a teacher in the middle of the year for the following reasons:\n\n1. These complaints from Indian Reserves die down and unless the evidence is conclusive that the change is wise we sometimes leave ourselves and the people worse off instead of better.\n\n2. It is difficult to get good teachers at this time of the year.\n\n3. The teacher there must live alone in the mission house. I would hesitate to send a girl without experience to that task in the winter. The summer is the time for testing out in these things.\"\n\nIn view of our inability to find a successor to Miss Black, who would take charge of the Gibson school at the beginning of the New Year, would it not be better to allow her to continue in her present position until next summer, when we will do our best to secure a Missionary Teacher to succeed her?\n\nAwaiting your reply, and wishing you the Compliments of the Season,\n\nI am,\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOTTAWA, December 29th, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant, requesting that the services of Miss Mary A. Black, teacher of the Gibson Indian Day School, be retained for the balance of the present school year, owing to the difficulty in securing a qualified teacher to succeed her.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the report received by you from the Reverend Arthur Barnet regarding the inadvisability of making a change of teachers at this school at the present time, the Department will approve of Miss Black remaining on as teacher until the 30th of June, next, the end of the present school year. We hope, however, before the next school year's activities commence, you will be able to nominate the services of a missionary teacher for this Reserve.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Agent Daly, Parry Sound, of the approval having been granted for the continuing of the services of Miss Black for the balance of the present school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in touch with a young man - 29 years of age - Frederick George Steeds by name, who has recently come to Canada. He was a Lieutenant in the British Army, and was transferred to the Indian Army. He was demobilized on May 23rd, 1921, and since then has been St. Luke's College, Exeter, England, training as a school teacher. He took his examinations in April 1925, but before they were over he developed the flu and his temperature rising to 103, he was not able to write on all the subjects set for the examination. Mathematics, I believe, was the only one upon which he did not write. A letter from the Educational authorities in England shows that he passed on all subjects but Mathematics.\n\nHe is willing to serve as Missionary Teacher on the Gibson Reserve. He is married, and has one child, and as there is a mission house on this Reserve it would be an advantage rather than otherwise that he is not a single man. He has the ministry in view and impresses me very favourably.\n\nThe Rev. Marshall Hartley, who is Secretary of the Methodist Brotherhood in England, writes of him as follows:\n\n\"He has teacher's certificates. He has had quite a remarkable career as a preacher while he has been in the army and has been the means of the conversion of officers and others. Clearly, as I gather from personal talk with him, his ultimate destiny is the ministry and in this I am sure you will gladly guide him. It is a long time since I have met a young man so obviously fitted for that work and willing to serve in any part of the world.\"\n\nIf you will agree to his appointment as Missionary Teacher on the Gibson Reserve, I will arrange with him to undertake the work there. Providing you concur in my proposal, what would his salary as teacher be?\n\nAwaiting your reply, I am,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nC. E. Manning.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 6th, 1923.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, nominating Frederick George Steeds as missionary teacher for the Gibson Indian Day School, and stating the qualifications which he possesses.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is considered that Mr. Steeds services would be satisfactory, and the Department will approve of his appointment. His retention in the position, however, will depend upon the success with which he meets in the work. The salary allowed will be at the rate of $700 per annum, payable on a monthly basis for the ten teaching months in the year. This will be supplemented by the bonus provided by law, which, during the present school year, is at the rate of $15 per month.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will inform the Department at a later date as to whether Mr. Steeds accepts the position or not.

Steeds, was absent from the school on May 21st and 22nd and also June 10th to 16th, inclusive. Apparently no permission was given by the Department to the teacher. You should advise him that, in future, he must not take special leave of this nature without securing the consent of the Department. All applications for such leave should be forwarded to the Department through your office.\n\nThe Department has also received Mr. Inspector Stother's report on this school. The inspector visited the school on June 12th, at which time the teacher was absent, and found the school door unlocked. The Department considers that the teacher is rather indifferent to the Department's property when he would leave the school in this condition.

Sir:\n\nThe Department has received complaints concerning the management by Mr. F. G. Steeds, the missionary teacher, of the Indian day school on the Gibson Reserve. He has conducted classes during the past year very irregularly. It would appear that during the month of May, last, the school was in operation only 8 days, and 5 days in June. The Public School Inspector visited this school on the 12th ultimo, at which time the teacher was absent, leaving the school unlocked. It is considered that Mr. Steeds has been rather indifferent to the Department's interest in his conduct of the school. The Indians have requested that a qualified teacher who will be relieved of the duties of missionary be engaged.\n\nI am forwarding the above for your consideration, and shall be pleased to hear whether you would approve of a change in teacher being made for the next school year or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. C. E.

Steeds has agreed to remain as Missionary Teacher on the Gibson Reserve for the ensuing year.\n\nFrom all reports I gather that he is a very successful teacher, and is rendering excellent service on this reserve. I trust that it will be in accord with your pleasure to confirm his appointment for another year.\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nC. E. Manning\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nJuly 9th,\nNineteen-twenty-four.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter, File No.22-1-1, bearing date of June 7th, 1924. This letter was not received at the Mission Rooms until this morning, July 9th. The date of this letter must surely be a typographical error.\n\nYou write about F. G. Steeds, the Missionary Teacher on the Gibson Reserve. I am surprised to have the information that you give me to the effect that during the month of May the school was in operation only eight days, and only five days in the month of June.\n\nIt is not long since the Indian Agent called me by phone when in the city, to urge that something be done to retain Mr. Steeds' services on this Reserve for another year. The Indians appointed a representative to come to Toronto to see me, to make sure that he would not be removed. Now, to have the statement from you that the Indians have requested that a qualified teacher - who will be relieved of the duties of a missionary - be engaged, is a surprise to me.\n\nIs it not possible that Mr. Steeds' efforts to establish better moral conditions on the Reserve have something to do with this agitation against him? According to his report he has taken drastic measures with some of the Indians there! I have written him to ascertain why the school was in operation only eight days in May and five days in June.\n\nI am leaving for my holidays on Monday next, and do not expect to be in the Mission Rooms until about the middle of August, and if you have any further report to send me in regard to Steeds' relation to the Gibson Indians, I would like to have it, if possible, by return mail.\n\nI am,\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nC. E. Manning\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

G. Steeds, the missionary teacher on the Gibson Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that our letter was based on complaints from Indians concerning the management of the school by Mr. Steeds and also from the report of the Public School Inspector. No doubt Mr. Steeds had sufficient reason for his absence at the time the Inspector visited the school and on other occasions, but it is considered that he should have notified the Indian Agent or the Department of such absence from duty as teacher. The Department has no desire to make a change in teacher at this school. Our object in writing you on the 7th instant was to inform you of the reports received regarding Mr. Steeds' work. We will approve of his remaining for the next school year. No doubt, as stated by you, Mr. Steeds' efforts to establish better moral conditions on the Reserve have something to do with the agitation against him by some of the Indians.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will inform Mr. Steeds of the Department's approval of his re-engagement for the next school year. We note from your letter of the 7th instant that he has agreed to remain as missionary teacher for next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

He has not yet had time to reply to my letter of recent date, enquiring why it was the school had been closed for so many days during May and June, and as I am going away for my holidays on Monday, I will send him a letter today, telling him that you approve of his appointment.\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nC.

Steeds, the teacher at Gibbon Reserve, and he said that he failed to understand Inspector Stothert's report. The door was locked when he left, to go to the conference. He understands that he asked for leave of absence when next called to a conference and will arrange with this office so that the Dept. will have time to grant any request in this nature, re being absent other than attending the conference.\n\nHe was two half days, one in afternoon, going to Bala for the doctor, for two different cases of sickness, the reason being that he has a car and could get there quickly to bring the doctor. I approve of him doing this and trust that the Dept. will agree. As of the same, as Mr. Steeds, being missionary as well as teacher, would be expected to do actions such as this when the children get sick. The progress of the children in this reserve under Mr. Steeds, is very remarkable, and his understanding of the human frailties of the band and their little jealous feelings, is remarkable for a man who is not long in this country.\n\nI shall be very sorry, as Agent, when the time comes when we can't keep Mr. Steeds. I am so interested in the schooling of the children and I see a great change in them, which I am sure the Dept. appreciates, when told of same. I have told Mr. Steeds of his appointment for next term.\n\nThe catch on the door is broken and I have given instructions to the caretaker to have it fixed.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nJ.B.

He called to see me today and has made a very fine impression. He is tall, very intelligent looking and in his twentieth year. He has completed his normal training and if you consent to his appointment he will be in charge of the above school his father, who for reasons of health retired from the Ministry of the United Church this year, would undertake to serve as missionary on this reserve occupying the parsonage where his son would find a home while he acts as teacher at Gibson. Young Hoffman has a second-class certificate and as intimated above has just completed his normal training in Toronto.

Arthur Barner,\n299 Queen St., West,\nToronto 2, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just received your letter of November 1st re Inspector Johnson's report of the Day School here. It comes as a surprise somewhat to me as on this particular visit he remained only a short time with us. He inspected some reading classes and said there was an improvement in the children's reading. I might just say that the children are a little nervous of Mr. Johnson, and read in a lower tone than usual. Indian children, in my twelve years experience in Indian teaching, do not speak so freely or clearly as white children. They have their Indian language before they start school and this makes it more difficult to learn the English, and causes their articulation to be rather broken. The attendance here is rather irregular.\n\nIn reference to appearing apathetic about the work, I might simply state, that like my father, a university man and teacher, I have always enjoyed teaching school and have been interested in the profession. However I may appear, I have always had fair results in my work. In the fifty years of school work here at Gibson I have been the first teacher to put through an entrance scholar. In the three or four years here I have put through two scholars. I voluntarily offered to teach them the first two years of high school work to fit them for training for nurses. They came and did very good work. I have an entrance class this year. I also started a fair in connection with the school. We receive Eaton's school prizes with silver cup as well as other special prizes. The fair work includes writing, drawing, painting, agriculture, sewing and composition. Our work has been taken to the County Union Fair and we have carried off some First and other prizes there. Also some families have asked that I remain on here until their children get educated. I do not see how in these above examples of my work in the school that I have been apathetic in my dealings with the pupils. I do not say Mr. Johnson is aware of what I have just been stating. The Indian work is peculiar in itself and one has to adjust oneself to them to get the best results. This I am attempting to do to the best of my knowledge. With the above evidence I think I am obtaining fair reward for my efforts with ten years experience in white schools. I find\nit more difficult in Indian work though I think much of the work here measures up fairly with the average white schools.\n\nAs an ordained minister and normalite I feel that my work is part of my religion and I will ever endeavour to obtain the highest reward in the work of my school. I have faithfully carried out any suggestions which Mr. Johnson has made in the school work in his inspections.\n\nI trust that with this rather lengthy Epistle I have given you a truthful statement of the work being carried on here at Gibson Day School and that you are in a position to understand more fully how the work is going on here.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(sgd.)

Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDecember 11th,\n1933.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nRe: Inspector's Report on Gibson Indian Day School.\n\nWe appreciate your courtesy in sharing with us reports which come to you from time to time concerning teachers who are nominated by the United Church to serve on Indian Reserves.\n\nMr. Barner and I were both quite surprised at the type of report made in regard to Mr. Ward, as he is a man whom we have learned to trust because of close association extending over a period of years. We asked him for a confidential report on the situation and I am enclosing for your personal information a copy of his letter.\n\nWe have been discussing for over a year now the possibility of moving Mr. Ward to another school. We think he has been long enough at Gibson. Last summer we tried a couple of different moves, but failed in both instances because of opposition in the local Presbytery or Conference. We wish to assure you, however, that we have the matter in mind and at the earliest possible date hope to place Mr. and Mrs. Ward in fresh surroundings, in the confident expectation that this will help them to take a new interest in their very important task as missionary-teachers.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MT\nParry Sound, Ont.,\nApril 24, 1934,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir;\n\nI would appreciate if the Department would let me know if there are any forms that I can give to the teachers to send in if they wish to stay in their position as teachers for another term.\n\nThe reason for me asking this is that the teachers that are in my Agency have the idea that it is a life job. If there is any form such as I ask for they would know that they are only in the schools from term to term, and if there is such a form it would be a nice way of having the teachers know that they are engaged from term to term. In the meantime the majority of them think that they are here as long as they wish to stay.\n\nIf you have any such forms as this I would appreciate it very much if some could be sent forward.\n\nThe very serious consideration of the Department in this matter will be very much appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJMD/EK.\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, April 28, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th instant, I beg to say that the Department does not supply any forms of the kind mentioned in your letter.

She has a certificate from Dr. Sangster of Stouffville, Ontario, stating that she is in good health and has never had any serious sickness.\n\nAs, according to the method of transferring ministers in the United Church, these changes should take place on July 1st, I would appreciate an early reply in regard to this nomination.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J.

We are new in work among Indians, being absolute greenhorns on our arrival here July 1934. We have worked away there however and have become very much interested in the work and in the Indians. We feel however that we need to know more about them than we do, in order to be of the most service in our work.\n\nWe understand that all Indians or tribes rather, have agreements or treaties with the government. We have no idea what the treaty with these Indians is, or how their affairs are to be managed.\nIf it is available to us, we would very much like to have all the information about these Indians that is obtainable, that we may more perfectly understand their and their relation to Canada's government and institutions, etc.\n\nWe find that the people spend way too much time arguing over things no one knows for sure about, and it seems to us that there must be information somewhere (surely with the Dept.) that would help clear up many matters at present not cleared up and never will be unless they know more about their own business. It seems just that they should know what are their rights and what aren't their rights; and that we all really should know how their affairs should be managed.\n\nThank you very much in advance for any help you can give us.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nChester Sommer.\nMay 5, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo and am enclosing herewith for your information copy of the Indian Act and the last Annual Report of this department.

Following are comments made by Mr. and Mrs. Sommer:\n\nArrangements were made through the Missionary Organization of the United Church that Mr. and Mrs. Sommer would both help one another in the school work. Mrs. Sommer being the appointed teacher takes all responsibility for the conduct of the school, as she is a qualified teacher, first class. This arrangement has been in force ever since Mr. and Mrs. Sommer went to Gibson Reserve in 1934.\n\nIn June 1936 when Mr. Johnson was on a visit of inspection Mrs. Sommer asked his opinion as to the advisability of sending the pupils to try the entrance examination, and Mr. Johnson advised that they should try.\n\nTrusting this is the information required,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJMD/EK.\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, October 24, 1936.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nIn your letter of June 23, 1934, you nominated Mrs. C. O. Sommer as teacher of the Gibson Indian Day School and her appointment was approved by official letter of July 5, 1934.\n\nA recent report from the Public School Inspector regarding this school reads as follows:\n\n\"While Mrs. Sommer is the teacher of the school, she finds it impossible to give full time to that work, and the work is divided with her husband. This year, Mr. Sommer takes the morning classes and Mrs. Sommer teaches in the afternoon.\"\n\nWhile Mrs. Sommer is a qualified teacher, the Department is not aware of Mr. Sommer's qualifications. It is doubtful if the present arrangement is in the best interests of the pupils. Please let me know if, when Mrs. Sommer was appointed, you arranged that she should only teach part of the day.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. K. J. Beaton, B.A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Gibson Indian Day School\n\nI have your letter with regard to the situation at the day school on the Gibson Reserve, and note what the Inspector says concerning the way in which the work in the schoolroom is divided. I would like to know whether or not he followed that remark with any criticism of the teaching ability and methods of Mr. Sommer.\n\nI may say that there was an understanding with Mr. and Mrs. Sommer when they were appointed that, on occasion, Mr. Sommer might relieve his wife in the class-room. He has special qualifications for teaching some of the subjects, but it never was intended that he should take over one-half of the teaching time. As a matter of fact, if he is really giving the leadership to the community which it needs, he cannot afford that much time to spend in the class-room. I am writing to them today, telling them of your communication, so that they may be aware that the present arrangement which they have taken it upon themselves to make is being questioned by the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB.MLT\nOttawa, November 3rd, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, the only comment of the Public School Inspector regarding Mr. Sommer teaching the Gibson Indian Day School for half a day was contained in our letter of the 24th ultimo.\n\nIt is noted from your letter that it was understood that Mr. Sommer would teach certain subjects for which he is specially qualified. The Department considers, however, that the present arrangement is not in the best interests of the pupils. I would appreciate hearing from you when Mr. Sommer replies to your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B.A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nGibson Reserve,\nEala, Ontario\nNovember 2, 1956.\n\nRev. Kenneth Beaton,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Beaton:\n\nAs the Indian Department's complaint concerns me, I feel I should write a few lines in answer too.\n\nQuoting the Indian Agent (Mr. Daly) about this, he remarked, \"I guess Mr. Johnson (Inspector) had a chip on his shoulder the day he called\". At any rate I am deeply grieved over his untimely report from here.\n\nHe came the last of September. I showed him the new time table for the school asking for help if it seemed unbalanced. He said it was all right. I had changed some of the afternoon subjects to the 11 a.m. to 12 a.m. period in the morning, subjects in which Mr. Sommer gives special help such as music, singing, public speaking, reading, etc. (In this he is unusually capable and very successful.) I explained the change, that after this, when Mr. Sommer did help it would be in the morning instead of in the afternoon as previously.\n\nWhen Mr. Johnson called it was the second morning of Mr. Sommer's help at school since school started in September, although last year he helped me more often in the afternoon periods.\n\nSince coming here we have succeeded in getting four to study for the \"Entrance\". Only one in the Reserve has succeeded in the school's history. We were quite pleased to think we had persuaded four to even try. Last June Mr. Johnson came and I asked regarding the pupils writing the Government exams. I told him I was rather worried over three of them trying white people's standard exams in a strange school (Eala) etc., and that three did not know their work thoroughly. He said, \"Send them anyway to give them an idea of what it is like whether they pass or not\". I sent them. They all failed. Mr. Johnson, in turn, wrote to Ottawa, (we were shown an extract from his report) \"Four pupils wrote. All failed. Fault partly due to children and partly to insufficient knowledge of the Ontario examination requirements.\" \u2014 Why wouldn't Ottawa wonder how we were running the school by such a remark? I thought it quite unfair on his part.\n\nMr. Daly told us that they were expecting trouble as Ontario is trying to get the \"say\" of Indian Ontario schools. So far it has failed. Such things as these in Mr. Johnson's mind would spur him on, I presume, to send in an absolutely ambiguous report.\n\nWe are running a heavy schedule of school work, manual training, sewing, knitting, public speaking, special singing, soft ball and soccer games for the school age children. I found the schedule to stand up under physically without help. We are conscientiously doing our best for the school (not omitting the community) which makes the complaint harder to\nbear without hurt. I feel very badly in having a complaint come in to your office over my seeming neglect of work, where, on the other hand, I am trying to do my very best to be an all-round help to the Reserve.\n\nMay I be allowed to suggest that you phone Mr. and Mrs. Douglas, 1529 Bathurst St., Apartment 127? We hired them as supply this summer and they must have gained some idea of our work from the children, while here.\n\nAgain I say I am very sorry over the trouble and misunderstanding due to the untimely report. Mr. Johnson has been and is always encouraging and quite enthusiastic over being answered by the children (he says) for the first time in his several years inspecting.\n\nWe would very much like it if you could at some time visit Gibson Reserve and/or sorry your heavy program is too rushed to allow you to do this.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(signed) (Mrs.) C. O. Sommer.\nBala, Ontario,\nNovember 2nd, 1936.\n\nRev. Kenneth Beaton,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Beaton:\n\nAs Mrs. Sommer is writing you in some detail about the school work, I shall devote my attention to your request for information regarding my teaching qualifications. The usual first question that is asked is \"Have you an Ontario Teacher's license?\", and my answer is \"No\". I have only those qualifications which my particular training and study in religious education, and my experience in teaching Sunday School classes at Summer Camps and Teacher Training classes has given me, along with what intelligence and soul I possess.\n\nMy best answer is \"by their fruits ye shall know them\", but you have to know the fruits to know the qualifications. We know that the school has gone steadily ahead. It is much nearer the standard it should be than upon our arrival. Subjects are being taught, which before our coming the children were not expected to be able to learn. There is a higher percentage of attendance. The school children openly profess to like attending school now, whereas they used to dislike it. There have been only two children in the history of the Reserve (we are told) who ever tried their Entrance examinations before our coming. We have encouraged four to write and I think that is a good sign. Mr. Johnson, also Mr. Tipper (the one who conducts the school fairs here) have commented on signs of advance and qualities of personality, not known and marked by a board of strange examiners.\n\nMr. Johnson knows all the above, and I am surprised that he should send in an adverse report of the school here, considering all the advance which he knows has been made. The only explanation I can offer is that he may have a personal grudge against us because we let him know we were not satisfied with some of the marks given some of our entrance class, and he is responsible for that.\n\nMrs. Sommer and myself carry on extra classes with the boys and girls in woodwork and sewing respectively. These are entirely voluntary on our part and they take up a good deal of our time and mental and spiritual energy. We do not begrudge the time, but we would at least not be unfairly criticized for our work. In the subjects which I have been teaching in the school, Mr. Johnson has acknowledged that the quality has been steadily improving ever since we came. In general, may I conclude and summarize that we are convinced that the school, not to mention the whole Reserve, is getting better service under the arrangement we have been carrying out than if the minister had to teach and be responsible for all the work up here.\nAnother factor motivating Mr. Johnson's conduct might very readily be that he imagines that besides what is allowed for teaching, I may be getting an extra thousand dollars or so as missionary. If so, I can understand this galling him when many of his teachers receive only $500.00 and upwards.\n\nMay I say in winding up this subject that I am very sorry there should be a troubling of the waters unnecessarily \u2014 at the Department, your office or here. I trust that they will be quieted down again satisfactorily, and to the best interests of the common good.\n\nMrs. Sommer and myself join in thanking all who were instrumental in our having a very enjoyable and profitable summer. Best regards to you personally and success and happiness in your new work.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(signed) Chester Owen Sommer.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nNovember 6th,\n1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Gibson Indian Day School\n\nI am sending you copies of replies received from both Mr. and Mrs. Sommer, of the Gibson Reserve, Bela, Ontario, concerning the Inspector's report. I am sure you will agree that they have made out a very good case. What they say is in harmony with the reports that have reached us from our Superintendent of Missions in that area and our Convenor in the Muskoka Presbytery, where the school is located.\n\nI am satisfied that there is no comparison between the work which is being done on the Reserve and in the school now and that which was being carried on for a good number of years by the missionary-teacher who preceded these people.\n\nIf you have any further comments to make, we shall be very glad to receive them.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MLT\nEnc.\nOttawa, November 9th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAt the time of his inspection of the Gibson Indian Day School on September 29th, last, Inspector Johnson reported that Mr. Sommer takes the morning classes and Mrs. Sommer teaches in the afternoon. As we had no intimation that this arrangement was in effect, a letter was directed to the Associate Secretary of the Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, under whose auspices this school is conducted and on whose recommendation Mrs. Sommer was appointed teacher. The arrangement mentioned by the Inspector has now been fully explained but, in writing, the teacher, Mrs. Sommer, states in part:\n\n\"Mr. Daly told us that they were expecting trouble as Ontario is trying to get the \"say\" of Indian Ontario schools. So far it has failed. Such things as these in Mr. Johnson's mind would spur him on, I presume, to send in an absolutely ambiguous report.\"\n\nThe Department would appreciate knowing from what source you obtained the above information.

There are a lot of things I do not understand about the Sommers. They were so fussed up when I spoke to them about the matter that I tried to quiet them down and I may have said that Mr. Johnson might be under the impression that they were running the Indian Schools. I explained to them that his Department was paid for his services as inspector, and that the recommendations of the inspectors were as a rule accepted, but not all the time. I cannot understand why Mrs. Sommer would make a statement like that. She has misconstrued everything that I said, and what I did say was to the effect that the inspector made his recommendations and it was up to the Department to say whether the recommendation would be carried out or not.\n\nTrusting this is the information that the Department requires.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nJMD/EK.\nGillieson Reserve,\nBala, Ontario.\nMay 21st, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Daly,\n\nWe have just received word from Toronto that the Conference of the church starts June 9th - No May 14th.

Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.,\n\nSir;\n\nI respectfully offer the following suggestions, which I think would be of benefit to the running of schools in this Agency,-\n\nI would suggest that before any teacher is employed for this Agency that she be asked to fill out a form stating her qualifications and notified that her appointment is for the teaching year (10 months) and that if she wishes to continue, and her services are satisfactory, she has to apply for the position from year to year.\n\nI have found in the last 15 years here that the teachers applying for positions in this Agency, have the idea that it is a life job and there are two cases in point where the teachers have shown their utter disregard of this office, one was at Lower French School when Mrs. Munson was there, and the other is at the Magnetawan Indian Day School at Byng inlet where Miss O'Meara is.\n\nIf this is done it would be a good thing for the teachers, a good thing for the Department, and a good thing for the Agency, and everyone would know just exactly where they stood.\n\nThe consideration of the Department to these remarks will be very much appreciated in this Agency.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJMD/EK.\n\nIndian Affairs.

A. Gibson, who has been teacher in the Georgina Island School. On May 17th you accepted our nomination.\n\nAs things have worked out we have been able to get an ordained minister, Rev. J. W. Johnston, to accept nomination to the school on this Reserve. Mr. Johnston is a graduate of the Ontario Normal Schools, and taught first of all at Uxbridge, then on the occasional staff of the Toronto Public Schools, until finally he had a permanent position in the Kimberley Ave. Public School in this city. Since then he has been a minister of our Church. He is a fine type of man, fully qualified, and we believe that both he and his wife would do good work on the Gibson Reserve. Will the Department be good enough to accept Mr. Johnston for this school in place of Mr. Gibson?\n\nRe: Christian Island School\n\nWe would like to nominate Mr. R. A. Gibson for the Christian Island School for the academic year, beginning September last, 1938. His qualifications are well known to the Department.\n\nWould it be too much to ask that, on receipt of this letter, or as soon as you have been able to come to a decision in regard to these two nominations, you wire me, so that I can report to the Settlement Committee of the Toronto Conference that everything is in order?\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nRBC.MLT\n\nIndian Affairs.

W. Anderson as successor to Mr. Stanley Campbell as teacher for the next academic year on the Gibson Reserve. Mr. Anderson has a first-class teacher's certificate. It has not been made permanent, because, after teaching for a year and a half, he went into business in Toronto and has occupied quite an important position in one of the large firms here for several years.\n\nMr. Anderson has become particularly interested in the Indians, has visited several Reserves, and is anxious to do educational and religious work among the native people. He is a young man of fine appearance, good character and ability. I feel sure he will satisfy both the Government and the Church as missionary teacher on this Reserve.\n\nI may say that Mr. Anderson expects before long to marry a young lady who is a graduate of the Bible College here, as well as a R.N. She is at present, I understand, doing some work in an inter-denominational mission on the Six Nations Reserve, south of Brantford.\n\nI shall be glad to have your approval of this recommendation as soon as possible, as we desire Mr. Anderson to go to Gibson and take over the church work in the middle of August.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Would it be possible, in view of the shortage of teachers, for the Department to do anything in this case to obtain exemption for Mr. Anderson?\"\n\nI regret that this Branch is not in a position to take the action suggested by the Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I had no idea that anyone would ask you to try to secure exemption for Mr. Anderson. In any case, we are not asking for it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\nParry Sound, Ontario,\nDecember 10, 1942.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI wish to advise that Mr. B. W. Anderson, teacher of the Gibson Indian Day School was absent from his duties for four days, November 3 to November 6, inclusive. Mr. Anderson went to Toronto expecting to be back the following day but was unavoidably delayed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nRoad conditions on the Gibson Reserve are expected to be very bad at some period of this month, when the spring break up occurs, and Mr. Anderson, the school teacher, has suggested that school be closed for one week when conditions are at their worst, which I think would be either the third or fourth week of this month. This week could later be made up by cancelling five days of the Easter holidays. I would be glad to have your authority to make this change in the school schedule.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 5, 1943.\n\nMr. S. Devlin, Indian Agent, Parry Sound, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to road conditions on the Gibson Reserve during the spring break up. In view of the information contained in your letter, it has been decided to allow you to close the Gibson School for one week, on the understanding that the school will remain open during Easter week.\n\nAs a general rule the Department wishes the schools to be operated on the regular schedule and consequently the permission granted in this letter is given owing to exceptional circumstances existing this year and is not to be taken as a precedent for future years.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nParry Sound, Ont.,\nMarch 2, 1943.\n\nREPORT FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY, 1943.\n\nFebruary has been marked by an epidemic of 'Flu or Grippe all over the country and the Indians have not escaped, but as usual, have had rather more than their share. School attendance has been very poor and in some cases schools had to be closed owing to illness of both teacher and pupils. I have been glad to learn that we are to have a teacher for the Ryerson School on the Parry Island Reserve, which is now scheduled to reopen on March 4. This school has been closed since last June and a good many of the youngster have been running wild, although many who live near enough to the Village of Depot Harbour have been attending the white school there. This school suspension will perhaps help the parents to realize the benefits offered by the Department's schools and induce them to more urgently take advantage of such benefits.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\n22-1-1 669 Inglewood Drive\nToronto Ontario\nJune 1st, 1843.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am applying for a job as a school teacher at Gibbon Indian Reserve, Muskoka (Ontario).

Dubin of Parry Sound, Ont. to forward this letter to you.\n\nThis spring we very nearly lost two small Indian children, with sickness, because of no means of transportation or communication to a doctor or hospital. (We live ten miles from the nearest telephone, that is one accessible by day, and twenty-two miles to our nearest doctor at Gravenhurst.) As I purchased a car and it has been used exclusively for the welfare and my work on the reserve.\n\nI have paid out of my own pockets over sixty dollars in gasoline and oil alone for doctor trips, not counting two or three trips to Parry Sound hospital which is fifty-two miles from here for an urgent after-booking operation. However, that said, it is quite all right, but this summer my tires went, and I purchased two new ones and paid for them, only weeks later the other tires went, and I purchased two new ones. At these two times and not yet paid for, so I have had additional...\nUnited Church Mission\nGIBSON INDIAN RESERVE, MUSKOKA\n\nSAHANATIEN, P.O. ONTARIO\n\nOur expenses, and I was wandering in view of our position here and isolation away from doctors hospital etc., if the department could or would be kind enough to pay for these last two tires and one tube. The bill for same is forty-five dollars and sixty-five cents.\n\n$45.65\n\nI trust you will understand the situation and will let me know as soon as possible your reaction to this proposal.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJ. O. Harris\nMissionary Teacher\nGibson Reserve\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI am enclosing herewith letter received from Mr. J. O. Harris, missionary teacher on the Gibson Reserve. With regard to Mr. Harris' request for the purchase of tires for his car, I am quite sure that the regulations would prohibit this. However, it is a fact that he uses his car to some considerable extent, as he has indicated, for the transport of sick Indians, but not as he himself says exclusively for that purpose. I would say that Mr. Harris uses his car about 90 per cent for his own purposes.\n\nI think possibly that the best way to handle the situation would be to pay him on a mileage basis for any trips which he may be compelled to make in bringing Indians either to the doctor or to the nearest hospital for medical attention. He has just recently been paid for one such trip and a few days ago he took two Indian children to Gravenhurst for tonsillectomies for which I am today sending forward a voucher for payment to him at the rate of .07\u00a2 per mile. I would be glad if you would advise me if this meets with your approval and also if the rate of .07\u00a2 per mile would be the correct figure.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nThe Department would be willing to pay Mr. J. O. Harris 10\u00a2 a mile when it is necessary for him to use his car in connection with medical services to Indians on the Gibson reserve. I think if he explained to the local ration board his missionary work and his assistance to us in the medical service that they would give favourable consideration for new tires. It would be in order for you to corroborate his statements regarding the work he does for us. You may inform him that we will be unable to pay for his tires but he could submit accounts at 10\u00a2 a mile for necessary trips he has made during the past summer and then submit accounts for future trips.\n\nP.

Harris teaching at the Gibson Indian Day School. His address is Sahanatien P.O., Ontario.\n\nI enclose the stamped, self-addressed envelope which you forwarded.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. B. Beldon,\nWestern Division,\nFinancial Agencies Limited,\n801 Great West Permanent Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI regret very much to be obliged to make an adverse report on Mr. J. O. Harris, Missionary teacher on the Gibson Reserve. On a recent visit to the Reserve, shortly after the reopening of the school following the Easter holidays, I found Mrs. Harris in charge of the school. I inquired for her husband and she advised me that he was in Toronto taking two weeks leave. Mr. Harris had not mentioned the matter of leave or made any application to me in this respect.\n\nI am bound to say that Mr. Harris had made an excellent school teacher but that otherwise he appears to be very erratic and has had no success at all in dealing with the adult Indians on the Reserve. He has kept me in constant hot water settling his disputes with the Indians and in many ways his conduct has been open to question. Questions have been raised as to his handling of church funds, a matter which I have not delved into, as I consider it the business of the church authorities and, while I would hesitate to say that there has been anything wrong along these lines, there appears to be no doubt but that his handling of various sums of money entrusted to him has been, to say the least, extremely careless and questionable in a man of his position. I have had various complaints also from local merchants about the difficulty of collecting his personal accounts.\n\nWhen Mr. Harris returns, I will interview him and advise you further as to what excuses he may have to offer of being absent without leave.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nI will begin with what I consider the most important part of our work for the Indian - the educational programme. The greater part of our work will be finished when we have taught the Indian to live as we do and to think as we think. While this process of education cannot be completed by the ordinary school curriculum, none the less the schools must supply the groundwork. I find that the average Indian professes a lip service to the principles of education for his children, but in actual fact opposes it by what at the best might be termed apathetic indifference.\n\nAs an instance I might cite the case of the day school on the Parry Island Reserve which I was obliged to close for two months during the winter for lack of fuel. There are probably 12000 acres of this Reserve covered thickly with good fuel-wood, but I had to use all my powers of persuasion to get enough of it cut and hauled in to ensure continued operation of the school. Poor attendance is another bug bear with which we have to contend. It is interesting to note that the schools which have the best teachers and who are the strictest disciplinarians have the best record of attendance. It is my opinion that in the education of Indian children we should have the best brains of the teaching profession and that any extra expenditures to secure this would be repaid a thousand-fold. Our present rates of salaries paid to teachers of Indian schools, coupled with all the social and other disadvantages of life on an Indian Reserve leave us, when we come to engage teachers, with the dullest of the profession when we should actually choose from the flower.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nFurther to my recent report on the missionary situation at the Gibson Reserve, I have to report that Mr. Harris was absent from his duties for one week. Apparently his wife had been having an affair with a young Indian boy of the Reserve and Mr. Harris has taken her to Toronto for psychiatric examination and treatment.\n\nThe whole affair has left us with a decided loss of prestige amongst the Indians and I consider that his influence as a missionary and teacher is definitely ruined, at least at that point. Mr. Harris was continually involved in quarrels with the Indians there and as I have mentioned before, there were questions raised as to his handling of church funds and he was also continually taking on financial obligations which he found it difficult to discharge and I have on several occasions been asked to bring pressure to bear on him to pay his debts.\n\nHe has mentioned to me a desire to be transferred to the Parry Island Reserve but I do not feel that I would care to have him continue in this Agency.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 4, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have had several letters recently from the Indian Agent at Parry Sound, with reference to Mr. J. O. Harris, missionary teacher on the Gibson Reserve. These reports indicate that it will be in the best interests of the work to dispense with the services of Mr. Harris at the end of the current academic year. I have discussed this matter with Mr. Hoey and he has suggested that I write to you. I trust that you will be able to nominate a qualified teacher for this school for the academic year 1945-46.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division\n\nRev.

I do not want to leave Gibson, but then again, I can hardly see why. I am very fond of the Indians as I have been living amongst them since I was quite young, and it has always been my desire to teach them. Dr. Borg of the United Church Mission informed me that he was speaking to you in June, but at that time there were no vacancies in any of the schools, however I thought if you then might be some changes made, and I would be available.\n\nI am hoping my children will be.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Matteson, missionary teacher on the Gibson Reserve is, as you probably know, a native of the United States and came here from Michigan. On her arrival early in September she was given a temporary entry record at Windsor which is valid until December 31, 1945. Mrs. Matteson requests that you take this matter up with the immigration branch and endeavour to have issued for her whatever entry record may be necessary to enable her to continue her work on the Gibson Reserve. The temporary entry record is enclosed herewith.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 6, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI am in receipt of the following letter from Mr. S.

Mrs. Matteson requests that you take this matter up with the Immigration Branch and endeavour to have issued for her whatever entry record may be necessary to enable her to continue her work on the Gibson Reserve. The temporary entry record is enclosed herewith.\"\n\nI doubt very much, if we made application for an extension, that it would be granted. I feel that you will have a better opportunity of obtaining the permission. I enclose the temporary entry record which Mr. Dewlin sent with his letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n290 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2B, Ont.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI received a wire on Saturday last from Mrs. Clyde W. Matteson, missionary teacher on the Gibson Reserve, resigning her position there effective December 17. I have since then seen Mrs. Matteson and advised her that it would also be necessary for her to forward her resignation to the Home Mission Board which she has already done.\n\nMrs. Matteson has not been very successful in her position on the Gibson Reserve and has become decidedly unpopular there. She is not at all the type for this sort of work but we had been so unfortunate with our teachers there recently that I had decided to give her some time to settle down and get acquainted in the hope that matters would improve. I was, however, very glad to get her voluntary resignation as things were going from bad to worse.\n\nMrs. Matteson complains very bitterly that her work was interfered with by Mr. J. O. Harris the last missionary we had at that point and who is now, I believe, employed in a similar position on the Saugan Reserve. I believe that Mrs. Matteson has some grounds for her complaint as it would appear that Mr. Harris has made several visits to the Gibson Reserve recently. His wife, from whom he is estranged, has also been a recent visit or to the Reserve and I have been told that they have both said to various people there that Mrs. Matteson would soon be out and that either one or the other of them will be back to the Gibson Reserve to stay. This, of course, is only hearsay but I intend to write to Mr. Harris and advise him that he should stay away from this Reserve altogether as his visits there cause me a lot of trouble. I would also write to Mrs. Harris but I have not her present address.\n\nWith regard to Mrs. Matteson, I might say that Dr. Johnstone had been called in to treat her for a cold and his report to me was that the Mission House was very dirty and that Mrs. Matteson's person and clothing were also in a filthy condition. The Mission Board seem to have been very unfortunate in their choice of missionary teachers for this point.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nMrs. Clyde W. Matteson, missionary teacher on the Gibson Indian Reserve, whose resignation I submitted to you a few days ago, requests that she be permitted to give up her position there on December 1. Mrs. Matteson reports that in the last week, school attendance has fallen off so badly that she believes there is no object in her continuing to make the necessary effort to keep the school going. She complains also of illness.\n\nMrs. Matteson has succeeded in antagonizing both pupils and parents to the extent that I believe she has no further usefulness in this position and I would be glad to see her released as soon as possible and replaced by any reasonable substitute.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 26, 1945.\n\nMr. Samuel Devlin, Indian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, with reference to the resignation of Mrs. C. W. Matteson. I have also reviewed your letter of November 21, which arrived during my absence from the office on business.\n\nDr. Dorey called at the office today and I informed him of the contents of your letters. He had also heard from Mrs. Matteson and he had expressed the hope to her that she would remain at the school until December 21, the closing date before Christmas.\n\nWhile you recommend that she be released on December 1, I am inclined to feel, after discussing the matter with Dr. Dorey, that she should remain until the date mentioned above. It is going to be very difficult to secure a teacher, but we will make an endeavour to do so and would appreciate any assistance that you can give us in this regard.\n\nThe Indian parents should be informed that they must send their children to school; otherwise their family allowances should be discontinued. You can also assure any Indian who may enquire from you that the Department has no intention whatsoever to appoint either Mr. Harris or Mrs. Harris at any school in your agency.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nFile No. 22-1-1.\n\nReplying to your letter of November 26 with reference to the school situation on the Gibson Reserve, I have today been advised by Mrs. Matteson that she will continue to teach school there until at least the Christmas holidays.\n\nI am aware of the very considerable difficulty at this time in getting competent teachers for our schools and at the moment I do not know of a single disengaged school teacher in this district. I will, however, keep on the lookout and will advise you further should I be able to do anything in the matter.\n\nThe people on the Gibson Reserve are being advised that keeping their children out of school will mean the cessation of family allowance payments.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 3rd December, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI am advised by Indian Agent Devlin that Mrs. Matteson has decided to remain as teacher of the Gibson School until the Christmas Holidays.\n\nI have not yet heard from Indian Agent Down with reference to the living accommodations at the vacant Oneida School. As soon as he replies, I will write to you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2B, Ontario.\nParry Sound, Ont.,\nDecember 13, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI visited the Gibson Reserve yesterday and had an interview with Mrs. Matteson, school teacher there. She has definitely decided to give up her position at the commencement of the Christmas holidays and desires to know if the cheque can be forwarded to her to reach her not later than December 22 as she intends to leave for the United States on the evening of that day.\n\nI am enclosing a record of the absentees amongst the pupils for this school covering the months of November and December and would wish to know if it is your desire that I communicate with the Family Allowance Board with a view to having the allowances of these children stopped.\n\nThe Stock family is the only one which appeared to pay any attention to my warnings and their children have been attending regularly during the month of December. Action had already been taken in the case of Clara News as her mother wrote personally to the Regional Director of Family Allowances. Mrs. Matteson appears to have been a very poor substitute for a teacher but none the less I do not consider that these people should be permitted to stage what is more or less a school strike.

This is in accordance with government policy and no exception can be made in her case. You should obtain her address and we will arrange to forward the cheque to you so that you can send it on to her.\n\nWith reference to the last two paragraphs of your letter, I am bringing to the attention of Colonel Jones, Supervisor of Family Allowances, the situation that has arisen at the Gibson School. Certainly, there is no excuse for parents whose children are receiving family allowances keeping them from school, simply because they do not like the teacher.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Gibson Day School,\n\nI am in receipt of an application for the position of school teacher on the Gibson Reserve from Mr. Lawrence White of Bala. Mr. White has just recently been discharged from the R.C.A.F. and has not been teaching school for some little time. He holds a second class certificate for the Province of Ontario and I believe that he would make a suitable teacher for this school to carry on that position for at least the balance of the current school year.\n\nIf the Home Mission Board have not already made arrangements for some other person to take the place of Mrs. Matteson who will be leaving at the commencement of the Christmas holidays, I would be glad to hear from you with regard to Mr. White's application. Mr. White does not propose to take over the missionary duties which are usually associated with this post.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 20th December, 1945.\n\nMr. Samuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ontario.\n\nREFERENCE YOUR LETTER 17TH UNITED CHURCH MISSIONARY SOCIETY NOT PREPARED TO GIVE DECISION REGARDING GIBSON FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS STOP DOCTOR DOREY ANXIOUS TO KNOW IF YOU CONSIDER MRS MATTESON WOULD BE SUITABLE FOR RYERSON STOP SUGGEST YOU TELEPHONE DOCTOR DOREY UNITED CHURCH MISSIONARY SOCIETY 299 QUEEN STREET WEST TORONTO REGARDING TEACHERS FOR THESE TWO SCHOOLS\n\nPhilip Phelan.\n\n---\n\nOttawa December 19 1945\n\nReverend Doctor Dorey\nSecretary Board of Home Missions\nUnited Church of Canada\n299 Queen Street West\nToronto Ont.\n\nINDIAN AGENT DEVLIN RECOMMENDS EMPLOYMENT LAWRENCE WHITE AS TEACHER FOR GIBSON SCHOOL -stop- HE HOLDS SECOND CLASS CERTIFICATE AND HAS JUST BEEN DISCHARGED FROM R C A F -stop- MR WHITE DOES NOT WISH TO PERFORM ANY MISSIONARY DUTIES -stop- PLEASE ADVISE IF YOU CONCUR IN HIS APPOINTMENT\n\nPhilip Phelan\n\nCharge Indian Affairs\nMines and Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI acknowledge receipt of Mr. Phelan's telegram of this date. I have talked to Dr. Dorey today and have advised him that I do not consider that Mrs. Matteson would be a suitable teacher for the Parry Island School. I would be much better satisfied to wait until Mrs. Vandenberg can resume her duties there which I hope will not be too long delayed.\n\nWith regard to filling the vacancy on the Gibson Reserve, Dr. Dorey has in mind some young man from the west whom he would like to send there as missionary teacher but he is unable to say definitely at the moment whether this can be arranged or not. In the meantime, I will keep open the negotiations with Mr. Whitehead of Bala about whom I wrote you a little while ago as a candidate for this position. By the way, I mentioned this man's name as being Mr. Lawrence White which should have read Whitehead. I believe that this would be a much better solution for the present of the situation at the Gibson Reserve, rather than to accept another one of these missionary teachers about whom we know nothing and who have been the cause of so much trouble to us recently.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 26th December, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nWith reference to our telephone conversation of December 20th, Indian Agent Devlin advises that he telephoned to you and expressed the opinion that Mrs. Matteson would not be suitable for Ryerson School.

Generally speaking, the Family Allowances Act has been a very useful club to enforce school attendance and the mere threat of stoppage of the payments has usually been sufficient. In the case of the Day School on the Gibson Reserve, however, I have been obliged to ask for wholesale stoppages of the payments there was a concerted attempt to boycott the school owing to dislike for the teacher. We have had ill luck with our missionary teachers on this Reserve for the last couple of years. We had one who was an excellent teacher but a poor missionary.

I had intended to say 'Terrible' but don't think you want that.\n\n\"Further remarks which may help to answer it - My position here is temporary till a Missionary is found, so I can be fired.

I cannot see anything behind this other than spite work on the part of the present Chief who has quarrelled with Mr. Hummel on various occasions. Mr. Hummel, I find, has been a reasonably good school teacher of good qualifications and I can see no real reason at the moment why he should be replaced. He is crippled in both hands and feet as a result, I believe, of some infantile disease and this has been made the occasion for foolish tales that his disability has affected unborn children on the Reserve with the result that they also had been born with defects, which of course is absurd. The only specific instance was a child of Chief Stock's born with a club foot.

The main difficulty would be transportation, provided also that the Bala school would accept them as pupils which I believe they would do if they have sufficient accommodation.\n\nThere is a small covered truck on the Reserve but I am very doubtful if all the children could be transported in one trip in this vehicle. There are twenty-odd children who had been attending the school on the Reserve. The greatest distance to be covered would be about 12 miles and there would possibly be occasions during the winter when they might have to miss the occasional day as the road on the Reserve is difficult to keep open during the winter.\n\nI have played with this idea myself for some time and will go further into it and see just what kind of a scheme might be worked out.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Superintendent.\n20th January, 1949.\n\nRev.

Re: Gibson Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply to your letter of February 10 I would advise that I have been looking into the matter of the transportation of the children from the Gibson Reserve to the white school at Bala. There are two small trucks owned on the Reserve which had been mentioned for the transportation job. One of them, however, is too small and while the other, which is a panel truck, might accommodate the number of school children, that owner and driver is not a person whom I could recommend for such employment. He has obtained an ordinary driver's license but I know that his eye sight is very poor and I do not myself think that he should be permitted to drive any kind of a vehicle.

In the meantime I have had a conversation with Rev. J.A. Lyttle, our Superintendent of Missions, who advises that he believes that Mr. C.A. Shaver, who taught the school at Christian Island, will be available about the middle of May. That is about the best that we can do. We have in mind someone to take over after the holidays if Mr. Shaver does not want to stay.\n\nIt might be well for Mr. Devlin to make arrangements for Mrs. Strength to begin work prior to Mr. Shaver's coming, though, in the light of Mr. Devlin's letter, I doubt whether there would be very much advantage to that.\n\nI shall certainly be glad when this school is under way again.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I note that Mr. Shaver will be available about the middle of May. Unfortunately, he is now 68 years of age and it would be rather difficult to add him to our payroll. As you are probably aware, our Retirement age is 65. If you think that the Indians would attend during the summer holidays, we might be able to interest a university student in teaching this school for May, June, July and August. I have a number of applications on hand from university students who, I feel, would prove quite satisfactory. I will list some of their names and addresses for you and you will note that I have selected only the male students:\n\n1. G. H. Brown, age 38, C.E., 6 years' service, Royal Canadian Navy, second year student, University of Toronto.\n   Address - 27 Linden Street, Toronto, Ont.\n\n2. J. J. Bond, age 31, Royal Navy service, under-graduate student in Anthropology, University of Toronto.\n   Address: 150 Keewatin Ave., Toronto, Ont.\n3. John L. Howe, age 26, 4 years Canadian Armoured Corps, graduating in Arts this year, University of Toronto. Address: 20 Winston Grove, Toronto 18, Ont.\n\nI also have the names of several students attending Mt. Allison University, Sackville, New Brunswick.\n\nIf you can arrange to interview any of the above students and find them suitable, please let me know and I will advise you the salary which we can allow.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAttention: Colonel B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary: Re: Muskoka - Gibson Day School\n\nI have your letter and can understand that it is difficult to take a man on the roll at Mr. Shaver's age, but at the same time he would only be a temporary employee. However, we have in mind the nomination of a man who has had two years' teaching experience, although that is only on a permit in Ontario. Would you agree to the appointment of Mr. Shaver as a temporary supply until the end of June?\n\nI do not think that there is any point in trying to get the school going in July and August because the children are all away.\n\nI shall be glad if you will let us know whether this proposal will be satisfactory to you. If you still refuse to consider Mr. Shaver, then we shall interview one of the students; but I should think that a good teacher like Mr. Shaver would be better at sixty-eight than an untrained teacher at thirty.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MIT\n\nMarch 31st,\n1949.\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nGibson Indian Day School.\n\nI have for answer your letter of March 31st, and we are prepared to hire Mr. Shaver on the distinct understanding that it will only be until the end of June.\n\nYou can appreciate our position in view of the present regulations in the Civil Service Act. His salary will be at the rate of $180. per teaching month.\n\nPlease find attached Income Tax forms and Employee Questionnaire form for completion by Mr. Shaver.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Devlin,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nParry Sound, Ontario.\n\nGibson Indian Day School.\n\nPlease find attached a self-explanatory letter to Dr. Dorey concerning the teacher at the above school.\n\nMr. Shaver is sixty-eight years of age, and you will note that we have agreed only to hire him until the end of June. He taught at the Christian Island U.C. Indian Day School and his work there was quite satisfactory. He is a qualified and experienced teacher, and should not have much difficulty with the school.\n\nFortunately, Dr. Dorey has in mind a young man with two years' of teaching experience for next September.\n\nBernard F.

As I am a graduate of the Normal College, Truro, N.S. I am asking the Dept. of Education, Ontario to grant me an Ontario public school license. This province does not seem to understand the training in the other provinces.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if you would kindly write a letter which I could send to the Dept. of Education, in Toronto, giving them an idea of how I handled the Ontario System of Education for your Dept. the four years in Gibson Reserve.

If you would, in writing next to the Provincial Department of Education, mention your teaching service at the Gibson Indian Day School during the period 1934-38 and also mention that during that time your school was inspected annually by Mr. George S. Johnson.\n\nWe have on file here copies of the reports submitted by this Public School Inspector, and his comments were always satisfactory concerning your teaching.

The 26th comes on a Saturday and they would like to do some shopping before they go home. I can arrange with the Manager of the Bank to cash their cheques. The Bank will be closed before the train comes in but the Manager will oblige us in that way. Mrs. English and Mrs. Earl Taylor cannot get in on time for the Bank on Saturday.\n\nI should state that Mrs. Taylor is handing in her resignation as teacher at the end of this term and will not be available for next year. I have spoken to the Rev. Father McPadden here to try to get a Teacher as all the Indians at Maganetawan are Roman Catholics. He will let me know in good time what he can do. Miss Smiley of Ryerson Indian Day School has asked permission to close school on the 25th, and as she has a very long way to go and has given excellent service, I would recommend that her request be favourably considered. Owing to a resolution passed some time ago by the Gibson Council regarding a new teacher being appointed I would suggest that the Dept. ask the Missionary people at Toronto to make a change at Gibson. I know that Mr. Joblin has been in the service of the Dept. for a number of years but somehow or other he doesn't seem to fit in at Gibson. This is only a suggestion on my part. I think that Mr. Joblin will be glad of a change.\n\nPlease say if I can expect the cheques on the 25th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

His letter which is herewith enclosed states that the cost will be $25.00. This price includes the cost of purchasing the basswood, teaming it to the Reserve, putting it on the walls, and doing all finishing.\n\nOn my last visit to the Gibson Reserve I examined the interior of the school house and found the walls in bad condition, the plaster having fallen off in several places, so that the Chief is justified in asking that repairs be made.\n\nThe price mentioned in the Chief's letter is the...\nIndian Agent's Office,\n\nEstimate cost of making the repairs appear to me to be quite reasonable & therefore beg to request you to sanction the expenditure if the Gibson Bank have any funds at their credit for such expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Dept.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The band was fully represented twenty-eight out of thirty-four members of adults were present. And the principal discussion at the meeting was the matter of repairs to School, which is in a great need of repairs more so than any School building in the Agency. I advised the Chief to get a practical Carpenter to make an estimate of the quantities of lumber and shingles required, as well as nails and paint. And have a resolution passed in their regular Council after he had found out what the cost of the material and labor would amount to. And that I had no doubt but the Department would consider their request. The first intimation I received was a memo giving the number of pieces of lumber required and in a few days Mr. Mickle, Symment & Sons account followed.

On receipt of your letter, I wrote Miss Forrest for a statement account of the material she purchased for the school when she took charge. Owing to her leaving her home at Woodville, Ontario, and going to Elk Lake, New Ontario, I heard nothing further from her until some days ago. When she wrote me from Ottawa informing me that she had left the hospital where she had been treated for typhoid, she sent me a statement and the prices in the form of a memo. I made out the statement in duplicate, and sent her the money.

Original on File 152195-6\n\nBUILDINGS and PREMISES.\n\nThe grounds are very poor. The school house needs painting. Everything else quite satisfactory.\n\nH.R. Scovell, I.P.S.\nOttawa, February 24, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Public School Inspector in his report on the Gibson School states that the grounds are very poor and that the building needs painting.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to report as to what might be done, if anything, to improve the grounds. The Department would also like to know whether if the material were supplied there is any reliable Indian who would undertake to perform the labour. I may mention that the name of Antoine Dewashe has been suggested to the Department as being a reliable person. It might be well for you to communicate with him when you have an opportunity and submit a list of the material necessary with an estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nAlex. Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nI examined the school house and grounds at Eaton Place, and find that the trouble is that the road passes close to the school house and the windows being low allow the children when studying the school work to feel very much when it was painted last June. They had not used any shelter on the walls (hence the trouble).\n\nThe water lies all around the building, it will be necessary to get a drain run from the building and some gravel put around it. The ground wants clearing off some. The road diverted and a fence put up to keep the teams and wagons away.\n\nI think it would take $100.00 to put the grounds in shape and build a fence around, and it will cost $50.00 to paint it.\n\nI can get Francis because to fix the grounds and build fence\u2014and Albert Commandant could do the painting if kept. Think it preferable to have the Indians do it\u2014waiting for Commandant I am sure.\n\nObd. Servant,\n\nAlexander Logan,\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6132, File 393-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 7, 1913.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo in reference to the painting of the Gibson School Building and drainage and fencing of the grounds. In reply I beg to say that the Department will supply the material for both the painting and fencing and will allow a reasonable amount for the labor. You may therefore purchase the paint and have the work done by Albert Commandant and have the work of the grounds and fencing done by Francis Decaire.\n\nThe voucher should show in detail the articles purchased and prices and also the amount of labor involved with the rates charged.

Original on 160370-26F, Ont.\n\nIn reference to the schoolhouse I take this opportunity of recommending that a great thing for this reserve and in my opinion a great necessity is a brighter and better schoolhouse. Either on this spot or close by could be erected a house which would attract the scholars and with the necessary improvements quite an advance could be made in our educational activities here. This schoolhouse is out of date, very poor appearance and very dismal. It is used for Council, entertainments, etc., etc., and is old and unattractive. In my opinion it would be an advantage to have a schoolhouse which would be up-to-date, attractive and used for a schoolhouse. The present building could be used for institutional purposes which we are anxious to prepare for next winter, where games, recreation, lectures, etc., could be enjoyed. Mrs. Jones and myself would make the physical culture and gymnastics a special feature.\n\nThe present house is badly in need of painting in and out, floor renewed, etc. (fair condition for aforesaid purposes but to encourage the day and night schools I certainly call your attention to the great need of a new schoolhouse. I am quite sure that attendance, punctuality, &c., would be greatly improved and a new interest aroused and the whole idea of education among the people placed upon a higher plane and the Dept. would be well repaid for the expenditure and effort. I am also persuaded that in the interests of the young and rising race we should have two classrooms.\n\nI would ask the Dept. in the event of their acceding to my request to appoint Mrs. Jones, my wife, to instruct the primer, who with myself is willing to make the education of these people a decided success. When all the children are at home there should be an excellent primer class. I refer to the main school, and Mrs. Jones could do this work very well. I would also desire the Department to authorize the permanent continuation of the sub-school which I am glad to state has proven a great success. The teacher, I believe, is devoted to her work and desires continuation.\n\nI would also ask as a great necessity that the night school be continued until June as I hear that some more are desirous of starting but camps and bad roads, etc., have prevented a regular attendance yet.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6132, File 393-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nI have a roll call of 7 or 8 and I am informed of the desire of others to come and to make it a real success. I ask you to make it permanent.\n\nI would also ask the Department to arrange in the new building, if granted, a kitchen and necessary fixtures where household science may be taught and where the scholars, who bring with them their lunch can get it in a more comfortable and cleanly way.\n\nIndividual seating in the schoolhouse too, seems a great necessity. With the addition of the primer class and the appointment of Mrs. Jones as kindergarten and primer teacher and the night school, the Department would then have upon this reserve a live educational institution which I believe would be a real moral one, and an organization worthy of our best efforts and fraught with great promises for the future and in addition the organization of an institution for the profitable recreation of our young folk in co-operation with our night school as afore outlined, would leave little to be desired.

Original on 160370-26F. Ont.\n\nClosets need urgent replacing.\n\nScreened approaches.- None. This is a great necessity.\n\nNo well, an urgent necessity.\n\nVentilation of School room.- Necessary improvement desirable.\n\nWilliam E. Jones,\nTeacher.\nOttawa, April 9, 1920.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your annual report on the Gibson Indian Day School for the fiscal year ending March 31st, last.\n\nIn reference to your request that a new school building be erected to replace the present building, which is out of date, I beg to say that, as the funds of the Department are limited, it will be impossible to erect a new school building during the present year.\n\nMr. Superintendent Logan is being written to regarding the closets and screened approaches.\n\nWith reference to your request that the night school be continued until the end of June, I beg to say that, if the attendance warrants this being done, the Department will have no objection to your continuing this work. If the results and attendance do not, in your opinion, justify the night school being continued until the end of June you should discontinue the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWilliam E. Jones, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nGibson Indian Day School,\nSahanatien P.O., Ont.\nOttawa, April 9, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Jones, teacher of the Gibson Indian Day School, in his annual report for the fiscal year ending March 31st, last, states that the closets need urgent replacing and that screened approaches should be provided.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to furnish a report concerning this matter. If you consider that new closets are required, you should furnish an estimate of the cost of erecting new ones, and also the providing of screened approaches. It might be possible, however, to repair the present closets and put them in a satisfactory condition. You should furnish a full report on this matter after your next visit to the Gibson Reserve.\n\nThe teacher states that there is no well and that one is urgently needed. You should advise also concerning this matter and, if you consider a well to be necessary, you should state approximately the cost of boring one.\n\nHe also states that the teacher's residence is in need of painting both inside and out and that the floors should be renewed. You should also report on these matters and state the cost of having this work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlexander Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nI beg to thank you for the intimation in reference to the book. When it arrives I will carry out your instructions.\n\nIn reference to the completeness of my equipment I beg to say that we now have every necessary thing except the school bell.\n\nI understand from Mr. Brown this matter is deferred for the present. I would advise that there is a good bell at the old church here. Would the Dept suggest any means of getting it.\n\nThis would save much expenditure. In reference to the school fees received I beg to say I have not yet received the invoices but will forward them duly certified when they arrive.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nWilliam E. Jones.\nOttawa, April 16, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, in which you request that the bell at the old church on the Gibson Reserve be secured for the use of the day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared at the present time to take up the matter of having this bell moved from the church and installed for the use of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWilliam E. Jones, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nGibson Indian Day School,\nSahanatien P.O., Ont.\nSir,\u2014\n\nI have had a number of complaints lately about the teacher and I think it would be better to have the teacher and preacher separate. The Infant school seems to be getting along alright.\n\nI am,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Supt.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report on Gibson School as requested in above letter.\n\nThe closets mentioned are in good shape, they are sided on the outside and painted, matched lumber inside and shingled roof with ventilator in each one. All they require and which I would recommend is a coat of lime whitewash inside. There is no need of screened approaches as they are twenty-five feet apart.\n\nAs to the urgent need of a well in the school grounds, there are three wells within one hundred yards of the school and as there are only a few children attending school it would be much better to use the water from one of these. If a well was put in the school grounds it would be so little used that the water would become stagnant.\n\nIn the last paragraph of the above letter you state the teacher's residence needs painting etc., As the teacher's house belongs to the Methodist Missionary Society I asked the teacher what he meant by reporting the house being in need of painting and he said he intended the school house. While I think the building is not very bad it might be well to give the inside a coat of paint during the Summer holidays and a new floor would improve the School House although it is not too bad. The present floor is laid with 10 inch pine lumber. If a new floor and platform were put down in hardwood it would cost at the present time $250.00.\n\nThe most needed thing in this school are seats as quite a number are broken. If the Department\nSir,\n\nwill look up where the seats were purchased and let me know I could get some repairs for them and have them fixed up. I think they were bought about 1911 or 1912.\n\nMr. Jones seems to have a mania for ordering supplies. He started a night school lately but no one is attending, the most he had was three and he has a cupboard filled with books etc., and lamps that cost a lot of money and are not used. He also got saws, planes, hammers etc., and sewing material and I find they have never been used either but he says he can get anything he wants from the Department and is now talking a new school house. I venture to say that this school and equipments including the closets as better than 75% of the rural white schools in this district. I am quite sure it was a mistake to change the truant officer as he has now a number of the Indian families against him and to use his own words \"are boycotting him.\" The man (the Chief) appointed truant officer was up at my office last week along with Frank Decaire, another Indian, of the Reserve, wishing to have Jones removed as teacher but would like to retain his services as preacher as he has put them into debt by purchasing a $500.00 imitation pipe organ and I am sure a $150.00 one would have been all that was necessary.\nOttawa, April 24, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant regarding the repairs which the teacher stated in his annual report were needed to be made to the closets and school building on the Gibson Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is considered, in view of your report, that screened approaches are not required. It might be well to give the closets a coat of lime whitewash inside and this work should be done at very little expense. If you consider it advisable to do so, you may have the closets whitewashed inside. The work should be done by one of the Indians.\n\nIt would not appear necessary to provide a well for the school, in view of the fact that there are three wells near the school from which water can be obtained.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to have a new floor placed in the school at the present time.\n\nYou should furnish an estimate of the cost of having the inside of the building painted, stating the cost of the paint required and the amount it would cost to have the painting done.\n\nThe desks supplied this school in September, 1911, were ordered from The E. N. Moyer Co., Limited, Toronto, and consisted of 4 No. 5 double individual, 4 No. 4, 2 No. 3 and 2 No. 2, as well as 2 No. 2 rear seats. Any broken parts of the desks could, no doubt, be supplied by this firm and you should ascertain what parts are required and order them and have the desks placed in good repair.\n\nAlexander Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nFerry Sound, Ont.\n\nYour\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6132, File 393-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nThis letter informs you that I closed school Friday noon Sept. 31st and that school was closed all last week and Monday of this week opening again Tuesday 11th October.\n\nThe reason for this is that it was absolutely necessary to have school repairs and cleaning done all of which should have been attended to during summer holidays. When I returned in September nothing had been done except the weeds had been\nin the school yard\nI started in to teach Tuesday\nafter Labor Day into a dirty\nschool and repaired desks\nand window panes\nout door repairs not done\nto caretaker on the job.\nThe former caretaker\nMr Laforce was offered\nforty-dollars but refused\nto take it for less than fifty\ndollars. However he was\naway up to Port Carling\nall summer and did not\nreturn till after I came back\nso he could not attend to\nthe school cleaning during\nthe holidays. The son Phillips\nLaforce was at home but they\ndid nothing.\nThe caretaker did not the\nslightest repair in school\nor out so when things got broken\naccidentally sometimes a little\nrepair might have saved them\nfrom going too far.\nLeaf 2 -\nOf course I know the caretaker did not get enough pay for the amount of work he had to do in connection with the school so he can hardly be condemned for not doing any extra.\n\nMr. Dewasha has undertaken the repairing & cleaning of the school and repairing outside everything is not complete yet but there is enough done to begin school on Tuesday.\n\nI will send you the expenses bill later when more work is completed.\n\nThe repairing & cleaning did not begin in the beginning of the week for Mr. Dewasha did not wish to undertake the work till he got authority to do so from the Chief through Monday. The Chief told him to start in on Wednesday, but he had to go to Bala for things and so could not begin till later and no cleaning could not start till\nSaturday as pipe chimney had\nto be cleaned first. Besides\nother repairs\u2014\nMr. Dewar will take over\nthe job of caretaker for the\nsum of fifty dollars a\nyear but will not take it for\nless.\nPersonally I think the job is\nworth that amount of money.\nHe will look after the school\nfor the present till a caretaker\nis hired for 25 cents a day.\nIf he is hired as a caretaker\nat the sum of fifty dollars,\nthis charge of 25 cents a day will\nnot be reckoned to his account.\nMay I be allowed the privilege\nof suggesting that when\nthe caretaker is hired, he to be\ngiven specific definite directions\nas to his duties among these\nthat a pail of fresh water\nbe put into school every morning\nand also that the fuel\u2014\nBuildings be carefully inspected & kept in a sanitary way, and then be inspected often and in co-operation with teacher and pupils we all try to help.\n\nI would like some law to be enacted to the Band whereby they would be under obligation not to spit around either in church or in the school house when they meet for any social or business function. Things along that line have improved but the improvement is not thorough yet.\n\nI have spoken about it and I have tried to have it stopped but I want this reform to be thoroughly rooted into them.\nI would request the Dept. of Indian Affairs not to deduct anything off my teaching days owing to school being closed as it was work which should have been done during holidays. It is a lesson to have things done at the right time and thus save time and money.\n\nRespectfully yours,\nMary A Black.\nOTTAWA, October 14th, 1921.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, informing the Department that you had to close the Gibson Indian Day School for several days on account of repairs being made.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your action in this instance is approved, but I would point out that the Department does not desire teachers to close schools during the regular teaching period, unless for urgent reasons. Salary will be allowed you, but you should state on your quarterly return the days school was closed, and the reason therefor.\n\nRegarding the appointment of a caretaker, I beg to say that Chief Strength, who visited the Department recently, recommended the appointment of Xavier Laforce. The Department has approved of his appointment, with salary at the rate of $50.00 per annum, payable quarterly. The Chief was requested to inform Laforce of his appointment, and to also inform him that it is expected he will perform his duties as directed, and besides the ordinary duties of caretaker he is to provide the drinking water required for the use of the school, and that he is to sweep the class room after school hours instead of in the morning.\n\nChief Strength was also instructed to have the following repairs made, viz:\n\n- 2 panes of glass put in, desks repaired, stove and stove pipes cleaned.\n\nThe painting of the inside of the school will have to remain over until next summer.\n\nIt is noted that you have arranged with Mr. Desasha to undertake the work of repairing and cleaning. You may also arrange with him to have 2 locks, with keys, installed; one on the wood shop and the other on the porch; also the hinges repaired, or new ones put on, and also have any repairs required made to the side walk to the boys' closet.\n\nI will be pleased if you will keep a careful account of all expenditures for the purpose, and forward these accounts, in duplicate, to Mr. Superintendent Logan, who will certify the same and send them to the Department when, if satisfactory, payment will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMiss Mary A.

She also states that the stove needs repair, and that the fence, roof of school and woodshed require attention.\n\nI shall be pleased if, on the occasion of your next visit to this school, you will enquire into the repairs needed, and inform the Department as to what you would recommend be done. You should also state the probable cost of any work which you suggest should be carried out. If possible, we would like this information before the summer holidays, as, if it is decided to authorize any work, it could be carried out during that period.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nSir,\n\nAnswering yours of May 4th, 22-1-5, I have been to Gibsen Reserve, and examined the school and school grounds, also the fencing. I find that the following is required to put the building and fencing in proper condition:\n\nThe wood shed, which is attached to main building, thus\u2014 as a lean-to, must be reshingled. The roof of main building must be repaired, a new ridge board put on. The chimney is dangerous and must be practically rebuilt, or outside of building. Part of base-board of main building, just above present height, is rotten. Both toilets are badly in need of repair, and all building badly in need of paint outside and inside. The school building will require to have about 100 ft. ef inside lining replaced. There are two locks required for doors of school, and two latches for toilets. There are 25 pests and one small gate required for fencing.\n\nI think the fencing might be made to do for a year or two, after the new pests are put in.\n\nThe work can be done by members of the band, and shingles can be bought at Balsam, lime for chimney at Parry Sound, and paint and nails, at Parry Sound. The small gate can be bought at Parry Sound.\n\nNext year this building will require a new floor. I would recommend that repairs be started right away, so that everything will be finished in good time for opening of school in September.\n\nTrusting that this will meet with your approval.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nJ.D.

If possible competitive prices for all the material should be obtained, and the purchase made from the firm quoting you the lowest price. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred, to which should be attached a memorandum showing the names of the firms or individuals asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nWhen the material has been delivered, you should arrange with the Indians to perform the labour. We are not sure, from your letter, as to whether they will perform the labour gratis or not. If not, proper time sheets, in duplicate, of all labour employed should be kept, which should be certified by you and forwarded to the Department for payment. We are leaving the above repairs in your hands to carry out as cheaply as possible. The work should be completed during the coming summer holidays.\n\nRegarding the painting of the building, both outside and inside, I shall be pleased if you will furnish an estimate of the cost of the paint, etc., required, and also the cost of the labour in having the work done. We prefer that all work at this school be done by day labour.\n\nAs soon as we have an estimate of the cost of painting, we will be in a position to decide whether funds can be provided to carry out the work or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

All Indians working for the Department want to be paid for work done.\n\nI roughly estimate that the cost of paint and labour of painting the Gibsen Scheel house and closets, will not exceed $100.00. While making that estimate, I would respectfully ask the Department to remember that I can't be present to keep tab on the labour, but I believe that the Band can be depended on to see that no time will be lost, so I think that the cost of paint and labour should not exceed $100.00.\n\nThese buildings should have been painted some years ago.

There was also a quantity of school material supplied. As this school will not likely be in operation, it is thought that the desks could be transferred to the Gibson school, and, if this were done, it might obviate the necessity of purchasing more desks.

I don't know if there are any funds available for this purpose, but I am sure that such action on the part of the Dept. would be appreciated by the children, their parents, the teacher, and myself. Even $10.00 for each school would bring a glow of happiness to the faces of the youngsters, which would more than reward for the expenditure asked.\n\nTrusting that you will consider this application favourably,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nR.T.

He states that a new seat is required.\n\nHe also recommends, with reference to the windows in the school building, that a cord running through a pulley and fastened at a lower window sill should be attached to each upper window sash, so that the sash might be lowered for ventilation, and that locks should be provided for windows when school is not in session. He also states that a cord and pulley for the \"manhole\" cover in the ceiling would also assist in the ventilation of the building.\n\nHe further states that there is a serious crack in the box stove which should be repaired before further damage occurs, and that the stove should also be provided with a metal jacket screen at sides and back to save pupils seated near from being too hot while others at a distance are cold.\n\nOn the occasion of your next visit to the Gibson School, I should be pleased if you would enquire into the matters referred to, and, if you concur in the Inspector's recommendations, you may arrange to have the work mentioned carried out. Any work undertaken should be performed at the lowest possible cost. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to have the work as suggested by the Inspector carried out if you consider it necessary to have same performed.

I may say that our funds for this year are extremely limited, as our appropriation was considerably reduced. Would the present floor, with a few repairs, be satisfactory until next year? If not, you should forward your recommendation, stating, in detail, the floor that would be required and the cost of material and labour, when consideration would then be given as to whether this work could be authorized this year or not.\n\nThe Public School Inspector also draws attention to the condition of the closets. He states they are badly marked up and soiled.

Burgess, Bala, Ont., for material required for repairing outised toilets at the Gibson Indian Day School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 22-1-5 dated July 8th, 1931.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI just got back yesterday morning from an inspection of the schools. As stated to you in a letter yesterday, I am very well pleased with Miss O'Meara and Mrs. Munson, and I believe that they are going to be a success. They had their little trouble in starting up, and the houses were not as tidy as they might have been and a lot of the stuff that should have been there, such as dishes, were broken and not reported home by the teachers.\n\nIn having a look around, which I took time to do, I find that there will have to be some improvements made still around next summer and I am writing at this stage of the game so that you will be able to get in your estimates sufficient to cover the cost of the following:\n\nGibson school requires paint outside and inside. It is very dirty and I am very dissatisfied with the appearance of the school. I would not like either you or Mr. Macookin to come and see the school as it is at the present time. The inside is very much in need of painting and the outside as well.\n\nThe teacher's house at Pickeral should not be allowed to go past the summer without painting. The school, I think, will do for another year.\n\nThe school at Magnetawan Reserve should have been painted last year and is surely very much in need of it now.\nThe school at Moose Deer Point requires painting both outside and inside.\n\nNow, Mr. Ferrier, the reason for me bringing this to your notice is this, I have tried to keep the schools standardised by having them fit for inspection by any of the officials from headquarters at any time. Mr. McGookin can tell you about the schools at Magnetawan and Moose Point, that they are in need of painting.\n\nI have conscientiously tried to keep down costs as much as possible, in fact I have come to the conclusion that perhaps I have been a little too tight re supplies for the teacher's houses and so forth. When I mentioned that some of these schools are isolated and out of the way to a certain extent, I think it is up to the officials of the Department, that is, you and me and everybody else, to try and make them as homelike and comfortable as possible so that we will be able to keep a good class of teachers. Then there is the dignity of the Department in owning these buildings, to be upheld. Hence my reason for bringing the matter before you at the present time so that if possible, you will be able to put through sufficient to cover the cost of the necessary improvements by the end of the financial year, next March.\n\nWhile at Lower French School, I looked the situation over re a boat and the dock. There is no dock there. There is a floating platform, which I must give Mrs. Munsen credit for. She has had it moved down to the river; when I was there before it was high and dry. There are a lot of round boulders and the water is shallow where they have to land. As the water is low at the present time this is a good time to have this work done. I have given instructions that a place 12 ft wide be cleared and sufficiently far out in the river so that in the event of a blow coming up in the river the boat will be away from the rocks. I should explain that the river is wide here and squalls at this time of the year will come up and blow the boat away from the dock which causes it to hit these rocks.\nI observed that Mrs. Munsen had the boat tied, bow and stern to the platform, but when the platform is floating it moves too, so you can quite easily understand how it is possible for a boat to be pounded against the rocks.\n\nI have satisfied Mrs. Munsen that the boat will be seaworthy for this season, so will try to keep this expense down until next Spring, but it will be necessary to have a good boat next spring. I will make arrangements with Scott's Boat Livery for a good strong boat which has been very slightly used and that I can procure for $50.00. This is a bargain that I am getting because of the business that I give to Scott's Boat Livery. The boat is well worth $75.00. This expenditure for boat can go into next year's estimates.\n\nAbout a gallon of varnish will be required for the bedroom and sitting room floors and linoleum for the kitchen in the Magnetawan Teachers house. It appears to me that they have been splitting wood in the kitchens by the look of them, and as both these teachers Mrs. Munsen and Miss O'Meara, are quite enthusiastic about their work I think it behoves us to make them feel at home and comfortable. I would therefore recommend that varnish for the sitting room and bedroom floors and linoleum for the kitchen be procured. This building is finished in British Columbia fir pine and at some future date the walls should be varnished in the meantime it will do but the floors will have to be fixed up.\n\nI trust Mr. Ferrier, that you will understand the reason for this letter. These things that I am asking for at the present time are absolutely necessary and if the painting is not done the buildings will not be a credit to the Department and I should feel very vexed if they were allowed to go any longer than next summer without being looked after, and I am sure the officials of the Department if they were here with me would concur with my ideas.\nThanking you for your kind consideration in sending me what I believe to be good teachers. The man at Parry Island is on trial, and I think with careful handling he might be a success.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJohn Daly\n\nIndian Sup'tcy, Parry Sound\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, relative to various matters concerning the Indian day schools in your Agency. It is noted that the new teachers appear satisfactory and that you believe they are going to be a success.\n\nRegarding the painting of the various schools as mentioned by you, I have to say that the Department has no funds this year to have this work done. You might draw the matter to our attention early next spring, stating the approximate cost of the painting required at each school, including material and labour, and how you would propose having the work carried out.\n\nYou are being written in a separate communication regarding the varnish required for the bedroom and sitting room floors and linoleum for the kitchen in the teacher's residence at the Maganetawen Indian Day School.\n\nIn future, I should be pleased if, in communicating with the Department on matters affecting the schools, you would write separate letters regarding each subject. Separate letters regarding each subject would be of much assistance to the Department in dealing with the various questions expeditiously.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I would request that you select the three schools which are the most urgently in need of painting. It is desired, if possible, that the labour be performed by Indians, in order that they will be given an opportunity to obtain work. Could you not reconsider the matter, and obtain the services of a competent Indian for each of the three schools selected by you to be painted? One who would be competent to do the work and oversee the labour of any extra help he might require - you to purchase all paint, oil, etc., and have same delivered at each school? We would not be prepared to authorize having the painting commenced until the first of July, next, after the schools have closed for the summer holidays. Please give the matter of the painting your further consideration, and supply full information as asked for, also the approximate cost of the material and labour for each school separately.\n\nI may add that we have no information regarding the firm of Tucker Bros. from whom you obtained the quotation. Please state where this firm is located and if they are on the list to receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M.

As the times get better, I would hope that the Department would be able to arrange for the painting of the other three schools, perhaps next year.\n\nIn sending in the estimate to the Department in mine of May 12th, T-3689, I omitted to put in the wood shed, and toilets. I am including same in this estimate. Tucker Brothers of Parry Sound have submitted the enclosed estimate, and considering the distances that they have to cover, it is to my mind, an exceptionally reasonable estimate for work which I know will be well done.\n\nThe distance from here to Magnetawan Reserve, on the railroad is 39 miles, and one mile from Byng Inlet Station to the reserve; the distance from here to Gibson, is 35 miles on the railroad, to Salla, and eight\nto the school in the Reserve; the distance from Parry Sound to Moose Point, via gasoline speeder is 45 miles.\n\nI would strongly recommend that this estimate from Tucker Brothers be accepted, for the painting of these schools. The reason for me recommending that these schools be painted, is that, the Byng Inlet School, is very much in need of painting and is a landmark on the Reserve. It can be seen from the train, when passing, and there is just the difference at the present time, of this building not looking good. The school at Gibson is a centre of interest to the tourists driving to Black Lake, and the school at Moose Deer Point, is visited by a great number of tourists. These three schools should be painted this year, in order that they may be a credit to the Department.\n\nThe consideration of the Department in this matter will be very much appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJMD/EK.\nAgent.\n\nEnclosure.\nParry Sound, Ont.\nMay 21, 1932.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir;\n\nYours of May 18th, 22-1-5 received re painting of schools in the Agency. I sent forward on May 19th, T-3600, an estimate for the painting of three schools, Magnetawan, Gibson, and Moose Deer Point.\n\nMy explanation, in letter sent forward that the Indians do not make a good job of painting, is one of the reasons why the schools require to be painted properly with a good foundation. I am taking into consideration the necessity of giving the Indians all the work possible, but in doing this in the past, I have discovered that the buildings suffer and the expenditure is not justified for the job that they make, and another reason I feel like refraining from giving the Indians the job of painting is this, that if I could get a regular job done, not patchy, by a good painter, we would have a good backing for future jobs whereby the Indians can make no mistake.\n\nThe prices as sent forward from Tucker Brothers seem to me to be very reasonable for the job that I know they will make. The Tucker brothers have their business here in Parry Sound, and they do pretty nearly all the Government work that is to be done here. They are doing the new post office. It is my opinion that the Department would be well advised to accept Tucker's offer for doing these schools.\nBy having Tucker Brothers do the job, we will have a good job, and if any future painting of the schools is done, there will be a good foundation for the Indians to work on, although my experience with the Indians is that they do not make a good job of painting.\n\nTrusting this explanation will be satisfactory and that Tucker Brothers offer will be accepted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nMay 26, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nThree schools in the Parry Sound Indian Agency have to be painted this year. It is proposed to put on two coats, both inside and outside, and do the outbuildings. The Indian Agent cannot recommend any Indians for this work but has received a quotation, without any authority, from Tucker Brothers, of Parry Sound. The total cost for the three schools would be $390.\n\nWould it be satisfactory to give this work to Tucker Brothers? If not, please let me know the Minister's wishes. Two schools are in the federal district of Parry Sound and one in Muskoka, Ontario.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nMay 30th, 1932.\n\nMr. Williams,\n\nI have your memorandum of the 26th instant regarding the painting of three schools in the Parry Sound Indian Agency.\n\nPlease advise me as to the location of the school in the Constituency of Muskoka, Ontario, and the two schools in the Federal District of Parry Sound. What I want is the name of the nearest village or town to each school.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nJune 1, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nI have your memorandum of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the location of three schools in the Parry Sound Indian agency which require painting. They are:\n\nThe Gibson Indian Day School, 9 miles from Bala and 20 miles from Bracebridge, in the federal district of Muskoka-Ontario.\n\nThe Magnetawan Indian Day School, one mile from Byag Inlet, in the federal district of Parry Sound.\n\nThe Moose Deer Point Indian Day School, at Moose Point, is quite isolated. It is 45 miles by boat from Parry Sound and is in the federal district of the same name.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nFollowing mine of July 7th, I would draw the attention of the Department to my recommendation that Robert Stock, who is a returned soldier with a family of seven, receive two more rations. I have to state that when coming back from Gibson Reserve on my last trip, I met Mr. Montgomery, a resident of Bala, who had the patronage for that section of the country and he informed me that Dr. McGibbon, the member for Muskoka had asked him to pick on two reliable men to paint the School at Gibson Reserve.\n\nMontgomery told me that he wanted to discuss the matter with me before doing anything. I explained to him that Robert Stock who is a returned soldier, and a member of the Band, with a wife and six children, and Isaiah Dewasha a married man with eight children, and both in receipt of relief, should have the privilege of doing this work. I explained to Montgomery that I would be responsible for them making a satisfactory job. He said he would send their names forward to Dr. McGibbon.\n\nOwing to the conditions in that section of the country at the present time, and the need for assistance being granted to these men and their families, I would strongly recommend that they get this job of painting the school, woodshed and toilets at Gibson Reserve, and that it be given to them as soon as possible.\n\nBy doing this, it would relieve...\nthe distress of these two families.\n\nThe consideration of the Department at their very earliest will be very much appreciated by this office.\n\nI should state for the information of the Department that the situation is very peculiar in the Gibson Reserve as these men have been accustomed to lumbering and doing other manual labour outside of the Reserve. They cannot procure any labour at the present time and that accounts for the hard-up condition of the members of the Band now.\n\nA reply at the very earliest convenience of the Department will be appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nJMD/EK.\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJuly 27th, 1932.\n\nMr. Williams,\n\nRe the painting of the Gibson Indian Day School, near Bala, Muskoka, prices for this work may be obtained from Mr. Robert Stock and Mr. Isaiah Dewasha, who, I understand, reside in the neighbourhood of the school. The Indian Agent will, no doubt, be able to locate and secure quotations from them.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nImmediate\n\nOttawa, July 28, 1932\n\nMr. [signature]\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\n[signature]\nOttawa, July 28, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 21st instant, relative to the painting of the Gibson Indian Day School building, woodshed and toilet, I have to say that you may obtain prices for this work from Mr. Robert Stock and Mr. Issah Dewasha. If you are satisfied that the prices obtained from these men for carrying out the labour in painting the buildings are satisfactory, you may arrange for them to do the work.\n\nYou should purchase from a firm on the list to receive consideration the paint, oil and other materials required. You should see that a good grade of both paint and oil is obtained. Accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the materials, and time sheets, in triplicate, should be forwarded for the labour. These should be signed by the individual men and certified by yourself.\n\nThe school building is to be given two coats of paint, both inside and outside, and the woodshed and toilet one coat. You should see that a satisfactory job is completed. The Department will leave the selection of the colours for the walls and trim in your hands. If possible, the painting should be completed before the school reopens after the present summer holidays. The total cost should not exceed your estimate as stated in your letter of May 19th, last, viz., $125.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M.

Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPerry Sound,\nOnt.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nThe teachers in this Agency have been in town enquiring about the grant for their Christmas Tree. There is a new store open in town where they can buy articles for the Christmas Trees, and they are anxious to know if they can get the grant as usual.\n\nThe grants given each year are as follows:\n\n- Parry Island, $10.00\n- Gibson, 10.00\n- Lower French, 15.00\n- Shawanage, 10.00\n- Moose Deer Point, 5.00\n- Magntawan, 5.00\n\nA reply at the very earliest convenience of the Department will be very much appreciated.\n\nThe teachers have been also enquiring about when they will get their salary cheques, for the quarter ending December. The schools here are closing on the 22nd, and I would appreciate it very much if the cheques could be here before that so that I can send the cheques to them before they leave the district, that they may be able to settle up all their bills before Christmas.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nJMD/EK.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, requesting a grant to purchase a treat for the pupils of the various schools in your agency at Christmas. In reply I have to say that, as our funds for this purpose are extremely limited this year, it is not possible to provide a grant to the same amount as allowed in previous years. You may incur an expenditure in the purchase of supplies for a treat at each of the schools in your agency, as follows:\n\n| School          | Amount |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Ryerson         | $8.00  |\n| Lower French River | $4.00 |\n| Shawansaga      | $8.00  |\n| Magnetawan      | $4.00  |\n| Gibson          | $8.00  |\n| Moose Deer Point | $4.00 |\n\nItemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the supplies, should be obtained for each school, separately. These accounts should be handed to you, to be attached to proper voucher forms, certified in the usual manner and forwarded for payment.\n\nRegarding the forwarding of the teachers' salary cheques for the current quarter, I have to say that, if the necessary Treasury authority is obtained, the salary cheques will be forwarded to you before the schools close for the Christmas holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

I would suggest that several loads of gravel be hauled to fill in the open ditch by the water closets. This open ditch is most unsanitary.\n\nThe platform in front of school needs repairing. The front gate is missing. This allows the cows to get in, making the playground more or less unfit for play.\nOttawa, June 5, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Gibson Indian Day School, states that the platform in front of the school needs repairing, also that the front gate is missing, which allows the cows to get in, making the playground unfit for play. He also recommends that several loads of gravel be hauled, to fill in the open ditch by the water closets. He states this ditch is unsanitary.\n\nI would request that you arrange to have any repairs required carried out to the platform in front of the school, and, if necessary, a new gate supplied and installed. Regarding the gravel, it is considered the Indians, themselves, should be able to haul a few loads of gravel to fill in the open ditch referred to by the Inspector without cost to the Department.\n\nAny expenditure incurred should be kept to the lowest possible point, and should be covered by accounts, in triplicate, which should be certified by you and forwarded for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nParry Sound, Ont.\nJune 12, 1933.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nYours of June 8th, 22-1-5 received re report of the Public School Inspector at the Gibson Indian Day School. In reply I have to state that I knew the platform required to be fixed up, but was letting it go as long as possible in my endeavour to keep down costs.\n\nI do not agree with the Inspector that the ditch at the toilets should be covered up, as I find it is necessary to drain that section of the School grounds, but I have to state that the aprons around the toilets have been heaved by the frost, and should be fixed up, and some of the boards are broken off the aprons. If the Department will grant a requisition for this, I can have it done at very little cost.\n\nThe next time I am in the Gibson Reserve, I will endeavour to have a bee, and have a couple of loads of gravel hauled to scatter around the toilets, but not to fill in the ditch. When I am talking to the Band about having a bee to have the gravel hauled for this purpose, I will explain to them that they are not paying anything out of the Band funds for their education and in that way perhaps some of the members of the Band will volunteer to haul the gravel.\n\nRe the little gate; I do not think the cows are doing any harm in the school yard, it is only a small gateway. The large gate on the main road is kept closed, but if the Department thinks that a gate should be put on, I would suggest that when they grant the requisition for the fixing of the aprons of the toilets, I could have a handy man make a\nlittle gate out of rough lumber to serve the purpose. This would not cost very much, as near as I can guess the cost of the lumber and a day's wages, or at the most two days' wages would cover the cost of this.\n\nThe opinion of the Department in this matter will be very much appreciated.\n\nShould the officials of the Department see fit, they can ask Inspector McGookin and he will tell them that the building and the grounds are in pretty good shape, and I know that the Public School Inspector visits schools not half as good as the school in the Gibson Reserve. It was painted last year and is in pretty good shape for such an old building.\n\nI would be much obliged if the Department will grant a requisition to get the work done as suggested by me.\n\nThe consideration of the Department at their earliest will be very much appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nJMD/EK.\nOttawa, June 15, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, regarding the repairs, etc., required at the Gibson Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange to have the repairs required to the platform in front of the school carried out. You may also arrange to have a handyman make a gate of lumber that would serve the purpose at the small gateway. You may also arrange to have the aprons around the toilets that have been heaved by the frost fixed up and any boards that are broken off replaced. All expenditure in connection with the above work should be kept as low as possible and, when same has been completed, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost. Funds for the purpose are covered by a blanket encumbrance obtained here.\n\nIt is noted that you will have the Indians haul a few loads of gravel to be placed around the toilets, and that you consider you can have this done without cost to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I had a look at the stove in the school the last time I was in the Reserve, and I have been putting off doing anything about this, as I thought perhaps we could get it patched up. The door was broken, but I have a letter from Mr. Ward stating that it is cracked across the top now, so it will be impossible to do anything to this stove, as it smokes too much. A suitable stove can be procured here in Parry Sound for $20.00. (Freight would have to be added to this.)\n\nI would appreciate it very much if the Department would give me authority to purchase a new stove.\n\nRe the picture of the King for the school, I think Mr. Ward is under the impression that a picture of the King would help to make them more loyal subjects in Gibson Reserve. There is a lot of petty squabbling among the younger members of the Reserve, and I think Mr. Ward is under the impression that a picture of the King might help the children to know who the King is.\n\nThe consideration of the Department will be very much appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Most of the men are working on the road, and I refrained from asking them to do any work around the school, as they were making money outside of the reserve, and keeping down the costs of relief.

This school is gradually becoming a ruin and I think that the repairs which I have indicated are very necessary this year. If the year's estimates are not sufficient to take care of this work I would be glad to know just what sum might be made available and we could perhaps do a portion of the work this year and complete the job next year. I might say that I do not anticipate anything other than minor repair bills for any of the other schools in the Agency this year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, July 16, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to repairs required at the Gibson Indian Day School.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation an amount of $200 was provided for repairs and improvements for the schools in your agency. We have already authorized an expenditure of $20 at Henvey Inlet and $81 at Ryerson. This leaves a balance of approximately $200 still available.\n\nI note from your letter that some of the work could be done this year and the balance completed next year. I would therefore appreciate hearing further from you regarding what can be done with the amount that can be spent, namely $200. When forwarding a list of the material, you should state the name of the firm from whom you are obtaining prices, because, if the materials cost over fifty dollars, it will be necessary to purchase them through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Samuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n## Estimate of Repairs, Gibson Indian Day School.\n\n### Material:\n\n| Item Description                                      | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Cost |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|------------|\n| 700 sq. ft. #2 Birch flooring @ 12\u00bd\u00a2                   |          |            | 93.75      |\n| 2 Rolls Tarred Sheathing @ 2.75                        |          |            | 5.50       |\n| 100 lin ft. 1 x 6 Pine D 4S @ 3\u00a2                       |          |            | 3.00       |\n| 125 \" \" \u00bd Rd. @ 1\u00a2                                     |          |            | 1.25       |\n| 1 - 1 3/8\" Door 3' x 6'-6\"                             |          |            | 8.50       |\n| **Door Lock**                                          |          |            | 1.00       |\n| 10 Bags Cement                                         |          |            | 7.25       |\n| **Nails, etc.**                                        |          |            | 3.00       |\n| **Freight & Cartage**                                  |          |            | 15.00      |\n\nTotal Material Cost: $138.25\n\n### Labour:\n\nLabour Cost: $60.00\n\nTotal Estimate: $198.25\nParry Sound, Ont.,\nJuly 22, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReference: Letter, July 16, 22-1-5.\n\nIn reply to above letter I beg to enclose revised estimate of repairs for the Gibson School, making the amount approximately $200.00 to be expended this year.

Possibly two would be sufficient. However, the matter is left to your decision. As far as I know, the condition of which the teacher complains is a temporary one, and in the event of Coleman lamps being purchased, they should be very carefully stored when they are not in use, in order that they might be available when required.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| Date   | Description                        | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|--------|-----------------------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| Sept 5 | 40 Rolls Toilet Tissue             |          |            |       |\n|        |                                   |          | $6 \u00bd\u00a2      | $2.50 |\n| Dec. 19| pr.

Authority was granted last year for these toilets to the amount of $112.00. I was unable to proceed with the work last year due to both the shortage of material and labour. I propose, if possible, to have it done this summer but a review of the situation shows the costs to be considerably increased due to prices of both material and labour.\n\nI would be glad to have these costs for the various schools passed if at all possible but should it not be possible to pass on the amounts requested because of non-inclusion in the estimates, you might indicate what amounts would be available for expenditure on the various schools and I will have as much as possible completed this year and the balance next year.

General of Indian Affairs,\n\nSir\u2014\n\nReferring to your letter, addressed to me, dated 17th July, File No. 152.1947\u2014 instructing me to see if the Severn Indians would assist in putting up a small house for a teacher residence\u2014I beg to say that during my recent visit I learned that a building committee of three members of the Band had been appointed\u2014a site suitable for the purpose had been selected on lot 11 Con. V contiguous to the School House. An application was made to purchase the house of the late Mr. Rivers from his widow\u2014who has again married\u2014and to remove it to the site of the Teacher House. It was thought that the house in question could be bought for $400. The Band consented to raise the proposed building as well as to aid in its removal. The balance of the amount asked for would, it was estimated, pay a contractor for completing the hemped structure.\n\nI examined the house it was proposed to purchase and found it a substantial well built log house 20x22 in size and 1\u00bd story in height. It was floored up and down stairs with very good lumber. The upstairs floors were hewn timbers about 3\u00bd\" and the walls downstairs were lined with very good planed lumber.\n\nI believe that the structure could be moved piecemeal.\nWith the exception of the roof which I fear would be injured by removal and would necessitate the reshingling of the new house.\n\nIf your Department approves the proposal I am writing to the holder of Peter Rivers' land named Mr. Smart of the Bay of Quinte Reserve (Chelmsford P.O.) and began at what price she would dispose of her claim on the house.\n\nI explained to the Building Committee that the chief difficulty that I saw in the way of purchasing the structure above mentioned, would be getting some contractor to accept the responsibility of buying, removing and erecting the house for $150, the amount asked for, and which I understand your Dept. will grant. If your Department were to purchase the structure and the contractor subsequently throw up or failed in his contract the loss of the purchase money would be sustained. Perhaps, however, a conditional purchase might be made from Mr. Smart and throw the risk of a default by the contractor on her. At present the house is of no value whatever to her and if not sold will only rest in the middle of her former husband's clearing.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The services of Miss Hyndman have been discontinued, and it is our intention to send a duly qualified male teacher (a married man) to reside permanently among the Indians. To carry out this project it will be necessary to erect a house for the teacher, and a necessary preliminary will be the setting apart of a site. I will be glad to be informed if this will have to be done as in the case of other Indian Reserves, by setting apart a certain portion of land by resolution in Council, or whether in this case it would have to be obtained from some individual Indian?\n\nI am,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nA.

I talked over the matter with Chief Beaire, and he now informs me that he brought the proposal before the general Council on the 7th inst.. At that meeting Xavier Laforce, whose farm is across the road from the school, agreed to donate half an acre free, and an additional acre and a half on receiving the cost of clearing the land. The two acres to be a site for the proposed mission house. This offer by Laforce was concurred in by the Council.\n\nI now write to enquire if the same regulations obtain at Gibson as on other Indian Reserves; that is, could Laforce give an absolute title to these two acres, or would we have simply a virtual title of occupancy from the Department so long as we used it for the purposes above indicated. We would prefer the absolute title, but of course desire to act in harmony with Departmental regulations.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nA.

The school at Gibson has been without a teacher for some time, and we have not been able to secure one whom we could confidently recommend. This has arisen partly from the fact that there is no accommodation on the Reserve for an unmarried teacher, and there is no house in which a married teacher could reside. A short time ago one of the Indians, Xavier Laforce, agreed to surrender two acres as a site for a teacher's house; this is on a farm immediately opposite to the school house. Arrangements were made for Mr C.E. Fitten, Land Surveyor, to proceed to Gibson on the 5th of June for the purpose of surveying the two acres, after which a sketch with distances properly marked would be forwarded to the Department. In order that a suitable teacher may be procured for the Gibson Indians, it seems to be not only desirable, but absolutely necessary that a house be erected for him to live in, and I respectfully submit this matter to the Department with the earnest hope that the necessary accommodation will be provided.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The same trouble occurs on most of the Reserves where the Indians wish to employ white teachers and the Department has taken steps to provide suitable accommodation when possible. These Indians, however, have no money and there is no special provision made.

Ferguson, of Bracebridge, to the Messrs Brown Bros., a reliable firm of builders in that place. They have furnished an estimate of cost of building according to two different plans, and I enclose their estimate, and am sending to the Department a copy of the plans in question. It will be seen that in both cases the houses are of the cheaper class; but I think if either plan is adopted it is very desirable that the building should be erected on a stone foundation, which will involve some extra cost, also that the rough outside boarding should be covered with building felt before the clapboarding is put on. \"Plan B.\" would look better and be more comfortable, if covered with clapboarding as provided for in the specification rather than with upright boards and battens, as shown in the plan. If the Department prefers a story-and-a-half building, differently arranged, we can supply plans for the purpose. Anything further we can do to facilitate the erection of the proposed house will be cheerfully undertaken.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary of the Depart't of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 7th October, 1901.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nAs directed by the Deputy Minister Rev. Dr Sutherland was requested to submit plan and specifications for a teacher's house on the Gibson reserve, with an estimate of the proposed cost.\n\nThe accompanying plan and specifications have been received from Dr Sutherland with a builder's estimate which shows that a building constructed after plan \"A\" would cost $1253.75 with stone foundation and $1010.00 if put up on cedar posts; while one after plan \"B\" would cost $950.00 with stone foundation or $720.00 if built on posts.\n\nPlan \"B\" would I think afford sufficient accommodation and for the small number of rooms provided would have a much better appearance than if the building were a story and a half instead of the cottage style.\n\nIf the Department approves of either of these plans the Methodist Church is prepared to go on with the building under the arrangement proposed which was to wait for payment until the money is voted.\n\nI understand that they have a good schoolhouse at Gibson, which should last for a number of years.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is practically in every house where there are children. I have been at the school every day this week but there have been scholars there only two of the days, and then it was only three little boys from one family, and one of them has the cough.\n\nMy wife and baby have not been here for fear of the child getting the whooping cough, and I think I will take a few days and go to them.\n\nWill you please send a few lines to me at Alderville and let me know if you are agreeable to the school being closed next week. If you do not acquiesce in the closing of the school, I will return to the Reserve as soon as I hear from you. My address will be Alderville, Ont.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nFrank J. Joblin.\n\nP.S.

Mr. Gorman asked me for the school in June, as July last, and I told him I could not give it as I had promised it when a vacancy would occur. He knew very well the school was promised, but took a mean advantage to influence me as Agent by getting you to refuse the authority of having a teacher from here. You know it takes a teacher who will not treat them, the Indians and their children, with contempt, and I am in a position to know the sort of teacher who will treat them. To speak plain, I say Gorman girl will not treat them so, in fact she is two upstilts, she is even so with her own colour. It is a very bad sign when a teacher will not be kept more than a year in any place. Now if you refuse the authority of appointing a teacher for the school from me, it hurts me as Agent, when that fact becomes known to the Indians of course they will come to the conclusion that I have no authority on the Reserve. I hope you will be kind enough not to take the authority from me as the Inspector Mr. Scott & I will select the teacher that will suit them, when the vacancy occurs if you grant my request I will forward to Dept. a teacher's name and certificate approved of by the S.P.S.

I can say that the Teacher Miss Louisa who was teaching there, that Faith Dewald, was not very kind to her. She asked me in June last for the school for a girl of the name of Nellie. He said he wanted her there to play in the church. I told him the Indians did not want any music in their church\u2014said that I would not promise the school to him\u2014nor give it to him by itself nor he would do his best to get it for her. Now he is a man that wants schools for all the Teaching in his mission, he does not care about Teachers and if his mission wishes they get schools or not, so as he can accomplish his own ends, and I further state that it is a Male Teacher that should be there. I know it from past experience so you can see what the object is in getting a Female Teacher in the said School.\n\n[Signature]\n\nTo\n\nThe Deputy for Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I need hardly tell you how reprehensible was this act, or how much displeasure it has given to the Department. To you, as Chief, the Department must look to assist Mr. Bennett in keeping order upon the Reserve. The Agent has control of your affairs, and you, under him, must do your share in maintaining law and good government. The Department is determined to take serious notice of this breach of order on the part of the above named Indians, and unless you will hand the Agent the key of the schoolhouse at once the guilty parties will be prosecuted according to law. If you fail to do this, and if you do not show by your actions that you are willing to assist in enforcing the wishes of the Department it may be necessary to depose you from the Chieftainship, as the Department has this power if you prove your incompetency to fill the position, under Section 75 of the Indian Act.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJoe Partridge, Chief,\nGolden Lake Reserve,\nOntario.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nSir,\n\nThe information received from you verbally today that three Indians of the Golden Lake Reserve took the schoolhouse key by force from the school teacher and refused to give it up, leads the department to the opinion that serious notice should be taken of this misconduct. You should, of course, in the first instance, do all you can to arrange an amicable settlement of the affair, and to this end the department has written a letter to Chief Partridge, which you will kindly hand him. If, however, you find it impossible to arrive at a settlement, you may lay an information before the nearest magistrate, and summon these Indians for assault. If you cannot obtain possession of the key you may remove the lock from the door, and put on a new lock, in order that the school may assume its session after the holidays are over.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nEdmund Bennett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCastile,\nOntario.\nOttawa, 30th Dec., 1896.\n\nSir,\n\nThis letter has been sent.\n\nReferring to the visit of Constable H. Giroux to the Golden Lake Reserve for the purpose of endeavoring to ascertain the parties who had been selling liquor to the Indians, I would say that I think it would be advisable for him to see the Agent, Mr. Bennett, of Castile, who will give him all assistance possible. Some friction has arisen between the Agent and some of the Indians, who are the school trustees. It appears that the latter by force took the school house key from the teacher, with a view of preventing his continuing his duties and appointing another. The appointment of another has not been recommended to or approved by the Department, consequently would have no effect. The Agent is desirous that proceedings be taken against these Indians; but the Department wishes Mr. Giroux to endeavor to obtain from these Indians the key and hand it over to the Agent, and also to make an endeavor to bring about a proper feeling between the two parties. I verbally instructed him (Mr. Giroux) not to make any arrest without first reporting to the Department, as it is thought better to bring about some settlement if at all possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Sect.

Peter White, who informed me that a petition had been sent to him containing complaints against your administration of affairs. The Department is particularly anxious to avoid all friction between yourself and the Indians, and has therefore instructed the policeman who goes from here to go over to get the Indians to see the error of their conduct and give up the key and consent to abide by the decision of the Department, and not to arrest or take criminal proceedings in any way against these Indians without first referring the matter here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Supt.

The Chief expressed regret that any difficulty should have arisen. He states that it is his desire to do what is right, and for the best interests of his Indians, and that he does not wish to come into conflict with your authority in any way. He says that no force was used in obtaining the key from the school-teacher; that he was not molested in any way, and that he handed the key over quite freely. Giving these statements of the Chief their full weight, it has been deemed advisable to send an officer of the department to\n\nEdmund Bennett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCastile, Ont.\nto investigate, and endeavour to adjust the difficulty between yourself and the Indians. Accordingly, early next week you will be called upon by one of our officers, who will go into the matter carefully.\n\nWhen the Chiefs were here they were promised that a set of Rules and Regulations for the government of their Band would be drafted by the department, and submitted for their consideration, to be afterwards approved in the usual way by the Department and His Excellency in Council. Such Rules and Regulations should, it is thought, under the government of the Band less difficult, define the powers of the chief and councillors more distinctly, and render less possible the friction which at present seems to exist.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, January 9th, 1896.\n\nTHIS LETTER HAS BEEN SENT\n\nSir,\n\nI have to instruct you to proceed as soon as possible to the Golden Lake Indian Reserve. The Agent for this Reserve is Mr. Edmund Bennett, who lives at Castle, Ontario. For some time past there has been friction between the Agent and the members of the Band. This culminated a few days ago by the school trustees taking the key of the schoolhouse from the teacher and refusing to give it up to the Agent. It will be your duty to enquire into the reasons for this state of feeling upon the Reserve, with a view to accomplishing an amicable settlement of all disputes. The Indian Agent receives a very small salary, and it would be well to remember this in dealing with the questions likely to be presented to you, as the Department can hardly expect the Agent to devote his whole time and attention to the affairs of the Indians for such a small annual remuneration. It should also be your care to enquire into the sale of intoxicants upon the Reserve, and if you find that liquor is furnished to the Indians you should endeavour to find out the guilty parties. It might be advisable to deal with any cases of intoxication that might, perchance, come under your notice, but your action throughout this inspection and investigation should be directed to allay any cause of irritation.\n\nJ. A. Ince, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nand Reserves,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nirritation between the Agent and the Indians, and\nto promote a more cordial feeling between them.\n\nThe Department promised the Chief that a set of\nRegulations would be prepared and submitted to the\nBand for adoption. They are enclosed herewith, and\nyou will kindly discuss them with the Agent and the\nChiefs, in order that they may thoroughly understand\ntheir application before adopting them for the govern-\nment of the Band. Departmental File No. 169,663 is\nalso enclosed herewith; it contains a petition from\nthe Indians with reference to the grievances which\nyou are to inquire into.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nPROPOSED REGULATIONS IN RE SCHOOL TRUSTEES.\n\nRESOLVED:\n\nThat there shall be elected for three years in the same manner as is provided for the election of Chiefs (Section 75 of the Indian Act) three school trustees;\n\nThat in the case of a vacancy occurring by death, resignation, or otherwise, it shall be filled by election of another trustee or trustees for the unexpired portion of the three year term at the time current;\n\nThat the duties of the school trustees shall be,\n\n1.

There would be no quality about the school, the other $500 should go to the Agent to be honest about it salaries, these boys to get Third Class Teacher for $200 any number, as that is the general wages for teachers in this part, so I would ask you as a special favor to leave O'Brien in for the next half year, to let the Indians & others see they cannot boss me.\n\nI am Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\nE.

In connection therewith I beg to inform you that Mr. Mackie, who was referred to, took charge of the Indian School at Golden Lake last November. He has not been able to fill the position by the Agent and recommended by the school inspectors. He succeeded Miss Wilson, who was dismissed shortly after his appointment. A letter was received from the Rev. J. Lowdall, requesting that he be placed under a female teacher who would be willing to give the Indian children the motherly care they so badly need. Father Lowdall was informed that before the opening of his letter a teacher had been appointed, but in the event of a vacancy being created, the Department would prefer to find the substitute as to the suitability of the female teacher. The Indians objected to Mr. Mackie and went so far at one time as to prevent him entering the school. In July last Chief Joseph Partridge informed the Department that he is a good man.\n\nAvise atten. Septr 24th 1895 - 18 -\n\nGeorge - 17 -\nMen 1896 - 12 -\nJewel - 12 -\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department felt that owing to the position of the Indians it was not desirable to continue Mr. Bird in the position and that if the school was to be made a benefit to the band it would be necessary to employ the person whom the Indians desired as a teacher providing that she had the necessary qualifications. The Chief was accordingly told that Miss Bird should forward through the Agent to the Department any testimonials and certificates which she had. Miss Bird's certificate of qualification was accordingly forwarded to the Department together with testimonials from the Rev. Father Smith and Inspector Scott, or Bonfrew. These were satisfactory and Miss Bird was engaged her duties as teacher to begin on the 14th instant. Her salary is placed at $250 a year. She has been paid Mr. O'Brien.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHon.

The Chief states that the Indians are not sending their children to the school because of Mr. O'Brien's incumbency of the position of Teacher, and will not do so while they feel that their wishes, which have for so long and so respectfully been represented, are, as the Indians feel, completely set at naught by the Department. He again respectfully begs that the situation may be changed, and that a Teacher satisfactory to the Indians may be appointed.\n\nTo compose the difficulty which arose between these Indians and their Agent over this matter of a Teacher, the Department early in the year adopted a suggestion made by its Inspector, who was sent to inquire into the matter, which was that the Agent's nominee should be removed after due notice, and that a female Teacher (which is what the Indians want, and what, as they say, their Priest desires them to have) should be appointed. Such appointment would not at that time necessarily have been given to Miss Dunne, the Indians' nominee, and a compromise which\nwhich would have been a sufficient support to the Agent, and at once have sufficiently reasoned and sufficiently satisfied the Indians would have been effected.\n\nThe Indians now again request Mr. O'Brien's removal, and the appointment of a female Teacher.\n\nThe Department considers that the action of the Agent has not been dictated by a wise, tactful, and conciliatory spirit, and that the present cessation of education on the Reserve is largely due thereto, and thinks that the maintenance of Mr. O'Brien in the position would not only cause further difficulty in educational matters, but tend to increase the friction which unhappily exists between Mr. Indian Agent Bennett and the Indians under his charge. It is therefore strongly of the opinion that Mr. O'Brien's services should be dispensed with at the expiration of the term for which it is stated he has been engaged, that is to say, on the 31st of October next; and that a female Teacher, preferably Miss Dunne, who is reported to be capable, and who has suffered innocently in the matter, and whose lawyers\u2014it may be mentioned\u2014are making demands for past salary, be appointed in his stead; and the Department recommends that this course should be decided upon, and the intention to pursue it be at once communicated to the Indians, in order to set at rest the uneasiness now prevalent amongst them.\n\nWill you be kind enough to intimate what steps you desire should ensue upon the representations of the Indian deputation referred to?\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nDept Indian Affairs,\nSept 16th, 1896.\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE ACTING SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL OF INDIAN AFFAIRS.\n\nTouching the continuance of Mr. O'Brien in the position of Teacher of the Golden Lake School, the undersigned has the honour to inform you that the chief of the Golden Lake Band, accompanied by one of his Headmen, visited this Department yesterday to protest against the recent action of the Department in the matter, which, as you may remember, was to displace a Teacher (Miss Dunne) satisfactory to the Indians, and to replace her by one unsatisfactory to them (Mr. O'Brien).

Mackay to the Premier, and which you sent me today. In connection therewith I beg to inform you that Mr. O'Brien, who is referred to, took charge of the Indian School at Golden Lake last November. He was nominated for the position by the Agent and recommended by the School Inspector. He succeeded Miss Quinn, who resigned. Shortly after Mr. O'Brien's appointment a letter was received from the Rev. P.J. Dowdall, of Eganville, suggesting that the school should be put under a female teacher who would be more apt to give the Indian children the motherly training they so needed. Father Dowdall was informed that before the receipt of his letter a teacher had been appointed, but that in the event of a vacancy again occurring the Department would bear in mind his suggestion as to the advisability of engaging a female teacher. The Indians objected to Mr. O'Brien, and went so far at one time as to prevent his entering the school. In July last Chief Joseph Partridge informed the Department that at a general\nmeeting the Indians enquired why Miss Sophia Dunn, the teacher engaged by them the previous winter, had not been appointed. The Department felt that owing to the opposition of the Indians it was not desirable to continue Mr. O'Brien in the position and that if the school was to be made a benefit to the band it would be necessary to employ the person whom the Indians desired as a teacher, providing that she had the necessary qualifications. The Chief was accordingly told that Miss Dunn should forward through the Agent to the Department any testimonials and certificates which she had. Miss Dunn's certificate of qualification was accordingly forwarded to the Department, together with testimonials from the Rev. Father Chain and Mr. Inspector Scott, of Renfrew. These were satisfactory and Miss Dunn was engaged, her duties as teacher to begin on the 24th instant. Her salary is placed at $250 a year, $50 less than was paid Mr. O'Brien.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHon. R.W.

Reed, \nof Indian Affairs Ottawa, he says it has been requested \nthat Mr. O'Brien was engaged as teacher for one year, which \nwill not expire until 31st October, and then to notify \nthe Dept. I would ask you favour to leave him in \nthe said Indian School until the last of December, as it \nwould be unjust to turn him out then, now Dept. had \nclaimed that the Dept. was not cognizant of the teacher being engaged \nfor a year, your wise see by letter from Dept. to me dated \n31st Oct. 1895, No. 152205, where the Dept. approved of Mr. \nO'Brien's certificate and appointed him to take charge of \nthe school, more than would be no trouble about the teacher \nonly for Inspector McLean, who visited the Reserve on Jan 11th 1896 \nat first there was no fault with O'Brien, but when making his report \nhe did not visit, but it was plain to be seen that it was \nfrom his own fault, he was favoring. Your wise see by \nletter to me from Dept. January 22nd 1896 No. 167-863 where he \nrecommended the teacher's engagement should terminate on 31st March 96 \nalso in same letter to me the Dept. says I would not be limited to \nengage Miss Dunn, the teacher whom I am instructed was trying \nto get in the school, as this would be too great a concession to grant \nto Indians, (they were doing their best to get him in to the school to please sanction) \nwho attempted to usurp functions as regards the appointment of teachers \nwhich the Dept. reserves to itself alone the right to exercise \nin my letter to the Dept. 2nd inst. I called his attention \nto that part of the letter above mentioned, but it appears it was no use, \nas the Dept. notified me to notify Miss Dunn to take charge of the \nschool on the 24th inst.

The school is in a much better condition at present than it has been for some time, and by changing teachers now, this work would be undone, as it really takes a new teacher one year to become thoroughly acquainted with the manners and customs of the Indian children, and it is very difficult to teach them anything.\nuntil you understand their peculiarities.\n\nIf the Department appreciate my work here, and wish me to remain, I think they should give me One Hundred dollars of an increase. It is only for one year that I ask this. I do kindly do as you promised and put in a good plea by my behalf.

The reports received from the Separate School Inspector are very satisfactory. In the last he stated that this is one of the best Indian schools in his inspectorate, which is a large one.\n\nI visited the school last Spring and you will recollect that my report was very favourable.

It is also known to the Department that this teacher takes an active interest in the general welfare of her pupils. The last quarter return shows an enrolment of 31, with an average attendance of 20, which is very high for an Indian school.

I would recommend that someone be appointed truant officer with a small salary which I think would be money well spent, to try to have the children attend more regularly.\n\nThere is no well on the school property and the water has to be taken from the river about 300 yards from the school, and the teacher informed me that they could not use it in the warm weather as there are a number of summer cottages just above, and during the warm weather the shore is lined with campers who dispose of all their sewage in the river. I would recommend that a well be dug this winter as the soil is of a sandy nature and could be done more easily in cold weather.\n\nThe ground is unfir for garden purposes as the only vegetables that could be raised were potatoes of which twelve bags remain in the school house cellar.

She has also received the bonus at the rate of $150.00 from the date she began duties. She has an Ontario Second Class Certificate and had previous experience in white schools.

The enrolment is 29, with an average of about 13.\n\nMiss Currier asks that a salary be granted her at the rate of at least $720.00 a year.

I saw in the paper where the pay was to have been mailed in July, but so far I have not received any cheque for\nwhich would have amounted to eighty-five dollars.\n\nSome time ago I applied for a higher salary and received an answer that no higher salary could be given to me as I was receiving at the rate of seven hundred and fifty dollars a year counting salary and bonus. Surely this is not a sufficient salary for a teacher, as normal students who attended during the last year were told not to accept any less than nine hundred dollars, and so far they have been successful in getting that amount.\n\nEven the Public School teacher in Golden Lake is to receive nine hundred dollars for the coming year.\n\nSurely when all this is taken into consideration, not forgetting the high cost of living there should be\nno trouble for me to receive what should be coming to me.\n\nKindly answer and let me know if I am to receive the back pay.\n\nRemain,\n\nYours truly,\nJosephine Carrier,\nEganville\nOnt.\nTeacher of Indian School.\nOttawa, August 13, 1920.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant in regard to the amount of salary and bonus which you are receiving as teacher of the Golden Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that all teachers in Indian day schools are being allowed a bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum for the current fiscal year and a cheque for the amount due you at this rate for the June quarter, last, has been sent you. You have also been sent your cheque for your salary for the June quarter and there is, therefore, no balance of salary or bonus due you.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to grant you any increase in your salary, as it is considered that the total salary and bonus of $750.00 per annum which you receive compares favourably with the salaries allowed to the teachers in the rural schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

I took the spelling lesson. They had around seven words to spell, which were taken out of his Reading lesson. He had them all wrong but one, although the other pupil in the same class and only about half his age had...\nno mistakes. I told him to take a seat nearer the front, as I felt he wasn't paying as much attention to his work at back, where he had been sitting, as he should. He went to the back seat, making no move to change. I told him again, but he just sat there. At last I went down to him and asked him again, but no answer. I tried to get him out of his seat but I couldn't move him. When trying to get him out of seat, he drew out his fist, in a terrible temper, hit my eye-glasses, broke them, and they cut me under the eye. Luckily I didn't get any glass in my eye, as far as I can see. He went home and told his father, the reason he\ncame home was, one of the children at school was teasing him.\n\nI had to send my glasses to Sutherland and Parkins, Ottawa, where I expect it will cost me six -- $50 Dollars.\n\nNow Mr. Hoey don't you think, a boy, with a temper like that, deserves some special punishment, as he is a bad example to other pupils?\n\nTrusting you will be able to do something. Thanking you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJosephine Carrier,\nTeacher Indian Day School,\nGolden Lake, Ont.\nGolden Lake Ont. March 27th, 1939\n\nSecretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear sir,\n\nI enclose herewith attached a letter from Miss Currier the teacher at the Golden Lake Indian Day school. In her letter Miss Currier reports an incident that happened there on March 23rd. I must say that this family are inclined to be undisciplined, as this boy was up in court last fall before Magistrate MacGregor for attempting to steal goods from Mr Bernards store. He received a suspended sentence. However I am at a loss to know what I can do about the situation other than to suggest the boys removal to a residential school where no doubt the boy would be under a stricter teacher.\n\nI received tuition from Miss Currie myself and she appeared to me to know her work, but uses the method of coaxing the children along rather than driving them, of course a very strict teacher would run into a lot of difficulty. I think Miss Curriers letter is self explanatory.\nI might add that when the father of this boy was informed of the boy's actions he claimed to have administered a sound thrashing.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 31, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 27th instant with reference to Percy Jocko.\n\nIt is noted that this boy is only in Grade II although he is 13 years of age. This suggests that he may be subnormal.\n\nPlease have him carefully examined by the local Medical Officer and submit the report for our consideration. It may be possible to arrange to have this boy placed in the Industrial School at Alfred, Ont.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. M.

So I may lay claim to knowing the Indians fairly well. The choice of a teacher there is a very important thing. The teacher must be a good disciplinarian, yet one with inexhaustible patience. The teacher there has always helped in the church as organist. This is also an advantage to the pupils in the preparation of concerts, etc. In fine, she must be one willing and able to co-operate with the priests so that the children's training will be thorough.\n\nI have known Mrs. George seven years. I think she is of the right age, disposition, and character to fill this position.\n\nI am, yours respectfully,\n\nRev. T.C. May.\n\n[Signature]\nRev. T.C. May, assistant to Rt. Rev. J.A. French, P.M., Parish Priest\nPerfum Oct. July 1922.\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nThis certificate that Miss Mary C. Kelly has taught for the past two years in a rural school in my Inspectorate.\n\nMiss Kelly is a capable teacher, diligent and painstaking in her work. She is a young lady of good moral character and will do her best to succeed in any position she may take.\n\nG. G. McNab.\nCreighton Mine, Ont.\nJune 15, 1926\n\nTo whom it may concern:\nThis is to certify that Miss Mary Kelly has taught in the Creighton Mine Public School for the past six months teaching Third Class work and substituting for the teacher of that form who has had a leave of absence during that time. I regret that she shall have no vacancy on the staff for the following year where Miss Kelly might be placed.\n\nThis young lady is a splendid disciplinarian, a bright and energetic teacher and very thorough in her work. It is my opinion she would be a splendid acquisition for any staff.\n\nFaithfully yours,\nH. M. Black\nPrincipal of Public School.\nBrockville May 1, 1925\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nI take this opportunity of recommending to you Mary C. Kelly, a very able and well qualified school teacher. She has taught in the Brockville Separate School during the past three years and I have found her a conscientious hard worker, willing to make any sacrifice for the advancement of the pupils under her charge, prompt in attending to her duties as teacher and very considerate to the parents of the pupils.\n\nI have always found her agreeable and kind, ready to take her part in any social or welfare work in the town as well as attending to her duties as teacher.\n\nB.

Mrs. George continues to impress one most favourably as a competent teacher, and one taking a keen interest in the students under her care. Attendance has not been good since school opened and of 27 on roll the average attendance is only 17. The homes of the children not attending regularly were visited and the parents warned. Seymour Jocko promised to have his two children attend regularly. Mrs. Peter Meness also promised her two children would attend. Peter Jocko has a very small child at school only five years of age. As this child is too young to grasp any knowledge Mrs. Jocko was visited and advised to keep the child at home another year. Seven windows in the basement are broken. Matthew Barnard the caretaker, was instructed to have them replaced forthwith.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nDuring the last two years Mrs. Mary George has been the teacher in the Indian School at Golden Lake\u2014a mission of my period. She has done splendid work with the children.\n\nShe finds the salary inadequate and has been offered a salary in the government at a much better salary. Surely when teachers are so scarce the department could give her a salary at least $1000. It would be too bad to see her go, if her services could be retained at that salary.\n\nIf she remains cured she will be allowed to teach in September and take the month of January.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6133, File 394-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAs we have done for the last two years. Last year some difficulty was made by the department because she did this. It is much easier to get the children out to school in September than it is in January.\n\nTrusting that you will be able to do something to help to retain her services,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nW.P. Brear, C.P.\nOttawa,\nJuly 31, 1942.\n\nDear Father Breen:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 27th instant, with reference to Mrs. Mary George, teacher of the Golden Lake Indian Day School. Very careful consideration has been given to your suggestion that this teacher receive an increase in salary, but I regret that such action is not possible. At the present time Mrs. George is being paid $90.00 a teaching month, plus bonus of 11$. This compares very favourably with salaries paid at other Indian day schools throughout the Province. It is true that the academic year is only nine months, but this cannot be avoided at present, due to the fact that our appropriation has been reduced owing to the very heavy financial demands occasioned by the war. If Mrs. George decides to remain, we would be prepared to allow her to open the school in September and close during the month of January. I think you will agree that it is only fair to all parties concerned for Mrs. George to decide immediately whether or not she intends to teach next year. If she does not teach, we will have to endeavour to secure another teacher and we should be in a position to take action in the near future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

George\n(teacher - Golden Lake Indian Day School)\nAddress - Box 118\nEganville, Ont.\nOttawa, September 16, 1942.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 15th instant in which you intimate that you have been offered a position by the Civil Service Commission, which is likely to be much more remunerative than the position you now occupy.\n\nI note from the records here that you were granted permission to teach in September. This means that your successor, when we secure one, will receive compensation for only an 8 month teaching period. In view of all the circumstances, I am accepting your resignation, on the understanding that your services at the school will terminate on Friday September 18. This will enable you to take up your position with the Civil Service Commission almost immediately. It will also enable us to offer a new teacher a longer teaching period.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMrs. Mary C. George,\nBox 118,\nEganville, Ont.\nOttawa, September 16, 1942.\n\nDear Miss Gallant:\n\nI am today in receipt of the resignation of the teacher who has been for a number of years in charge of the Indian day school at Golden Lake, Ontario.\n\nGolden Lake is approximately 100 miles due west of Ottawa. If you are interested in this school, we would be glad to offer it to you. The salary is $90.00 per teaching month, plus 17% cost-of-living bonus.\n\nThere is not a teacher's residence on this reserve, but I have been informed that you will experience no difficulty in securing a suitable boarding house. It is just possible that the Indian Agent might be prepared to provide you with board and room.\n\nAn immediate reply to this communication would be very much appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

George, in which she states that she has been offered an appointment by the Civil Service Commission. Mrs. George has been informed that her resignation is accepted, on the understanding that her services at the school will terminate on Friday September 18. She should therefore be paid from September 1 to September 18, and no further payment should be made to her.\n\nYou will be informed when a successor is appointed to Mrs. George.\n\nR. A.

I should appreciate your advising the name of the Department by which you are employed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMrs. Mary C. George,\n259 Isabella St.,\nPembroke, Ont.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nI am now employed by the Unemployment Insurance Commission. I was not sure whether or not my superannuation while teaching at Golden Lake was taken care of by the Teacher's Superannuation Fund by the Civil Service. I take it for granted it is held by the Civil Service and that it will be paid at the expiration of my employment with that body.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMary C. George.\nOttawa,\nNovember 9, 1942.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have your recent letter in which you advise that you are employed by the Unemployment Insurance Commission. As you are still in the employ of the Government, the amount to your credit in the superannuation fund will be retained.

McDonald, Esq., Acting Chief of Personnel,\nUnemployment Insurance Commission, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Mrs. Mary Catherine George\n\nWith reference to letter of March 23, 1943, I have to advise you that Mrs. George was employed as a School Teacher at the Golden Lake Indian Reserve from September 1, 1940, to September 18, 1942.\n\nAs Civil Service Leave Regulations did not apply during her period of service as School Teacher, she did not accumulate any leave credits during this period.\n\nSgd.

Please find attached a letter from Dr. MacKinnon of Renfrew Ont., explaining Miss McNulty's reason for not teaching this last two weeks.\n\nWould it be possible for you to forward some Indian Day School Report forms (Form No. I.A. 409) to me as the forms that were at the school seem to have been misplaced and the teacher will need them for the quarter ending March 31st. Thanking you I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. P. Ruddy,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 18, 1944.\n\nDear Miss MacNulty:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of October 14 and have noted with interest the statements contained therein.\n\nMay I state without hesitation that you are wholly in error when you state:\n\n\"I feel that as all your teachers have free quarters the Department should pay my room rent.\"\n\nI can think of dozens of schools in Ontario and in the West where no accommodation whatever is provided for Indian day school teachers. I am not suggesting by any means that this is an ideal condition. I am simply submitting it as a statement of fact. Then, too, it does seem somewhat strange to me that these demands for additional accommodation should reach us at a time when this Nation is fighting for its very existence and when there appears to be an acute shortage of building materials and skilled construction workers.\n\nMay I point out also that Indian day school teachers and Civil Servants in the lower salary brackets qualify for the cost-of-living bonus. This bonus is not paid, however, to a great many Civil Servants whose salaries are a little higher and who have without protest accepted the higher cost of living as a patriotic duty. However, in view of all the circumstances, I am recommending that your salary be increased by $5.00 per month. It is my hope that this action on my part will prove satisfactory to you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hosy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss M. MacNulty,\nTeacher, Indian Day School,\nGolden Lake, Ontario.\nOttawa, October 18, 1944.\n\nMr. H. P. Ruddy, Indian Agent, Golden Lake, Ont.\n\nThe Department has decided to grant an increase in salary to Miss M. MacNulty, teacher of the Golden Lake Indian Day School. Her salary will be at the rate of $100.00 per teaching month - an increase of $5.00 - effective October 1, 1944.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\nMemorandum\u2014\n\nAt the time of my visits to Golden Lake during the past year I have received many complaints from Indian women against the teacher Miss M. MacNulty.\n\nAt first I was of the opinion that as the complaints were of a trivial nature that through time they would correct themselves. This, however, is not the case. It appears that Miss MacNulty has aggravated conditions by discussing the family affairs amongst the children during class hours. The agent states that she was especially nasty to Mrs. J. Lavalley, and just before school closed it took him all of a week to iron out their differences. Mrs. Lavalley at the time was threatening to leave the reserve. This, in my opinion, would be serious as Mrs. Lavalley has been very actively engaged working among members of the Homemaker's Club assisting and advising Indian women in the improvement of their homes, gardens, care of chickens, remodelling clothing, etc.\n\nI hesitated to investigate these minor complaints as I felt that they would be magnified way out of proportion. I am convinced, however, in spite of the good classroom work being accomplished by Miss MacNulty, that in the interests of the Golden Lake Indians her services as teacher there should not be continued for another term.\n\nI would recommend that an effort be made to obtain another teacher.\n\nJ. E. Morris,\nWelfare Division.\nOttawa, August 3rd, 1945.\n\nMr. H.P. Ruddy, Indian Agent, Golden Lake, Ontario,\n\nIt has been decided to dispense with the services of Miss MacNulty as teacher of the Golden Lake Indian Day School.\n\nI enclose a letter addressed to her notifying her of our decision. We would have mailed it direct to her but I am not certain whether or not she is living at Golden Lake for the summer or if she is at home in Renfrew. Please address the letter to wherever she is living so that she may get the letter as soon as possible. It will be necessary for you to pay the postage on the envelope.\n\nIt may be difficult to secure another teacher by September 1st but if we receive any applications I will let you know. However, you should make immediate inquiries from the neighbouring Parish Priests with a view to ascertaining if they know of any teacher who might be interested in this school. We are prepared to allow a qualified teacher $100.00 a teaching month plus bonus of seventeen percent. As you know five percent of the basic salary or $5.00 a month is deducted and placed in the Retirement Fund. This amount is returned with interest when the teacher gives up duties in an Indian school. There is, of course, the usual deductions for Income Tax but the rate of deduction for this tax is the same in a White school as it is in an Indian school. If you hear of any teacher whose services can be secured you should advise this office immediately.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nGolden Lake, Ont.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nApril 25, 1946.\n\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Engagement of Golden Lake Indian Day School.\n\nI wish to inform you that we now have thirty-nine pupils attending the Golden Lake Indian Day School. To accommodate this number of pupils we are utilizing every bit of space in the classroom. The extra number of pupils who have recently entered the school are children of families who were living away from the Reserve during the war years, and have now moved back. There is a possibility that more families will move back to the Reserve in the near future.\n\nTaking these families into consideration along with the children now on the Reserve who will be old enough to start school in the autumn, I find that we will have an enrolment of between forty-five and fifty in the school before any of the present pupils have either reached the age of sixteen or passed their entrance. Therefore the present school will have to be enlarged to two rooms to accommodate this many. I would suggest that an official from the Training Division visit this Agency in the near future to inspect the school and see what can be done with regard to an additional classroom.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. P. Ruddy,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 29, 1946.\n\nMr. H. P. Ruddy, Indian Agent,\nGolden Lake, Ontario.\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, with reference to the Golden Lake Indian Day School.\n\nOwing to the present policy of encouraging the erection of private homes, our public building program has been somewhat curtailed this year. No provision was made in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1946-47 for an addition to the Golden Lake School.\n\nDo you expect that the maximum number of 50 children, mentioned in your letter, will desire to attend the school for the academic year 1946-47, which opens on September 1?\n\nIf a second classroom is definitely needed for the next academic year, would it be possible to rent a building on the Golden Lake Reserve? I realize that such a building might not be exactly suitable, but it might serve the purpose for a year or so, until the necessary addition can be erected. I would be pleased to hear from you further.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nGolden Lake, Ont.\n\nMay 7th, 1946.\n\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRe: GOLDEN LAKE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nI acknowledge your letter of April 29th, last, with regard to a second classroom in the Golden Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIn answer I wish to inform you that we will definitely have 44 pupils in the school for the academic year 1946-47. In addition to this number it is quite possible that Indian families, who have been living away from the Reserve during the War years, may move back. If this happens then our school attendance may reach well over the fifty mark. This sudden increase in the number of pupils attending this school is partially due to the Family Allowance regulations which says that a child has to start school at six years of age when formerly Indian children started when they were seven or eight years old. Also as I stated in my previous letter a number of Indian families have moved back to their homes on the Reserve. This increase was unforeseen when making the estimates for 1946-47. The classroom now in this school normally holds about twenty-seven pupils but by using chairs and tables and every inch of available space we have an attendance of thirty-nine.\n\nIn your letter you suggested that a building be rented, on the Reserve, which could be used as a classroom for the coming year. With regard to this I wish to inform you that all available buildings are being used as homes and with the exception of the Community hall and storehouse (which we intend to complete this summer) there is no other building which we could use. By raising the roof on the present school a second classroom might be built above at less cost than building a new wing; also save cost in heating. However I would like to have an official of the Training Division visit the school before making any recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.F.

I would also ask the Department to specify the qualifications required of this assistant teacher, the salary and etc.\n\nTeachers are rather scarce around this part of the country at present so I would ask for an early reply so that this ad could be inserted as soon as possible.

Ruddy, Indian Agent,\nGolden Lake, Ontario,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant, regarding a second teacher for the Golden Lake Indian Day School, you may offer the same salary as paid the present teacher, namely, $100.00 a teaching month plus bonus.\n\nYou have authority to insert advertisements in the local newspapers. The bill can then be forwarded to us, attached to vouchers.\n\nYou should try to obtain the services of a certificated teacher, preferably one holding a second class certificate or better. A personal interview will enable you to select the teacher you want and one able to get along with Miss Legris. A teacher with experience is preferable, but a Normal School graduate will often compensate with zeal and eagerness her lack of experience.\n\nBernard F.

This is in payment for the September quarter for teaching in the school.\n\nThe amount I should have received was One hundred and eighty-seven dollars. My year in the first class started from Sept. 1st and I was to receive a salary $750 per annum paid.\nquarterly at the rate of $187.50 every three months. I have not received all my salary for last year, I am still minus of $187.50. All the other teachers around here are receiving $900 surely the Government cannot afford to pay $900 without at least pay what is coming to the teacher.\n\nKindly look into this matter as soon as possible.\n\nAnd oblige,\n\nMiss Josephine Carrier,\nGolden Lake,\nOntario,\nTeacher.\nOttawa, October 18, 1923.\n\nENCLOSURE.\n\nMadam,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the amount of salary sent you for the month of September.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it has been decided to pay the salaries of day school teachers, in future, on the basis of ten teaching months in the school year. In this connection I enclose for your information copy of circular letter of the 17th ultimo, which was forwarded to all Indian agents and teachers.\n\nYour salary is at the rate of $750.00 a year, plus bonus. The amount, therefore, due you for September was 1/10 of $750.00, or, $75.00. At the end of the other quarters in the school year, you will be paid $225.00, plus the bonus in each case.\n\nThe Department cannot understand the statement that there is a balance of salary due you for last year. On looking up the payments made to you it is found that you were paid as follows:\n\n| Quarter       | Year | Amount   |\n|---------------|------|----------|\n| September     | 1922 | $187.50  |\n| December      | 1922 | $187.50  |\n| March         | 1923 | $187.50  |\n| June          | 1923 | $187.50  |\n\nTotal: $750.00\n\nYou were also paid for the period September 1, 1922, to June 30, 1923, a bonus amounting to $150.00.\n\nMiss Josephine Currier,\nGolden Lake,\nONT.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I was not paid for July and Aug 1919 showing that the twelve months ended with Oct 31st 1920. Also I am not receiving my full pay for the whole year.\n\nSince you are paying the salary at a different rate this year, the cheques I have just received pay for Sept. and I have still to be paid for July and August of last year, sixty-two and a half dollars for each month.\nmaking it One hundred and twenty-five Dollars still coming to me.\n\nHoping you will look into this affair as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMiss Josephine Carrier,\nGolden Lake,\nOntario.\n\nTeacher.\nGolden Lake\n\nSalary $600 yr\n\nSupp yr 1919 = $63.00\n\nDec yr 1919 = $15.00\n\nMar yr 1920 = $15.00\n\nJune yr 1920 = $15.00\n\nTotal $513.00\n\nSalary = $600\n\nCash paid = $513\n\nBal. due = $87\n\nMrs. Annie Lynn\ndated Sep 01/29\nProvince of ONTARIO\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTEACHERS' SALARIES\n\nSCHOOL YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1920\n\n| NAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | Annual Grant or Salary | Amount due | Address to which Cheque is to be sent |\n|-----------------|---------------|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Josephine Currier | GOLDEN LAKE   | $600.00                |            |                                      |\n\nAmount paid ........ $513.00\nBalance due ....... $87.00\n\nTeacher,\nGolden Lake,\nONT.\n\nNo. of school days in quarter\nNo. days school was open\nNo. holidays\nGrant asked for\n\nRemarks:\n\nMiss Currier began duties at this school September 1, 1919, at salary of $600.00 per annum.

At time she consulted me I noticed her in a very nervous condition. I drew her attention to the fact that she had absorption in her system due to pyorrhea condition surrounding many of her teeth. She then told me she was under medical treatment & was unable to open up her school when school reopened. I advised her to consult Dr. Copeland & see if he would verify my statement. He found her condition required immediate attention which she consulted too. I believe it nothing a splendid recovery. No doubt her absence from teaching was unavoidable under her condition at that time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.G. Lambertino D.D.S.\nNovember 8/30\n\nThis is to certify that I attended Miss J.

That the present one is very uncomfortable and is so decayed that he doubts if it would stand repairing. Mr. Bennett confirms the inspector's report and says that the building is about the meanest and worst in the country for a school house. The blackboard was reported by Mr. Scott to be a poor article, but although Mr. Bennett was not instructed to purchase a new one he has evidently done so judging from the closing remarks of his letter. As regards the school material needed Mr. Bennett was requested to make list for what was required, but he has not yet done so.

I don't think he would be able to build the school House according to plan, the rest of the Indians think the same, they are very anxious that it should be built according to plan, I think it would be better to hire a competent man and let the Indian work with him, it is a pity if the job is not well done, but if I get authority from the Dept I will see that it is done according to plan.\n\nE. Bennett\nIndian Agent\nI was at the Indian Line 7th and asked some of the Indians such as was at home if they would come on the 23rd in case the $200 would not be enough to finish the School House. They would like to know if it would be paid back by the Department if they did use some of it. There is one of the Indians a Carpenter. I showed him the plans he says he can build the house according to said plan but I doubt if the wages he wants per day is one dollar & 50\u00a2. I went around himself & was enquiring at the saw mill if all the lumber was cut for said school house and I was told that only the Scantling Sills and rough lumber was cut, there is no shingles cut, no clapboards or finishing lumber. I don't think it can be got on the River as there is no green pine only dead and very fine. I want to know if the Department will pay for cutting what lumber is cut as the mill owner seems to hold me responsible for what is cut. The difference between the stone foundation and blocks would be about $15.00 there is no use in depending on some of the Indians to do any work. Some are good and willing to do their share and more if then will do nothing, they promised me faithfully they would get out all the logs for the lumber.\nLet me know if I will go ahead or try to with the school house.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nC.

Agent Bennett says that only a portion of the lumber is paid for and the cost of the sawing not paid for and that the Indians have failed to supply raw logs as they promised.\n\nA new school building appears to be a necessity, and only \u00a3200 has been voted for its erection. In view of Mr. Bennett's statement it is probable that the cost will exceed \u00a3200.\n\nI respectfully recommend that Agent Allen be instructed to endeavour to obtain a resolution from the Ind. Council to the effect that their funds may be drawn upon in case the sum of \u00a3200 is not sufficient. He should explain to them that no promise can be made them of repayment, and that if they had done all they reasonably could...\nin the way of providing\nnew logs, the $200 would\nprobably have been sufficient\nto complete the building.\n\nWhen the resolution\nof the Council is forwarded\nto the Dept., instructions will\nbe given to Mr. Bennett to\nproceed with the work.\n\nSam Evans\nJune 17, 1893\n\nSir,\n\nReference to your letter of the 8th inst. and the statements therein made to the effect that only a portion of the lumber reqd for the proposed new school house on the Golden Lake Reserve has been saved (the saving nothing paid for) & that the Indians have failed to supply same as they promised, I beg to state that that the building which certainly appears to be a necessity, will\nwill, in view of the condition of affairs reported by you, probably cost more than the $200.00 voted for the purpose.\n\nYou should therefore endeavor to obtain from the Indian Council a Resolution authorizing the Dept. to draw upon their funds in case the $200.00 is not sufficient, at the same time explaining to them that no promise of repayment can be made, but that if they had done all they could reasonably have been expected to do in the way of providing saw logs, the $200.00 would probably have been sufficient to complete the building.\n\nUpon receipt of such Resolution further instructions in the matter will be given you.\nSaskatchewan, July 6th, 1893\n\nIn reply to yours of June 17th,\n\nNo. 133847 I visited the Indians at the Golden Lake Reserve on 4th inst., as I was told the most of them was away before the 4th.

Bruce\nI was at the Gold Lake Reserve today, the 21st of September, 1855.\n\nI was speaking to a German Carpenter who lives about half a mile from the Reserve. He says he will build a schoolhouse for $200 if the Department will supply the paint and oil and foundation. I showed him the plan; he is a good Carpenter and a good responsible man, so I am well acquainted with him. In my opinion, it would be cheaper to give him the contract to finish the schoolhouse than to build it by days' labour. He says that in the carpentry trade it is figured that two men can make anything like good wages at it.\n\nI am to commence on the 23rd of October to build the foundation for the schoolhouse. Please let me know immediately if I will give him the contract or build by days' labour.\n\nI am his friend,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor the Deputy for the said\n\nIndian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nI want to know if I will be allowed to give timber & vacant lots on the Reserve to Mr. Parsons for lumber supplied for building the School House at Pelly Lake Reserve. The Indians promised in the beginning to get out dogs the winter to pay for the lumber, but I will not depend on this word, as they promised to help to build it, but all the work I could get out of them was one day from ten of them. If I gave them their dinner that day, they were lumber to build the School House and I had to go with my team and Wagon and draw it; the only Indian who is willing to do any work for the teams is Lee Partidge, but they elected another Chief this fall a young man. I am sorry Lee Partidge is not Chief as he and I get along well, as he was willing to help the Indians and me, it was because we the Cause of it; I wish a Chief be appointed Chief from Ottawa the new School House will be finished and ready for the teachers at the new year. I paid it twice a week, Mr. Buteff the Carpenter is a hard working man, he is to get two dollars a day and board himself and he is worth it. The floor is built, the house is well underpinned with stone finished there is only the to finish doors & Windows to finish the building unless paint which can be done in the spring. I thought it would be better to finish the work in a hurry, so to pay rent for the winter would be twenty dollars.\n\nFor the Chief for sale land of Indian Affairs Ottawa\n\nJ.

This came into my mind when I was wondering what we would otherwise have to pay for the lumber.\n\nThe sale to Mr. Chief must have been illegal as it was not held under the authority of the Office of the Receiver General, as Mr. Stewart informed me, before.\nReported to the Office Agent Amosk\nfor your further consideration\n\n14/11/93\nE.

McLean\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear sir,\n\nRe school house at Golden Lake.\n\nIn laying out the piers in the basement and the flue I could not see where you intended to enter the smoke pipe from the furnace into the flue, as the running beam rests on a pier in the centre of the flue in which place I think the smoke pipe should enter. Thinking that this is an oversight of your draftsman I instructed the contractors to put the running beam out of the centre enough to allow the smoke pipe to enter the chimney. Kindly look into the matter and let me know at once if this is all right. When your Mr. McKenzie was here some days ago he was showing me where he intended to build a drain from the basement of the school house and as the contractor have quite a few men there at present I think that the present would be the cheapest time to build this drain. The drain will be one hundred and eighty-five feet long on an average of about four feet deep and layed with six inch salt glazed sewer tile and would cost in the neighborhood of two hundred dollars, as the land is pretty stony and very hard to dig.\n\nTrusting to hear from you by return mail.\n\nI am Your obedient servant.\n\nR.G.

You should make the account out in duplicate and when it is received in this form the question of payment will be dealt with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nP.

It was, however, the intention of the architect that the furnace would be set to one side of the building and that the smoke pipe would enter the flue from the side.\n\nWith regard to the drainage, which was discussed by yourself, the contractor and Mr. MacKenzie, I beg to say that the architect who prepared the plans states that he does not consider that it will be necessary to provide drainage as, if the cellar is constructed carefully according to the plans and specifications, it will be absolutely waterproof. It is thought, however, that it might be well to place an outlet pipe six inches in diameter under the foundation in case drainage is found to be necessary at a later date. This will preclude the necessity of the cutting of the wall and the concrete floor should such a contingency arise. This pipe should be carefully closed at the outer end.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to report a few days in advance of the final completion of the cellar walls.\n\nR. G.

The work on this foundation is of very great importance and in letter of June 24th the Inspector was instructed to advise the Department in advance of the final completion and withhold the filling in around the walls until such time as he received further instructions. The idea at the time this letter was written was that Mr. Ghene should visit this school. He could leave tomorrow morning and return in the evening. If this cellar is properly constructed Mr. Ghene states that it will not be necessary to do any drainage, otherwise it may cost us about $200.00 for drainage at a later date.

That portion of the specifications shows that these closets were to be built according to detail, which would naturally be furnished at a later date. While the plans now submitted by the Department may be more elaborate than would be ordinarily expected, the Department is prepared to make some allowance for them, but, in view of the specifications, it must require the contractors to state a figure such as they consider necessary to erect closets that might meet the requirements of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.
