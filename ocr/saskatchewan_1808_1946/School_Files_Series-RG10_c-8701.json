H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies\nOttawa, February 11, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nClassroom Blocks, for Blood Residential School\nand St. Paul's Residential School.\n\nThere are two residential schools situated on the\nBlood Reserve, namely the Blood (Roman Catholic) School, with a\npupillage of 150, and the St. Paul's (Anglican) School, with\na pupillage of 140.\n\nIndian Superintendent Regan, along with the Principals\nof these Schools, has made an extensive survey of buildings of the\nR.C.A.F. camps in the area of Cardston, Alberta, and has located\ntwo ideal buildings to fill the educational needs of his reserve.\nThese buildings are as described below:\n\n1. Building No. 36, R.C.A.F. Station, Macleod, Alberta.\n\nThis building is needed at the Blood R.C. Residential\nSchool as an additional classroom building. It is a former\nLink Trainer building. It is of frame construction, in very\ngood condition, with storm windows and completely shingled\non the outside. The inside contains four good-sized class-\nrooms, each 25' x 36', a large cloakroom for each classroom,\na Principal's office and very adequate washrooms and furnace-\nroom. The ceiling is finished in Tuf-Tect, the walls are\nlined with 3-ply veneer in very good condition, and the\nwhole building is floored with tempered masonite. All\nplumbing and electrical fixtures, as well as all heating\napparatus are still intact. This building was used as\nclassrooms during the war and is ideal for the need on the Blood Reserve. It can be moved without dismantling; it is built in the form of an H, with two classrooms on either side and would be moved in three pieces very easily.\n\n2. Building No. 12, R.C.A.F., Station, Fearce, Alberta.\n\nThis building is needed for additional classroom space at the St. Paul's Residential School on the Blood Reserve. It is similar in every way to the Link Trainer building at Macleod, only this building has four classrooms, each size 15 x 24, and all on one side of the building. This building is 76 feet long and 30 feet wide and complete with electrical wiring (although the fixtures are gone) plumbing and heating. There are four classrooms, two offices, large washroom and heating room. It is ideal for the purpose intended and could be moved intact.\n\nThe Director of the Lands and Buildings Department of War Assets Corporation advises that these buildings are available at the following prices:\n\n(a) Building No. 38 ..... $1,358.60\n(b) Building No. 12 ..... $1,160.51\n\nBoth the above prices represent 5% of the cost of construction. From our past experience with converting such buildings for school use, we immediately requested Inspector Godberham to advise us as to the maximum cost of moving these buildings. We have now received an army signal from him, reading as follows:\n\n\"METEL AIRFORCE BLDGE NEAR BLOOD RESERVE - stop -\nMAXIMUM COST MOVING #12 PEARCE $1800 and #38 MacLEOD $2800 -\nstop- HAGAN ESTIMATES TOTAL COST INCLUDING PURCHASE AT NEW LOCATIONS $5000.00 FOR PEARCE BLDG. AND $6000.00 for MACLEOD\".\n\nThese two buildings will provide classroom accommodation for 150 children in each instance. It will mean that we can offer full day tuition for the children at each of these two schools and will also enable us to increase the pupilage. It\nshould be possible to convert one or more of the present classrooms in these schools to additional dormitory use.\n\nBoth these schools are some 30 miles to the south and a river lies between them and the airport sites. It will be necessary to move these buildings in the near future so as to take advantage of the ice now covering the river.\n\nIn a recent letter Superintendent Hagan advised this branch: \"As you know, this reserve has over 200 children who cannot be educated for lack of accommodation; we have the staff, the land and everything but the buildings.\" Therefore, it is recommended that you consider the inclusion of a sum of $12,000.00 in the Supplementary Estimates for the cost, moving and setting up of these two classroom blocks for the two residential schools as mentioned above. It is estimated that the construction of new classroom blocks at these two residential schools would cost $40,000.00 for each building, or a total of $80,000.00 in all.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector\nCOPY OF MEMORANDUM SENT TO\nG. H. GOODERHAM, with following note:\n\n\"It is suggested that you anticipate the approval of this submission by obtaining written tenders for the moving of these buildings. I will send you an Army Signal as soon as we get approval for this submission and we will have to have written tenders for further submission to the Minister's office.\"\nBlood Indian Residential School,\nCardston, Alberta,\nFebruary 13, 1948.\n\nMr. Bernard Neary\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nYour letter file 103-2-5-(E) of the 9th instant has been received, and I want to thank you for same.\n\nOn my return from Ottawa I got in touch with Mr. O. O. Davis, War Assets, Calgary, regarding Building No. 18. I also saw him yesterday in Calgary and here is what he had to say.\n\nBuilding No. 18 has not been released as yet, but should be released with the next group of buildings in the very near future. This Recreation Centre at one time was requested and used by the army, but lately has been abandoned because it was too big. Lately also the heating equipment has been taken out of the building.\n\nI will be going to Macleod within a day or two and see if some of the released buildings could be used to advantage. My plans call for cinder block construction and a steel truss. The latter is being made in my shop at the present time. The cinder blocks can be bought locally. The lumber from the gym or other building could be used for the roof, main floors and inside finish.\n\nI am very anxious to get on with my plans early in the spring, and if you could supply me with the following materials, I could go right ahead.\n\n500 sacks cement $1800.00\n9000 concrete blocks @ 20\u00a2 each\n10,000 ft. 2x8x18 @ $48.00 per mill\n8000 ft. 2x12x18 @ $48.00 per mill\n18,000 ft. rough lumber @$48.00 per thousand.\nI understand that this is a considerable amount of material, but I do not think it could cost more than the purchase price of Recreational Hall No. 18. This material is all new and has the additional advantage that I would not have to spend a considerable amount of money and time to take the building apart.\n\nTo begin with I would require the cement and the blocks. At the present time construction is at a standstill and cement and blocks are available. But in a month's time it would be very scarce. As for the lumber all I would have to do for the present time is to notify the Indian mill at Brocket of my requirements. It would then be available in May or June. In the meantime, if the gym becomes available, we could cancel the lumber contract, or sell it at a profit.\n\nHoping that I will hear from you soon, I am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nRev. P.A. Charron, S.M.\n\nRev. P. A. Charron, O.M.I.\n\nPRINCIPAL.\nClassroom Blocks, for Blood Residential School and St. Paul's Residential School.\n\nThere are two residential schools situated on the Blood Reserve, namely the Blood (Roman Catholic) School, with a pupilage of 150, and the St. Paul's (Anglican) School, with a pupilage of 140.\n\nIndian Superintendent Ragan, along with the Principals of these Schools, has made an extensive survey of buildings of the R.C.A.F. camps in the area of Cardston, Alberta, and has located two ideal buildings to fill the educational needs of his reserve.

No. 12 at Pearce and No. 38 at Macleod.\n\nIt will be impossible to have this moving done in the present fiscal year and it is anticipated that it will take a good part of the coming summer. The contractors much prefer to move these buildings through the water of the river, rather than over the ice, and they now have moving commitments to keep them busy until late Spring; it will also be much more satisfactory to complete cement foundations after danger of frost.\n\nFEB 23 1948\n\nR.D.

It is presumed that the Calgary office of the War Assets Corporation will be advising you shortly as to the date upon which these buildings can be taken over.\n\nWe have also received Superintendent Hagan's letter of February 20th with attached tender from North Lethbridge Motors Limited for the moving of the buildings.\n\nBefore this tender is submitted to the Minister's office for the necessary approval, could we please be advised as to whether the tender includes the placing of the foundations or whether it is expected that we will provide the necessary cement foundations before these buildings are moved.\n\nIt is also felt that interior changes will have to be made to these buildings and that the windows will have to be moved to provide maximum fenestration. In view of the fact that these buildings can not be moved until the summer, it is felt that these alterations can be the subject of future correspondence. Would you suggest that an Engineer from the Lands and Development Services be consulted with regard to these alterations.\n\nBernard P.

Neary, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Classroom Block St. Paul's Residential School, Blood Reserve.\n\nYour files 103-2-5 and 103-1-5 (E).\n\nUpon receipt of yours of the 24th instant, I contacted the Manager of the War Assets Corporation, Calgary, and learned that his office had just received a directive to say that Building #12 at Pearce and Building #38 at Macleod have been allocated to the Indian Affairs Branch, and would be released when notification of payment for them had been received.\n\nI have not yet contacted Superintendent Ragan, but I know that the tenders do not include the placing of the foundations. This work must be done either by day labor or by contract when weather conditions allow. I would not recommend that such work be done until the weather at least is fine and warm, and that will be in the new fiscal year. It is not at all likely that the mover will get the buildings on to the reserve before early summer.\n\nIn the meantime, the foundations can be made. (I have moved numerous buildings and set them up in the air until the foundations were laid. This is not the best procedure, of course.)\n\nIn regard to the changes to be made to these buildings, I cannot remember how the windows are placed, but I would not attempt to do any alterations until they are on the new foundations. Will not fenestration be subject to the direction the front is facing, and whether or not they are clear of other large buildings? I also consider it too early to consult with an Engineer from the Lands & Development Service.\n\nI am asking Mr. Ragan to locate the sites for these buildings and to obtain some figures on cost of foundations, to be submitted to you.\n\nThe main problem now is to gain possession of the buildings and, in due course, get them moved on to the Reserve. We cannot expect to have them in use before next fall.\n\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n\nGHG: RM\nOttawa, March 3, 1948.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham, Regional Supervisor, Calgary, Alberta.\n\nClassroom Blocks, St. Paul's and Blood Residential Schools.\n\nReference your 205-10-8 of February 26th.\n\nI understand that the Purchase Orders have been issued for both these buildings and that the War Assets Corporation, Calgary Office should shortly receive these.\n\nI agree with your recommendation that the foundations be put in when the weather is much warmer. I also note that the movers will not likely be ready to move the buildings before early summer. However, I will now forward the two tenders to the Minister's office for the necessary approval, on the understanding that this work will be carried out in the 1948-49 fiscal year.\n\nHowever, I would suggest that you advise me now as to the cement which will be required and also the cribbing so that we can forward the requisitions to the Departmental Purchasing Agent now. In this way you will be sure to have the necessary materials when the time comes to build the foundation. With regard to the movement of windows, I will expect to hear further from you when you have had an opportunity of considering this matter.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMarch 4, 1948.\n\nDear Father Charbon:\n\nI have for answer your letter of February 13 and I have delayed in answering you until we were certain about the purchase of the two classroom block buildings. This has now been settled and the necessary purchase orders have been issued. It would seem from your letter that building No. 15 is still somewhat in doubt and that you are now proposing to erect your own gymnasium building. You are therefore requesting that the Department provide you with the building materials for this construction rather than purchasing recreation hall No. 15. Your request would involve the following approximate expenditures:\n\n- Cement: $500.00\n- Concrete blocks: $1,800.00\n- Lumber, approximately: $1,800.00\n\nTotal: $4,100.00\n\nIn the first place, we simply have not the funds available for this expenditure. This is now the last month of the fiscal year and we are already committed to the fullest extent. Therefore, we can do nothing during this month at least, with regard to your proposal.\n\nIn the second place, I feel that the above expenditure would be considerably more than the purchase price of recreation hall No. 15. Of course I cannot confirm this point because the building has not yet been declared surplus.\n\nIn the third place, there is no mention made in your letter of the labour involved in the construction of this building. However, I do not want to drop this proposal but wish that you would thoroughly discuss it with Mr. Gooderham when the\nopportunity presents itself. I am sending him a copy of this letter and am also forwarding one to Father Flourde. I will expect to hear further from you, clarifying this situation and advising me of any further developments.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nReverend P. A.

We have now received a tender from Mr. H. J. Boelof & Son, North Lethbridge Motors and Auto Wreckers, North Lethbridge, Alberta. Unfortunately, we are not going to be able to move these buildings across the ice, as originally planned, due to the lateness of the season and the fact that suitable equipment is not now available. However, the attached tender is from a contractor who has expressed a preference for the moving of these buildings in the late spring and the acceptance of this tender is recommended for approval by the Minister.\n\nIf approval is obtained, it is our intention as soon as weather permits, to have the necessary cement foundations laid and to prepare the site otherwise for the moving of the buildings. Fortunately, our Regional Supervisor, Mr. Goderich, has had some experience in such moving and will ensure that a good job is done in setting up these classroom blocks. Every effort will be made to have them ready for school opening in September.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nOttawa, February 18, 1948.\n\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nBlood Indian Residential School, Blood Reserve, Alberta.\n\nVOTE 516 ALLOTMENT 13-491 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO: G.

Gooderham, Esq., Supervisor of Indian Agencies, CALGARY.\n\nRe: Blood Residential School Gymnasium.\n\nFurther to our recent conversation with Rev. Father P.A. Charron of the Blood R.C. Residential School of this Reserve regarding the building of a gymnasium for that school, we now forward you complete plans of the proposed building.\n\nThe plans, I believe, are self explanatory; Father Charron now has the trusses all complete for the building, these are of steel and very well constructed. The Principal also has on hand sufficient steel-framed windows for this building and wrought iron for reinforcing the concrete. I might add that Father Charron has had considerable experience in construction work of various kinds and I have seen very creditable buildings which he has built. He now has the staff at the school and is prepared to go ahead with the construction of this gym, but is rightfully asking that the Department contribute to the build-\n\nMr. Neary's letter 103-2-5 (E) of March 26th, 1948, in which I believe was forwarded your recommendation, completely the idea of purchasing an existing gym for this school - firstly because it is not yet available and secondly because we find that it would cost more to dismantle and move this building than it would cost for the construction of the building as designed by Father Charron. Other than that the proposed building will be semi-fireproof while Building No. 18 would be a fire trap.\n\nFather Charron has asked that the following materials be supplied by the Department:\n\n| Material       | Cost   |\n|----------------|--------|\n| Cement         | $500.00|\n| Concrete blocks| $1800.00|\n| Lumber         | $1800.00|\n|                | $4100.00|\nThe concrete blocks are manufactured in Cardston and the lumber will be secured from the Peigan Indian Mill at Brocket. All labour will be undertaken by Father Charron and his Staff and cost of all steel trusses, etc. will be borne by the Principal.\n\nThere is no question of the need of a building of this type at this - or any - school. During the last winter I have seen Indian children \"scooped\" into small recreation rooms, with little or no facilities for play, which has more forcibly brought the need of a building of this type to my mind.\n\nAs will be noticed from the plans, it is intended to have a large gym floor, with stage with bowling and manual training rooms and dormitories on either side. It is the idea of the Principal to house the large boys in the dormitory in this building, separating them from the smaller boys and thereby eliminating the cause for much complaint among parents; at the same time of course, this would allow for a greater pupilage providing the classroom blocks are available.\n\nIt will also be noticed that a room has been set aside for a museum; Father Charron has one of the most complete collections of Indian relics and handicraft in this part of the country and it is my opinion that these should be displayed in a museum of some kind in order that they may be preserved and viewed by the public. I feel that the Blood Reserve is fortunate in having a collection such as Father Charron's.\n\nIt is certainly my recommendation that the $4,100.00 be allowed toward the cost of construction of this most useful and necessary building. It is hoped that authority can be obtained for the sum. I might add that Father Charron has given much thought and effort - as well as dollars - to this project and I believe his efforts should be\n\nR.D. Ragam\nSuperintendent.\n\nCop - Principal,\nR.C. School.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Supt. of Education\n\nRef: R. C. Residential School, Blood Indian Reserve\n\nYour file 103-2-5.\n\nReference is made to your letter of March 4th, addressed to the Rev. Principal of this school, and particularly in regard to a gymnasium, which the Rev. Father Charron proposes to erect. Under separate cover, I am sending you a set of three plans, showing the exterior, interior and truss detail, as prepared by Father Charron. Attached hereto please find copy of a letter from the Superintendent of the Blood Agency, Mr. Regan.\n\nIn your of March 4th you suggest the purchase of Building #18 from the Macleod Aerodrome on the belief that it would answer the purpose as well as a new structure, and would possibly cost less. The Superintendent and the Rev. Father believe that it would cost more and that it would not be nearly so fine a building, even if it were available, which apparently it is not.\n\nThere is little to add to what the Superintendent has said in his letter, except that this has been the pet idea of Father Charron for sometime. He has accumulated a lot of material and has solicited financial support from organizations interested in the welfare and progress of Indians. It would be unfortunate if it did not become a reality.\n\nThe financial assistance which he asks from you is a small part of the total value of the building. The sum of $4,100.00 is not a very great deal of money these days and returns should more than justify this expenditure.\n\nIt is submitted in the hope that this assistance will be forthcoming. If for any reason the whole amount cannot be authorized for such a building, please do not consider that the idea will be dropped. Even with a lesser amount, the Rev. Father proposes to go ahead and erect the building and find the necessary money from outside sources. It is hoped that this is not necessary.\n\nG. H.

Indian Residential School.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your 103-4B-2 of April 17, with attached drawings.\n\nIn our Supplementary Estimates for 1948-49 we have already received Ministerial approval to include an item of $12,000.00 for the conversion of the two R.C.A.F. buildings at Pearce and Macleod for use as classroom blocks at the Blood and St. Paul's Residential Schools.\n\nAs you are already aware, Mr. Kaughman's tender calls for an expenditure of $2,900.00 at St. Paul's and $3,900.00 at the Blood School. In addition to this initial expenditure, we have all the other items to be considered in the establishment of these buildings for classroom purposes. The purchase of desks, blackboards, etc., are all items which will have to come out of the $12,000.00 involved. We are quite prepared to devote any of the $12,000.00 remaining towards the construction of Father Charron's gymnasium but with present prices, we are doubtful if there will be much left by the time everything is done. In other words, we cannot make any guarantee to Father Charron at the present time and cannot make any commitment until we know how much the establishment of these two classroom blocks will actually cost.\n\nBernard E.

It is understood from a previous description that each of these buildings will provide four extra classrooms attached to these two residential schools. As desks are very expensive at the present time, it is presumed that the desks from the former classrooms can be used in most instances. The same may be possible with regard to the blackboards.

We have already approved a tender from A. Kaughman & Sons amounting to $6,800.00 for the moving of these two buildings. This leaves an amount of $5,200.00.\n\nMajor Clark has specifically recommended the installation of full basements under these buildings and the Department concurs in his recommendation. The lowest tender for the installation of these basements is that of R. Weston and it amounts to $6,440 (broken down into two separate bids of $2,739 and $3,901). This means that an additional amount is required over and above our estimates of $1,440 and will necessitate a transfer of funds in this amount.\n\nBefore proceeding with such a transfer it is essential that we know what additional funds will be required for:\n\n(a) Stair wells,\n(b) Posts and/or pillars for bracing,\n(c) Laying of drain and water pipe,\n(d) Installation of electrical wiring.\nYou can readily appreciate the fact that if a transfer is to be arranged through Treasury Board, it is essential that we have the one transfer arranged and not a series of small transfers. Therefore, before anything can be done with regard to the basements, we must have an approximation of all additional expenditures which will be required in order to set these classroom blocks up as operating units.\n\nBernard F.

The future of Edmonton is bound up with the development of the mining and other resources of the North West Territories; the three main National Parks are in Alberta, and the largest Indian Reserves are in this Province.\n\nJust so that you will have a problem to deal with immediately, I am writing to you with reference to the following matter.\n\nRecently I had a visit from Rev. Father Charron of the Blood Indian R.C. Residential School and he requested me to give him any assistance I could on the following matter.\n\nFather Charron at the present time is building a gymnasium which is to be used by the Indian children attending this school. He has asked the Department of Indian Affairs for financial assistance to the amount of $4,100.00. He was very hopeful that his request would be granted but it now has been turned down.\n\nI enclose copies of the correspondence which will give you the complete story. You will note that Mr. Ragan, the local Indian Agent wholeheartedly supports the request.\nIn support of the request Father Charron pointed out that through his personal operation of the farm attached to the school he has put in over $25,000.00 in each of the past two years towards maintaining the school apart from the Government grant of $218.00 per pupil per year paid on the basis of 175 pupils last year.\n\nYou will note that moving the buildings from Macleod to the school will increase the classroom and teaching space but it will accentuate the need for recreational space.\n\nAt the moment there is one recreation room for boys and one for girls, each 40 x 50 with 8 foot ceilings and steel posts every nine feet. The sanitary facilities for each room are contained in small rooms and have no ventilation. With the posts there is no chance for indoor sports or games and the rooms when used are badly overcrowded.\n\nThere is a crying need for a gymnasium at this school. Due to our Chinook winds the winters are broken and it is impossible to carry on an outdoor schedule of skating, hockey, etc. The school has no place for plays or visual training.\n\nAs you know there has been strong criticism in the past of the conduct of Indian Schools. However, I believe that St. Mary's School on the Blood Reserve enjoys an excellent reputation and is worthy of some recognition.\n\nThe situation on the Blood Reserve according to Father Charron is that there are 195 pupils at his school, 140 at St. Paul's Anglican School and somewhere near 200 Indian children are running wild on the reserve and not attending school at all. He says that the population on this Reserve has increased from 1100 in 1931 to 1800 at present and the birth rate at present is 47 per 1000.\n\nIf this small amount of $4100.00 can be inserted in the supplementary estimates I am sure that it will serve a very useful purpose and will gladden the lives of 195 Indian children who at the best do not enjoy a very full life.\n\nWith very best wishes,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL.S.

When Father Charron visited the Indian Affairs Branch last winter, he requested that consideration be given to the purchase of building No. 18 at the Macleod R.C.A.F. station. You will note in Father Plourde's letter of January 20 that he makes the following statement:\n\n\"If the Principal is able to secure the recreational gymnasium of the R.C.A.F. establishment at Macleod, the construction of this recreation centre will become relatively easy.\"\n\nWe then wrote to the War Assets Corporation concerning this building and were advised that it had not yet been declared surplus. The cost of this building would probably have been between $1,000 and $1,500.\n\nWe were then advised that the idea of purchasing building No. 18 as a gymnasium for the school had been abandoned completely. It was on this occasion that we were advised that $4,100.00 would be required for the construction of the gymnasium.\n\nIn the meantime we had included in our supplementary estimates an amount of $12,000 for the moving and conversion of two other R.C.A.F. buildings at Pearce and Macleod for use as classroom blocks at the Blood and St. Paul's Residential Schools. Father Charron was therefore advised that if any surplus was available from this $12,000 it would be devoted to the erection of his gymnasium.\n\nHowever, the moving and conversion of these two classroom blocks will now evidently take more than the $12,000 allotted.\nIt will probably be necessary to transfer funds from other projects in order to have these classroom blocks completed by September first. It is felt that the erection of these classroom blocks with full basements is a more important project than the erection of a gymnasium. It is difficult at the present time to decide whether it will be possible to transfer additional funds that might be devoted to the erection of this building. However, officials of the Department are in sympathy with the requirements of the Blood School and consideration will be given to the requirements there if and when funds are available.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHFN/EM\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nMINISTER'S OFFICE\n\nJune 15, 1948.\n\nTo - The Deputy Minister,\n\nThe Minister would appreciate a report on this situation.\n\nA.C.L.

It will probably be necessary to transfer funds from other projects in order to have these classroom blocks completed by September first.

My Bishop at the request of the Pelican Indians wants me to reside at the Brocket village and the only suitable house I could purchase is at the Fearce Airport, but I can get it only through the Department of Indian Affairs and Mr. Davis of the War Assets Corporation advises me to come to you.\n\nThe house I have in mind is No. 31, W.D. Officers Fearce Airport - the price $625.00. I would pay for it myself and my cheque would be available at any moment. The house would be used as a residence and a Church for the Indians. Could you also ask Mr. Davis to hold it for me in case the Government ban would be lifted.\n\nTrusting you will be able to do me this favor and with best wishes, I remain, Sincerely yours\n\n(signed) E.

Father M. Riaux, O.M.I., Catholic Missionary at the Peigan Reserve, in which he outlines his plan to obtain building #31, Pearce Airport, for use as a house and church at Brocket. I contacted Mr. Davis, of local War Assets Corporation, who informs me that the building is still frozen along with others at Pearce. If you can arrange a release for the purpose outlined, please advise. Father Riaux would no doubt make the necessary arrangements to have the building moved to Brocket.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nJuly 13, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nSuperintendent of Welfare.\n\nPlease find attached correspondence from the Regional Supervisor for Alberta concerning War Surplus Buildings at Pearce, Alberta.\n\nEncl.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAIRMAIL\n\nJuly 13, 1948.\n\nMr. G. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nWar Surplus Buildings, Pearce, Alberta.\n\nI am referring your letter 116-19-8 of July 7, concerning building No. 31 at the Pearce Airport, to the Superintendent of Welfare.\n\nI would say that at the present time it will probably be quite difficult to have this building \"unfrozen\".\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nRelative to the above, on this date at 10:45 AM, a telephone call was received at this detachment from the St. Mary's School on the Blood Indian Reserve to the effect that a workman had been electrocuted while working on the new gymnasium, which is being built in connection with the school. It was learned that Dr. Jno. A. KEY had already been notified and was at the scene of the accident.\n\n2. Sgt. H. D. Ferguson and the writer immediately patrolled to the Indian School. Upon arriving there it was ascertained that Merlin HALL of Cardston, Alta., had been working directly under some high tension wires and a long iron rod which he was handling had come in contact with one of the wires. Artificial Respiration had been applied, but upon arrival of Dr. KEY, HALL was pronounced dead.\n\n3. The following observations and measurements were made at the scene of the accident. The gymnasium on which HALL was employed is located on the north side of the main school building. The walls are being constructed of cinder blocks and have been completed. The power line which HALL came in contact with runs east and west lengthwise over the gymnasium. This power line leads from the line running along the road in front of the school to the back of the school where it enters the building. This line which leads from the main line carries 18,000 volts as the bank of transformers are located at the back of school. In other words the voltage is not reduced until just before it enters the school buildings.\n\n4. On the inside walls of the gymnasium a scaffold has been erected. At the time of the accident HALL was employed on the scaffolding on the east wall. He was placing long iron rods in a form that had been built on top of the cinder brick wall. These rods were to be used in reinforcing the cement, which was to be placed in these forms. Just previous to the accident, Billy HEAVY RUNNER and Indian had handed about a dozen of these rods up to HALL and HALL had laid them on the scaffold. The rods which had been handed up had been laid directly under the power line. Apparently HALL had placed one of the rods in the forms and then reached down and picked another one up. The second one he was about to place in the form was no doubt the rod that touched the wire. It was also possible that HALL was standing on the other rods. There were two other workmen working on the scaffold nearby when the accident happened.\n\n5. The east wall of the gymnasium is 60' 6\" in length and is 80' 6\" in height, that is to say the top of the forms.\nThe scaffold is 4' 9\" below the top of the form. There are three wires passing from east to west over this wall. The centre wire is 16' from the south wall. The north wire is 18' above the top of the form. The centre wire is the highest and is 4' 3\". The south wire is 2' 1\" above the form. The wire which HALL touched with the rod was the north wire which is only 6' 3\" above the scaffolding. The rod which HALL was placing in the form was 15' 1/2\" in length. There was a burnt mark on this rod 4' from one end, no doubt being where it came in contact with the power line.\n\n6. Dr. Jas. A. KEY, local Coroner and the writer examined the body. No burn marks could be found other than a slight burn on the rubber sole of the right shoe which HALL was wearing. On this shoe there was a slight burn around two nails in the sole. The body was removed to HALL'S funeral home in Cardston. HALL'S watch and .15\u00a2 in cash were turned over to Vern HALL, brother of the deceased.\n\n7. After viewing the scene, Dr. Jas. A. KEY local Coroner ordered that an Inquest be held. Dr. KEY issued a warrant to take possession of the body and to summon a Jury. The following jurors were summoned, Warren SMITH, Garage Prop., Cardston, Alta.; William SLOAN, Merchant, Cardston, Alta.; Orson ANDERSON, Farmer, Cardston, Alta.; Jerry McIntyre, Merchant, Cardston, Alta.; William LADLAN, Merchant, Cardston, Alta.; Elmo NELSON, Farmer, Cardston, Alta., to appear at the Court House, Cardston, Alta., at 2:30 pm. on this date. The Jury picked Warren SMITH as Foreman. The body was viewed at HALL'S funeral home, Cardston and then the scene of the accident was viewed. The jury then adjourned until 2:00 pm. on the 26-6-48.\n\n8. The following is a statement obtained from Gilbert L. SCHAFER, Cardston, Alta., a carpenter that was employed on the scaffold with HALL.\n\nCardston, Alta.,\nJune 25th, 1948.\n\nStatement of Gilbert L. SCHAFER.\n\nAt about 10:00 am. this morning I was working on the new recreation hall at the Roman Catholic School on the Blood Reserve. I was up on the scaffold, working on the north east corner. I was with Tony MILK building form. I heard Merlin HALL suddenly shout and when I turned around he had hold of a rod, this rod was touching the wires of the power line above the structure, sparks were flying between the rod that he held and the wires. Almost immediately he collapsed on the scaffolding, his head was hanging over the edge and I pulled him back and commenced to administer artificial respiration. At this point Father CHARON came up and we moved Merlin off the bars on to a flatter spot. We continued to apply artificial respiration until Mr. CODY arrived and he took over for a few minutes. At this point Dr. KEY arrived and pronounced him dead. The Dr. arrived at about 10:35 am. I heard Father CHARON warn Merlin HALL to be careful of the wires while putting the rods in place.\n\nWitnessed, Capt. H. D. Ferguson\n\n(Signed) G. L. Schaffer.\n9. The following is a statement obtained from Antoni WILK, who is a Polish Refugee employed by St. Mary's Roman Catholic School on the Blood Indian Reserve. WILK was also on the scaffold when HALL met his death.\n\nCardston, Alta.,\nJune 25th, 1948.\n\nStatement of Antoni WILK.\n\nAt about 10:00 am., shortly after I was working with Gilbert SCHAFER on the new recreation hall at the Roman Catholic School on the Blood Indian Reserve. I heard someone make a noise and turned around and saw Merlin HALL swaying with one of the metal bars in his hands. The bar was apparently touching the wire of the power line which was above the structure. There seemed to be smoke rising from either the bar or the wire. Almost immediately HALL fell to the scaffolding. I ran to get Father CHARON, we both came back and Father CHARON instructed an Indian to go and tell Mr. GODY. While waiting for the doctor to arrive I assisted Gilbert SCHAFER in giving HALL artificial respiration. The doctor arrived about 10:30 am. and pronounced HALL dead.\n\nI heard Father CHARON warn everyone to be careful of the wires. He had done this often and even wrote a warning on a board under the wires. This board had been removed at the time of the accident.\n\nWitnessed, Cst. H. D. Ferguson. (signed) Antoni Wilk.\n\n10. The following is a statement from Billy HEAVY RUNNER, an Indian who handed the iron rods up to HALL and who was on the ground when HALL touched the power line.\n\nCardston, Alta.\nJune 25th, 1948.\n\nStatement of BILLY HEAVY RUNNER (Indian)\n\nOn June 25th I was working on the new recreation hall at the Roman Catholic School on the Blood Indian Reserve. I had been helping Merlin HALL, having just handed about 10 to 12 metal rods up to him. I turned my back and was talking to some people outside the structure. I heard someone make a noise and turning around saw Merlin HALL fall to the platform of the scaffolding on which he had been standing. He did not have anything in his hands when I looked around and he was almost right down on the platform. He landed with his head over the edge of the platform and I thought that he was in danger of falling off. I shouted to Tony WILK who was up on the scaffold to pull him back and he did this. I noticed that Merlin HALL was shaking when he was lying on the platform. I would estimate the time to be about 10:00 am. Dr. KEY was called and arrived about 25 minutes to 11:00 am. He inspected the body and pronounced him dead.\n\nI had heard Father CHARON warn everybody to be careful of the wires which were overhead and everyone seemed to be aware of the fact that they were dangerous.\n\nWitnessed, Cst. H. D. Ferguson. (signed) Billy H. Runner.\n\n11. The following is a statement obtained from Father CHARON, who is in charge of the St. Mary's Roman Catholic School on the Blood Indian Reserve and also has charge of the construct...\nCardston, Alta.,\nJune 26th, 1948.\n\nStatement of Paul Andrew CHARRON (Priest)\n\nYesterday morning I worked with the boys on the scaffolding placing forms on top of the walls, these forms were to be filled with cement at a later date. Before leaving I warned Merlin HALL and the others to be careful as there was great danger near the wires, they acknowledged this warning. I then departed to the school, shortly after a knock came at my door, and I was informed that there had been an accident. I immediately went to the building, looked up and saw Mr. SCHAFER. He seemed to be giving artificial respiration. He was up on the scaffold and I got up also and helped him. I had someone go and phone for the Doctor. We continued to give artificial respiration and Merlin seemed to be responding, sometimes to words and if not to signs which I made. When the Doctor arrived he informed us that it was useless to continue. I immediately left and notified the R. C. M. Police by telephone. I would estimate the time to be about 5 passed ten when I was first called to the scene of the accident.\n\nWitnessed Cst. H. D. Ferguson. (Signed) Rev. P. A. Charron\n\nThere were numerous other persons around the gymnasium at the time of the accident. However, none of these persons actually saw it happen.\n\nThe following witnesses were summoned to appear for the Inquest at 2:00 pm. on June 26th, 1948. Gilbert SCHAFER, Antoni WILE, Father P. A. CHARRON and Billy HEAVY RUNNER.\n\nOn this date at 2:00 pm. the inquest was continued at the Court House, Cardston, Alta. All of the jurors were present along with the witnesses mentioned in para. 13. The evidence of the four witnesses followed the lines of the statements embodied in this report. The writer gave evidence in regard to the measurements etc. Father P. A. CHARRON in his evidence stated that he had requested the Calgary Power Co. to move the line over the Gymnasium about one month and a half ago. The poles had been put in for the new line, but no other work had been done. Father CHARRON had also requested the Power Co. to place the transformers on the road so the high voltage would not pass over the School grounds.\n\nThe Calgary Power Co. was represented at the Inquest by E. F. STRINGAM, local barrister and other officials of the Company.\n\nThe jury deliberated for one half hour and Warren SMITH, foreman of the jury brought in the following verdict.\n\n\"That at approximately 10:00 am. on June 25th, 1948 at St. Mary's R. C. School on the Blood Reserve, Cardston, while working on the new Recreational Hall now under construction, the said Merlin HALL came to his death.\"\naccidentally by electrocution, by a rod he carried coming in contact with a live high tension wire which passed about eighteen inches above the wall he was working on.\n\n17. From the investigation and the evidence at the inquest there is no doubt that HALL came to his death accidentally. HALL is single and was born at Cardston on Sept. 23rd, 1921. He is survived by his mother and three brothers all of Cardston, Alta.\n\n18. The Coroner was engaged in regards to this inquest for 4 hours on the 25th instant and 4 hours on the 26th instant. Transportation was furnished the jury by this detachment to view the scene of the accident.\n\n19. Form \"A\" of the Alberta Coroner's Act was issued on the 25-6-48 by Coroner Jas. A. KEY, M.D., Cardston, Alta. On 26-6-48 the death was registered at Cardston, Alta. Internment taking place on 28-6-48 in Cardston Cemetery.

The erection of full basements will amount to $6,640. This brings preliminary work to a total amount of $13,440.00. Of this, only $12,000.00 is provided in our Estimates and we will have to seek transfers to the amount of $1,440.00. In addition, it would seem that other large expenditures must be made and that in all this project will cost approximately $30,000.00, (a figure much higher than that originally estimated). However, we have recommended to the Minister the acceptance of Mr. E. Weston's tender for the establishment of the basements. If you will note the final paragraph of my letter of June 17, I advised you that such approval would have to be obtained. If this approval is forthcoming, you will be sent an Army Signal, through Mr. Gooderham's office.\n\nI would also ask that you obtain firm tenders from\n\nCopy sent to Mr. Gooderham\nlocal contractors for the following items at each school:\n\n1. **PLUMBING:**\n   (a) Sewers for both schools.\n   (b) Tile drain for St. Paul's School.\n   (c) Connection and supplying of pipe to toilets and sinks.\n\n2. **CARPENTRY:**\n   (a) Stair walls and doors at both schools.\n   (b) Extra windows at both schools.\n   (c) Stringers and Pillars at both schools.\n\n3. **ELECTRICAL WIRING:**\n   (a) As required in classrooms at both schools.\n\n4. **HEATING:**\n   Installation of heating unit, radiators, etc.\n\nYou do not state whether the figure quoted in your letter for heating at the Blood School includes the stove mentioned in your comments under the St. Paul's School. You are of course aware that if we provide such a unit for one school, it will certainly be necessary to provide it at the other. I would ask clarification of this point before a decision is reached.\n\nYou will note that we cannot consider the installation of the passage-ways, in view of the large expenditure which this project has already cost. The painting of these buildings will have to wait until next year.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

These tenders are as follows:\n\nR. WESTON:\n(1) Full basement, St. Paul's School $2,739.00\n(2) \" Blood School $3,901.00 $6,640.00\n\nT.

Weston's tender is the lowest of the three submitted, it is recommended for your approval.\n\nMr. Ralph Weston is a contractor of Cardston, Alberta, who has previously carried out repair work in a satisfactory manner on these residential schools. Therefore, it is recommended that approval be\ngiven for the following two separate contracts:\n\n(a) Erection of full basement for R.C.A.F. building to be used as classroom block at St. Paul's Residential School ...................... $2,739.00\n\n(b) Erection of full basement for R.C.A.F. building to be used as classroom block at Blood Residential School ...................... 3,901.00\n\nDirector.\nAugust 4, 1948.\n\nMr. R.

School\n\nPresent pupilage 204 - to be increased to 240. Present desks - 158; small tables and chairs filling in for missing desks. Five classrooms at present with four more to be made available by new blocks. However, two of present classrooms will have to be converted to dormitories to take care of expected new pupils. When completed, therefore, it is expected to have a pupilage of 240 with seven complete classrooms.\n\nOther items for which requisitions are not forwarded at this time, but which will need immediate consideration are:\n\n1. New washing machine in laundry. Present Canadian Laundry Machine Co. Ltd., Machine, of Toronto, Serial No. 1215\u00bd M7165, with 5' drum is not large enough to handle increased pupilage.\n\n2.

NEARY\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nChg. Indian Affairs.\nBFN/MGD\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA.\n\nRe: Surplus Boiler - Classroom Blocks.\nBlood and St. Paul's Residential Schools.\n\nReference your letter, file 103-2-5 (E) of the 4th instant regarding the above.\n\nThe possibility of using these boilers to heat the classroom blocks was gone into thoroughly when estimates on heating were being obtained, and the idea was abandoned as being more costly and inconvenient than heating from existing boilers.\n\nIn the first place, there are no radiators in either building and these would have to be purchased in any event. To install the surplus boilers would mean special boiler rooms and special coal bins at each School, at a terrific cost - it might also mean additional help to tend these boilers. Existing boilers are adequate in capacity to handle this increased load, with the addition of a stoker at the St. Paul's School - the St. Mary's R.C. School already has a stoker. The surplus boilers are fitted for gas and would have to be converted to coal.\n\nIf we are allowed to install one of these boilers in the Superintendent's residence, there will be one remaining for disposal and which can be sold. We have had no estimate made on their value to date. For your information the boilers are Gurney New Bright Idea 25 (G) Boilers (Gas) 4'9\" high, 5' long and 2'8\" wide.\n\nMay we be advised as soon as possible regarding our request to use one of these boilers and as to the Department's wishes in regard to the disposal or otherwise of the remaining unit.\n\n(R.D.

I discussed this matter with Mr. Bethune and wrote to Mr. Superintendent Ragan to make sure that we could not use this boiler in one of the two classrooms being erected.\n\nHe advises me that this would not be practicable and requests authority to install one of these boilers in the Superintendent's residence. I have advised him that this matter has been referred to you for attention.\n\nBeynard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nSeptember 8, 1948.\n\nMr. R. D.

All plumbing and electrical fixtures as well as all heating apparatus are still intact.\n\n\"Building No. 22 .................. It is also complete with electrical fixtures and wiring, plumbing and heating.\n\n\"Building No. 12 .................. Complete with electrical wiring, although the fixtures are gone) plumbing and heating.\"\n\nIn view of the fact that these buildings will only be used in the daytime, would it not be possible to install hot air heating and thus reduce somewhat the estimate originally given for installing the heating plants in these two buildings?\n\nI have referred the question of installing one of these boilers in the Superintendent's residence, to the Chief Executive Assistant.\n\nBernard F.

Bldg. #38\nMacLeod to Cardston, Alta.\n\nAt your request my men and myself have inspected the above building with a view to moving it to the Blood Indian Reserve; we have also inspected the road over which it will have to be moved.\n\nWe will contract to move Building No. 38, now situated at Macleod, and set on your foundation at the Blood R.C. School, near Cardston, Alberta as follows:\n\nWe will move this building and place on your foundation and tie together; we will move the large hot water boiler that goes with the building and place where wanted; we will salvage all gas, water and sewer lines; we will cap all water and gas mains; we will move all cement piers to your site if needed; we will haul all debris from site and restore present site as called for by War Assets Corporation regulations; we will make arrangements with proper authorities re permission to move over roads; we will bulldoze necessary roads, where needed, at our expense and will guarantee a satisfactory job on the above for the total sum of thirty nine hundred dollars ($3,900.00).\n\nFor reference we would refer you to the Canadian Sugar Factories at Raymond or to Mr. Mark Mann of the P.F.R.A. for whom we have moved many buildings, with complete satisfaction.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nKAUGHMAN & SONS,\nPer: Andy Kaughman.\nCol.

Residential School\n\nFurther to correspondence your file 103-2-5(E),\nI recently inspected the gymnasium which the Rev. Father Charron is building on the school grounds. This is a very fine structure and is completed except for the flooring. This must be of hard wood.\n\nFather Charron states that he can secure the necessary maple hard wood flooring from the Tanner Lumber Company at Macrae for $1500, but he has not got the funds to do so. If the Branch is not prepared to assist in the erection of this building to that extent, he must leave it unfinished for another year. This would be too bad, and I sincerely hope that funds, which may not be used in the erection of day schools, can be used to purchase this flooring. I doubt if the existing building could be erected for $7,000, if it was necessary to go out and purchase material and supply the labour which has gone into it.\n\nWhen it is finished, it will be useful not only as a gymnasium, but as a class room and for other work that goes on at these large institutions.\n\nThis is a distinct asset, and I hope you can get the authority to make this expenditure.\n\nG.

We have moved two Air Force buildings from nearby camps and have them now set up on full basement foundations at these schools. These buildings were former Link Trainer units and are already fitted up with classrooms. They will provide ideal classroom blocks at these two schools.\n\nBy converting the present classrooms into extra dormitories and by using the new classroom blocks, we will be able to provide accommodation for many more children at each of these schools. At present we are not providing any educational facilities whatsoever for over 100 children on this reserve.\n\nOur Superintendent of Education found on his recent visit that the only serious problem now remaining before these classroom blocks can be opened is that of heating them. Our Regional Supervisor for Alberta and the local Indian Superintendent both made strong representations that a heating engineer should recommend the best way in which these buildings can be heated, in view of the magnitude of the tenders which will probably be involved.\n\nOur field officials are agreed that the calling in of local heating contractors would not have solved the problem.\nas each one would have presented his own ideas on the solution of the problem. Only the visit of a heating engineer will provide a sound and satisfactory solution. Therefore, the prompt sending of a heating engineer by your Branch will be appreciated, not only by our Headquarters officials, but also by our field officials.\n\nActing Director.\nCANADIAN PACIFIC TELEGRAPHS\n\nWorld Wide Communications.\n\nACCOUNTING REFERENCE: \n\nCHECK: \n\nTIME FILED: \n\nSend the following message, subject to the conditions on the back thereof, which are hereby agreed to:\n\n750-5 Ottawa October 20 1948\n\nMR R D BAGAN\nSuperintendent Indian Agency\nCARDSTON Alberta\n\nHAVE ARRANGED VISIT BRATING ENGINEER HARGRAVES\nBLOOD SCHOOLS AS DISCUSSED -stop- DUE ARRIVE TO A LETHBRIDGE FRIDAY\nNIGHT -stop- MAKE RESERVATION MARQUIS HOTEL AND ARRANGE PICK HIM UP\nSATURDAY MORNING OCTOBER TWENTY THIRD -\n\nBernard J Mary\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nCharge Indian Affairs\nMinistries and Resources\n\nE77/EM\nSHOP AT: Little Bridge, Sept 20th 1948\n\nM.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Reverend Father Maurice Lafrance, Principal of the Blood Indian Residential School in which he mentions the high cost of the School gymnasium. He would like to know if the Department could come to his rescue. He would need between four and five thousand dollars to pay wages and for materials already bought and used.\n\nAs this building is deemed necessary for the good of the school children, it is hoped that you will accede to his request.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. C. Flourde, O.M.I.\n24th January, 1949.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nLaurier Avenue East,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWe have your letter of the 15th instant requesting four or five thousand dollars in connection with the erection of the gymnasium at the Blood Residential School.\n\nAs you are aware, the former principal began the erection of this building and it is understood that he had the funds for the purpose. However, we have supplied the maple flooring required at a cost of $1,560.00.\n\nAt the present period of the current fiscal year our funds are so limited that we are unable to give favourable consideration to the request contained in your letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBernard F.

R. Prowse Range Co. Ltd., Montreal, Que. Fr. M. LaFrance, Principal of the R.C. School on the Blood Reserve received these goods on December 20th, 1948.\n\nFr. LaFrance informs me that he did not order these goods, nor were they ordered from this office, and we can find no authority or purchase order for them; we are wondering if they have been ordered by the Nutrition Division.\n\nWith the individual dining table system in use at the St. Mary's School, these ladders are needed, and this voucher is submitted for your disposal.

School - Classroom Block.\nBlood Indian Reserve.\n\nMr. Ralph Weston and myself have thoroughly gone into the building of a coal bin and boiler room with 30' chimney for the above Classroom Block, and I attach hereto Mr. Weston's estimate for doing the job, which amounts to $1,675.00. In submitting this tender Mr. Weston advises that he would much prefer to work on a cost-plus basis; either the Department or himself to pay for all material, excavation and so forth, Mr. Weston to furnish all labour and receive a 25% bonus computed on the cost of labour only. Added to this cost would be 10\u00a2 per mile transportation charges for himself and his crew.\n\nWe are enclosing two plans of this coal bin and boiler room, as we believe it should be built. There is an existing lean-to on the building without floor or foundation, and we believe this lean-to is worth salvaging. We propose to build a concrete foundation for the coal bin and boiler room, as called for on the plan, and then to extend the existing lean-to to the edge of this foundation as shown on our enclosed sketch. By putting a door in this extension, and a railing on the reinforced concrete top of the boiler room, with steps to this top, it will give us an ideal building for any use to which we wish to put it. To do this will necessitate making the coal bin a bit larger than shown on the Department plan, but we believe this would still leave plenty of space in the boiler room. The contractor suggests moving the chimney away from the valley of the roof as shown in the Departmental plan, to eliminate danger of run-off water. As we understand it, this coal bin and boiler room must be completed before heating contractors can commence work; however, this cement work cannot be done until we have warmer weather unless the Department are prepared to pay an increased cost. May we have your criticisms and suggestions, therefore, regarding our enclosed plan, and any other suggestions which you deem advisable.\n\nAt the same time, can you please advise whether or not the Department contemplate lining the basement of the classroom block and whether or not this and other work - mainly electrical, can be proceeded with on a cost-plus basis.\n\nRDR/S\n\nAtt: G.H. Gooderham, Reg. Sup., Calgary.\n\n(R.D. Regan)\nSuperintendent.\nBlood River\n\nArt\n\nDoes this look OK?\n\nMr. Watson seems to have offered everything in accordance with the requirements and I think his price is fair and reasonable.\n\n14/2/49\nOttawa, 4th February, 1949.\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Classroom Block, Blood Residential School\n\nYou will recall that approval was previously given to a tender for moving two buildings purchased from War Assets Corporation in order that they could be renovated for classroom blocks at the Blood and St. Paul's Residential Schools, Blood Indian Agency, Cardston, Alberta.\n\nMr. John Superintendent Regan, with the approval of Regional Supervisor Gooderham, suggests that the existing lean-to should be extended and placed on a foundation, in order to provide adequate space for a coal bin and boiler room.\n\nMr. Ralph Weston, Cardston, Alberta, has forwarded a tender offering to supply material and labour at a total cost of $1,678.00. Our officials believe that this is a reasonable price, and we would appreciate having the Minister's approval for accepting Mr. Weston's quotation.\n\nDirector.\n4th February, 1949.\n\nMr. R.D. Regan,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 28th ultimo suggesting the erection of a coal bin and boiler room in the classroom block of the Blood Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that Mr. Ralph Weston is prepared to supply the material and labour at a total cost of $1,678.00, and it is understood that this price will include all the work which you consider necessary.\n\nWe have submitted Mr. Weston's tender to the Minister for his approval. When it is received, you will be so advised.\n\nIn view of the expenditure that will be required in connection with the heating and plumbing contract, our funds are not sufficient to justify other expenditures, and consequently, we do not intend to line the basement of the classroom block. It should not be necessary to place an extensive electrical installation in this building, but in any case, we are not prepared to award the business on a cost plus basis. You may obtain a contract for the electrical work which you consider is absolutely essential, and submit it for our information.\n\nIt is noted that you refer to this school as \"St. Mary's R.C. School\". The official name of the R.C. School on the Blood Reserve is \"Blood Indian Residential School\". When forwarding correspondence regarding this school, in future, please refer to it by the latter name.\n\nBernard F.

Murray,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOttawa, 9th April, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Blood Indian Residential School\nBlood Indian Reserve\n\nOn August 3, 1948, we submitted to you a tender from Mr. Ralph Weston, Cardston, Alberta, for the installation of two full basements for the classroom buildings being moved to the St. Paul's Residential School and the Blood Residential School, on the Blood Indian Reserve.\n\nWhen Mr. Ralph Weston completed this work, the question was raised of joining the new classroom blocks with the main buildings, preparatory to the installation of the heating units required. Indian Superintendent Ragan was requested to have firm tenders obtained for the installation of a passageway from the main building to the classroom block at both the St. Paul's and the Blood Residential Schools.\n\nOur information is that the weather closed in and Mr. Ragan apparently permitted Mr. Weston to begin the construction of the connecting passageway without the proper authority.\n\nIn a memorandum dated February 9, 1949, we submitted to you an account from Mr. Ralph Weston in the amount of $701.81, for the erection of the connecting tunnel from the main building of the St. Paul's Residential School to the classroom block at that school. Payment of this account was approved by your office.\n\nSuperintendent Ragan has now submitted an account from Mr. Ralph Weston in the amount of $2,428.02\nfor the erection of the tunnel from the main building of the Blood Residential School to the classroom block at that school. Owing to bad weather, Mr. Ragan apparently permitted Mr. Weston to begin the erection of the connecting passageway without first receiving proper authority.\n\nIn explanation of the considerably higher cost for the erection of the connecting tunnel at the Blood Residential School than at the St. Paul's School, Mr. Ragan points out that the classroom block at the Blood School had to be placed a much longer distance from the main building than at the St. Paul's School, in view of drainage requirements. The width of the corridor at the Blood School is wider than at the St. Paul's School, and in order to provide safety for the large number of children enrolled at the Blood School, Mr. Ragan also points out that Mr. Weston installed an outside double door exit from the passageway. He further states that Mr. Weston did a splendid job.\n\nIf this work had not been done by Mr. Weston it would have been necessary to have the tunnel built in order to carry the water and drainage pipes. As stated in my memorandum of February 9, Mr. Ragan has been written to concerning the issuing of authority for such contracts without first receiving official approval, and we feel confident that there will be no repetition of such matters.\n\nI would, therefore, recommend that you authorize payment of the account in the amount of $2,428.02. Funds for this payment are being held in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49.\n\n[Signature]\nMinister\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n| Description                          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------|----------|------------|---------|\n| Roofing nails                       | 25       | $0.25      | $6.25   |\n| 100 lbs. 2\u00bd in nails                | 100      | $0.18      | $18.00  |\n| 50 lbs. 4 in spikes                 | 50       | $0.20      | $10.00  |\n| Ft.

Bagan,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of March 26th with reference to electrical work in the classroom blocks at the Blood Reserve.\n\nIt appears from the tenders which you forwarded that the Modern Home Electric is lower than the other, and consequently, if you feel that they will do a satisfactory job the Department approves acceptance of their tender as follows:\n\n(1) Electrical Work, St. Paul's Residential School........$247.50\n\n(2) Electrical Work, Blood Residential School.........$366.70\n\nA separate account should be forwarded for each school.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nAuthority for Modern Electric\nOttawa, 9th April, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Blood Indian Residential School\nBlood Indian Reserve\n\nOn August 3, 1948, we submitted to you a tender from Mr. Ralph Weston, Cardston, Alberta, for the installation of two full basements for the classroom buildings being moved to the St. Paul's Residential School and the Blood Residential School, on the Blood Indian Reserve.\n\nWhen Mr. Ralph Weston completed this work, the question was raised of joining the new classroom blocks with the main buildings, preparatory to the installation of the heating units required. Indian Superintendent Ragan was requested to have firm tenders obtained for the installation of a passageway from the main building to the classroom block at both the St. Paul's and the Blood Residential Schools.\n\nOur information is that the weather closed in and Mr. Ragan apparently permitted Mr. Weston to begin the construction of the connecting passageway without the proper authority.\n\nIn a memorandum dated February 9, 1949, we submitted to you an account from Mr. Ralph Weston in the amount of $701.31, for the erection of the connecting tunnel from the main building of the St. Paul's Residential School to the classroom block at that school. Payment of this account was approved by your office.\n\nSuperintendent Ragan has now submitted an account from Mr. Ralph Weston in the amount of $2,428.02\nfor the erection of the tunnel from the main building of the Blood Residential School to the classroom block at that school. Owing to bad weather, Mr. Ragan apparently permitted Mr. Weston to begin the erection of the connecting passageway without first receiving proper authority.\n\nIn explanation of the considerably higher cost for the erection of the connecting tunnel at the Blood Residential School than at the St. Paul's School, Mr. Ragan points out that the classroom block at the Blood School had to be placed a much longer distance from the main building than at the St. Paul's School, in view of drainage requirements. The width of the corridor at the Blood School is wider than at the St. Paul's School, and in order to provide safety for the large number of children enrolled at the Blood School, Mr. Ragan also points out that Mr. Weston installed an outside double door exit from the passageway. He further states that Mr. Weston did a splendid job.\n\nIf this work had not been done by Mr. Weston it would have been necessary to have the tunnel built in order to carry the water and drainage pipes. As stated in my memorandum of February 9, Mr. Ragan has been written to concerning the issuing of authority for such contracts without first receiving official approval, and we feel confident that there will be no repetition of such matters.\n\nI would, therefore, recommend that you authorise payment of the account in the amount of $2,428.02. Funds for this payment are being held in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49.\n\nPP/ST Director.\n| Description of Articles and Marks | Weight | Rate | Freight | Advances | Prepaid | Collect |\n|----------------------------------|--------|------|---------|----------|---------|---------|\n| 20 POS BED                       |        |      |         |          |         |         |\n| 20 MATTRESSES                    |        |      |         |          |         |         |\n| 2 CTS PILLOWS                    |        |      |         |          |         |         |\n| CHARGE DEPT OF MINES AND RESOURCES FOR TRANSPORTATION, OTTAWA CANADA | 1710   | 121  | 2069    | 2069     | C/A     |         |\n\nTotal: \n\nReceived Payment for the Company\n\nDate: \nAgent:\n\nMake Cheques Payable to Order of CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY CO.\n\nMail to Local Freight Agent\nDominion Government,\nDept.

This included the cost of the beds, mattresses and pillows in the amount of $189.10 and also freight charges in the amount of $20.69, a receipt for which accompanied the Voucher. We, therefore, issued a cheque for $209.79 to the Army & Navy Department Stores, 10125 - 101st Street, Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nIt would appear that this account is still outstanding and an amount of $20.69 should be collected from the Company mentioned above.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Original on file 750-1.\n\n\"The class building is not completed, but he hopes that the finishing touches will be done in two or three weeks provided your Department is willing to spend a few dollars for wages and materials.\n\nHe complains that the basement of the school will be extremely cold during the winter unless something be done to finish it properly. At the present time it seems that it is the intention of your Department to leave the ceiling open and not plaster the basement walls. There is doubt about the Department supplying double windows. As the basement foundation is 8\" thick, he is of the opinion that if not plastered, it will not keep frost and humidity out of the basement and that it will be extremely cold during the winter.\n\nYou must know that you have not yet shipped the desks and blackboards, but I suppose that the order has been given and that they will arrive for the opening of the school in September.\n\nHe is informed that there is $3,000.00 in the estimates for his school and he says that he needs a large kitchen stove, a refrigerator 400 sq. yds. of battleship linoleum and showers for both boys and girls.\"\nJune 9th, 1949.\n\nMr. R.D.

We are attaching hereto two circulars, one illustrates the Chef Junior Coal Range in #20, made up of one Firebox on the left hand end, and two Ovens, also the #2-24 L.H. Navy Range with Firebox on the left hand end and two Ovens. We have found these two Ranges to be popular, especially the Chef Jr., on account of the heavier construction. We would quote you as follows on these two types:\n\n#20 Chef Junior Coal Range ........................................... $418.00\nDouble Deck High Shelf .................................................. $56.00\nStraight Waterfront, if required ........................................ $16.50\n\nTo these prices must be added a Sales Tax of 8% if your Department are called upon to pay Sales Tax. The prices quoted are F.O.B. Calgary.\n\n#2-24 L.H. Navy Range .................................................. $254.00\nDouble Deck High Shelf .................................................. $48.00\nFlat Water Back .............................................................. $12.50\nF.O.B., Calgary Sales Tax extra, if it applies.\n\nWe make only one type of Range with the Centre Fire, and that is our #2110 Centre Fire Chef Junior; on this the price is $685.00; Double Deck High Shelf, extra, $67.00; special Waterfront, if required, $19.50. These prices apply F.O.B. Calgary and are subject to 8% Sales Tax if it is applicable for your Department.\n\nRegarding delivery on the Navy and the #20 Chef Jr., we require approximately 6 weeks from the time the order is received at our Foundry at London, Ontario, to make shipment. On the #2110 Centre Fire Chef Jr., we believe that this could be shipped within 3 weeks from the time the order is received at London. We would be very glad to hear further from you regarding your requirements.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGENERAL STEEL WARES LIMITED.\n\nATC: SH\n\nPer:\nGeneral Steel Wares Limited\n\nCalgary, Alberta,\nApril 13, 1949.\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCARDSTON, Alberta.\n\nATTENTION: Mr. R. D. Ragan\nSuperintendent\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou called at our office yesterday and left with us, for the writer's attention, our quotation of April 1st.\n\nOn Page 3A, #21 Centre Fire Chef Jr. Range with Double Deck and High Shelf is the one on which we quoted you - $655.00, with Double Deck High Shelf Extra at $67.00, special Waterfront, if required $19.50. We hope this clears the matter for you, and are returning the quotation herewith.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGENERAL STEEL WARES LIMITED.\n\nPer:\n\nATC:SH\nEncls.\n\nBLOOD INDIAN AGENCY\nSUPERINTENDENT'S\nAPR 16 1949\nOffice\nCARDSTON, ALTA.\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA, Ont.\n\nReference your letter of the 10th instant, file 750-5 (E.l) and the request for a laundry press for the Blood Indian Residential School.\n\nHaving in mind the monies allocated for this school and equipment that must be purchased, Father LeFranco and I have gone over everything very carefully and have mutually agreed on the following expenditures:\n\n**Equipment:**\n\n- Stove (Tenders attached) $622.00\n- Linoleum (Tenders Attached) $748.00\n- Built-in Refrigerator (Tenders Att.) $1100.00\n- Necessary construction work, material and wiring for same $300.00\n- Showers for boys' and girls' baths $250.00\n\nTotal $3080.00\n\n**Repairs:**\n\n- Patch cement floors in boys' playroom and girls' bath $500.00\n\nIn this expenditure you will note there is nothing left for a laundry press and the Principal and I have agreed that the work as outlined is more urgent, and the press will have to wait.\n\n**Stove:** Reference your letter 750-5 (E.l) of March 25th. Enclosed are two quotations, one from General Steel Wares and one from Electrical Wholesalers. It is respectfully requested that Coal Range No. RO SL at a price of $622.00 f.o.b. Lethbridge, Alta., and with three ovens and left hand firebox be ordered from the Electrical Wholesalers Ltd., 532 - 7th Ave. West, Calgary. This stove can be shipped to Lethbridge by C.P.R. and picked up there by the school truck.\n\n**Linoleum:** This is badly needed for cement playground floors in the main school building and will save wear and tear on shoe leather, and serves as well as being much cleaner and quieter. Two quotations are submitted for this 400 square yards of linoleum. One quotation from J.H. Ashdown Ltd. at $1.97 sq. yd. and one from Breck Co. Ltd., Calgary at $1.97 sq. yd. It is respectfully requested that 400 sq. yds. A gauge, Brown battleship linoleum be\nordered at $1.87 sq.yd., or $745.00. This line can be picked up in Calgary, by the School truck to save freight.\n\nRefrigerator:- The present refrigerator or cold box at this school is adequate for milk and small articles of food only. A Walk-in freezer, where large quantities of meat and other perishables can be kept is essential as this school do their own killing of beef and pork and must have adequate space to keep it. We have an extra room off the kitchen where this freezer can be located and it is respectfully requested that an expenditure of $1410.00 be allowed at once for the installation; the school will bear any costs over and above this amount.\n\nWe recommend that the enclosed tender of the Bruce Robinson Electric Ltd., of Calgary, in the amount of $1110.00, be accepted for the equipment installed plus insulation. It is also requested that an accountable cheque of $300.00 be forwarded this office toward building the Walk-in cooler, applying insulation, installing plumbing, wiring etc. Local labour will be supplied and the accountable advance will be used to pay wages as far as it will go after which the school will take over.\n\nShowers:- It is our wish to install showers in the boys and girls' bathrooms and an amount of $250.00 is left for this. Tenders will be secured and forwarded for this work in the near future.\n\nRepairs:- The repairing of the cracked and heaving cement floors of this school was begun last year, and is not near finished. We have reserved the total amount allowed for repairs - $600.00 for repairing and patching the cement floors in the boys' and girls' bathrooms. Tenders will be submitted for this necessary work at a later date.\n\nWe hope that the Department will agree with our plan of spending funds allocated for this school this fiscal year. Father LaFrance is very co-operative and has agreed to do much work at the school from his own funds. It would be appreciated if authority could be given for this work as soon as possible. We would especially like to begin work on the Walk-in freezer at once.\n\n(R.D. Ragas)\nSuperintendent\n\nAtt:\n\nRDR/S\n\ncc to: G.H.

D. Ragun,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nBlood (R.C.) Indian Residential School.\n\nI have just received a letter from Father Lafrance and am sending it to you for comment. You will recall our previous letter and I presume that if you agree, we will receive a requisition for the insulation board required. If you will get prices from local firms and mention this on your requisition, it will certainly speed up action on the part of the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nI presume you will submit a similar requisition if you feel that similar work is required at St. Paul's School.\n\nWould you please return Father Lafrance's letter to me when you are replying to this.\n\nThe desks, beds, mattresses, sheets and blankets have all been ordered and should arrive in the near future.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard B. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEnc.\nBlood R.C. Indian School\nCardston, Alta\nJuly 7th, 1949.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary\nSup. of W. Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nI must first thank you for the kind offer of assisting financially to advance our provincial champion boxer to the Dominion finals. Unfortunately, the class he was in was not competing in Vancouver. However I hope to be able in the near future to send you a picture of this Indian Boy who has shown great ability.\n\nThe work on the classroom block is at a standstill. We are expecting the \"go ahead\" signal from Ottawa. I fear that if the work is not continued immediately, the classrooms will not be ready by September. I do hope that we will soon be favoured with a favourable answer from you, telling us to finish the whole thing.\n\nI plan to have two classrooms in the basement, and I am enclosing a diagram of what divisions we plan to have in that basement. The classrooms would no doubt be dull, and even unsanitary, due to humidity if they were not finished. So would the sewing room, and the kitchen. The woodwork-shop could stay as it is. 5000 ft of stoneboard at $55.00 a thousand would take care of the material, labour and lumber partitions extra. I only wish that it would be possible for you, to see for yourself the necessity of those partitions and the finishing of the basement which we consider a minimum.\nI was given to understand by Fr. Plourde O.M.I., that you could supply us with women lay teachers from the Maritimes. I already have on the teaching staff five teachers. One more would be required. The Grey Nuns are unable to give us an additional one. Would you be so kind as to give me the address or assist me in any way in getting a teacher. We could provide accommodation (room and board) for a teacher (single).\n\nHoping that you will give us the pleasure of your visit soon.\n\nI remain\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.J. Lafrance\nO.M.I.\n\nRev. Maurice Lafrance O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA.\n\nI have your letter (Airmail) of the 13th instant, file number 750-5(E.), and also Mr. Phelan's letter of the 9th June, regarding closing in the basement of the Classroom Block with insulation board at the Blood Indian Residential School.\n\nI certainly agree that all of this work is most necessary to protect the basement of the Classroom Blocks from the extreme cold weather and from frost covering on the inside of the walls. I would recommend insulating board be applied on all outside walls to do a first-class job. I have contacted Mr. R. Weston who is at the present preparing a tender for this necessary work at both Schools and I shall submit these with a requisition as soon as it is received.\n\nI am returning Fr. LaFrance's letter as requested.\n\n(R.D.

Picurde, O.M.I., and by the Principal of the Blood Indian Residential School, this work is most necessary to complete the basement of this school and protect it from the extreme cold of the winter and to prevent frost from forming on the inside walls. These tenders will also close in the ceiling, finish off the windows with casings, trim and hardware, put baseboard around all walls, case all exposed beams and posts and generally give us a first class job. When this work is finished it will give us at the Blood Indian Residential School a first class finished Classroom Block with six classrooms, a domestic science kitchen, a sewing room, manual training room and large storage and general room, not to mention toilets, cloak room and waiting room.\n\nAs Mr. Ralph Weston has the stone board on hand to complete these two important jobs, and as he has always done a first class job for the Department, it is hoped that these two tenders can be awarded him as soon as possible, so that this work can be completed by the 1st September.\n\n(R.D.

This classroom block is being used at the present time for all class work at this school and is proving to be a wonderful asset.\n\nRegarding representations to the effect that the basement has not been properly completed we, at first, contemplated only putting partitions in the basement, which work was included in Mr. Weston's tender of the 22nd of July. However, by your letter of June 9th, file no. 750-5 (E 1) and Colonel Henry's letter of the 18th of July the question of supplying storm windows for the basement and doing something with the exposed basement walls was brought up. We replied on the 22nd of July agreeing with Father La France and Rev. Picoule that something should be done to these basements and we recommended insulating board be applied on all outside walls and ceilings in view of the fact that these basement rooms were now to be used as classrooms, etc. On the 25th of July we submitted firm tenders on completing the basements of the two classroom blocks at the Blood R.C. School and at the St. Paul's School, which were tendered by Mr. Ralph Weston and in our covering letter asked that this work be authorized. However, by night letter of the 3rd of August we were informed that no funds were available for this expenditure.\n\nWe would again strongly recommend that this work\nbe done if there are funds available and would refer you to tenders of Mr. Ralph Weston as submitted with our letter of July 25th which he will still complete at the prices tendered.\n\nAgain we certify that Mr. Weston has carried out all the work as outlined in his tender of July 22nd and the Principal of the R.C. School and myself are completely satisfied with the work done and as Mr. Weston has been waiting sometime for payment of this large account it is hoped that this can be done at your earliest convenience.\n\nR.D.

The pillars which hold up the basement floor above are badly rotted; the dirt floor is wet and smells sour and musty.\n\nAs this room is used as storage for food stuffs and other materials at the school and as the pillars must be repaired to safeguard the main building I have asked Mr. Ralph Weston to give me a tender on cleaning out this storage basement, including the musty wet soil, laying a gravel sub-floor with a complete 5 inch concrete floor over this and to replace all rotted pillars.\n\nI attach hereto his tender in the amount of $275.00 with a request that authority be given to proceed with this work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.D.

Remove old tubes from vertical boiler and replace new tubes.\n\nTo supply 1 - 5\u00bd\" tube approximately 11\u00bd\", remove old tube from Horizontal Boiler and replace new tube.\n\nSupply all material, labor and transportation charges to and from job, leaving work completed and tested in accordance with the Provincial Boilers Act., for the sum of ($668.00).\n\nYou would be expected to afford sleeping accommodations and meals for two men, for approximately three days, also if possible 3 phase 220 volt power for our portable air compressor, using a 5 H.P. motor.\n\nIf you desire us to do this work for you, we would appreciate you advising us a couple of days ahead, so that we may make the necessary arrangements for a crew and material, as we are quite busy with this type of work at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nLiberty and Welding & Boiler Works\n(SGD) G.A.

Henry, Provincial Boiler Inspector, recently made a complete inspection of all boilers on the Blood Indian Reserve.\n\nHe found that the heating boiler at the above school was in very bad shape and condemned the tubes and recommended that they be replaced immediately.\n\nAccordingly we had the Liberty Welding & Boiler Works of Lethbridge, Alberta, who are the only boiler men we know of in this part of the country, tender on the work necessary to replace these boiler tubes. A copy of their letter is attached and you will note that they will complete this tube job in accordance with the Provincial Boiler Act for the sum of $565.00.

The new Principals of the schools, as space was limited, requested that double deck bunks be supplied instead of beds. As the Parkhill Bedding was prepared to supply the double deck bunks and as these double deck bunks were more useful than the cots and as the substitution of the double deck bunks for the cots would save the Government over $328.00 we certainly did not anticipate refusal of the exchange from the Department.\n\nBefore our telegram of the 27th of October asking for authority for this substitution the double deck bunks and mattresses had already been ordered from Parkhill Bedding and had already been shipped on receipt of your letter of October 31st. The bunks have now been delivered, the children are sleeping on them, we have saved valuable space in the schools and valuable money for the Department.\n\nWe are sorry that we have again over-stepped our authority but with pressure of other business, lack of staff, etc., etc., we hope that you can understand our position. I am submitting herewith two vouchers covering purchase orders no. 48240 and 47157; you will note that voucher no. 748 on purchase order 48240 is $328.65 less than the actual purchase order. This is a saving made possible by purchasing double deck bunks for this school. By voucher no. 632 you will note that the Blood R.C.

C. Residential School\n\nThe bake oven at the above school has been giving us a great deal of trouble as of late, in that it will not build up and maintain temperature and smokes badly. To attempt to remedy this situation we called in Hall Brothers, the only Plumber in Cardston and had them work the oven over. They told me that the oven was worn and burned out but that they believed that a new fire box would make it serviceable. As bread must be baked, I told them to repair the oven as an emergency measure so that it could again be used.\n\nHall Brothers installed a complete new fire box, Y pipe, and made other small repairs to the cost of $375.25 for the oven and still no build up temperature or hold it, and on windy days, which is practically 90% of the time here, the oven smokes so badly that it drives the sister cooks from the kitchen. We have again had Hall Brothers look at the oven and they now tell me that they have done all they possibly can to make this oven work and that the only solution is a new oven.\n\nI have asked the Rev. Father LaFrance his views and he agrees with the Plumbers and requests that a 150 loaf capacity coal fire oven be purchased immediately. The Rev. Principal is now buying bread and if it is at all possible to replace the oven at the Blood R. C. Indian Residential School this fiscal year, we would certainly recommend that it be done.\n\nR. D.

Indian Residential School\n\nWe are becoming quite concerned regarding\nthe expenditures at the schools in the Blood Agency,\ndue to the fact that Superintendent Ragan apparently\nconsiders that it is unnecessary to obtain authority\nfor expenditures before authorizing them.\n\nThe latest instance arises in connection with\nthe bake oven at the Blood R.C. Residential School.\nMr. Ragan advises us that the oven was giving trouble\nand in an attempt to remedy the situation he arranged\nwith Hall Brothers to install a new fire box, \"y\"\npipe and other small repairs at a cost of $375.25. No\nauthority was requested from this office before\nincurring this expenditure.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would interview\nSuperintendent Ragan in connection with expenditures\nthat are charged to the appropriation for Indian\nEducation, as he should be made to understand that he\nshould consult you in order that you can communicate\nwith the Department when such action is necessary.\n\nBernard F.

Residential School, Blood Reserve.\n\nBy authority of your letter 750-5 (E.1) of November 12th, an amount of $368.00 was approved for this work. The contractors, by an error in measurement had to supply more tubing than contracted for to complete this job. The job had to be completed, and Father LaFrance informed me that if the Department would not accept the extra $28.56 charge, he would see that it was paid.\n\nAs a first class job has been done on these boilers, and as the extra to contract item of $28.56 was most necessary, it is hoped that the Department will approve this Voucher in its entirety.\n\nR.D.

He sites specifically the instance of an installation of a new fire box, etc., in a bake oven of the N.C. School, at a cost of $375.25.\n\nYou are well aware that this is not the only instance, or in my opinion, the most flagrant case where you have not asked for authority before proceeding with the purchase or repairs which amounted to a considerable expenditure. It should be unnecessary for me to again remind you that such procedure is wrong despite the fact that you have always had a very logical explanation for doing so. In future, you shall make no expenditure without first consulting this office, or wiring direct to the Superintendent of Education for authority. If you appeal to this office in the first instance, I can tell you now that I will not authorize any expenditure of major proportion, unless it is extremely urgent, without first wiring the Superintendent.\n\nI regret that this is necessary, and I am satisfied that Colonel Neary has been long-suffering for the reason that he believed that you were so enthusiastic and sincere in your desire to see proper conditions and progress in these schools, and delayed bringing it to my attention until now.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.

School in respect to plumbing account which he incurred without any authority. You will note he asked that at least part of the total be paid from public funds.\n\nApparently Mr. Clark, the Educational Survey Officer and Mr. Battle, Field Agent, who were making an inspection of the school were shown a battery of wash basins which Rev. Father LaFrance was congratulating himself for having located at the Pearce R.C.A.F. Training School. When the Superintendent stated he wondered if more could be gotten as they were badly needed at the St. Paul's Residential School, on the Reserve, the Rev. Father asked if authority had been given to purchase these for St. Paul's and the answer was in the affirmative!\n\nIn submitting this for your consideration, I am advised by Superintendent Ragan that these plumbing fixtures are something along the same line as were needed.\n\nWith Best Season's Greetings,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.

Hence the need for additional bathroom facilities.\n\nThe same condition existed for the boys. This is far from being the complete bill for the installation. Mr. Weston has presented me with a bill for $1,975.00 for divisions and alterations of which I have already paid $975.00.\n\nThe congratulations of Mr. Gooderham and Mr. Clark on this initiative would mean little if I were not to get assistance in footing this bill.\n\nI think it would be only fair if the Department would pay the plumbing bill.

Ragan,\nSuperintendent,\nBlood Indian Reserve.\n\nCopy for Mr. Gooderham\nCardston, Alberta.\nDecember 28th, 1949.\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Fire Protection - Residential Schools.\n\nThe fire equipment and facilities at the two Residential Schools on the Blood Reserve are certainly not all that is to be desired and has given this office some worry.\n\nOn a visit of the LaFrance-Foamite Representative, he was requested to view the two schools on this Reserve and give me his recommendation as regards fire equipment; I attach hereto his recommendation for your information, please. I also attach a copy of a letter from Mr. D. S. Pitts, Principal of the St. Paul's School also regarding Fire Protection for his school.\n\nWe realize that funds are limited at Ottawa and that the recommendations of the LaFrance Representative possibly can not be carried out at this time, but these letters are forwarded to give the department a picture of things as they now exist.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) R.

One 25 gallon Model C.A. Foamite extinguisher discharges over 25 gallons of fire smothering Firefoam in one minute at an effective range of 25 feet. The range allows an operator to stand back in safety and comfort and the rapid application of volume allows him to smother a large fire very quickly. Foamite Firefoam clings to any burning surface, vertical or horizontal, and floats on volatile liquids forming an airtight blanket which extinguishes the fire by both cooling and smothering.\n\nFoamite Firefoam is as non-damaging as clear water, will not irritate the delicate membranes of the eye, ear or throat and can be swallowed without ill effect. While it will dampen slightly it does not soak and can be safely used around patterns and ply woods without causing warping. Foamite Firefoam may stain slightly office stationery but the information recorded thereon will not be obliterated. To remove Fireform simply scrape off excess and allow remainder to dry, then brush or wipe off.\n\nThe Carbon tetrachloride (vaporizing liquid) type of extinguisher should only be used out in the open where there is abundant fresh air and room for the operator to keep clear of the gases. Carbon tetrachloride has no quenching effect on fire. It turns to gases when in contact with heat diluting the oxygen in the surrounding air. The two chief gases formed are chlorine and phosgene, both are military poisons and both are corrosive, and the harm they may do is not immediately apparent. Breathing these gases is exceedingly dangerous, slight amounts over a period of time cause hardening of the liver, amount sufficient to make a person dizzy leave one susceptible to pneumonia for a period of six weeks and heavier concentration can cause death within a few hours.\n\nI will call on you on my next visit to Cardston in the not too distant future.\n\nYours very truly\n\nLA FRANCE FIRE ENGINE AND FOAMITE LIMITED\n\nC.

The wire and poles are now buried under the snow to the Church and the Cottage and will constitute a hazard with the coming of mild weather and moisture.\n\nThe cost of the two items as mentioned will be Seven Hundred and Eighty Dollars or less. Any reduction in this price will be credited for labor supplied in the erection of the outside wiring line.\n\nThanking you for the privilege of serving you, we are,\n\nYours truly,\n\nMODERN HOME ELECTRIC,\n\nS.W. Low\nCardston, Alberta,\nJanuary 18, 1950.\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Blood R. C. Residential School\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of November 24/49, file 750-5 (E.1), regarding electrical wiring at the above school. Since my letter regarding the electrical wiring situation at this school the outside wire and poles gave way during one of our bad blizzards and the wire and poles are now buried in 6 feet of snow. This is a 220 volt line and something must be done to put this wiring up out of danger before moisture seeps into the wires. Father Lafrance still has no electricity to his Gymnasium as the Calgary Power Company will not connect this building until a larger panel and Service Entrance is installed, as they claim the present equipment is even now over-taxed.\n\nFollowing your letter of November 24th, I have had Modern Home Electric look this electrical work over with a view to connecting the Gymnasium and repairing the outside wiring, which in the Principals and my opinion is very minimum that must be done. I attach hereto their letter, tendering a price of $750.00 on a new entrance and repairing outside wiring.\n\nIf sufficient funds are available it is hoped that this work can be approved.\n\nR. D. Ragan\nSuperintendent,\nBlood Indian Reserve.\nJanuary 27, 1950.\n\nMr. R.D. Rugan,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nRe: Blood R.C.

The results have been gratifying. While last year we had several cases of truancy, there has not yet been a single case this year.\n\nWhereas last year we had the boys and girls in separate classes, this year we have them divided by grades only, to the advantage of both, the pupils and teachers.\n\nThis could not have been accomplished without the work that has been done in the main building.\n\nI do hope therefore that the Department will be favorable to our demand.\n\nWith all best wishes, dear Mr. Neary,\n\nI remain sincerely Yours\n\nMaurice J.

I think this would be the most practical for us.\n\nMy most sincere thanks, Mr. Neary, for the latest raise in the grant. As you know the prices have steadily been climbing and things were really getting to be difficult.

Only conduit could be used in this wiring. For the outlets for work shops the same idea applies, making safe outlets for shop purposes. In the passage ways and entrances we followed the instructions of the Inspector in order to comply with the Electrical Code of Canada and believe it to be in the best interest of safety.\n\nNone of the work included in the extras was considered in the estimate of the original contract but found to be necessary as the work progressed and was done at the request of the parties in charge of the schools and construction, in order to complete the jobs.\n\nWe trust that you will find the work satisfactory in every respect and thank you for the privilege of serving you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMODERN HOME ELECTRIC,\n\nS.W.

Limited.\n\nABC:ES\n\n[Signature]\nSALES DEPARTMENT.\nSteel vs. Brick Ovens\n\nSteel Ovens have during the past ten years come into great favor because first, of the great improvements made in their construction and secondly, because they are much cheaper than the smaller and medium size brick oven. The smaller size brick oven is more expensive to install an work with than the steel oven. However, the building of a large expensive stationary brick oven often in rented or leased premises.\n\nSteel ovens have another very important advantage and that is their portability. They can be removed from one location to another without any loss of time whereas against brick ovens, where very little can be saved except when they have to be torn down and re-erected.\n\nThe building of a good first class brick oven, especially one which will stand up to the severe conditions of temperature fluctuations and heat stress, requires a great deal of skill in design and foundations, general vibration, wear and tear, is very costly and often many times the cost of the most portable steel or combination type of oven.\n\nExperience has shown that a brick oven as described above will last at least fifteen years and with trimmings and high freight can easily exceed $350.00. Some of the heavy duty ovens built by Kipp-Kelly in Western Canada cost from $1000.00 to $6000.00.\n\nLarge semi-portable steel ovens can be shipped at costs considerably less than $200.00 and is roughly half that of the average first class brick oven.\n\nIt is therefore, much more economical for the smaller baker to install the steel oven, which will give him the same capacity and enable him at the stage when his business requires capacity in excess of what is able to be handled by the brick oven.\n\nWe have seen with our own eyes the value of brick ovens. We build brick ovens that are second to none on the market and sell exclusively to those who require large capacities and where the necessary capital is available. We believe however, in building only brick ovens which are properly designed and have enough bricks in them, that they will store heat and maintain a high baking temperature all at the same time stand up for a good many years.\n\nThis Bulletin is, therefore, devoted only to the description of our semi-portable and all portable hot air and electric ovens.\n\nMETHOD OF RAVEN\n\nThe majority of the portable ovens, except the small electric ones, are built on single leaf pans, strapped in fours, whose outside sizes do not exceed 4' x 8'. These pans are usually constructed of old cuttings of single pans set closely together or double pans, not strapped. Our ovens, however, are therefore, constructed of double leaf pans. Our double deck oven holds actually only 102 single leaves, strapped in fours, but the oven is built so that the pans may be closed together. Some oven builders still use the old method of building them on the same conservative basis, as above.\n\nThis means that our 300 leaf double deck oven measures 7' x 14', while the same size brick oven will hold only 340 leaves, so we build a 302 leaf oven whose inside deck dimensions are 9'6\" x 7'1\".\n\nGUARANTEE\n\nWe guarantee every oven built and designed by us to perform exactly as built and designed, to be economical in the use of fuel, either coke or wood, and to be free from defects in materials. Our portable ovens built of standard steel plate or special cast iron, are guaranteed against rusting, warping, cracked metal, etc., and can supply ovens also with enamelled or plated exteriors, etc.\n\nFINANCING\n\nOur financing department will arrange, if required, an easy payment plan for purchasing Kipp-Kelly Semi-Portable Hot Air Double Deck Ovens, thus enabling bakers having limited means and allowing the ovens to pay for themselves.\n\nKipp-Kelly Semi-Portable Hot Air Double Deck Ovens\n\nEQUIPPED WITH OUR OWN EXCLUSIVE FLUE SYSTEM\n\nExtra heavy construction throughout, the best materials being used. Our Flue System not only saves money but also reduces the weight of the oven units, thereby making these ovens very economical. Coal, Coke or Wood can be used for Fuel with equal success. Baking and firing can be done at the same time. No long waiting periods between batches. Extra heavy construction throughout, complete with brick lining on sides of decks inside, for additional heat storage.\n\nSupplied in four sizes of the following specifications:\n\n| MODEL | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 |\n|-------|----|----|----|----|\n| CAPACITY | 110 | 192 | 300 | 392 |\n| SIZE OF DECKS INSIDE | 6' x 4' | 7' x 5' | 9' x 6' | 10' x 7' |\n| TOTAL WEIGHT | 1000 lbs. | 1600 lbs. | 2000 lbs. | 2500 lbs. |\n| APPROX.

All Ready Ovens can be supplied with ordinary floor pans, just existing coppered steel and stainless steel or mound metal, plain or polished or white or colored enamelled steel exterior.\nAll Steel Portable Double Deck Bake Ovens\n\nThese ovens are built with the same exclusive Kipp-Kelly flue system, as furnished with our semi-portable and brick ovens.\n\nKipp-Kelly Electric Ovens\n\nOur electric oven possesses two distinct and important features; each deck has its own independent and individual top and bottom heating element and both top and bottom are completely covered by a smooth enamel finish, the best available.\n\nThe fact that each deck is heated by its own elements means that in a two deck oven, even different kinds of goods can be baked at the same time, all different temperatures. For instance, the bottom deck could be heated to 350\u00b0 F., the lower deck to 300\u00b0 F., and the top deck to 250\u00b0 F. Each deck is heated independently, thus eliminating hot spots which will not transmit heat. Independent deck construction is also economical, as a baker can easily replace any deck, without having to replace the entire oven.\n\nThere facilities are not available in the case of an ordinary oven where between deck elements serve a double purpose, both top and bottom heat. The deck which is being heated by the deck above is a very common construction, even for the oven builder but not for the baker.\n\nOur top element is exposed in the open deck. We have a special reason for this, as it makes the baking of light goods easier. When quick top heat was required to put color on some goods being baked, the baker would have to send that heat down through a layer of brick it would take considerably longer and would do more harm than good. With our open top heat is applied when it is wanted and as soon as the current is turned off the oven is allowed to cool.\n\nHaving the top elements exposed in the deck is not in any way harmful, as they will last for years. We know of ovens which have had their elements replaced fifteen years of service, are still in good condition.\n\nWe have always believed that the only way to get an absolutely even distribution of heat is to have the elements cover the whole inside deck top and bottom. This is why we use two elements in each deck which cover only a small space, hot and cold spots are bound to result.\n\nOur electric oven construction is much more expensive than other types, but it is our desire to produce the finest oven possible, one superior in design, flexible and economical in operation and which will enable the baker to turn out a superior product.\n\nOur Heavy Duty Electric Ovens can also be supplied with brick lining on the sides of the decks, usable for additional storage space. While this will cut down the capacity somewhat, some bakers have found that the extra storage space is extremely valuable for baking light goods after the bread has been baked, without additional currents.\n\nWe manufacture every part of our electric ovens in our own shop with the exception of the switches. This enables us to closely supervise every part, assuring the highest Canadian workmanship and construction throughout.\n\n| MODEL | 30 | 31 | 32 | 33 |\n|-------|----|----|----|----|\n| CAPACITY | 180 | 140 | 102 | 300 |\n| SIZE OF DECK | 10\" x 43\" | 6\" x 4' | 7\" x 5' | 8\" x 8'9\" |\n| SIZE OF INSIDE | 9\" x 42\" | 5\" x 4' | 6\" x 5' | 7\" x 8'9\" |\n| APPROX.

We have built them the result of many years of study, experience and recommendations of prominent users. Everything has been done to make them good deals to be desired; they might have been good for others but not for the bakers or the trade.\n\nOur outstanding feature accounts for the great success of our electric. First, each deck has its own independent control, which is completely separate and independent of the others. The heating elements cover the whole deck, so that each deck can be heated independently. Secondly, the oven is constructed of cast iron, which is very strong and durable.\n\nElectric Cake, Pastry or Hotel Oven\n\nWe build this model of Electric Oven in three sizes, that can be shipped by any type of transportation. They are ideal for bakeries requiring the large quantity of goods than even our smallest oven will turn out.\n\nThese ovens heat up very quickly, are very flexible and have met with the greatest favor wherever installed.\n\nBuilt in four sizes, both double and three deck types. Even though our elements cover the whole deck, our ovens do not draw any more current than other makes.\n\nNote that our Switchbox is at the front of the oven within easy reach of the operator. This also permits the oven to be increased side by side without any part being put in from the front. This will save considerable space where more than one oven is installed.\n\nMODEL | 8 | 10 | 11 | 12\n---|---|---|---|---\nSIZE OF DECK | 3' x 4' | 6' x 4' | 7' x 5' | 8' x 6'\nHEATING SURFACE | 6' x 4' | 12' x 4' | 15' x 5' | 18' x 6'\nFLOOR SPACE | 6' x 4' | 12' x 4' | 15' x 5' | 18' x 6'\nWEIGHT | 3,000 lbs. | 6,000 lbs. | 9,000 lbs. | 12,000 lbs.\nNO.

If it is removed to another location, it must be taken down and rebuilt.\n\nWe enclose our bulletin on ovens for your files. You will note that both a semi-portable and a portable oven are illustrated. However, this is hardly according to fact with respect to the portable oven, for, as stated above, it has to be built in and does not come in sections for easy setting-up or taking-down. The interior of the oven is practically all brick and cement.\n\nFor your general information, the price on our 200-loaf semi-portable oven is $1800.00; the 300-loaf $2100.00; the 400-loaf $2500.00. All of these prices are f.o.b. Winnipeg, Sales Tax not included; neither do they include the base or foundation for the oven which must be built on the job. Our price, however, does include the labor for erection, but the transportation and living expenses of our erector must be paid by the customer while he is on the job.\n\nWe are sorry that we cannot quote on the present inquiry but hope to have better success with your future tenders.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nKIPP KELLY LIMITED,\n\nGeo.

TO APPEAR ON ALL PACKAGES AND INVOICES.\nMarch 16th, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nRe: Purchase Order 47157, Your File 95255-4-38\nBlood R.C. Indian Residential School\n\nThe above placed an order with the Parkhill Bedding Limited for 30 beds and 30 mattresses for the above mentioned school. Before this equipment was delivered, there was a change in Principals, and the new Principal decided that it would be preferable to have double decker bunks, which would occupy less floor space.\n\nIn the case of the Blood Residential School, securing the bunks made it possible to provide sleeping accommodation for 10 more children than by providing the 30 beds. This change was made by the Principal himself without first consulting the Department, although it is understood that he consulted the Indian Superintendent. We have pointed out to both these officials that they had no authority to make the change without first obtaining official approval.\n\nHowever, the bunks are now in use at the school, and I would appreciate it if you would change the Purchase Order to read bunks instead of beds, in order that the account will be accepted by the Treasury Branch. I attach the account and you will notice that the firm charge Sales Tax and that the Principal paid the difference between the total of the original Purchase Order, namely $772.50, and the total of the Voucher, namely $780.00.\n\nBernard F.

Indian Residential School, Cardston, Alta.\n\nAs the use of double-deck bunks is proving more satisfactory than that of single institutional beds, and as the price of $15.50 per bunk seems reasonable to us, it is our opinion that the account of Parkhill Bedding Ltd., Calgary, should be submitted to Treasury for payment.\n\nH.

Pitts\nFather Lafrance\n\nI have been instructed to advise you that the Department will not, in future, assume responsibility for expenditures incurred without express authority first had and obtained from the Department.\n\nIf an occasion should arise at your school when certain work should be performed, including the repair and upkeep of and alterations to buildings or purchase or repair of equipment, or any other expenditure which you consider should be borne by the Department, either in whole or in part, you must first contact the Superintendent of the Blood Agency for authority to perform the work or to make the purchase. It may follow that the Superintendent himself will then have to obtain authority from his headquarters. His authority to make local purchases is very limited, and invariably he must seek higher authority unless the occasion for the expenditure is a real emergency. An emergency occurs when immediate action is required that cannot wait for wired communication and authority from either the Regional Supervisor or Ottawa. Such occasions, I am sure you agree, arise very rarely.\n\nAlthough it is obvious that departmental estimates completed each summer for the following fiscal year should be complete insofar as they concern your school, you understand of course, that because an item is placed in the Blood Agency Estimates for Educational vote is no assurance whatsoever that the expenditure will be allowed. It is often necessary to scale down such estimates at Ottawa to an amount that we can reasonably expect the taxpayers of Canada to bear.\nApril 4th, 1950.\n\nMr. R.D. Regan,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nRe: Blood R.C. Indian Residential School\n\nWe are returning unpaid your Voucher 226 issued in favour of Hall Brothers, Cardston, Alberta, for work done at the residential school without authorization.\n\nCareful consideration has been given to this account, but as you are aware, the expenditure was incurred without consulting the Department, and we feel that the account will have to be paid from school funds.\n\nWe have noted the contents of your letter of February 14th to the Principals of both the Blood and St. Paul's Schools, and we have also noted the letter from Father LaFrance acknowledging receipt of your communication, and expressing the intention of following its contents in the future.\n\nBernard F.

Since the beginning of the year I have written three letters, and up to now have received no acknowledgement.\n\nLast summer I was informed that we would have to increase the pupilage by some fifty pupils. This of course meant alterations and enlargements of dormitories and new facilities for play-rooms. All this I have done with the tacit approval of Mr. Gooderham and the Superintendent.\n\nIt seemed only logical that it was necessary to have separate play-rooms for both senior and junior girls and boys and that these new rooms would need toilets. I am sure that I would have been condemned by Ottawa had I packed 130 girls in a single playroom 30x30. Same situation for the boys.\n\nIn all this I acted in good faith, now I see that I am considered just short of a criminal at Ottawa. What is more, I was given to understand that I should do my utmost to provide better class facilities, and improve recreational program etc.... It would be too long to tell you all that has been done in that time; I will only mention that I have built a gymnasium 90 X 50 without any special aid from the Department. All assistance was refused.\n\nAs for classes, things have been improved to such an extent that the pupils, believe it or not, like their class work. As proof of that, in the past year we had over thirty cases of truancy, while this year we did not have a single case. What is more surprising is that there were only five pupils late in coming back after the Christmas holidays, this was because of illness.\n\nIt is rather discouraging now to see that I am condemned for having made improvements at the school and that I am refused all assistance when I was ordered to take more pupils. I felt it only logical to go ahead and provide accommodation for them. The absolutely\nindispensable alterations and improvements amounted to some $4,000. All I am asking the Department is to help me with at least half the amount.\n\nWould you kindly let me know if any money has been voted this year for reparations to our school. If so, could part of that money cover the expenses of last year?\n\nI was given to understand that we could requisition to Ottawa for a 16 mm projector. Please let me know if I am right in assuming that we can obtain from the Department either a Victor 60 or B & H 16mm sound projector.\n\nIn closing I can assure you dear Mr. MacKay, that I have only one thing at heart and that is to make our children happy so they will study well and eventually become good Canadian citizens.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nMaurice J.

Aff.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Henry:\n\nHerewith you will find a copy of a letter to Mr. Regan, the local superintendent.\n\nThese are the items which I deem necessary for undertaking successfully a new school year.\n\nMr. Regan was telling me that Ottawa had agreed on a grant of $1,000.00 for a new bakery & woodwork shop. This naturally falls far short of the required amount necessary to install our new bakery & build a woodwork shop, but I am ready to foot the remainder of the bill.\n\nOur bathing facilities are also very inadequate. For the $40.00 we will have in September, we have only 2 bathtubs here and $40.00 dollars is a very conservative estimate of the amount necessary to have adequate showers. But I will be satisfied with that.\n\nI hope that these estimates will go through as soon as possible, so that we can do the work during the holidays, to be ready by September 1st to start again for another successful year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.J. [signature]\nCardston, Alberta,\nJune 29th, 1950.\n\nMr. G. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n507 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nRe: Bake Oven\nBlood R. C. Res. School.\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of March 29th, file 104/6-1-1, which quoted a telegram from Col. Neary regarding exchange of a Bake Oven and authorizing up to $1000.00 for structural changes at the Blood School to handle the larger Bake Oven.\n\nFather Lafrance and I have gone over this problem thoroughly and we have the following recommendation to offer. It is suggested that the present Manual Training Shop in the new classroom block of this school be made into the Bake Room. This room lends itself very well to this as the large chimney of the classroom block is on one of the walls, the room is well lighted and very handy to the dining room and kitchen, the straight changes required to make this room into a Bake Room would be practically nil. This would, of course, provide other room for Manual Training, interest in which is growing very rapidly at this school. For this we mean to build an entirely new work shop behind the present school gymnasium, this shop to be designed for all modern power tools and so forth. This new work shop, of course, will cost much more than the $1000.00 allowed by the Department, but Father Lafrance is willing to pay all costs of this building above the $1000.00 from school funds.\nWe whole heartedly recommend this procedure to the Department as it will give a much needed building for the Manual Training Class, provide beautiful, large, well lighted Bake Room and all at a minimum cost to the Department. If authorized, it is recommended that the $1000.00 allotted be forwarded this office as an accountable cheque so that Father Lafance may begin construction as soon as possible and during the holidays.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

Residential School.\n\nMay we refer to your letter of the 30th May, file 103/6-1-1 regarding the above.\n\nThe boiler at the Blood R. C. School was temporarily repaired by welding but it is now leaking badly again and there is no doubt but what it must be replaced.\n\nI attach hereto a requisition in quadruplicate covering a replacement for this boiler and an estimate of $328.00; this cost was given by J. C. Edgar and Sons, Plumbers, Macleod, Alta.\n\nIt is hoped that this boiler can be replaced during the holidays.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. D. Ragan,\nSuperintendent,\nBlood Indian Reserve,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration.\n\nRDE/LR\nEnc1\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Blood R.C. Residential School.\n\nRef: Boiler - I am attaching copy of a letter received from Superintendent Ragan to which he attaches a requisition for Windsor Tank Water Heater needed for the above school. The old tank is apparently in very poor repair. It developed a leak in May and we authorized repairs at a cost of $25.00. I concur with Mr. Ragan's recommendation that the tank be replaced.\n\nRef: Bake Oven - You will recall that a new bake oven was supplied in March by the Brantford Oven & Rack Company. In your Army Signal of March 26th, 1950, your file 750-5 (E 1), you asked what part of this school the new addition would be added to accommodate the oven. At that time it was understood that the cost of material and labour would not exceed $1,000.00. I am now attaching copy of Mr. Ragan's letter of June 29th in which he recommends that the present manual training shop in the new classroom block be converted for use as a bake room. In order to make this room available, it will be necessary to construct another room for manual training. Principal Rev. Father La France would be prepared to bear a portion of the cost of this new workshop over and above the $1,000.00 which the Department was to have paid to construct the bake room. I hope that you can provide the $1,000.00 in the form of accountable advance but if this is not possible, please advise in what manner you wish the project to be handled.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Education Service.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nReverend Father Lafrance, principal of the Blood R.C. Indian Residential School, is very anxious to have a sufficient quantity of paint to refresh up the school and particularly the new school-block which has not as yet received any paint at all. He mentions that 80 Gals interior white flat wall paint is necessary for this work, and he says that he will supply the labour if it is forwarded immediately.\n\nHe has asked his agent to forward this order to the Department, but wanted me to relay it to your office so as to expedite its shipment.\n\nTo following is a list of his requirements for the present year:\n\n- 5700 sq. yds of Battleship Linoleum\n- 2 Sewing Machines\n- $300.00 grant for installation of showers\n- 1 Extractor for Laundry\n- 1 Zone Air Dryer\n- 1 Laundry Press, 6 ft. in.

It is stated that there are only three bath tubs in this school. Do you recommend the installation just mentioned.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nJuly 17, 1950.\n\nMr. G.H.

The information given on the requisition was not sufficient to allow us to place the matter before the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nWe cannot see why the Principal of the school suggests placing the bakery in the new classroom block. We do not approve of this suggestion. However, we are prepared to allow $1000. for material and labour to construct a bake-room if you consider it is necessary. If it is decided to proceed with the expenditure of the $1000. just mentioned, it will be necessary to have a requisition forwarded for the materials required and you should also inform us regarding the name and address of the person who is to do the work.\n\nBernard F.

Residential School.\n\nFollowing discussion in your office regarding the above I wish to elaborate a bit on the proposed changes at the Blood R. C. School. Possibly the Department misunderstood when we suggested that the Bake room of this school should be transferred to the classroom block; we should have stated to the basement of the classroom block. In our opinion this basement room is an ideal bake shop, as stated in my previous letter, as it is well lighted, roomy and very handy to the Dinning room and kitchen with practically no structural changes required.\n\nI am attaching hereto a rough sketch of the proposed Manual Training Shop to be constructed to house the equipment in the Class room basement. As you know the Rev. Father Lafrance has agreed to construct this building himself, providing the Department allow him $1000.00 toward labour. Father Lafrance has the necessary lumber on hand at the present time to build this shop and if the Department would approve and could forward the $1000.00 as an accountable cheque, construction could begin immediately. It is proposed to hire a Contractor from Cardston to build the shell of the building so that it would be weather tight; it is then our plan to have the Manual\nTraining Class complete the inside of the building as to insulation, finish, tool and lumber racks etc. This would not only save construction costs but would give the class valuable training. When and if this building is completed it is Father Lafrances plan to secure more power equipment.\n\nThis arrangement is again recommended for your consideration and it is hoped that an accountable advance of the $1000.00 contribution by the Department can be forwarded without delay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. D. [Signature]\nSuperintendent\nBlood Indian Reserve,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration.\n\nRDE/LR\nEnc.\nThe matter of the bake oven has been discussed with Superintendent Ragan.

I concur in his recommendation that:\n\n(1) The bake oven be installed in one of the basement rooms of the classroom block.\n\n(2) That an Accountable Advance of $1,000.00 be supplied to pay labour required to erect the woodwork shop on the understanding that this will be the only share of the cost of construction to be borne by the Department.\n\nfor: G.H.

Indian Residential School.\n\nThe two shades are described as follows:\nThe octagonal one is shellacked after painting, and the round shade is smudge proofed with a coating of turpentine.\n\nThe value placed on these for sale is, octagonal one from $8.00 to $10.00, and the round one $7.00 to $8.00. We think this value is not too high for the quality and the idea behind the making.\n\nI may say that all the designs are free hand, no tracing at all, and apart from direction by the Teacher, Sister Le Forest, and the Rev. Father Charon, the assistant Principal, the work is entirely that of the pupils, and is done in their art class and spare time.\n\nYour interest in the sale of these will be appreciated as we believe that it will be an incentive to these pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.A.

There is no regular manual training shop for carpentry or mechanical work. The Principal is arranging to open a shop in a fair-sized frame building near the main building. This has a brick chimney, and he intends installing a coal stove to heat same, as soon as he can procure one. I looked over the building, and found it quite suitable as regards size and lighting. Brother Turcotte, to whom the Principal refers as \"Supervisor of Manual Training\" will be in charge. At present they have no tools, and I was asked if it would be in order to forward a requisition for same. My reply was, that I would certainly recommend same, and that I believe the Department would give the request their kind consideration. I expect to receive the requisition shortly, when it will be forwarded to the Department.\n\nThe girls are receiving a good training in domestic and household work. They make their own and the boys' clothing, and mend same. During the summer months they go daily, in groups of seven, under the supervision of one of the sisters, and milk cows. This work is not carried on during the winter months.\n\n(Sgd.) C.

Higgs, who has a store at Waterton Park, for a certain type of Indian made goods of a saleable type, and I viewed a number of the articles already made for this store for the coming tourist season, and they reflect great care on the part of the instructors. This work is being done in the evenings by the older girls who are enjoying this innovation. A description of the articles being made is attached as a note to my school report for this particular school.\n\nJ.E. Pugh.\nIndian Agent.\nYou will realize that the Department's wishes in regard to manual training can only be carried out with the co-operation of yourself and I feel certain that you recognize the value of this training and that the school management will provide at their own expense the space required for the classes and arrange to have some member of the staff follow the curriculum that you will receive.\n\nI understand that you have small space available for manual training purposes and Mr. Doucet advises me that it might be possible to use the basement in the Church. It is also expected that you will arrange for a member of the staff to teach the work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nAugust 8, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nAs I advised you in my letter of March 24 the Department attempted to emphasize the importance of manual training in Indian schools by having Mr. A.J. Doucet of this Branch visit your school during the past few months. At that time he outlined the policy of the Branch regarding manual training and endeavoured to explain the matter as fully as possible to your teachers.\n\nDue to present conditions it will not be possible for the Department to allow any large amount in order to encourage the teaching of manual training in your school. However, it is hoped that you will co-operate with us in having this work commence during the academic year 1941-42.\n\nTo assist you in this regard Mr. Doucet is preparing a curriculum covering woodwork especially which it is hoped will be followed at your school during the coming academic term.\n\nAt the time of his visit Mr. Doucet made a careful check on the equipment that you have and has made definite recommendations to me regarding the additional equipment which he considers should be supplied in order to carry out the curriculum that you will receive. The cost of these tools will be borne by the Department and in addition you may expend an amount of $25.00 for necessary material.\n\nRev. P.A.

As you are aware, it was completely understood that monthly reports showing the progress of the work at this school would be forwarded to us at the end of each month. None has yet been received.\n\nI should appreciate receiving an immediate reply outlining what you have done and, if no action has been taken, you should state why you are unable to co-operate with the Department in this very important matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Indian Residential School dated February 10, 1942.\n\nMANUAL TRAINING\n\nGood work is being done in this line: It has been found that the work shop -- a separate building from the main school building -- is cold in winter and rather difficult to heat, for which reason work in this room is not being carried on during cold weather. The Principal has prepared plans for enlarging this building, which will double the floor space. This will be properly finished, lined inside and insulated, and a proper floor laid. When arranged, it will comprise a number of ordinary carpenter's work benches, a forge, anvil, vice and bench, etc., and will have double doors to allow a truck, tractor, or other smaller-sized farm machinery to be brought inside for repairing or overhauling at any time of the year. The shop is now equipped with an electric welding unit. The tools now in use are well cared for and kept in separate lockers. There is a fair supply of material -- boards, planks, etc. -- on hand.

Charron, Principal of the Blood Residential School, at Cardston, Alberta.\n\nIt is noted from Reverend P.A. Charron's letter that he would be interested in purchasing a Landis Stitcher and Finisher for repair of boots on hand in Calgary, and also a patching machine for the repair of uppers.\n\nUp to date of writing we have not knowledge of these machines having been declared surplus, and until we receive a Declaration we shall not be in a position to go further into this matter. We note, however, that Reverend Charron was notified by Captain K.D. Jones, Calgary, that these machines were available, and that he would notify Ottawa accordingly.\n\nWe do not know who Captain K.D. Jones is, and it will be of assistance to us in tracing this matter if you could advise us in whose possession these machines are at the moment, and which of the Services will be declaring them surplus.

They are under the care of Captai Captain K.D. Jones, officer in charge of Returned Ordnance Stores, No 2 Wireless Training School, Calgary, Alberta. During that same visit I have found out that although these machines are in the stores at the present time, they have not been declared surplus material by the higher Services. That may be the reason why Mr. F.E Buckley has not been able to locate the machines. It is sure however that Ottawa has been notified that this material was surplus at the Calgary Returned Ordnance Stores.\n\nI am very grateful that you have given this your prompt attention and I sincerely hope that our efforts will not remain fruitless.

The inquiry, however, shall not be delayed more than 72 hours after the time at which it would otherwise be held, to enable them to attend it.\n\nIf the Indian Agent is located at such a distance from the school as to make it impracticable for him to attend the Board, he shall request a responsible local resident to act for him. A suitable person for this duty would be a Justice of the Peace or a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted or Provincial Police. A more or less permanent arrangement of this kind might be necessary in some cases. The Department is prepared to pay a reasonable fee for this duty, on the Agent's recommendation. The report of the Board, in any case, must reach the Department through the Indian Agent's office.\n\nThis inquiry is not designed to take the place of, or prevent, any other inquiry, including an inquest, which may be required by law.\n\nIf the pupil died as the result of an accident, the Indian Agent is required to take the statements of the witnesses of the accident, and attach them to this memorandum.\n\nFORM NO. 414.\nA.

He was fully recovered and was attending school again. The measles were very mild being that of the German type.\n\nOn May 13 he was taken suddenly ill again; and was at once transferred to the Blood Hospital.

It has been approved by the Vital Statistics Section of the Canadian Public Health Association and also by the Deputy Registrar of births, deaths and marriages of each province.\n\n(2) Physician's Statement of Cause of Death.\u2014The morbid conditions relating to death are divided on the certificate into two groups. In Group I are those related to immediate cause of death; those in Group II, those causally related thereto. In most cases only one of these groups will be filled in. During certification is not desirable to enter more than one cause. In cases where this can be considered as adequate (see Example I), but where the physician finds it necessary to record more than one cause it is important that these be stated in the position provided on the form as indicative of their mutual relationship. This information is sought so that the selection of the cause for tabulation may be made in the light of the certifier's viewpoint:\n\n(a) Name first the \"Immediate Cause\" of death, i.e. the disease, injury or complication which caused death (not mode of dying or terminal condition).\n\n(b) Then give other morbid conditions (if any) of which it was the consequence, in order of causal relationship (due to) stating the most recent one first and then others in descending order.\n\n(c) Entries under Group II should be reserved for \"other important contributory morbid conditions\" in those instances particularly in which death was due to a combination of maladies, none of which would have been fatal alone. In such cases the physician's judgment alone can afford a guidance to the tabulator.\n\n(d) Use always accepted terms for morbid conditions and never record mere symptoms.\n\n(e) Maternal Deaths.\u2014Qualify all diseases resulting from childbirth, miscarriage or abortion by the word \"Puerperal,\" e.g., puerperal septicemia. Distinguish between septicaemia originating in abortion and in childbirth.\n\n(f) Cancer.\u2014In all cases the organ or part first affected should be specified.\n\n(g) Violent Deaths.\u2014Coroners, medical examiners and physicians who certify to deaths from violent causes should always clearly indicate the fundamental distinction of whether the death was due to accident, assault or homicide, and then state the manner and nature of injury. The circumstances of each accident should be stated as fully as possible. Any automobile accident should always be designated as such.\n\nThe following examples illustrate the essential principles in the use of the form.\n\n| Immediate Cause | Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3 | Example 4 | Example 5 |\n|-----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n|                 | (a) Lobar pneumonia | (a) Pulmonary tuberculosis | (a) Acute peritonitis | (a) Bronchopneumonia | (a) Uremia |\n| Morbid conditions, if any, giving rise to immediate cause (if preceding backwards from immediate cause). | due to | due to | due to | due to | due to |\n|                 | (b) due to | (b) due to | (b) due to | (b) due to | (b) due to |\n|                 | (c) due to | (c) due to | (c) due to | (c) due to | (c) due to |\n| Other morbid conditions (if important) contributing to death but not causally related to immediate cause. | II. | II. | II. | II. | II. |\n\n| Chronic interstitial nephritis | Chronic bronchitis |\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta., December 9th, 1940.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith Memorandum on inquiry into cause of Death of Pearl Brave Rock, Pupil No. 0234, of the St. Paul's Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAnthony McMillan,\nClerk in Charge.\nOttawa,\nDecember 16, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant enclosing memorandum of inquiry into the cause and circumstances of the death of Pearl Brave Rock, No. 0254, of the St. Paul's Indian Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

A. Forget\nAssistent Commissaire\nR\u00e9gion\n\nMon Cher Monsieur,\n\nLe dernier courrier m'a apport\u00e9 cette lettre du 8 courant. Je vous suis bien reconnaissant de l'avoir pu vous en donner; bien que tout soit pr\u00e9par\u00e9 pour b\u00e2tir \u00e0 Saddle Lake, je vais disposer prochainement de quelques ou d'abord.\n\nSans pouvoir m'expliquer les raisons pour lesquelles les sauvages protestants de la Rivi\u00e8re Blanche sont si oppos\u00e9s \u00e0 ce qu'il y ait un \u00e9tablissement catholique \u00e0 30 ou 35 milles de l\u00e0, eux, je peux cependant dire que cette opposition n'est pas nouvelle.\n\nNous avions autrefois un \u00e9tablissement sur la rive gauche de la Saskatchewan \u00e0 30 milles au moins de la Rivi\u00e8re Blanche; il y a toutefois eu en 1876 ou 1877, je vis une lettre adress\u00e9e au P. Lacombe, \u00e9crit au nom des sauvages protestants de cette place, demandant le P. Lacombe d'avoir b\u00e2ti sur un terrain qui appartenait qu'ils avaient d\u00e9sign\u00e9.\nils de leurs fonfathers. Les sauvages catholiques et leur nombre de paires de la rivi\u00e8re se trouvaient alors \u00e0 St Paul des Ois, s'\u00e9tablissant en quelque sorte. La R\u00e9v. leur tendait le bras devant moi afin d'avoir leur opinion. Ils ne firent pas mine de ces r\u00e9solutions, assurant qu'ils poursuivraient au m\u00eame titre, r\u00e9clamer comme leur propri\u00e9t\u00e9 les terres de la Rivi\u00e8re bleue. Un vieux m\u00e9tis, sauvage du nom de cardinal, plus connu sous le nom d'Ouabatache \u00e9ponyme, s'\u00e9tait mis \u00e0 pr\u00eater partout r\u00e9clamer la place de la Rivi\u00e8re bleue comme une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ; la premi\u00e8re maison b\u00e2tie \u00e0 cette place \u00e9tait par mon d\u00e9faut perdue, puis encore nombre de petits \u00e9tablissements de la colonie. Le lieu \u00e9tait sign\u00e9 de ce nom. J'ai rencontr\u00e9 bien de fois cette Rivi\u00e8re lorsque nous avions encore \u00e9t\u00e9 officiellement de St Paul des Ois, il ne s'agissait pas de mettre en place une telle supposition qu'il nous est donc permis, il a, au contraire, toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 aimable et obligeant.\n\nCependant les sauvages ne reviennent \u00e0 cette mission qu'\u00e0 des \u00e9poques de temp\u00eate, nous renon\u00e7ons \u00e0 y entrer un temps, ou moins\nmoins pour un temps et nous\nnous d\u00e9cid\u00e2mes \u00e0 y accourir que\nlorsque les sauvages s'y rendraient.\nLe 25 Ao\u00fbt 1746, descendant la\nSaskatchewan avec le capitaine\nBouchard et un jeune guide nomm\u00e9\nPaul Joseph L\u00e9vis, nous continuons\ncamp\u00e9e \u00e0 cette mission de St Paul,\nmais l'\u00e9tablissement avait disparu.\nVoici la note qui s'\u00e9crit alors sur\nnotre journal : \"L'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re nous\nn'avions pas de nouvelles ; la maison,\nla chapelle, le hangar, le stable, tout\nl'\u00e9tablissement est d\u00e9truit. Il est surpre-\nnant que les petits maisons des\n\"commer\u00e7ants et des sauvages soient\nrest\u00e9es malgr\u00e9 la quantit\u00e9 de flammes\nqui ont br\u00fbl\u00e9 autour, le terrain, les\n\"cl\u00f4tures du jardin et celles du cimeti\u00e8re\nont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement \u00e9pargn\u00e9es, ce qui\nferait supposer que l'incendie serait\nl'effet de la malveillance.\"\n\nJe n'accuse seulement les\nsauvages de la lacombe de cette\nle fait, mais je ne peux pas dire qu'ils font aujourd'hui\nen quoi nous ne savons et\n\u00e9tabliement pas de leur belle\nne rappellent cependant la histoire\npass\u00e9e.\n\nJ'ajoute que je trouve tr\u00e8s\nagr\u00e9able la pr\u00e9caution du D\u00e9partement,\nde demander aux autorit\u00e9s de l'\u00c9glise\nm\u00e9thodiste\nm\u00e9thodiste d'une de leur influence en faveur de la loi et de la libert\u00e9. Un savage de cette \u00e9poque, r\u00e9sidant pr\u00e8s du lac \u00e0 la Belle, a recueilli la partie d'un sermon ou d'une conversation d'un ministre avec les savages, et ce ministre \u00e9tait probablement recette d'une certaine autorit\u00e9, car le savage lui donnait le titre de grand pr\u00eatre, s'il existait probablement officiellement le mission de Saddle Lake ou de la Pr\u00e9sentation. Le rappelant dans l'ordre de la m\u00e9thode de St. Hippolyte, nous trouvons surtout en paraboles, il est de cette m\u00e9thode en ce qui concerne une, bien faite pour faire comprendre ce qu'il est. Voici la fable en parabole, d'apr\u00e8s le savage :\n\n\"Chacun une grosse toupie, des animaux d'un caract\u00e8re faible et p\u00e2le, \u00e9taient au centre dans une esp\u00e8ce d'\u00e9tal. Un animal fort et puissant, un \u00e9l\u00e9phant sans doute, vint demander l'hospitalit\u00e9 aux heureux habitants du logis qui furent d'abord quelques difficult\u00e9s pour recevoir un pareil h\u00f4tes. Cependant, bient\u00f4t de se mettre et de se suffire, ils le laiss\u00e8rent entrer. Ainsi est ce monde d'ignorants, de fra\u00eeche, dans une telle ou bienfaiteur et resta ma\u00eetre de la place.\"\n\"place\".\n\nPour que la parabole fut comprise, elle fut expliqu\u00e9e et comment\u00e9e. Ces faits et points d'interrogation, ce sont les savages protestants de la rivi\u00e8re bleue et de la rivi\u00e8re de la Selle, et nous, catholiques, avons connu cet animal mal\u00e9fique dont qui voulons nous installer parmi eux. Apr\u00e8s le avoir choisi des terres de leur p\u00e8re-pat\u00e8re, nous en retournons les ma\u00eetres. L'histoire veut elle r\u00e9ellement d'un h\u00e9ritage, je ne peux l'assurer, elle est donn\u00e9e comme telle par un savage et peut-\u00eatre par plusieurs. Ce qui est certain c'est qu'elle n'a pu \u00eatre invent\u00e9e par lui. Une autre fois son mot est certain, c'est que la seule raison que les savages donnent de leur opposition \u00e0 ce que nous nous installions au lac de la Selle, c'est que nous sommes des occupants qui voulons nous rendre ma\u00eetres partout et il est tout naturel qu'on se d\u00e9fende contre de tels \u00eatres.\n\nJ'aurais pas parl\u00e9 de ces faits, si votre lettre ne me le e\u00fbt rappel\u00e9, et il n'est peut-\u00eatre pas mal que M. le commissaire le connaisse.\n\nCopie non. Je vous prie,\n\nX Votre j. E. de St. Albert\n\n[Signature]\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI received your letter of the 8 instant by the last carrier. I am very grateful for the advice you give me and although everything is ready for the building at Saddle Lake, I will defer until July or August.\n\nWithout being able to account for the Protestant Indians of White Fish Lake opposing a Catholic establishment 25 or 30 miles from their place I can nevertheless say that it is not a new thing.\n\nWe had formerly an establishment on the south shore of the Saskatchewan 30 miles on the river White Fish Lake and half-way to the present day in 1879 or 1877, I took command of a letter addressed to Rev. Father Lacombe written in the name of a Protestant Indian accusing the Red Fathers of having built on their land which they said they held from their forefathers.\nThe Rev. Father Lacombe made a translation of his letters in my presence to the Catholic Indians and a number of Papagos who happened at the time to be at St. Paul des Cris, the establishment in question, to ascertain what were their opinions on the matter and they only laughed at such pretensions saying that they could not make any claim as their own property the land as White Birch Lake.\n\nAn old Indian had heard of the name of Cardinal, better known by the name of Ovahatche added \"I am the one who can claim the land as White Birch Lake as my own property for the new house built at that place was built by my late father and I can even show them to Peter Brannos the foundations of the chimney - Peter Brannos was the party who signed the letter.\n\nI often met Peter Brannos when we had our establishment at St. Paul des Cris but I never heard him say a word that could lead me to suppose that he was vexed because we were there; on the contrary, he was always very friendly and obliging. And as our distance visited this place...\nFather - The Rev. Father Laverne made a translation of his letters in my presence to the Catholic Indians once a month or so, and who happened at the time to be at St. Paul des Oris, the establishment in question. To ascertain what were their opinions on the matter, and they only laughed at such questions, saying that they owned the land as Whitefish Lake. An old Indian had been of the name of Cardinal, better known by the name of Ovabatoche added - \"I am the one who can claim the land as Whitefish Lake as my own property, for the first house built at that place was built by my late father, and I can even show them to Peter Erasmus the foundations of the chimney - Peter Erasmus was the party who signed the letter. I often met Peter Erasmus when we had our establishment at St. Paul des Oris, but I never heard him say a word that could lead me to suppose that he was vexed because we were there; on the contrary, he was always very friendly and obliging. But as our Indians visited this Mission...\nMission at fixed periods only,\nwe came up the idea of permanent\nresidence in the place and decided\nthat we would visit the mission\nonly when the Indians would come\nto it.\n\nOn the 26th Augt 1876 Coming\ndown the Saskatchewan with Capt.\nBrevetton and a party of Indians\nnamed Vital Joseph. However we\nthought of camping at our\nmission at St Paul, but on our\narrival at the place we found\nthat all our buildings had disap-\npeared. I then wrote the fol-\nlowing annotation in my diary:\n\"When we arrived at St Paul\nwe found nothing but ashes, the\nhouse, the Chapel, the school\nthe stables had all been destroyed\nand it is surprising that nothing\nstanding the great quantity of ships\narrived, the small houses of the\ntraders as well as those of the\nIndians were all intact.\"\nI do not accuse the Indians\nor White with large or being guilty\nof that destruction, but the threat\nthey have uttered today in case\nwe returned near in the vicinity\nof Lake Louise brings to my\nmind a certain story\u2014\nI will add that it was very\nwise of the Department to arr\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nThe authorities of the Methodist Church to use their influence in favor of law and liberty. An account of that circumstance who resides in this vicinity in Lake Dunn has reported a portion of a sermon or conversation which he heard from a Reverend Minister who must have been connected with some authority for the Indians called him \"John Peter\" (Povesh, Peter), and was visiting the Mission of Lake Dunn or White Rock Lake in some official capacity. Doubtless remembering the method of Our Lord in making use of parables when instructing and wishing to illustrate Him, He made use of one well calculated to leave no doubt as to what He meant.\n\nThe following is the story or parable in question according to this Indian: \"During a great storm, some inoffensive and peaceful animals took refuge in a stable where they were safe from the storm. A mother animal, mighty and powerful, probably an elephant came to ask hospitality of these happy inhabitants of that place. At first they would not consent to receive such a host, but at last, touched by his pleadings...\"\n\"very and urgent supplications\n\"that let him in - rather to! thus\n\"a minister of misfortune himself\n\"against him, striving to ruin him\n\"burning and killing him, and\n\"finally to make his master\n\"of the land.\"\n\nThis formulae to be understood\nwas explained and commented\nupon as follows -\n\nThe two figures and animals\nrepresent the Protestant\nIndians or White Fox Lake and\nLake LaSalle and that wicked\nand unjust animal represents\nthe Catholics who seek to be let\nin amongst them so as to drive\nthem away from the land of\ntheir forefathers and become the\nmasters of the land themselves.\n\nWhether the Red Indians\nare really the father of this story\nor not I cannot vouch, but it is\nreported as such by the Indians\nand probably by several others,\nwhat is certain is that this de-\nsign has not invented it.\n\nIt is also quite certain that\nthis idea came from the Red\nIndians for appointing their\nestablishment at Lake LaSalle\nis that we are farmers (accu-\npators), and we want to be\nthe masters wherever we\nIt is therefore quite natural that we defend ourselves against such deceit.\n\nI would not have allowed such facts, had they not been recalled by my mind by your letter as it is, it is well that the Commissioners be made acquainted with them.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n+ Bishop of Allentown\n\n(OMG)\nSaddle Lake Agency,\n195 Main Rd.

B. Forrest.\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto, March 18th, 1860\n\nHayter Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge your favor of the 8th inst., No. 866, referring to difficulties said to have occurred among the Indians at Saddle Lake, and requesting that the Methodist Church will use its utmost efforts with the Protestant Indians to prevent threatened violence.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I was not aware \"that a considerable portion of the Indians of the Bands mentioned belong to the Roman Catholic Church,\" but on the contrary have always understood that a very small number indeed profess that faith; on this point, however, it is possible I have been misinformed.\n\nIn former correspondence with the Indian Dep't, I have always understood it to be their settled policy to discourage the establishment of competing schools in the same Bands, unless the number was sufficiently large to necessitate such a division. If the number of Roman Catholic Indians is sufficient to entitle them to a school in accordance with the standing regulations of the Indian Department, I presume the way will be clear for the Commissioner to proceed in the usual way. At the same time I wish to say that for some time a disposition has been shown by authorities of the Roman Catholic Church to interfere with our missions wherever it was possible to do so, especially by establishing schools under Roman Catholic auspices, and from any information that is in my possession, I am disposed to think the present is a case in point.\n\nIt is true that Chief Pecan, and a large portion of his Band, reside at Whitefish Lake, but the settlement at Saddle Lake was formed by a detachment of the Whitefish Lake Indians, who were all connected with the Methodist Church, and have retained that connection to the present time. From what I know of these Indians, their general christian character, and their unserving loyalty to the Government during the North-West rebellion, the statement that they have \"gone the length of threatening to burn any mission or school buildings which may be put up by the Roman Catholic Church on the Reserve,\" is one which I am unwilling to receive without the most positive evidence. I shall therefore put myself in communication at once with the Missionary in charge of the Saddle Lake station, and also with the Chairman of the District, so that the matter may be thoroughly sifted, and the truth brought to light.\n\nIn the meantime permit me to express the hope that no steps will be taken by the Department to force a division among the people at Saddle Lake until it is clearly ascertained that the request of the minority is one that comes clearly within the standing regulations of the Department in such cases.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n(Sgd) A. Sutherland,\nGen'l Sec'y.\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto, March 14th, 1890.\n\nRev. R.R. Steinheiser, R.A.,\nPakan, N.W.T.\n\nDear Bro.\u2014\n\nA communication has just been received from the Commissioner for the North-West Territories, referring to a difficulty which is said to have arisen at Saddle Lake between the Protestant and Roman Catholic Indians, growing out of a desire on the part of the latter to establish a school which shall be under Roman Catholic auspices. It is stated that the opposition comes chiefly from Chief Pakan and his Band, and that the Protestant Indians \"have gone the length of threatening to burn down any mission or school buildings which may be put up by the R.C. Church on the Reserve.\"\n\nA statement like this is so serious, and reflects so strongly upon our mission, that it is of great importance that we should have a full statement of the facts without delay. Will you kindly inform me at your earliest convenience what is the entire number of Protestant and Catholic Indians on the Saddle Lake Reserve; also the number of children of school age in each case. Let me also have a statement of the present difficulty, its nature and history, and whether there is any truth in the report that the Protestant Indians have threatened violence as indicated above.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) A. Sutherland.\nSaddle Lake,\nApril 18th, 1860\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto.\n\nDear Doctor,\n\nHaving had very little or no time to reply sooner to your favor of the 14th of March, respecting the agitation which exists between the Protestant and Roman Catholic Indians, I now take this opportunity to do so. Several questions were put forth in that communication concerning this agitation which I will endeavor to answer.\n\nIn the summer of 1857, the year I was sent out to take this charge, the Priest, who is now stationed here, while at Onion Lake used to make frequent calls at this place (so I was told when I arrived) administering to the spiritual wants of their people. About that time there was a sort of religious awakening among the Indians in this place, and the people were in a somewhat unsettled state, there being no one whom they could look upon as instructor in things Divine. It happened that the Priest made his appearance first, and he embraces the opportunity of instilling their doctrines in the minds as well as in the hearts of the people. This, however, was only a temporary call.\n\nThe appointment to this mission being allotted to me by the Conference of that year, the Protestants were the first ones to have a teacher.\n\nThe people of the other persuasion naturally desired to have a teacher as well as the Protestants. This desire took the following effect: An invitation was extended to this Priest, which he of course accepted. May say at this juncture that the Band whose Reserve is joined to Pakan's Reserve is catholic almost in total; the Headman is the only Protestant among them. Before this Band extended an invitation to the Priest, they held Councils without the knowledge of their Chief (which was not done by the Protestants when they desired to have a teacher) wherein they decided to take such a step. The Chief of this Band did not know anything about these meetings, nor what was decided in them until the decision of his Band took effect in the arrival of the Priest within his reserve. Of course the Roman Catholic Indians on this Reserve (the one I am on) joined hands with the Band already mentioned towards securing a teacher of their persuasion. They secured one, and right early at that. He had not been in long until it was rumoured that he was not content with the situation, to be on the tail end of the Reserve (because it is like one, though in reality two distinct ones) did not suit his reverence, but he must needs be in the centre of it. When this intention was generally known, the Whitefish Indians came out in a body, held a Council wherein they expressed their unwillingness that the Roman Catholic Church should establish itself within their Reserve. It was held that no party had a right to establish itself without their consent. This is the opposition which is said to have come from Chief Pakan and his Band. Why should it not be so since this as well as the Whitefish Lake Reserve are under his Chieftainship? Besides they have been\nmade to understand that these Reserves are their private property. There never would have been any contention whatever had the Priest established himself in the Reserve which he first entered. This contention comes from no persecution whatever, nor from want of intolerance. But the spirit of arose from his insisting on planting himself where he is not allowed to. I think he would not have persisted in his idea had he not had countenance from others outside who are in authority.\n\nAt first it was said that whichever side had the majority, that side should win the case. But this they did not abide by, for as soon as they discovered that Pakan and his whole Band protested against the planting of the Roman Catholic Church in the heart of the Reserve, they wanted to exclude him and his band by making a sweeping statement that Chief Pakan and his Band had no right whatever to say in the matter.\n\nIs it not to be wondered at that those who took an active part in the Rebellion, and who were put in jail for it for several months, are the ones who are using their energies and time toward the establishment of the said Church in the proposed site. When such men are the leading spirits in any project, one can hardly expect any good to come of it.\n\nBefore going any further may I be allowed to ask several questions. To whom does this Reserve belong? To the Government? To the Roman Catholic Church? To any other denomination that might be named? Or does it belong to the poor Indian?\n\nRegarding the number of people in each party, there are sixty-seven Protestants, and forty-seven Roman Catholics, grown up people and children in each case within Pakan's Reserve. The number of children of school age are seventeen of the Protestants, together with three above the age which the Government has made the standard but who are attending, making a total of twenty; Roman Catholics nine, with one above school age. But counting the Chief of the other Band, the Protestants would number seventy-one, and Roman Catholics seventy-two. I give you these figures that you may know the exact number of children in each case on these two Reserves. As I understand the Priest took some names that do not belong to either Reserve. For instance, some half-breeds, French, and some Indians who have no home since the Rebellion.\n\nAs to the violence threatened. From the tenor of your communication this threatened violence seems to have been attributed to all the Protestant Indians. Such is not the case; but I believe one did say something to that effect in a bluff way while in hot discussion with the Indian Agent concerning this trouble. But they were unanimous in signing the following notice:\n\n\"We the undersigned do hereby notify the Rev. Father O'Meara that as we have sometime ago prohibited him from erecting any building on this place or inside this Reserve claimed and surveyed for our own property.\n\nThat if he still without our consent place any timber or lumber of any part of the aforesaid Reserve, we will haul the same away, and place it on the Reserve where he now is. No man has a right to build on any portion of this Reserve without our consent.\"\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(Sgd) R.R.

After a little parleying, I obtained the consent of Chief Pakan, and his Indians, to allow of the erection of buildings upon that part of the Saddle Lake Reserve, known as Blue Quills. Most of the followers of Blue Quill are Roman Catholics, and in order to obviate as much as possible, the ill feeling which would in all probability continue to exist, I induced the Indians of that portion of the Saddle Lake Reserve owned by Pakan and his followers to consent to move over to Blue Quill's portion, so that all those claiming adherence to that Denomination, numbering about 30 odd souls, might be together. These Indians\n\nThe Deputy of the\n\nSupt.

In our last visit to your honor at Ottawa, last summer, I have understood you and his Lordship that a new institution of ours was to be placed in department, on the same footing as the one of St Albert.

His Lordship told me to take more children than we had, but as we are so poorly housed, I could not comply this year with His Lordship's intentions. I have begun this year a great building which will enable me to receive more children in our school, but to finish my enterprise I will need the help of the grant from the time above mentioned. Mr. J. Ross, Indian Agent, visited our school last winter and he seemed well pleased with the progress of our pupils. With better accommodation and more children I hope we will be better yet.

Father and the Minister and have no recollection of any such promise.\"\n\nLast winter, during one of my visits at your office, I asked you very earnestly to increase to 20 the number of pupils to be received in the school of Lac La Biche, with the government grant per capita. I can not say now if Mr. Reed was present with us at the time, probably he was not. At first you made objection but at last you consented to my repeated request. Of course you gave me no writing, only saying to me: \"I will see that it will be all right.\" If then I did not...\non my own responsibility to inform\nthe said school-managers that they can\ntake 20 children.\n\nNow, my dear friend, supposed I had\nunderstood you and supposed Mr.\nReed knows nothing about such an\narrangement, I ask you again to grant\nour demand, apparently so just.\n\nMind, dear Mr. Daly, that Lac LaBiche\nis an old catholic settlement, com-\nposed of half-breeds and indians far\naway from any civilisation centre.\nThe people there are poor.

E. Forget\nAvocat en chef\nSt. Albert, 5th January, 1896.\n\nTo Mr. Amedie Forget,\npro Commissioner of Indian Affairs,\nRegina.\n\nMy dear Mr. Forget:\n\nI believe it is my duty to write to you in reference to our Institution (Boarding School) of Lac la Biche. This has existed for over 40 years and upon the request of the Hon. Mr. Dewdney, it has been almost entirely remodelled in the last few years. In the course of September 1890, I made an application to the Hon. E. Dewdney for an Industrial School for the Pitt District, making an offer to move our Lac la Biche Orphanage to any locality of this District he would prefer, to which he answered: \"Since you have already an Institution at Lac la Biche it would be better to have your Industrial School there than elsewhere,\" on the strength of which we have since expended over ten thousand dollars increasing or repairing this establishment.\n\nAllow me to tell you, Sir, that it seems strange to me to see the unwillingness of the Indian Department to do more for establishments the cost whereof has been entirely to our charge, than for others for which it has borne the entire cost of erection. It seems that the least thing that could be done for such Institutions would be to fix no other limit to the recruiting of pupils than such as would be regulated by the needs of\nthe Indians. However in several instances we have, to our own cost, exceeded the number of pupils allowed, because the Indian Department endeavoured to oblige some Catholic children to be incorporated in Protestant Industrial Schools, under the pretence that the Catholic ones had their full number. We might have overlooked this, if in those Protestant Institutions the faith of our children were unmolested; but notwithstanding the conditions of the Treaty in regard to religious belief, notwithstanding formal promises from Sir John A. Macdonald and Hon. E. Dewdney, promises which are written and printed and of which neither you nor Mr. Reed are unaware, if parents are not forced to change their belief, poor little children are. We are consequently in the necessity of exceeding the limits and it would be but justice that account be taken of it.\n\nSome years ago there was on the Ermineskin Reserve an Indian woman with three children. She took some steps towards having them admitted in our St. Albert Institution, where at the time the allowed number of pupils had been exceeded. If my information is correct, and I believe it is, Mr. H. Reed caused her to be offered that she might send her children to Regina where there was no lack of room. This poor woman, notwithstanding her past disorderly life, such a life very likely caused by her poverty, would not consent to expose her children to the danger of losing the faith in which they had been baptized. As there was room at Lake la Biche, I sent the two little boys there and placed\nplaced the little girl in a different Mission, for a time, on account of the difficulties of the journey.\n\nI wonder why the Department has never consented to pay the grant for these children who are educated at Lake la Biche. It is said, I hear, that they are not Indian, the father being a civilized half-breed. Let it be, but were they not under the Department's charge when we admitted them? And if the mother had consented to have them sent to Regina, wouldn't the Department have paid a grant for them? Surely, you will not deny this. I refrain from writing all that indignation inspires me with on this subject; this is for later on if I am forced to it. But another reason is given; the Department is not willing to pay for these children as it would be indirectly favouring immorality. Worthy scruples indeed, but it should have been felt earlier. You allow a poor Indian woman to live in a disorderly way and you take no steps either with her or with the wretch who abuses her, to put an end to it. And when abandoned by her pseudo husband, this dishonoured woman returns to the reserve, you are obliged to support her and her children. I am in doubt even whether any reproof has been given her for her past conduct. Us, we admit them to give them a Christian education and it is then that your scruples begin to show. Would it have been the same if the mother consented to let them go to Regina. As for me, seeing what is going on, I am inclined to think that I am the culprit, not the mother, who likely would have finally consented to let the children go to Regina.\nRegina if I had not found room for them in some of our Institutions.\n\nI therefore claim, according to strict justice, a complete payment for these children, and I shall then see that the little girl be with her brothers at Lake la Biche. Moreover I claim that this Institution be authorized to admit at least 70 pupils, and more if necessary. It is awkward to be in the necessity to refuse many Indians who to-day seem to understand the benefit of education.\n\nI close this too long letter with the prayer that you take this request into consideration. Grant, for the present at least, 30 pupils for the Lake la Biche Boarding School and that these three illegitimate Calder children be taken on the same footing as the others.\n\nBelieve, Dear Sir, yours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) X Vital J. Bishop of St. Albert,\n\nO. M. I.\n\nP. S. I cannot give in respect to these children all the details which might be necessary. The mother belongs to the Ermineskin Reserve. The two boys have been at the Lac la Biche Boarding School for the last three years at least. I have not thought advisable to send the girl there, when I learnt that the Department was unwilling to do anything for these children, fearing to overburthen the Institution. The father of these children is named Antoine Calder, son of William Calder, who many years ago had been employed by the Hudson's Bay\nBay Co. I believe however that Father Grandin, Principal of the Lac la Biche Industrial School has several times written to the Department in this matter and has given all the necessary details.\n\n(Sgd) X V.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith, translated copy of a letter to this office, dated the 5th Instant, from His Lordship Bishop Grandin, requesting -\n\n(a) That a greater number of pupils be allowed to be taken in by the Lac la Biche School under the capitation grant;\n\n(b) That authority be given for the admission at that school, the same to be maintained therein by the Department, of three illegitimate children, known as the \"Calder children.\"\n\nRegarding request (a)\n\nI beg to state that the number of pupils at present authorized at the Lac la Biche School is 20 and 22 the number estimated for in the estimates recently transmitted to the Department. In making provision for 22, it was thought at the time that that number would include all children of school age likely to seek admission into the Lac La Biche School, during the next fiscal\n\nTo the Deputy of,\n\nThe Supt. General of,\n\nIndian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nfiscal year.\n\nBut in view of the application now made, it would seem that our information must have been incorrect. Considering therefore the large and commodious buildings owned by the R.C. Mission at Lac la Biche and the efficient school training given by the Sisters in charge, I would recommend that provision be made for 30 pupils commencing with the 1st July next.\n\nThe request made on behalf of the Calder children is coupled with certain complaints made against yourself which I am confident His Lordship would not have made had he been in possession of all the facts. In my reply, a copy of which is also enclosed, I have endeavoured to place them before his Lordship in their entirety, and hope that this bare statement of facts will dispel any misgivings that he may heretofore have entertained.\n\nAs to the merit of the application, I beg to state that the children referred to are issues of an illegitimate union between a daughter of Keniawats No. 3 of Ermineskin's Band and Jackey Calder, a Half-breed, formerly Interpreter on the Stony Plain Reserve. The mother was known as Jane Pich\u00e9 and withdrew from Treaty to take scrip on the 7th of July 1886, but afterwards separated from Calder and returned to her father's home, where she continued to live until February 1892, when she died.\n\nTwo of the children are now on the roll of the Lac la Biche School under the names of Jimmy Calder No. 16 and Willie Calder No. 17, aged respectively 10 and 7 years old. The third child is a girl of about five years of age, who is still, I believe, at the Orphanage.\nof St. Albert. Steps were taken to induce their father to assist in the bringing up of these children, but without success. So far therefore the R.C. Missions have had sole charge of them.\n\nThere are a few precedents of such children being admitted into Industrial Schools; and the claim on behalf of these children is, in my opinion, enhanced by the fact that the father was living on the Reserve as an Employee of the Department at the time of his illegitimate connection with their mother.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAsst. Commissioner.\nMy dear sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th inst., No. 013\u2014 in answer to mine of the 5th inst.\n\nI am happy to accept the explanations given in regard to the admissions, proposed in the first place, and afterwards refused by the Regina Industrial School.\n\nOf the Calder children, as you may find your letter Mr. Reed himself replied to have these children admitted in his own handwriting, when he learnt that the mother had left the treaty and received a script.\n\nHowever, my dear sir, allow me to insist that the children be admitted into the school, to which they seem entitled under legitimate authority, for the following reasons:\n\nFrom this office, the 16th inst., I have been informed that the Indian Department has done so willingly and legally, the Indian Department should have granted her the liberty only after her being legitimately and legally married to Calder, who, after this, would have been legally obliged to keep and support her and children. But being married, he has been able to leave her when he has chosen to do so and have her and children to misery and destitution, after having eaten and squandered more or less the script money of this evidently deserted woman.\n\nThe Indian Department, before granting permission to leave the treaty, should have insisted to have the marriage certificate. It has not done so, although acting in good faith. I don't doubt it, but for not having done so, it has been the cause that the children are today helpless without legal support, and the least that you could do for them now, would it not be to take care of these children and...\n123386\n\nTo open for them the doors of an industrial school of their religious faith is proposed, and when they will learn to make an honest livelihood.\n\nTwo of these children are at Lethbridge. I make anew on their behalf the request made in my letter of the 5th inst., and ask also that the little girl be admitted for the same reasons in the said Lethbridge school.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. Forget, Esq.,\nRegina\nOTTAWA 1st February 1895\n\nTHIS LETTER HAS BEEN SENT -\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a translation of a letter from His Lordship, the Bishop of St Albert in further reference to the application for admission of three children, said to be illegitimate and known as the Calder children, to the Lac La Biche Boarding School; and in reply I beg to say that the Department would like to know if it was not understood that Calder was legally married.\n\nThe Department would also like you to forward the papers relating to discharge of Jane Calder No. 463, who was discharged on the 7th July 1896 No. 163 Edmonton Agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Assistant Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nMy dear Mr. Forget:\n\nAllow me to make some few remarks in regard to your letter of the 14th instant, No. 013.\n\nI understand the Department being obliged to limit the number of admissions to the various Boarding Schools since the necessary monies have to be voted by the Commons.\n\nThere is nevertheless one fact, which is that the Department has to provide the Indians with the means of educating their children and that shortly there will only be the Boarding Schools, the benefit of which the children will be able to have.\n\nWhen the Catholic Boarding schools have reached their maximum as fixed by the Department, it has sometimes happened that Catholic children have been sent to Protestant schools.\n\nIt would be tolerable if in these schools the children's faith and parent's wishes were respected, if the children could go to Catholic services on Sunday and Feasts, and if the Catholic Priest could go to these Institutions to catechise these poor children. This should take place in all justice and has been promised to me by Hon. John A. Macdonald in a letter of the 8th December 1896.\n\nThese promises have been made anew by the Hon. E. Dewdney viva voce and by writing on the 5th September 1896.\n\nThe Commissioner has been made aware\naware of these premises, but they have remained without effect. The Catholic Missionary has not been even able to speak to the children kept in these Institutions. Having shown Sir John A. MacDonald's and Hon. Mr. Dewdney's letters to the Inspector of the Catholic Schools, I requested him to be kind enough to make sure whether there were Catholic children in the Protestant Industrial School of Battleford. The Inspector was no more admitted there than the Catholic Priest, and was blamed by the Commissioner for having taken such a step. Being grown up, two of these children have tried to meet us and to attend to our services and have always been stopped. One of these told me that whilst at the Battleford School he had been made to visit all the Town Churches, with the exception of the Catholic one. Lately again two of our Stony Plain children have been sent to the Protestant school of Regina. They had been so much turned against the sisters, they never would consent to go to either St. Albert or Lac la Biche. Although St. Albert had exceeded its number they would have been received there if they had wanted to. Their father, James Stony, consented to let them go to the said Protestant school providing their faith was respected. He was promised what he asked. If you may judge by the manner in which all our Catholic children have been treated in these schools up to the present, it is more than probable that these poor children, Francis and Joseph Stony, are as protestant as they could be made to be. Under such circumstances the Department cannot do less, it seems to me, than to provide means for the admission in catholic Institutions of all Catholic children whose\nwhose parents are Catholics. I regret to have to make\nthe statement\u2014a statement which can be proved by numer-\nous instances\u2014that up to the present, between the\npromises on one hand and the denials on the other, the\nfaith of the children and the desire of the parents have\nnot been taken into account in any of these Institutions;\nand that, notwithstanding this fact, or perhaps because\nof it, too many Indian Officials have tried to have\nour children admitted in protestant schools. I there-\nfore would not like to be put in the necessity of re-\nfusing admittance in our schools to our own children.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nX Vital J. Bishop St. Albert,\nO. M. I.\n\nP. S.\n\nI am forgetting the necessary consequence of all\nthis; it is that the St. Albert School be authorized to\nreceive a greater number of pupils, fifteen or twenty\nmore.\n\nX V.\nTo the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for Manitoba and the North-West Territories.\n\nI, Jane Piche, J. Calder's wife, a half-breed, admitted into the Treaty with the Edmonton Stragglers (No. 103) Band of Indians, and paid last as J. Calder's wife, in 1885, desire to withdraw from the said Treaty, under the provisions of Section fourteen of \"The Indian Act, 1880,\" as amended, and hereby signify my intention of so doing, by signing this application in the presence of the witnesses, this seventh day of July, A.D. 1886.\n\nWitnesses\n\n(Signed) Joseph V. Kildahl\n(Signed) Samuel Whitford\n\nWe, Joseph Varatow Kildahl and Samuel Whitford, both of Edmonton, Alberta, do hereby certify that the above application, a half-breed to withdraw from Treaty, was signed by the said Jane Piche, in our presence, and that we are the subscribing witnesses thereto.\n\nSworn before me at Edmonton this 7th day of July, A.D. 1886.\n\n(Signed) W. Anderson\nInd. Auth.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the Department's letter of the 1st Instant, No. 116,859; I would say that John Calder, the father of the children referred to was never lawfully married to their mother whose name was Jane Pichie.\n\nShe received her discharge from Treaty from the Indian Agent at Edmonton on the 7th July, 1886, but as at that time the right to issue such was vested in the Indian Agents - without reference being had to this office, there was no correspondence in connection therewith but merely the forwarding to this office of duplicates of the applications for such discharges.\n\nA copy of that of Jane Pichie, under Register No. 483, is sent herewith.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Commissioner.\n\nThe Deputy of,\nThe Supt. General of,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of copy of letter from His Lordship the Bishop of St. Albert, dated 31st January, and transmitted by you on the 5th ultimo, and with regard thereto to inform you as follows.\n\nSince His Lordship's statements are avowedly introductory to his application to be authorized to receive some 10 or 20 additional pupils at the St. Albert's School, it is questionable whether any thing more need be said in reply than that in order to meet His Lordship's views provision is being made in the next year's Estimates to increase the number of pupils to 65, and for your own information it may be added that it is thought best to let the School remain of the Boarding School class, in which it has proved so successful.\n\nShould you, however, consider it advisable to make any more extended reply to His Lordship's letter, the Department considers that your marginal notes sufficiently indicate the direction it should take.\n\nThe Department cannot refrain from an expression\n\nA. E. Forget, Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner,\nRegina.\nexpression of regret that His Lordship should consider it necessary to preface his application by again re-opening matters which have long ago been disposed of, and, in its opinion, tend to produce or prolong a feeling of friction which it deprecates, and in the desire to avoid which it has made concessions with regard to admitting children of whites and half-breeds into these schools, and in other ways, in a manner which it has not done with regard to other churches.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 16th January last forwarding a translation of a letter dated the 5th of this month from His Lordship Bishop Cran in applying for an increase in the number of pupils allowed at Lac la Riche, and for authority for the admission of three illegitimate children known as the Calder children; and in reply I beg to say upon reference to the Estimates it is found that only 18 pupils are now provided for at this school and provision is made for the same number in the Estimates for next year, but in view of the ample accommodation which this school is said to have the Department would like to see the number increased and will consent to this being done to the extent of say 21 pupils, provided a saving can be effected at the St Albert School to meet such increase. Provision has been made for 85 pupils at $72 per cap. at the latter Institution and if His Lordship Bishop Cranlin has not already been advised to that effect it might be as well to do so now as he only asked for an increase of 15 or 20 for that school in his letter to you of the 21st ultimo, which would bring up the number to be provided for to 70. I see no other way by which more pupils can be admitted to Lac la Riche than by utilizing some of the appropriation for St Albert. By doing this it would then be possible\n\nThe Assistant Indian Commissioner.\n\nRegina, N.W.T.\npossible to admit the three Culier children for whom application has been made, and although they have no just claim on the Department, they being illegitimate and their mother having withdrawn from Treaty, still under the peculiar circumstances of their case, the Department will not object to their admission.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent:\nof Indian Affairs\nExtract from resolutions of the Council of White Fish Lake Hill, dated June 3rd, 1895.\n\nMoved by E.B. Elmo, seconded by C.E.

This Diet Meeting respectfully\nrequests the Indian Depart-\nment to take effective means\nto restore these children to their\nhomes, and to prevent further\nrepetition of like encroach-\nment. Carried.\n\n(covering letter signed) E.M. Glass\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that a Resolution was moved by Mr. R.B. Glass in the Whitefish Lake Council, and seconded by Mr. Somerset, asking the Department to take steps to recover certain Protestant Indian children stated to have been taken from the Saddle Lake Agency and placed in the Lac-la-Biche Boarding School in contravention of the Regulations relating to the education of Indian children. The Department would like you to make enquiries in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Assistant Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nMy dear Father Grandin:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th inst., in regard to certain children of Whitefish Lake who have been brought to Lake La Biche by Rev. Father Boulet. You were right in supposing that the Reverend Minister of Whitefish Lake might not be satisfied to see these children admitted in the Lake La Biche school.\n\nAs a matter of fact, our Agent at Lake La Biche has lately transmitted to us a complaint of Mr. Glass in this respect, basing his contention on the following text taken from certain Regulations of the Indian Office made at Ottawa: \"No protestant child shall be placed in a Roman Catholic School, or in a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices, and no Roman Catholic child shall be placed in a protestant school, or in a school conducted under protestant auspices.\" Mr. Glass is apparently not aware that the Department wishes to be absolutely neutral in regard to the admission of children in any school and that the choice of such schools is left entirely to the parents, the Department reserving its influence towards having such choice respected. I have\n\nRev. Father Grandin, O.M.I.\n\nR.C. Mission,\n\nEdmonton, Alta.\nhave accordingly written to Mr. Ross to inform Mr. Glass of this in terms about as follows:\n\n\"I beg to ask you to advise the Reverent gentleman that the attitude of the Department as to the religious denomination of the school which any child shall attend, is one entirely neutral. The choice in this respect, is left with the parents, but the Department's influence will be used in the direction of having the parents' choice respected\".\n\n\"In this case there is nothing in the correspondence to show that the action taken is not in accordance with the wish of the parents in this instance\".\n\n\"I have noted Mr. Glass's quotation from section 14 of the Regulations relating to the education of Indian children.\n\n\"Apparently Mr. Glass understands this clause to absolutely prohibit a Protestant parent from placing his children in a Roman Catholic school, or a Roman Catholic parent from placing his child in a Protestant school, of his own free will and accord\".\n\n\"If as a reperusal of the regulations will no doubt reveal that this is an erroneous view, and that the said Section 14 provides merely that no compulsory action shall be\nbe taken in the direction indicated thereby.\n\nIn this connection I would add that by \"parents\" is meant the father, if living, or the mother, if the latter be a widow. If a child be adopted, or the ward of another, the person so adopting, or becoming the guardian of such child, has all the right of a parent.\n\n\"Concerning the action you should take, and regarding which you ask for advice, I would refer you to Circular No. 237, of the 31st October, 1890.\"\n\nOn the 22nd May last, I have addressed the same circular to you at Lake La Biche in a letter asking for certain information respecting Annie H. Mason, one of the children brought there by Rev. F. Bouleau. You probably had not yet received this letter when you wrote to me which explains why it has not been answered. I hope you will be satisfied with the manner in which this trouble has been adjusted.\n\n(signed) A. E. Forget\nAsst. Comr.\nMy dear Sir:\n\nSome days before leaving Lac La Biche for St. Albert, Rev. Father Bouleau of Saddle Lake brought to us three children from Whitefish Lake. Amongst these, one is Catholic, the father of another is a Catholic, who having had the weakness to have his child baptised by a protestant minister, desires the same to be educated in the Catholic religion, the last is I believe, of protestant parents, but the three children have been brought to our school upon the requests of their parents, and such request would have been made upon official forms if I had been at home when they came. My co-worker writes to me that these Indians insisted to have their children admitted at once and baptised as Catholics. The Rev. Father has refused of course and the parents were told to return during the summer. I do not think that there is ground for the slightest trouble in the admission of these children, since we have taken them upon the formal request of the parents. I shall take the first opportunity to see these Indians myself, and to have them...\nthem sign the official form which I will immediately forward you.\n\nI daresay that the Rev. Minister at Whitefish Lake shall not much appreciate the admission of these children, but, once more, they have been given us voluntarily and without compulsion. I do not know the parents and have not asked them to send their children, but since they are admitted, they shall be discharged only upon the request of the parents.\n\nBelieve me etc.\n\nH. Grandin\n\nO.M.I. Ptr.\nMay 29th, 95.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th inst., enclosing a communication from the Rev. E.B. Glass complaining that two children, of Methodist parents, taken from the Roman Catholic Boarding School at Lac La Biche, and asking that prompt measures be taken to have them removed from that Institution.\n\nIn reply I would ask you to advise the Rev. Gentleman that the attitude of the Department as to the religious denomination of the school which any child shall attend, is one entirely neutral. The choice, in this respect, is left with the parents, but the Department's influence will be used in the direction of having the parent's choice respected.\n\nIn this case there is nothing in the correspondence to show that the action taken is not in accordance with the wish of the parents in this instance.\n\nThe Indian Agent,\n\nSaddle Lake,\n\nPaken.\nI have noted Mr. Glass's quotation from Section 14 of the \"Regulations relating to the education of Indian children\" brought into force by Order-in-Council of 10th Nov. last, and providing that \"Notwithstanding anything in these regulations contained, no Protestant child shall be placed in a Roman Catholic School, or in a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices, and no Roman Catholic child shall be placed in a Protestant school, or in a school under Protestant Auspices\".\n\nApparently Mr. Glass understands this clause to absolutely prohibit a Protestant parent from placing his children in a Roman Catholic school, or a Roman Catholic parent from placing his child in a Protestant school, of his own free will and accord.\n\nIf so, a repeal of the regulations will no doubt reveal that this is an erroneous view, and that the said Section 14 provides merely that no compulsory action shall be taken in the direction indicated thereby.\n\nIn this connection I would add that by \"Parent\" is meant the father, if living, or the mother, if the latter be a widow; if a child be adopted, or be the ward of another, the person so adopting, or becoming the guardian of such\nsuch child, has all the rights of a parent.\n\nConcerning the action you should take, and regarding which you ask for advice, I would refer you to Circular No. 237, of the 31st Oct. 1890.\n\nI enclose herewith for the information of the Rev.

Commissioner.\nWhitefish Mission, Alta.\nApril 16th, 95.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI hereby make the following complaint to, and request of, you as Indian Agent.\n\n(A) That yesterday the priest from Saddle Lake did take from this Reserve at Whitefish Fish Lake, for Lac Biche Catholic Boarding School, two Protestant children, viz:- A son of widow Mary Bigsnake, also a child of Sophie Alexis, daughter of Mary Bigsnake. The said Mary Bigsnake and her daughter Sophie are members of the Methodist Church. Their children were baptized in this church, and the late Mr. Bigsnake died in Sept. '93, a member of the same.\n\n(B) Whereas the Indian Dept. has established an Industrial School at Red Deer under the auspices of the Methodist Church for the education of those Protestant Children, and whereas the \"Regulations relating to the Education of Indian Children\" dated Ottawa 7th. 1894, declares, section 14, that \"No Protestant child shall be placed in a Roman Catholic School, or in a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices, and no Roman Catholic child\nchild shall be placed in a Protestant school, or in a school conducted under Protestant auspices; and whereas this particular case is considered as an interference with the work and the privileges of the Methodist church, I would respectfully call your attention to this case as one that requires special consideration, and action on your part, and would strongly urge that prompt measures be taken to liberate, with as little delay as possible, these previously mentioned Protestant children.\n\nI am dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Sd.) E.B. Glass.\n\nMr. John Ross,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nIndian Agent's Office.\n\nSaddle Lake.\n\nMay, 17th. '95.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a letter from the Methodist missionary, at Whitefish Lake Reserve, which conveys a complaint against the course pursued by the Rev. Father Bouleuc, the Roman Catholic missionary, on Blue Quill's Reserve, in obtaining pupils for the Lac La Biche Boarding School. The latter gentleman's action was without my knowledge, and approval, and I find also, that he has taken an orphan child of protestant parents, but whose guardian is a Roman Catholic, from Blue Quill's Reserve, and placed her in the same school, viz., Annie H. Mason, (or Jessie,) whose guardian is Louisian Doghead No. 36, Blue Quill's Band No. 127.\n\nI shall be pleased to receive advice, as to the course I shall pursue, in dealing with these matters.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\n(Sd) John Ross.\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner\n\nRegina.\nSir:-\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Department's letter of the 3rd inst., relative to the request of the Whitefish Lake Methodist Council relative to certain children in the Lac La Biche Boarding School.\n\nIn reply, I would state that prior to the receipt of the Department's letter, this office had been dealing with the matter, and I now enclose for the information of the Department a copy of the undermentioned correspondence already had:\n\nLetter from Mr Agent Ross of May 17th 1895, enclosing one from the Rev Mr Glass, dated April 16th 1895.\n\nLetter from this office of May 22nd to Rev H. Grandin Principal of the Boarding School, relative to his admission Return for January 1895.\n\nLetter May 28th from this office to Agent Ross in reply to his of May 17th.\n\nLetter of June 10th from Rev H. Grandin explaining why\n\nThe Deputy.\n\nof the Supt General.\n\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\nwhy the children were admitted.\n\nLetter of July 11th in reply.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst Commissioner\nLac La Riche 11th July 1895\n\nThe Superintendent General\nIndian Affairs.\n\nSir,\n\nAs you may see by our school return, the number of Indian children received in our Boarding School is getting larger, and yet I do not receive all the children that are offered to me. Till now we have received the $62 grant for 14 children only, but I think that this year you will be able to do more than that for our school. I could easily get 30 and more children if we had the means to support them, and without boasting I think I can say that our school deserves to be helped by your Department. I know that you have many charges and that you cannot always do what you would like, but yet I hope that you will be able to grant my request that the number of children supported by the Department should be raised from 14 to at least 30 and more if possible.\n\nHoping to receive a favorable answer to my request, I have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Granger\nOttawa, August 1906.\n\nMy Lord,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship's letter of the 11th instant applying for a grant for an increased number of pupils at the School at Lac la Biche. And in reply I beg to say that the Assistant Indian Commissioner was previously written to on the subject and as the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs is now in Regina, I have forwarded a copy of your Lordship's letter to the Regina Office.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYour Lordship,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nHis Lordship\nBishop Grandin,\nLac la Biche,\nN.W.T.\nSir,\n\nThe enclosed is a copy of a letter from His Lordship Bishop Grandin applying for a grant for an additional number of pupils at the Lac La Riche School, and in connection therewith I beg to refer you to official letter of the 13th March last; in which you were told that the Department would not object to allow for more pupils provided it was not called upon to pay for more than the total number provided for at this and the St. Albert School -88 in all, 80 at St. Albert and 16 at Lac-la Riche. His Lordship has been referred to your office. Please advise the Department of the arrangement made by you as to the number to be paid for at each School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Assistant Indian Commissioner,\nRegina,\n[Signature]\n\nOctober 2nd August, 1904.\nLac La Biche. IIth July 1895.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina.\n\nSir:\n\nIn answer to your letter of May 22nd, No 013, I beg to state that the child Annie H. Moswa, although baptized by a Protestant clergyman, is the daughter of Catholics. It is at the request of her guardian that she was sent here, and the man who says that he is her father wanted her to be brought up by us. You must know that this poor cripple was a burden to every one on the Reserve, and even if she had had no right to be received here, on account of her having been baptized by Protestants, in common pity and charity she could not be refused by me.\n\nBut as I said her guardian asked the Rev Father Boubecto send her here, and her reputed father was perfectly satisfied with that arrangement. I tried lately to see them both at saddle Lake, but could not meet them, but the details I give you today are correct.\n\nAbout Easter I wrote to you asking the discharge of two Chippewayan boys, we had at our school. To this day I have not received any answer to this letter, and I had\nTo let these two boys go.\n\nI asked Mr Ross to let me know how our return sent from here on the first days of April could arrive only late in May at Regina. Our last return was sent on the 4th of this month, and I hope it will take less time to get at your office.\n\nI have, etc.\n\nsgd, H. Grandin.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Departmental letter of the 2nd Ult., enclosing a copy of a communication relative to additional pupils for the Lac La Biche Boarding School.\n\nThe Department seems to be under a misapprehension as to the author of the enclosure, which is apparently not from His Lordship Bishop Grandin, but from the Rev. H. Grandin, a Roman Catholic Priest at Lac La Biche, who is Principal of the Boarding School at that point.\n\nI beg to add that the Departmental letter referred to of the 13th March last cannot be found on our files, and as there is no entry of it in our register, it has not presumably reached our office.\n\nWith reference to the provision for 30 pupils at St Albert, I would observe that by the Department's letter (No number) of the 29th May last, a reduction of 10 was made in the number to be paid for at this school.\n\nSince this reduces the number to 70;\u2014the number shown on the last quarterly Return\u2014it is difficult to see\n\nThe Deputy,\n\nof the Supt General,\n\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\nsee how any adjustment can be made for increasing the number at Lac La Biche\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nAsst Commissioner.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to quote the following memo left by the Deputy Superintendent General when here:\u2014\n\n\"Better advise St. Albert and Lacla Biche of the number of pupils they are entitled to receive, as there appears to be some misunderstanding in the matter,\" and to state that this matter was dealt with in a letter from this office, No 013 of the 3rd instant, in reply No 116859 to Department letter of the 2nd ultimo.\n\nI would add that the Rev. Father Leduc who is here is most anxious for some additional pupils, and would be glad if by any means the enrolment of 98 at the two schools, as suggested in the Department's letter, can be allowed to stand.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Commissioner\n\nThe Deputy of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 3rd (on 013) and 12th (on 0104) instant, relative to the number of pupils provided for at the St Albert and Lac-la-Biche Boarding Schools for the current year; and in reply I beg to say that the Department will pay for 70 pupils at St Albert and will authorize an increase of 5 at Lac-la-Biche.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Assistant Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nSir:\n\nAs we have our mail only once a month, can we send our Return a few days before the end of the third month; for instance, the next mail will leave this place on the 20th and the next on the 19th of April. As we never get our cheque before three months after sending our Return, if we have to mail it only next month the cheque will not be here before the end of June or maybe July.\n\nI will have a copy of the Return sent direct to your office and you may keep it or forward it to Ottawa, but I would like to make the experiment once. What made me suggest that we should send our Return direct to your office is that the Agent has no means to control our Returns and therefore our Returns lay 2 weeks for nothing at Saddle Lake and sometimes longer.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Grondin.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a copy of a letter from the Rev. Principal of Lac-la-Riche Boarding School; and in reply I beg to say that in view of the statements made therein, the Department will consent to the proposed arrangement for sending in Quarterly School Returns.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nIndian Agents Office, Saddle Lake.\n\n1st May, 1896.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter OG5, of 12th ultimo, I have the honour to inform you that I have received a letter from the Rev H. Grandin, regarding your proposition that he receive 5 pupils of Blue Quill's school at $60.00 per annum each. Father Grandin says that he has very many more pupils at present than he is paid for, and that instead of the Department coming to his aid, as it seems to him it should do, it is proposed to him to take 5 pupils more at a reduced rate. The Rev Gentleman directs my attention to the usefulness and success of his school; he says that it is the oldest in the country, and yet he cannot get a tithe of the assistance newer, and no more useful or successful schools receive; he adds he has a considerable number who receive from the Institution a free education, and, in addition, he has at present 6 children, the offspring of Treaty Indians, for whom he receives no grant, and it is a constant tax on his energies to keep the school up to the standard it has gained, owing to lack of funds. He asks me to recommend, which I heartily do, that the present number of Indian pupils at his school, 29, be increased to 40, by the eleven pupils at Blue Quill's day school, and that the usual grant of $72.00 per cap be\n\nThe Indian Commissioner.\n\nRegina.\nbe given to that number, and to lay this proposition before you with a view to obtaining your sanction to it.\n\nIn conclusion I would say that this school deserves strong and favourable consideration.\n\nI have etc.\n\nsgd John Ross.\n\nIndian Agent.\nLac La Biche, 12th May 1896.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\n\nRegina,\n\nSir:\n\nAmong our Indian children here there is a boy named Willie Calder who is quite sickly. Last fall Dr Willson of Edmonton advised us to send this boy to St Albert's where he could be treated by him and other doctors, with a good hope of his recovery. I could not follow that advice during winter, but now that the roads will soon be practicable we could easily send Willie Calder to the boarding school of St Alberta where he would be received by the Principal, to whom I spoke of his case last March. I propose then to you, to transfer this boy from our school to the St Albert school, and to replace him in our attendance return by one of those above the number authorized.\n\nCould not the Department provide for one of the doctors of Edmonton coming once every quarter to visit our children, you have Indian Reserves at Saddle Lake, Good and White fish Lakes where a medical visit would be very useful three or four times a year, and the same doctor could come as far as Lac La Biche without much more expense, and Indians from Heart Lake knowing the time of these visits could avail themselves of this opportunity and come to consult him here. I earnestly wish you could grant us this favour, but if you cannot send a doctor four times a year at least send him once in early summer and at Treaty time.\n\nYours, etc.\n\nsgd H. Grandin.\n\nNote:-\n\nThe boy mentioned herein is pupil No 17, Willie Calder, a non-treaty child for whom no grant is paid to the school. Will the Department kindly instruct in the matter.\nOttawa 3rd June 1896\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a copy of a letter from the Rev. Father Grandin, Principal of Lac-la-Biche Boarding school with reference to the case of Willie Calder, pupil at that school, whom Dr Wilson advises should be sent to St Albert for medical treatment; and in reply I beg to say that as this pupil is a non-treaty child for whom no grant is paid the Department has no objection to this being done if it will be likely to benefit the boy, as he is not an owner of the grant the Department does not see that his transfer will cause a vacancy.\n\n2. With regard to the 2nd paragraph of Father Grandin's letter, I beg to say that you have made no recommendation respecting the visit of a medical man to Lac-la-Biche.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt.: [Signature]\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nTHIS LETTER HAS BEEN SENT ON JUNE 1924:\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a copy of a letter from Mr. Agent Ross, regarding the proposal to receive five of the pupils from Blue Quill's School at Lac La Riche for whom the Department agreed to pay $50 per cap. per annum; and in reply I beg to say that the Department does not consider that further discussion has any excuse for complaint as to the amount to be paid for these pupils while in the school, as this sum has to be met out of the amount provided for the salary of a teacher at Blue Quill's, no other funds being available.\n\nHow is it proposed to make the additional pay recommended by Mr. Ross and which is apparently approved by you as you have forwarded it without comment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent:\nof Indian Affairs:\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, S.S.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of No 116859 Departmental letter of the 2nd instant relative to a grant for the 5 pupils whom it is proposed to transfer from the Blue Quill Day School to the Lac la Biche Boarding School with a view to closing the former, and to state in reply to the last paragraph that it was thought, in the event of the Department approving the payment of the full $72.00 grant, for each pupil, that the amount required in excess of that saved by closing the Day School, which would not exceed $5.00 a month, might be made a charge against the estimated saving in the school vote as per statement enclosed in the Commissioner's letter No 113 of 22nd March last.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nfor Commissioner.\n\nThe Deputy\n\nof the Superintendent General\n\nof Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th ultimo in further reference to the proposed transfer of five pupils from the Blue Quills school to the Lac la Biche Boarding School and the closing of the former school; and in reply I beg to say that the Department cannot agree to pay for more than five additional pupils at $60 per annum, but it will allow the tuition grant of $12 per annum for any day pupils in excess of the number provided for at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent:\nof Indian Affairs:\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nSir:-\n\nI have the honour to refer to Department letter of March 13th 1895 (on our 1891) authorizing the enrolment of the Calder children at the Lac La Biche Boarding School where they are now registered as:\n\nNo 16 Jimmy Calder\nNo 17 Willie Calder\nNo 021 Mary Calder.\n\nOwing to the enrolment of other children being in excess of the number authorized to earn the maintenance grant, none has yet been asked for the Calder children, but I enclose herewith Vouchers for a tuition grant for them for the four quarters of 1896-6 being $9.00. for each quarter.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nCommissioner.\n\nThe Deputy,\nof the Supt General,\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\nReserves furnish no argument for the presence of a doctor two or three times a year at Lac La Biche.\n\nWhen Dr. Wilson visited the Lac La Biche School at the last payments, he found the pupil, Willie Calder, suffering from a diseased hip, and he told the Rev. Sister Dougherty that he could not do anything for the lad till he was sent to the Hospital, where an operation might be performed after a consultation.\n\nThe other pupils of this school were in robust health, saving about six who were scrofulously affected, and, as the remedies for skin diseases seldom vary, these children could be treated in the school, if Dr. Wilson were requested to select the medicines required and forward written instructions to the Principal how they should be used.\n\nThe Indians at Lac La Biche and Hay Creek, who consulted Doctor Wilson last October numbered ten, and not one was seriously ill\u2014there were dyspeptic Indians, Indians with sore eyes, with rheumatism, but not one bad case, not even a venereal case, and these Indians had not seen a doctor for twelve months so that it is correct to argue that, if a Doctor visited these Indians more frequently, there would not be a single case of even sore eyes.\neyes or dyspepsia for him to attend to.\n\nThe cost of two visits yearly, at the present per diem allowance, would amount to about $475.00, viz:- twenty six days travel and twelve days attendance, making a total of 38 days at $12.50 = $475.00.\n\nsgd.

This may be granted, but certainly not to such a degree as to warrant the large expense which such visits by an Edmonton Physician would incur.

John Ross,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 7th, 1896.\n\nEXAMINED\n\nSCHOOL BRANCH,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of copy of letter from Mr. Agent Ross, dated 8th and transmitted by you on the 30th ultimo, reporting upon a representation made by the Rev. Father Grandin as to the alleged necessity for having a medical practitioner make occasional visits to his school and its neighbourhood, and in reply to inform you that if the Department be correct in assuming from the context of your marginal note that you intended to say that you were of opinion that it is not advisable to accede to the request of the Rev. Father, instead of that it is advisable, as you actually write, then it quite agrees with your view, and approves your decision.\n\nIn this connection it may be pointed out that an expenditure in the Saddle Lake Agency for the fiscal year recently ended was on account of medicines, $257.20, and for medical attendance $242.50, and exceeded the estimated amount of $377.50 by $122.21, which would seem to point to the necessity for retrenchment rather than increase of outlay in the direction in question.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) HAYTER REED\n\nA.

Father Grandin that a medical practitioner be allowed to visit the Indians of Lac La Biche, and to say that the assumption of the department is a correct one as the marginal note on our file copy of Mr. Agent Ross' letter of the 3rd ultimo reads\u2014\u201cIn view of the Agent's statements and the large expenditure which under his estimates would be necessary, taken in connection with the arrangement proposed in the next preceding paragraph, I am of opinion that it is impracticable to accede to the request of the Rev. Father Grandin, and he has been written to in this direction.\u201d\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Deputy.\n\nof the Supt General.\n\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\nD.I.A., 25th August, 1896.\n\nTo the Acting Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nRe request for assistance made by Indians at Lac la Biche, through Reverend Father Grondin.\n\n---\n\nWith reference to letter on attached file, from Rev. Father Grondin, the undersigned begs to state that the Indians referred to have not been wilfully neglected but treated on a well defined policy which is to leave hunting Indians in outlying districts to their own resources, until the failure of the hunt may convince them of the necessity for settling down and learning to farm; because, if persuaded to do so before having been so convinced, it is found that they go off on the hunt and neglect their farming at the most important seasons, and yet depend on their farms sufficiently to create a certain indifference with regard to energetically prosecuting the hunt, and then endeavour to hold the Department responsible and throw themselves upon it.\n\nAs the Indians decide to turn to agriculture, the undersigned would recommend that, in accordance with the policy which has proved so successful at Onion Lake and other points, instead of giving them a separate reserve, involving sooner or later, the provision of a Farming Instructor, and a not inconsiderable expenditure in other ways, they be made to join the reserve at Saddle Lake, where all the machinery for their instruction and supervision exists and where they would benefit by the help and example of others who have already become farmers. There is\na band there of their co-religionists, and some land might be added to the reserve if the owners demand it in consideration of the addition to their numbers.\n\nIt has not been considered inconsistent with the policy defined to send the Indians some relief when emergency has arisen, and such has been done; but to give such assistance as now asked for would only retard the eventual settlement of the Indians, and do more harm than good.\n\nIn any case, Lac la Biche is not a good locality for the Indians, surrounded as it is by Half Breeds who can hardly eke out an existence. As to cattle, such Indians do not understand their care, and soon tire of them, and either let them starve, or kill and eat them.\n\nThe fact that these Indians forfeited Treaty rights by disloyalty during the Rebellion exonerates the Department from any charge of breaking faith with them in carrying out a policy which experience teaches to be in their own as well as the Department's best interests; and as a matter of fact the Treaty stipulation relative to choice of reserves was \"That the Chief Superintendent of Indian Affairs shall depute and send a suitable person to determine and set apart the reserves for each band, after consulting with the Indians thereof as to the locality which may be found to be most suitable for them.\"\n\n(sgd) Hayter Reed.\nMemo. for acting minister\n\nThis is the copy of my memo on Mr. Grandin's letter which you desired to refer to in connection with letter from Mr. Oliver, M.P., to the 10th inst.\n\nHayter Reed\nDir.\n17-5-56\nIn the hope of a favourable answer to my request.\n\nI am, etc.,\nsgd H. Grandin.\n\nNote:-\n\n(A) At the date of writing this letter the Rev Father Grandin was not yet in receipt of the one from this office, advising him that $12.00 per annum for tuition for 5 children for Blue Quill's would be paid in addition to $60.00 for maintenance, as instructed by Department letter No 118359 of July 13th 1896.\n\n(B) Reference Rev Father Grandin's letter to the Department dated July 11th 1896. If by any means provision can be made for increasing the number to 40, apart from the 5 to be sent from Blue Quill's to be paid for from salary saved, I would recommend it to the favourable consideration of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nCommissioner\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina.\n\nSir:-\n\nIn your letter of the 22nd June No 113, you seem surprised that I did not accept the offer made to me by Mr J. Ross, to receive 5 children of the Blue Quill day school at $80.00 per annum.\n\n(A) The reason why I did not accept the offer was that by my acceptance the other children who frequent that school would have been deprived of their instruction they are receiving, and that there was nothing to show that this diminution of the grant was only temporary. Although to me this offer was much, I had 30 Indian children and was paid for 28 only.\n\nWith such a number above the 28, I think I was justified in making a remark about the diminution of the grant for the five I was asked to receive. If the Department would make provision for all the children who frequent Blue\nBlue Quill's day school, I would take them willingly next spring. I am getting the lumber ready for building a new school house, but just now there would not be room enough for all.\n\nYou tell me in the same letter that an amount has been placed in the estimates for 1896-7 for 30 pupils, this being the number asked for in my letter to the Department at Ottawa a year ago.\n\n(A) I asked for this number at that time because I could then get that number of children, but now it is altogether insufficient.\n\nAt this very moment I have four applications for admission, and before winter I will get some more. As I wrote to you some time ago the number should be increased to at least forty to meet the present needs, and if you mean to close Blue Quill's day school, that number would be too small by far. Mr Agent Ross knows as well as I do that my demand is not too great and I believe he recommends himself strongly a large increase in the number of authorized pupils. I hope, Sir, you will take my request in consideration and obtain the increase I named above. You know that it is not so easy to make Indians understand the necessity of instructing and educating their children. Now that they begin to take our advice, and are willing to give their children a chance of bettering their condition, do not refuse them the help that you alone can give them.\n\nIn\nIn the hope of a favourable answer to my request.\n\nI am, etc.,\nsgd H. Grandin.\n\nNote:-\n\n(A) At the date of writing this letter the Rev Father Grandin was not yet in receipt of the one from this office, advising him that $12.00 per annum for tuition for 5 children for Blue Quill's would be paid in addition to $60.00 for maintenance, as instructed by Department letter No 118359 of July 13th 1896.\n\n(B) Reference Rev Father Grandin's letter to the Department dated July 11th 1895. If by any means provision can be made for increasing the number to 40, apart from the 5 to be sent from Blue Quill's to be paid for from salary saved, I would recommend it to the favourable consideration of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nCommissioner.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 23rd ultimo relative to the enrolment of the Calder children at Lac-la-Biche boarding school, I beg to say that a cheque for the sum of $50 was sent the Principal direct on the 4th instant in payment of the tuition of these children for one year (1895-6).\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs:\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nMontreal, August 27th 1896\n\nMr. Read - Dep.

The Government answers for about twenty of them; but we have to accept about thirty children and leave many others out.\n\nI would insist upon being allowed, by the Department, to receive at least forty Indian children in that establishment and would be much obliged to you, my dear Sir, if you would kindly take note of my petition which is also that of the Principal of the Establishment, and have it agreed by the Department.\n\nAnd believe me, with Consideration,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.M.S.\nOTTAWA 31st August 1896\n\nMy Lord,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 27th instant calling attention to the provision made for the Lac-\u00e0-la-Croix Boarding school and asking that the grant may be increased to provide for at least 40 Indian children at that Institution; and in reply I regret to say that I am unable to hold out any hope to Your Lordship of this being done as the Government is not making any provision for increasing the grant to our schools this year beyond what has already been considered.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nYour Lordship's most obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent:\nof Indian Affairs:\n\nHis Lordship,\nThe Bishop of St Albert,\nMaison des P\u00e8res Oblats\n107 Rue Visitation\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a copy of a letter from Rev. Father Grumlin, Principal of the Lac-la-Plante school, making that the number of pupils provided for be increased; and in reply I beg to say that it is not at all likely that further provision will be made this year, beyond what has already been considered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent:\nof Indian Affairs:\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.T.\nSir:\n\nIn connection with the attached attendance Return of the Lac La Biche Boarding School, for the September 1896 quarter, I have the honour to state, for the information of the Department, that in a recent interview at this office with the Rev Father Leduc, that gentleman expressed his disappointment that provision had not been made in the Estimates of 1896-7 for the maintenance of 40 pupils at this Institution.\n\nIt is claimed that in the vicinity of the school there are enough eligible children to make up that enrolment, and that their parents are clamoring for their admission. In view of the fact that the buildings had been erected and equipped, and an efficient staff employed at the sole expense of the Mission, the Rev Father feels that their efforts should be encouraged by the Department to the extent of making provision for the maintenance of the children available.\n\nI succeeded however in securing his consent to an arrangement\n\nThe Deputy,\n\nof the Supt General,\n\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\narrangement, for the present, similar to the one approved by the Department for last fiscal year, that so far as the enrolment at the Lac La Biche School exceeds the 23 pupils for whose maintenance there provision has been made, a corresponding reduction will be made from the 30 provided for at St Albert, and Father Leduc has promised to secure His Lordship's written consent to this arrangement.\n\nIn this connection I would refer to Department letters of March 6th and July 13th last, relative to the proposed closing of the Blue Quill's day school, and the transferring of 5 of the pupils to the Lac La Biche Boarding School. I learned from Father Leduc that His Lordship Bishop Grandin is in favour of closing the Blue Quill's School, if provision is made for all its pupils at the Boarding School.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nCommissioner.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 13th ultimo in which you state that the Rev. Father Bede has expressed his disappointment that provision had not been made in this year's Estimates for the maintenance of 10 pupils at the Lac-la-Biche Boarding School, and to your suggestion that so far as the enrollment at this school exceeds the twenty-three pupils provided for a corresponding reduction may be made from the 60 estimated for St Albert, I beg to say that if the Church authorities consent to this arrangement, the Department will sanction the Lac-la-Biche school taking up to 35 pupils.\n\nWith regard to the proposal to close Blue Quill's school, the Department will consent to the transfer of 5 pupils to Lac-la-Biche school, in addition to the 25 above mentioned, and any additional pupils from that school are to be counted among the 35.\n\nThe arrangement will then stand thus:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\text{25 pupils now estimated for} \\\\\n&\\text{5 \" to be provided for by closing Blue Quill's Sch;} \\\\\n&\\text{Any additional pupils from Blue Quills to be among the} \\\\\n&\\text{12 from which a corresponding reduction is to be made from} \\\\\n&\\text{St Albert School.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nIt should also be understood that the Department\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\n\nRegina, N.W.T.\ndoes not agree to increase the number of pupils to be provided for in next year's estimates beyond 38, and in the event of the Department not having funds for any numbers over this the Church will be expected to make provision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent:\nof Indian Affairs:\nIndian Agent's Office,\nSaddle Lake Agency,\nSaddle Lake P.O.\n15th June 1899.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that Harriet Sinclair pupil No.036, aged 8 years, of the Blue Quill Boarding School is suffering from very sore eyes and requires constant medical treatment which the situation of the Blue Quill's Reserve renders impossible, the nearest Doctor being at Fort Saskatchewan 75 miles distant.\n\nThe case is such a serious one that I would ask for permission to send the little girl to the Edmonton hospital where she would be well treated. The hospital charges used to be and so far as I know still are $1.00 per day, board, care and medicine, and Dr. Harrison, medical attendant for the Edmonton Agency would no doubt give his services at the usual rate to the Department, of $1.00 per visit.\n\nIt would be useless, so far as the child is concerned, to send her home, there she would have no attention, her mother is dead and her father is a thriftless cripple. The Rev. Principal, Father Grandin, agrees with me that the only way to cure the child is to send her to the hospital. I therefore hope you will kindly grant my request and send me a reply at your earliest convenience.\n\n(Sgd) W.

Further fire protection is also required. The cost is apportioned as follows:\u2014 Addition for dormitory $1,200.00\nRecreation hall.................. $100.00\nPainting.......................... $100.00\nFire protection................... $360.00\n5 pupils @ $72.00.................. $360.00\n\n$1,960.00\n\nThe additional building would provide accommodation for an increased number of pupils. An item to cover the proposed expenditure was inserted in the Commissioner's estimates last year, but was disallowed by the Superintendent General. The Principal was informed, upon renewal of his application, that the matter would receive consideration, but that it was doubtful whether provision could be made for the expenditure.\n\nTo provide an amount to build a laundry at the Rupert's Land Industrial, to replace the one destroyed by fire.......................... $1,000.00\n\nThis building is absolutely necessary, and the estimate of cost has been kept as low as possible consistent with the requirements.\n\nForward........... $2,960.00\nSir,\n\nI am directed to advise you that an application has been received from Mr. Leon Balter, Principal of the Blue Quill Indian Boarding School in the Saddle Lake Reserve, asking for a free permit to cut 50,000 feet of timber in Township 57, Range 14, West of the 4th Meridian, to be used in the construction of an addition to the School.

D. McLEAN\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Batty, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBadilo Lake, Alta.\nDear Sir,\n\nA few months ago I have made an application to the Department of Public Works to get a permit to cut 50,000 feet of timber to be used in the construction of an addition to the Blue Quills Boarding School, the work having been authorized by the Indian Commissioner David Laird.\n\nThere was a saw-mill not far from here last winter and I was anxious not to miss the chance I had to get the lumber there at a reasonable price. I gave the contract to Henri Guibert Carpenter, and his men waited for the permit about four weeks. After that they began to cut the logs and saw the lumber, as no one of us doubted the permit was not granted, the Department itself having authorized the work!\nBut when the lumber were cut and all carried near the School instead of a permit I was not a little amazed in receiving a letter from the Indian Commissioner (to whom I had sent the bill) saying that a mistake had been made and that the $600 in fact had been voted not for us but for the Pegau Reserve.\n\nHowever he recommended the affair at Ottawa, and we received the $600 not to pay the building which is not yet erected, but to pay the lumber which is cut and freighted.\n\nWe thought we were justified to cut the lumber before we got the permit as we could not suppose it would be refused or delayed any longer, as according to the timber regulations we had a right to a free permit.\n\nI hope these explanations will give you satisfaction.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLeon Butler\n\nprincipal\nOttawa, July 6, 1908.\n\nRev. Sirs\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th ult., in which you state that the timber, which you required to build an addition to the Blue Quills Boarding School was cut without waiting for the issue of a permit.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this should not have been done without authority from the Department of the Interior.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. B. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Leon Balton,\nprincipal,\nBlue Quills Boarding School,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nOttawa, July 6, 1908.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 1st April, I am in reference to the application of the Rev. Leon Balter, principal of the Blue Quill Indian Boarding School, for a permit to cut 50,000 feet of lumber to be used in building an addition to the school, I beg to say that such addition is being made to the building.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nP. G. Koyes, Esq.,\nsecretary,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 6th ultimo, File No. 116859, with respect to the application of the Rev. Leon Balter, for a free permit to cut 50,000 ft. of timber on available lands in Township 57, Range 14, West of the 4th Meridian, which you state is to be used in building an addition to the Blue Quills Indian Boarding School, I am directed to say that it has been decided to authorize the Crown Timber Agent at Edmonton to issue the required permit to the applicant on the condition that when the permit is being returned an affidavit will be made to the effect that all the timber cut thereunder has been used solely in the erection of the School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

McLean\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Leon Balles,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Boarding School,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nOttawa, August 31, 1908.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI have to call your attention to the confusion that arises from the fact that the Roman Catholic Church has under its auspices three boarding schools, Blue Quills, Peigan (R.C.), and Providence Mission, are all called by the Principals \"Sacred Heart.\"\n\nAs a file in Point you will recall that last year the Blue Quills school received a grant of $600.00 for buildings, etc., which was intended for the Peigan (R.C.) schools. Much trouble is also caused in the Department in filing correspondence when only the name \"Sacred Heart Boarding School\" is given. To avoid this I have to ask that you will be good enough to request the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church to use the names given these schools by the Department, as mentioned above. Of course, the Department has no objection to their using both names, if they so desire, but for its guidance it wishes to have the Departmental name in each case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Hon. David Laird\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSacred Heart\n8th April 1910\n\nTo the Very Honourable Frank Oliver,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nVery Honourable Sir,\n\nI think it is my duty to write you about a class of children living on this Reserve, and I wish you will be interested in their fate. I mean those illegitimate children, whose mother is of Indian blood, and whose father is some White Man. The father does not acknowledge the child, and so the Mother alone incumbs the duty to feed, educate and instruct the child. She being an Indian Woman living on the Reserve, necessarily the child himself will be brought up among Indians. All his life he will be considered and will consider himself an Indian. He will only feel at home on the Reserve, where he knows all his relatives. He too, would never be willing to acknowledge his father, and to stay with him.\n\nAre not these children unfortunate enough, and are we to make their condition worse yet, in refusing them the admission to the only School at hand, that is the Indian Boarding School. Are those children condemned to remain without any Education at all?\n\nHitherto the Indian Department has it always considered its duty to admit such children in the Boarding schools, and such policy was right and fair.\n\nI write to you personally, very Honourable Sir, knowing enough the humanity of your sentiments and ideas, to believe that you will design interest yourself in behalf of these unfortunate children, so much so as their number is very limited.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\nOttawa, April 22nd., 1910.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 8th. of April addressed to the Honourable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, I have to inform you that it is not the intention of this Department to alter its policy as regards the admission to residential schools of children who have Indian blood, whether they be legitimate or illegitimate. The Department will, however, insist on all the conventions being observed in these matters and no children can be admitted until after a careful medical examination, and a recommendation and full statement of the facts from the Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

School\n\nAlberta Inspectorate,\nSaddle Lake, March 14, 1914\n\nSir,\n\n15. A complaint was made by some of the Indians regarding the management of this school about a year ago and I was directed to investigate but as this is my first visit here since I was unable to do it earlier, I shall make a special report in connection with the complaint referred to at an early date. I may state however that one of the principal items of complaint was that the pupils did not get sugar on their porridge in addition to milk.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.A. Markle,\nInspector.\nRe. Mr. Brighteyes Complaints.\n\n1. Blue Quill School's Boarders have 3 full meals per day besides lunch at 3:30 P.M. They have oatmeal with milk at breakfast (or molasses for a short time during winter when we get short of milk.) But we don't think advisable to give sugar at every meal. Refits have bread & butter or butter in summer beside oatmeal & milk. They are also helped with tea.\n\n2. It is absolutely false that Refits are given at breakfast the same food from the Sisters' table. 1st because the Sisters, the staff, the Principal and the children have their meal at the same time (7 A.M.) 2nd Because scraps from the Sisters would hardly be sufficient to feed 45 Boarders with a very extraordinary good appetite.\n\n3. Noon Meal - Children have soup, meat, potatoes & other vegetables, tea & milk every day but Fridays. It is utterly false they are fed of the refuse from the Sisters' table.\n\n4. I must state once for all that the meat is of the same animals we are helped with (we the staff) and the bread is absolutely the same as the one on the Sisters' and the Fathers' table, being of the 1st Quality of Strong Bakers' Flour. We have no other in this establishment.\n\n5. Have meat, vegetables at supper, rice & beans and occasionally fruits at noon evening, pudding or some kind of cake &c.\n6) Any body visiting the school can judge by himself of\nthe splendid health the children are enjoying in spite of\nthe diseases they have inherited from their parents.\n\n7) Would like to know if there was ever a single Indian\non this P.Q. Reserve who has been qualified to judge\nof the competency of the Sisters as teachers. Will state\nof the two Sisters teaching at school, one is Irish, com-\npletely devoid of English accent, never speaks a word\nof French to the pupils. The other is of Canadian\nextraction, but, according to all even the Indians\nthemselves is the best teacher they ever had.\n\n8) In regard to Clothing I will express the wish that in this\nafternoon the pupils be more modest and be always active\nas they are just now. It is absolutely false that they\nwork outside in the winter without mittens and, I am sure,\nthere is not a single Indian on the settlement who ever\nspent $10 yearly for extras in favor of their children.\nThe Sisters have been very lenient in correcting\noffenses and if parents were not their own children's\nmore advisers, they would save the staff a good deal\nof trouble & worry.\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nBlue Quills School,\nSaddle Lake.\n\nAlberta Inspectorate,\nRed Deer, March 25, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nAbout 14 months ago I was instructed to investigate a number of complaints made by Indians against the staff of the Blue Quills boarding school. The letter was placed on the wrong file, evidently, for I'm unable to place my hands on it as I expected for the purpose of quoting No. and date.\n\nWhile at Saddle Lake Agency I learned that Peter Bright Eyes was the chief complainant and I called him to make specific charges.\n\nCharge 1. Pupils get for breakfast, so they say, \"The leave over from the sisters table, such as bread made into soup with small pieces of meat therein and hot water, bread, butter and either milk or tea without any sugar in the tea. Complainant thought should have porridge with milk and sugar, or meat, in addition to bread and butter and tea with sugar.\n\nCharge 2. Lunch about the same as breakfast and no sugar in the tea. Complainant thought children should have soup, meat and potatoes or other vegetables, bread and butter and tea with sugar therein.\n\nCharge 3. Stated got principally the left over from the sisters table for supper and bread and butter. The tea, as usual, no sugar therein. Entertained the view that the children should get for supper: bread and butter, fruit of some sort, such as dried or evaporated apples, rhubarb in season or boiled rice with milk or sugar thereon.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nCharge 4. Complainant stated that \"too much French spoken by the staff and one teacher spoke with a strong French accent and this objectionable to him when he desires the children to talk and understand English\".\n\nCharge 5. \"Pupils too poorly clothed and that he usually expends about $10.00 annually on clothing for his boy now in that school.\"\n\nCharge 6. \"Thinks too severe punishment inflicted, does not object to light punishment if pupils deserve it\"\n\n\"Peter Bright Eyes\" further stated that there were three new sisters since the complaint made and with the exception of one sister they were a great improvement over those transferred, that there has been a good deal of improvement in the management within the last year but still room for improvement.\n\nI shall attach herewith the Rev'd. Father Husson's answers to the charges made and I desire to say that the teacher referred to as having a strong French accent in her speech was absent and that I'm unable, therefor, to state whether \"Bright Eyes\" complaint is reasonable or otherwise.\n\nI examined a lot of bread newly taken from the oven. It was light, sweet and well baked. Evidently a good grade of flour is purchased, better than some lots I have seen delivered under contract to the Department and for issue to the Indians and to the officers of the Department.\n\nPersonally I am not in sympathy with educating children to demand sugar in and on every thing set before them to eat. Well cooked porridge with good milk is sufficiently good for me and think it should be for all children. I further think that schools should not encourage the high cost\ncost of living. Plain substantial well cooked food and chiefly of such products as will be within their reach, if they work, in after life. Most Indians are in a position to keep a cow and cultivate a garden and I prefer to know that the children are supplied with an abundance of good milk and vegetables to sugar on porridge and in tea.\n\nMy impression is that the Saddle Lake Indians have, not now at least, many reasons for complaining regarding the treatment within the Blue Quill's school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInsp.\nOttawa, April 7, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo reporting the result of your investigations into the charges made against the management of the Blue Quills Boarding School by the Indians and enclosing the Principal's answers to these charges.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your report is satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. A. Markle, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRed Deer, Alta.\nOttawa, April 7, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of February 4, 1913, in regard to charges made by the Indians against the Blue Quills Boarding School I beg to say that the Department is in receipt of a report from Mr. Inspector Markle in this connection which would go to show that there is nothing in the complaints to justify the Department in censoring the school management.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChas. E. Hughes, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nBlue Quills Boarding School\nSacred Heart, Alta.\nMay 26, 1914.\n\nTo\nThe Honorable W. Scott,\nSupt. Gen. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nWe have been told by our Principal and teachers that you intend visiting this far away country in the near future. Welcome there! thrice welcome honored sir! to Alberta, and though we are the least of your proteges, we are emboldened to hope that the honor may be ours of welcoming you to our loved Boarding School.\n\nWe have heard so much of your devotion to the Indians that we feel we are addressing no stranger; therefore we extend to you a hearty welcome in advance.\n\nWe have the honor to be,\nYour humble servants,\nThe Pupils of this school.\nWe profit by this occasion to thank you for all you have done for this Institute, and beg of you to continue your great interest in its concerns.\n\nA Thousand Welcomes in advance, is the sincere and heartfelt wish of those who have the honor to be Your humble servants.\n\nThe Sisters of Charity.\nBlue Quills Boarding School,\nSacred Heart, Alberta\nMay 28th 1914\n\nTo\nThe Honorable W. Scott\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nHaving heard of your proposed trip to this Western Country, may we not hope that a favorable Alberta breeze will induce you to extend your visit as far as Blue Quills Boarding School? Which though one of the least of your numerous institutes, would be delighted to be privileged by your presence, even for a short time.\n\nPermit the liberty we have taken in soliciting such a favor, but we do so wish you to see our tawny little pupils, for whose interests you have been so long laboring.\nJune 4th, 1914.\n\nDear Mesdames,\n\nI have the very kind invitation of yourselves and the pupils of the Blue Quills Boarding School to visit that institution when I go west on my proposed trip at the end of this month. I regret that I will not be able to visit northern Alberta this year, and so will be denied the pleasure of calling at the Blue Quills School. I would like to know personally all those who are engaged in this important branch of our Indian work, but owing to lack of time my itinerary is necessarily very limited.\n\nThanking you for very kind expressions contained in your letter, I am, Mesdames,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Sisters of Charity,\nBlue Quills Boarding School, Deputy Superintendent General,\nSacred Heart, Alta.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that in connection with the Joseph Brant School on Blue Hill Reserve, in view of the present state of the regulations in force at said school, I thought it best to bring the matter to your attention.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Seal]\npleasure. That the result is worthy of recommendation. They continued to learn with a lighter heart in class and soon finished all kinds of useful work besides. Thus encouraged I now come to put out the matter to you, trusting you will take it into consideration and also join in favor of that school the approval of the Department.\n\nWith good wishes for the coming season,\n\nTrusting you will give respectfully to Mr.\n\nSister E. Pige Provincial\n\nDec. 11 1874\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the letter from Sister Page, Provincial of St. Albert, in which she states that she has adopted the half day system for the girls in the Blue Quills Boarding School I beg to say that this is only carrying out the policy of the Department in regard to the teaching in schools of this class and I see no reason why it should not be approved of.\n\nSome of the Blue Quills Indians made complaints against the staff of this school, which were investigated by Mr. Inspector Markle last March, and I am under the impression that the Rev. Sister Page desires the approval of the Department to the change she has made to guard against any further complaints from the Indians.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, December 23, 1914.\nOttawa, December 28, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 11th instant I have to say that the Department approves of your action in adopting the half day system for the older girls in the Blue Quills Boarding School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLennan,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Master E. Ross,\nProvincial,\nYoung Indians' Agent,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nSt. Albert Boarding School,\nJan. 15, 1916.\n\nHonorable Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nAllow me to claim your attention again concerning the Boarding School on Blue Quill Reserve.\n\nThe object of my request today is that you would kindly allow the grant for sixty pupils. The Principal tells me that there are enough children on the Reserve to make it possible to take even more than that number into the school. We have already begun to draw plans for the building of an annex but shall wait for a reply from you before we proceed any further.\n\nHoping that the expected reply will be a favorable one,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nYour Grateful servant,\n\nSister M. A. Leduc\nPrincipal\n\nAccommodation:\n19 boys\n21 girls\nTotal: 40\n\nClassroom for 8-10\nJanuary 20th, 1916.\n\nMadam -\n\nI have your communication of the 15th instant, in further reference to the Blue Quill's Boarding School in which you ask a grant for 60 pupils instead of 45, as at present.\n\nI regret very much that I am unable to grant your request. The funds at the disposal of the Department for some time to come will be much more limited than during the past few years, and the strictest economy will have to be exercised. For this reason the Department cannot assume the financial obligation that would be entailed in increasing the pupilage at this institution.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Sister M. A. Ledue,\nProvincial Superior,\nSt. Albert Boarding School,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nSt. Albert Boarding School,\nSt. Albert, Dec. 29, 1915.\n\nHonorable Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nAllow me to entertain you briefly concerning the Indian Boarding School at Saddle Lake, on Blue Quill Reserve.\n\nA word of explanation, however may be necessary to make it clear to you why I should be interested in this Institution.\n\nSince last October, I am named Provincial Superior, in replacement of Reverend Mother Page who has been transferred to Manitoba. Having just visited the Saddle Lake Boarding School, I find it in great need of improvement and am coming to solicit your kind favor in its behalf.\n\nWe would be disposed to undertake the improvement called for but the present limited resources of that house make it impossible for us to meet all the necessary expenditures.\n\nIf you could from now on, allow us the full grant per capita as it stands at present in most schools, and also reimburse the amount that might have came to us if we had been allowed the full amount since the new allowance has been made, with this help we would immediately begin to take measures to have the necessary space and other accommodations required by the Department.\n\nTrusting, Honorable Sir, in your past kindness, and in the interest which you yourself have in these Indian Schools, may I hope that you will kindly take into consideration our humble demand.\n\nI am, Honorable Sir, with sincere thanks,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nSister M. A. Leduc, Sulp. Pro.\nJanuary 7th, 1916.\n\nDear Madam -\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 29th ultimo, in reference to the Blue Quills Boarding School. I gather from your letter that you wish to have this school graded in Class A instead of Class C as at present and you be paid at the rate of $125.00 per pupil per annum; this grading to take effect from the time that the agreement was entered into for the maintenance and management of this school in 1911.\n\nI regret very much that it is not possible to comply with your request, as the condition of these buildings would not permit of their being graded in Class A, and even should it have been possible to comply with your request as regards the grading, payment could not now be made at the increased rate for the years that are past.\n\nIf you can see your way to remodel your buildings so that they will meet the requirements of\n\nRev. Sister M. A. Leduc,\nProvincial Superior,\nSt. Albert Boarding School,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nof Class A, I shall be very pleased indeed to allow the increased grant.\n\nI hope that you will have a happy and successful year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nMay 26th, 1916.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nIf there is an application for increased per capita grant at the Blue Quills Boarding school, see Inspector Markle's report dated May 19th, 1916, on file.\n\n116859/6.\n\nPP.\nNote - The second petition was filed with extract of covering letter.\n\nFile 35995\nTo the Very Honorable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nHofsmundt, dear Sir,\n\nThe Indians of the Saddle Lake Reserve wish to draw your attention to the Blue Quill Reserve Boarding School. This establishment can barely accommodate 50 boarders and nearly one half of this Reserve, Whitefish Lake and Beaver Lake Reserves cannot get here any instruction for the want of space, although we are all willing to entrust them to the care of the R.C. Mission.\n\nOn the other hand, we object to our children being sent far away from the Reserve for their training.\n\nOur greatest wish is to obtain from the Department an Industrial School here instead of the Blue Quill Boarding School, with accommodation for 100 pupils.\n\nSo that our good will we have decided to grant in this purpose \u00bd section of land, which must be utilized for farming and \u00bd section for pasture.\n\nThe reason we apply for an Industrial School\nit is absolutely necessary to our children to learn farming, carpenter and blacksmith trade. They will never be able any more to make their living by hunting as of old.\n\nHoping you will take our request in consideration we beg to be\n\nHonourable and Dear Sir,\n\nyour obedient servants,\n\nThe Saddle Lake Indians\n\n[Signature]\n\nN.B. The original of this petition was destroyed by means of the fire at the R.C.M.P. building.\nDear Sir,\n\nA few days ago three Indians from Saddle Lake Reserve came all the way from there to see me in St. Albert. They were:\n\n1. Thomas (Shokohus) Head chief - Protestant\n2. Moses (Ayawake) Counsellor - Catholic\n3. Peter Bright Eyes - Catholic\n\nThey wanted to see me about the two ordered petitions:\n\n1. One petition referring to the transformation of the Roman Catholic Boarding School at Blue Quills' Band into a Roman Catholic Industrial school; the other\n2. Petition referring to a project of handing to Chief Pakan of White Earth Lake Reserve, a certain tract of the Saddle Lake Reserve.\n\nI advised them to go and treat both questions, and especially the latter one, with the Indian agent on the Reserve, and then I would be ready to give them any assistance needed.\n\nI am informed that the agent refused to forward their petitions to the Indian Department.\n\nConsequently, I believe that I may be allowed to give through your good offices, some explanations on both questions, to the Indian Department.\n\n1st question: Transformation of the Roman Catholic Boarding School into an Industrial school. I may say that this is desirable, as the Indians object always to have their children transferred to a far away normal school, and the present building is not large enough to accommodate the number of children who could be admitted into it, so that the request of the Indians is perfectly justified.\n\nI may add that when the Department puts up a new enlarged building, we will be in a position to take charge of said school, and the community of Saddle\nalready in charge of the Boarding school, will provide the necessary staff for the new institution, viz., masters for a few ladies, besides the teaching staff.\n\n3rd question: Project of handing to chief Pakan a certain tract of the Reserve.\n\nAlthough I do not like, in a general way, to interfere in purely secular matters, yet in this particular case, I think I can, at least, explain the reasons of the objection to the project, coming from both sides, Protestant as well as Catholic.\n\nSome arrangement has been entered into, several years ago, to the effect that the Indians from White Fish Lake Reserve and other Reserves, of the same agency, could come and locate on the Saddle Lake Reserve, and vice versa. Indians from Saddle Lake could go and locate on the other Reserve. Yet it must be noted that this arrangement had been taken all in favour of the benefit of the other Reserve, as there is not the smallest inducement for Indians of Saddle Lake to quit, and go elsewhere.\n\nWork, partly expensive, has been done on the Saddle Lake Reserve, as the fencing in all round of the Reserve, to which Chief Pakan have never contributed. The only assistance received, and contributed personally by three or four Indians, of the other Reserves, does not amount to more than \u00a320.\n\nThe Indians of Saddle Lake Reserve are perfectly satisfied to stand by the arrangement, leaving the Reserve undivided. But now it is proposed that the Reserve be divided and that a tract from it be handed to Chief Pakan and his band, in separate ownership. This they object to.\n\nIt is no secret that Mr. Inspector Marsh has been trying to get the Indians' consent, for the relinquishing of part of the Reserve. The impression is that, if a certain tract of the Reserve is made out to Chief Pakan, he will take it immediately and get all the profit of the sale for himself and his band.\n\nThe rest of the Reserve, in a general way, seem to be opposed to the sale of part of the Reserve, or at any rate, if the sale is to take place, we want the consent of the majority of the Band; they want to share in the profits.\n\nI hope that these explanations will be taken in good part, and are professed only with the view of securing equal justice to all.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. I hope I may depend on your kindness to communicate these remarks to Hon. the Superintendent-General, if necessary, before withdrawing your attention.\nOttawa, July 26th, 1916.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th ultimo, enclosing two petitions, the first of which requests that the Blue Quills boarding school be made an industrial school, and the second refers to a claim of Chief Pakan to a certain section of the Saddle Lake reserve.\n\nIn reply to the first petition, I beg to say that the Department regrets that it is unable to consider the changing of the Blue Quills boarding school to an industrial school.\n\nYou will be advised with regard to the second petition in a separate letter.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAssistant Deputy\n\nMost Reverend E.J. Legal, O.M.I.,\nArchbishop of Edmonton,\nSt. Albert, Alberta.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the Blue Quills Boarding School, October 6, 1916. Original on bl6859-6.\n\n10.- The main building was generally overhauled this year and some additions made. Water has been conveyed from the well through a pipe to a tank in the attic and cess pit connected with the lavatories, etc. The work has not yet been completed and in my opinion when it is completed according to present plans, will be lacking in the particulars specified under sections 2, 5, 6 to place it in Class \"A\", as defined on pages 5 and 6 of the agreement relating to schools. The basement is not a full one and with a floor of hard material; there is no first class isolation wards and there is not sufficient space in the dormitory in use by the boys. It would have, I think, been prudent to have elevated the main building 12 or 18\" in the first instance, then excavated under to make a full basement and placed a solid wall, stone, brick or cement concrete, throughout. The room now in use for the senior classes could be transformed into an additional dormitory but if this is done it would be necessary to provide additional room room for classes. It is intended to add some modern lighting system. My impression is that more improvements are under consideration and that they will be carried out as soon as funds are available to meet the cost. The greatest difficulty now will be to get the basement full and to conform to the requirements.\n\n11.- The rooms were clean and tidy and so were the yards. If the building had been raised 12 or, better, 18\" the drainage would have been improved and a full basement secured with less excavation, better light, etc., secured too.\n\nSgd. J. A. Markle,\nInsp.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the Blue Quill Boarding\n\nMay 18, 1916. Original on 116859-6. 4946*7\n\nThe church authorities own the buildings in connection with this institution, so it has been decided. They are now at work on improvements and with a view of placing it under Class \"A\". An \"Ideal\" steam heater has been set in the basement, radiators placed in all rooms, 5 bath tubs and 5 closets, 6 wash basins and 2 sinks are installed. A water tank, capacity about 500 gallons, placed in the attic and hot and cold water will shortly be provided for use in the kitchen in connection with the baths and wash basins.\n\nThe site was not well chosen for such an institution. There is not sufficient fall of land from the main building to ensure good drainage and at a nominal cost. A sewer pipe is to be carried to an unused well and I presume when the cess pit (old well) gets full it must be pumped out and transported away. There is a stone and mortar wall foundation, but the basement is not a \"full one\", neither has the portion excavated a cement concrete floor. About the only method of procedure, in my opinion, to get this institution in Class \"A\", as defined in the memorandum of agreement, page 6 of correspondence and agreement record, was to have jacked up the building about 3', excavated to a depth of about 6' under the entire building, placed new foundation walls throughout with windows therein and a floor throughout of cement concrete. The additional 3' elevation would have provided a well lighted basement, greater fall for the sewer, etc. Then additional dormitory space for boys would be demanded. The ceilings fortunately on the two floors are high and these ceilings have been lined with dressed matched lumber and walls have either been painted or it is still to be done. It is intended too, to place new flooring (laminate) throughout the first floor. The work is not completed at present. It is expected that it will be during June and that after the summer vacation it will be in shape to ask for the grant to be increased from $100.00 to $125.00 per capita. Oil and lamps supply the required light.\n\n(Sgd) J. A. Markle,\nInsp.\nOFFICE OF THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL\nOTTAWA January 27, 1915.\n\nThe Schools Branch,\n\nKindly note that Chief Samson, who represented the Indians of the Saddle Lake agency, in an interview with me yesterday, stated that the Indians do not wish the situation of the Blue Quill's Roman Catholic boarding school to be changed, that such a change would not be viewed with favour by the Indians, as it would probably be proposed to locate the new building on the Protestant section of the reserve.\n\n[Signature]\n\nD. S. G. I.\nDear Sir,\n\nAllow me to remind you that at the time of my last visit to your office, you had kindly promised me to see if you could not do something for the Saddle Lake Indian School. As I told you the only improvement to be made for placing this school in the A class, is the cement foundation and floor. The excavation is begun, and it would not take much time to finish the work. Of course the $10 per capita will be a help, to this as to other schools, but do you not think that all the ameliorations made by the Rev. Sisters deserve a better acknowledgment from the Department.\n\nThe Saddle Lake school is doing good work and we could get many more pupils if we were allowed to receive them. I hope and trust that you will see your way to grant my request in its favor.\n\nYours respectfully\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. [Signature]\nAugust 15th, 1927.\n\nDear Father Grandin -\n\nI have your favour of the 4th instant, in reference to the Saddle Lake Indian School. I very much regret that we will not be able to add anything further to the school expenses this year. For favourable consideration we must await a time when our appropriation for Indian Education may be increased.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. H. Grandin, O.M.I.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nEDMONTON, Alberta. August 29th, 1918.\n\nD. SCOTT Deputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe management of the Indian Boarding School of Saddle Lake have tried to place the school in such a state that it might be placed amongst the Class A schools. The heating system, the water-works have been completed more than a year ago, and the school has a first class electric light apparatus. The basement is nearly completed according to the requirements of the Dept., and I hope that you will agree with me, that such endeavors deserve to be acknowledged by granting to this school the full grant allowed to all schools in class A. As soon as the hay crop has been saved, work will be resumed on the basement and everything will be completed in a short time. Of course the school had to run into debt for all these improvements, but outside of this, the main reason why I earnestly beg of you to grant NOW the full amount accorded to class A schools, is that the wheat crop on which the school relied for part of their support, has been completely destroyed by frost. This is a heavy loss and makes it urgent that the Department should not delay the grant I ask for, grant which is due, since we can say that we have virtually fulfilled all the conditions required by the Department.

Grardin, Provincial of Alberta, in reference to the re-classification of the Saddle Lake Indian Boarding School. He is apparently of the opinion that the improvements required and necessary for an A. Class school are now complete. Before giving consideration to any application for re-classification, as you have previously reported on the condition of the building and on the changes made within the past few years, and are fully cognizant of the requirements for an A. Class building, it has been decided to request you to make an inspection of the building at an early date and report the conditions fully to the Department, that the information may be available when the matter is being considered.\n\nA rough sketch plan of the building throughout should accompany the report with the dimensions of the several rooms and heights of ceilings including basement and the height of basement above ground level. The basement plans should show the divisions or rooms therein with the uses and the manner and effectiveness of the lighting.\n\nThe report should also cover fully any matter in connection with the buildings and surroundings which will assist the Department when this matter is under consideration.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ. A. Markle, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRed Deer, Alta., Deputy Superintendent General\nSeptember 6th, 1916.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of the 29th ultimo in reference to improvements and the re-classification of the Saddle Lake Boarding School, and in reply to say that I sincerely sympathize with you in the destruction of your wheat crop, which is indeed a serious loss to the school in these times of high prices.\n\nRespecting the classification of the Saddle Lake School, as you are of the opinion that the building is now in such condition as would entitle it to be placed in the A. Class, I am requesting Inspector Markle to visit the School and report fully, so that this information will be available when the matter is given consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. H. Grandin,\nProvincial Oblate Fathers,\n10155-107th Street,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nSir,\n\nAnswering your letter of September 6th, I have the honour to state that the improvements to the Blue Quill's boarding school, with a view of getting it placed in the \"A\" class of Indian educational institutions, are still incomplete. Work, however, with this end in view, is now in progress and I was assured that it would be about completed during the present school quarter.\n\nI have made up a pencil sketch, and shall enclose it herewith, showing the dimensions of main building and annexes thereto, as you requested me to do.\n\nThe ground on which the main building is located is not as high as it should be and the mistake that was made at the outset, when starting to remodel it, about 2 years ago, was not to have raised it about 2' and in that way partially, at least, overcome the flatness of land. The steam heating plant and the sewerage were installed about 2 years ago and it would be more expensive and difficult to raise the main building and the annexes at this late date. The 1st floor is about 2' above the grade. If it had been 4' above the grade the basement could be better fitted.\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Sup't. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nand better facilities provided for the drainage to the cess pit, etc.\n\nYou will notice on the sketch that an underground root cellar has been provided in the corner where the main building and the annex join. The roof of this cellar is about 2' high at the ridge of the roof. I fear water falling on this roof is liable to cause annoyance.\n\nNo hospital building has yet been provided. I was informed that a balloon frame building had been purchased and that the purpose was to remove it to within the school grounds and fit it up for a hospital. The outside dimensions of this building are only 16'5\"x 12'8\" and the studs 12'. First floor to ceiling: 8'2\", 2nd. floor to ceiling: 3'1\". The walls from the 2nd floor to top of the plates only: 2' 1\". It goes without saying that a hospital of such dimensions is likely to be too small for two sexes, etc., I so informed to Sisters.\n\nThe size of the boys dormitory seems small for 20 boys. The various floors of the institution, with the exception of the boys dormitory, meets the requirements of an \"A\" class building reasonably well. I would prefer, of course, plastered walls and ceilings to wood covered.\n\nThe Superior was informed that the Ermineskin's school was given the additional grant while the final work of re-construction was under way. For this reason the authorities of this institution hope that you will allow $135.00 per capita for the current quarter.\n\nI noticed that the kitchen range was in bad order and I was told that repairs for it could not be secured.\n\nThe Delco Lighting System, cost $800.00, and is satisfactory.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInsp.\nReverend Sister Superior\n\nRev. Sister:\n\nI have just received an answer to my letter, for which I asked, that your school be on the letter \"A\" that is, for you to receive the full grant ($35) for each child. Mr. Scott replied that he would notify Mr. Markle to inspect the school and give a report on the work that was done. I advise you to continue the work, so as the Inspector can see, and then notify the Department that your desire is to finish the work as quickly as possible. Therefore, they will see that\nI did not deceive them, in telling, that your idea is to finish the basement as promptly as you can.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nFr. Grandin.\nOttawa, November 12th, 1915.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Scott,-\n\nOn September 6th last the Department requested Inspector Markle to make an examination of the Blue Quill Boarding School, and to prepare sketches showing the exact condition of the building at this time with a view of re-classifying the school.\n\nFrom the Inspector's report and drawings and information on file, it would appear that as soon as the concrete basement walls and floors have been completed, that the school is entitled to the \"A\" classification, the building having a system of electric lighting, is steam heated, provided with sanitary baths, closets and basements and the accommodation necessary.\n\nThe dormitory accommodation is, boy's 19, girl's 23, equal to 42 pupils and as the floor space is ample, one or two additional may be allowed in excess, thus providing for the 45 pupils for which the grant is authorized.\n\nHospital accommodation is scarcely in accordance with the requirements, but the providing of this within a reasonable time might be made a condition for the re-classification of the school.\n\nArchitect.\nNovember 19, 1918.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn regard to previous correspondence in reference to placing the Blue Quills Boarding School in Class \"A,\" I beg to say that, as soon as the concrete basement walls and floors have been completed, the school will be entitled to rank in Class \"A.\"\n\nThe hospital accommodation is scarcely in accordance with the requirements, however, and the re-classification of the school can only be made upon condition that satisfactory hospital accommodation is provided within a reasonable time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

II6859/I Nov. 19th,\nI beg to say that work on the basement of the Blue Quill's School\nwas delayed because the workmen could not get the cement from\nVegreville, this town having been quarantined. Now that the ban is\nremoved the work will be completed in 9 or 10 days.\nThe hospital accommodation will be ample as the present laundry\nshall be, or rather is fitted for that purpose. There will be one\nlarge room for the boys, and one for the girls. The building is\n40 by 30.\n\nCould not the Dept. purchase for this school a stronger engine\nthat the one in use at present? If no formal promise to that effect\nhas been made, I believe that the school management have been placed under\nthe impression that on the completion of the work, such a\npurchase might be done by the Dept.\n\nHoping that there will be no delay in the re-classification of the\nschool, I remain,\n\nSir,\n\nyours respectfully\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPT.

A plan of this showing the proposed divisions with doors, windows, ceiling heights and sanitary fittings, drains, etc., should be sent to the Department together with a certificate stating that the concrete and other work required and necessary to enable the School to qualify for \"A\" Class has been completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

I don't know of any other school having done so much for the well being of the pupils, and these improvements have been made under conditions so adverse, so difficult, that the Department ought to have helped them to the best of their ability.

Scott Deputy Superintendent general\nof Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI take the liberty to inclose a copy of my answer to the Secretary of the Dept. re the Blue-Quill's indian Boarding School. I hope I may be mistaken in attributing to this gentleman some ill-will against our school, but I confess that I cannot see any other explanation for the unheard off delays in granting to that school the full grant to which it is entitled. The grant was given to the Hobbema, Delmas, indian schools on my word that the required improvements would be completed to the satisfaction of the Department, and as far as I know, my promised was fulfilled to the letter. Why do you treat the Blue Quill's school differently from the others? Is it because we had to incur expenses four times larger in this out of the way place, than in other schools near the railroads?\n\nI trust, dear Sir, that you will kindly give your attention to this matter, and I remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nJanuary 29th, 1919.\n\nDear Father Grandin -\n\nI have your communication of the 21st inst., enclosing copy of your letter of the same date, addressed to the Secretary of the Department. At the outset I wish to correct the impression that you have with regard to the attitude of the Secretary of the Department towards your school. I wish to assure you that Mr. McLean is personally much interested in our educational work, and would not wish to do anything that would hinder it in any respect.\n\nI notice in looking over the correspondence that certain assurances were required in order that the school might definitely be ranked in Class A. The first was that the concrete basement, walls and floors had been completed; and the other was that plans for the proposed isolation hospital for which the old laundry was to be fitted up, were satisfactory.\n\nAlthough the cement work, above referred to, was supposed to have been completed about the end of the last month, you do not mention in your letter whether it is actually so or not.\n\nHowever, taking everything into consideration it has been decided to grade the school in Class A, the increased per capita grant to commence from the first of the current month.\n\nWe shall be glad to have the information above referred to at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. H. Grandin,\nProvincial Oblate Fathers,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nEdmonton, December 18th, 1919\n\nD. Scott Deputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nA very serious epidemic of typhoid fever has broken out in the Blue Quill's Indian Boarding school, and on the reserve. Two of the nuns have died, one is very seriously sick, five of the children have died in the school, and I do not know how many Indians have died on the reserve. I believe the worst is over, and I ask you to allow us to close the school for a month or six weeks. The sisters who are all worn out need that rest, and it will take some time to properly disinfect the school thoroughly. Of course I expect the grant to be paid during that time, as the sisters could not well stand all the expenses incurred during the epidemic, and those required for the new painting and white-washing of the whole school.\n\nPlease wire me your answer.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n10184 107th Street\nDecember 23, 1919.\n\nDear Father Grandin,\n\nI was very sorry to receive this morning your letter of the 18th instant, and to learn of the fatalities at the Blue Quill's boarding school. I had already received advice of the outbreak on the reserve.\n\nI am very pleased, indeed, to grant the request of the Sisters to close the school for a month or six weeks, to give them an opportunity to clean the building, and obtain the necessary rest. The grant, of course, will be paid during the time the school is closed, and I would ask the Principal to be good enough to advise me of the dates of both the closing and reopening of the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

Grandin, O.M.I., Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nOblate Fathers,\nProvincial House,\n10168 - 107th Street,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nHonorable Sir:\n\nI beg to state that at the present time, the Indians seem very well disposed, and wish to place their children in our Boarding School; and if the Department will deem to give a Grant for fifty-five children we can very readily accommodate them. We have presently fifty in the house.\n\nAsking you to intercede in behalf of the Indians and our School, and hoping a favorable reply,\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nR. L. Dauphine\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Seal]\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., Jan. 21st, 1921\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nInspector Murison, who has recently returned from the Saddle Lake Agency, informed me that within the last two weeks some seventeen children have been admitted to the Blue Quills Boarding School on the Saddle Lake Agency. This school, for a number of years, has been running with about forty-five children, but of late something has happened which made the Indians feel they should send their children to school, and this additional seventeen were brought in all at once. The Grant for this school at the present time is for forty-five children. The Sisters in charge of course cannot begin to carry on the work and feed the additional number of children that have recently been admitted, although they have the accommodation I am told.\n\nI would be glad if you could see your way clear to make provision for the additional number of children who have been admitted to this school. These children have come from the Beaver Lake band, which is some hundred miles North of Saddle Lake Agency. The reports I have, are that they are a fine healthy lot of children. I am informed that this Institution is doing good work, and I think, if it is at all possible, we should do what we can to assist them in carrying the work through; especially when it is so hard to make ends meet owing to the high cost of living. They cannot afford to accommodate and look after these children unless they get a Grant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(W.M. Graham)\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Commissioner Graham requests that provision be made for an additional number of pupils at the Blue Quills Boarding School. He states that Inspector Murison, who recently returned from the Saddle Lake Agency, informed him that seventeen children have been admitted from the Beaver Lake Band, which is some hundred of miles north of Saddle Lake Agency.\n\nThe grant at present allowed is for 45 pupils at $145.00 per capita, the school being graded as Class \"A\" since January 1st, 1919. During the year 1918 extensive repairs were made to the school building. Excavations were made under the main building and a concrete basement put in. A steam heating plant and a sewage system were installed and an isolation hospital fitted up in the old laundry building and the walls and floors of the main building renovated. The floor space in the dormitories was not enlarged and in a memorandum hereunder from Mr. Ogilvie, the Architect, he stated the accommodation in the boys' dormitory to be suitable for 19 boys and in the girls for 23, equal to 42 pupils; and, as the floor space is ample, one or two additional pupils might be allowed in excess, thus providing for the 45 pupils for which the grant is authorized.\n\nThe Commissioner states that he has been told that the school has accommodation for the 17 extra pupils who have recently been admitted and that the Sisters in charge cannot begin to carry on the work and feed this additional number of children without receiving a grant therefor. The December quarter return has not yet been received, but there were 42 children on the roll at the end of September.\n\nIf it is intended to provide for the children recently brought into the school it would require a grant for at least an additional 15 pupils. It will, no doubt, be possible to provide for that number from the general appropriation for Indian Education and I shall be pleased to have your decision as to whether\nwhether the request of the Commissioner be complied with and an additional pupilage be provided. It would require a total of $2,175.00 to provide a yearly per capita grant for 15 extra pupils at the same rate as is allowed for the other 45 pupils already provided for. If the grant for the above extra number is approved, I would recommend that it date from January 1st, last.\n\nIt might be well, however, to first ascertain definitely the number of children the school can accommodate, taking into account the requirements as to air space in the dormitories and class-room. Mr. Ogilvie's report on the matter is turned out hereunder, and, as far as I am aware, no additions have since been added to the buildings.\n\n[Signature]\nMr. Duncan Scott,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nMy Dear Mr. Scott,\n\nI would also recommend that Blue Quill School at Saddle Lake be raised in its classification from 45 to 60. I understand that this is the desire of the inspector.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHenry J. O'Leary,\nArchbishop of Edmonton.\n\nJan. 21st, 1921.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Sutherland -\n\nI note that we are receiving a good many applications for increasing the pupilage at our residential schools. This would entail increased expenditure and I do not think it advisable at the present juncture to increase our obligations to pay the grant without obtaining funds from Parliament in the usual way.\n\nIf it is possible for you to give me a list of these applications I wish you would kindly do so, and add to it from time to time and when considering the supplementary estimates we might endeavour to obtain an increased appropriation. I do not think we should allow the schools to take in these pupils and put a strain upon our appropriation which it was not designed to bear. If the pupils are taken in without proper authority the management of the schools will have to take the financial responsibility.\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\nJanuary 27, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 21st instant, in which you request that an additional grant be provided for the seventeen children who have recently been admitted to the Blue Quills Boarding School from the Beaver Lake Band, I beg to say that I do not think it advisable at the present juncture to increase our obligations without obtaining funds from Parliament for the purpose in the usual way. Provision for an increase of fifteen in the pupilage of this school is being noted for the Supplementary Estimates and, if approved by Parliament, this increased number will then be allowed. I do not think that we should allow the schools to take in pupils in excess of the number authorized and put a strain upon our appropriation which it was not designed to bear.\n\nBefore this excess number of children was taken into the school applications should have been forwarded and their admission approved. Until funds are provided for their maintenance the management of the school will have to take the financial responsibility.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will inform the Principal of the Blue Quills School accordingly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy-Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nExtract from Mr. Inspector Murison's report on the Saddle Lake Agency, Regina, Sask., December 24, 1920.\n\nBLUE JAYLING BOARDING SCHOOL\n\nThe main building is a frame three story structure with a full sized basement. It is steam heated and has a Delco lighting plant installed which was temporarily out of use at the time of my visit owing to the batteries being burned out. The basement has a high ceiling and cement floor and is equipped as a wash room. Water is pumped into a storage tank and from there is piped through the building for fire protection and all other requirements. Outside stairways from each floor are provided as fire escapes.\n\nThere are two dormitories for the girls and one for the boys. Each bed is provided with a comfortable mattress. There is also an infirmary for the isolation of the sick. There are two classrooms and the usual accommodation found in a school of this class. Everything was scrupulously clean. The pupils had a clean and health appearance.\n\nThe school provides accommodation for 45 pupils and a staff of 10. Their stables were burned down a year ago and have been replaced at a cost of $4,000.00 by a large barn 36' x 90' with a large loft for storing feed. This building adds to the appearance of the place. The buildings and grounds are neatly fenced in and present a well kept appearance.\n\nThere is only sufficient land in connection with the school to permit them to crop 15 acres. The sisters, however, this season rented 50 acres from the Indians and seeded 65 acres from which they threshed 1500 bushels of oats. Their garden yielded 500 bushels of potatoes and sufficient vegetables for the use of the school.\n\nTheir live stock consists of 48 cattle, 20 pigs and 75 poultry. They milk 10 cows in summer and 4 during the winter months. The boys assist with the farm work. The girls are taught butter making, breadmaking, knitting and mending clothes. I saw some very fine knitting and needle work done by the pupils of this school.\n\nThere are 44 pupils enrolled, 16 boys and 28 girls. Their class standing is as follows:\n\n| Standard | 1 | 19 |\n|----------|---|----|\n|          | 11| 7  |\n|          | 111| 7  |\n|          | 1V| 10 |\n|          | V | 1  |\n\nSister Dorothy is a capable teacher and I found the pupils making progress with their classroom work. The Sister Superior is a capable manager and the comfort and health of the pupils is well looked after. She states that it is very difficult to finance the school owing to the present high cost of everything in the way of supplies.\nOttawa, February 1, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nA request has been received for an increased pupilage at the Blue Quills Boarding School; the number for which a grant is provided at present is 45 pupils. The Department is informed that seventeen extra pupils have recently been admitted from the Beaver Lake Band and the increased pupilage asked for is to provide a grant for these extra children.\n\nDuring the year 1918 extensive repairs were made to the school building and at that time the full number for which the school could provide accommodation, taking into account the requirements as to air space in the dormitories and class-rooms, was 45 pupils.\n\nBefore the Department could come to a decision regarding increasing the present number it will be necessary to ascertain the size of the various dormitories and class-rooms. I have, therefore, to request that you will be good enough, at your early convenience, to visit this school and measure up the boys' and girls' dormitories and the class-rooms and state the dimensions of the same, including the height from floor to ceiling, and you should inform the Department fully as to the dimensions of each of the above rooms.\n\nI may say that no applications or certificates of health have been received for the seventeen children who are stated to have been recently taken into the school from the Beaver Lake Band, and, until funds are provided, the management of the school will have to take the financial responsibility for their maintenance.\n\nI shall be pleased to receive the information asked for above regarding the size of the dormitories and class-rooms at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeo. S. Dodd, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nFebruary 19th, 1921\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the last instant No. 118-1-1, I have the honour to inform you that I visited the Blue Quill's Boarding School and measured the class rooms and dormitories. The following are the measurements:\n\nClass room No. 1; 29' 6\" x 27' 6\". Ceiling 8' 6\"\n\nClass room No. 2; 29' 6\" x 24' \" 8' 6\"\n\nGirl's dormitories; No. 1; 29' 6\" x 30' \" 9' 6\" hip roof.\n\nNo. 2; 29' 6\" x 21' 6\" \" 8' \"\n\nBoys' \" 29' 6\" x 36' \" 10' 3\" \"\n\nSewing room; 29' 6\" x 25' Ceiling 9'\n\nIf the grant for increased pupilage is allowed by the Department, the principal will convert class room No. 2 into a dormitory and the sewing room into a class room.\n\nI may say that there has not been any extension work done on the school since 1918.\n\nAt my inspection, the air was fresh in the rooms. It was apparently well ventilated from the windows. In the dormitories, there is a 6\"x8\" ventilator through the ceiling to the roof.\n\nOtherwise, there is no system of ventilation.\n\nWith reference to the 17 additional pupils from Beaver Lake, 15 of these have had medical examination and have been in residence since January 12th. Two others\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nothers have been admitted in the past week.\n\nI beg to suggest that as the pupils at the Blue Quill's Boarding School are making good progress and that their discipline is good, the Department might allow the increased pupilage on the distinct understanding that additional room is provided within a reasonable length of time, time to be fixed by the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Indian Agent.\nSeptember 30th, 1921.\n\nDear Father Guy,\n\nRelative to our conversation today regarding a grant for an increased pupilage at the Blue Quills Boarding School, I beg to say that before full consideration can be given to this request it will be necessary to be assured that there is ample accommodation in the class-rooms and dormitories for the extra number of pupils.\n\nI understand that it would be possible to make alterations in the building in order to convert one of the class-rooms into a dormitory and the sewing-room into a class-room.\n\nOur Agent reports that 17 additional pupils in excess of the number for which a per capita grant is allowed have been in residence since the 12th of January, last. This increased enrollment, it is hoped, is not detrimental to the health of the regular grant earning pupils. I do not think the Principal was justified in accepting these extra pupils until the necessary alterations had been made to provide for them.\n\nWhen full assurance is received that there is ample accommodation as regards air space in the class-rooms and dormitories the question of providing for 15 extra pupils will then receive consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\n\nRev. Father J. Guy, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa.\nNovember 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to respectfully call your attention to the marginally noted person, and report her condition.\n\nWhile examining the pupils of Sacred Heart Boarding School (Blue Quill) at Saddle Lake, I found the marginally noted person to be pregnant. The girl confessed her condition to me personally, telling me who the father of the child was.\n\nThe case was brought to the attention of the Agent and the priest. The latter assured the Agent and self as well as the Sisters that he would do all in his power to have the girl married at once, as she is under age. Will only be 13 years of age January 1922.\n\nThe Sisters expressed a wish that they would be pleased were the pupils obliged to remain at the school during all vacations and all the time till their educations are completed at the age of 16 years of age. This they consider would tend to lessen the evil among the children.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. P. Johnston, R. N.\nTravelling Nurse.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward, herewith, copy of a report received from Miss E. P. Johnston in regard to Mary Rose a pupil at the Sacred Heart Boarding School, Saddle Lake, who upon examination by the Nurse was found to be pregnant. The girl made a confession, and declared who was the father of the child, and it seems to me that this is a case which should be prosecuted under section 301 of the Criminal Code. I shall be glad to receive your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 10, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 6th instant, concerning Mary Rose, a pupil at the Blue Quills Boarding School, Saddle Lake, and a copy of report from the Travelling Nurse.\n\nBefore giving instructions to prosecute, under Section 301 of the Criminal Code, the Department would be grateful for further information. It appears that a local priest is doing all in his power to have the girl married at once. I would like to know if the intention is to marry Mary Rose to the man responsible for her condition. If he is young and yet able to provide a home, this might prove a solution to the problem. On the other hand, if the man in the case is of advanced years, or married, and it is not the intention to have him selected as the bridegroom, the Department might do well to institute a procedure under the Section referred to.\n\nYou will please make an effort to discover the identity of the responsible man, and give us your recommendation as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M.

Johnston,\nTravelling Nurse.\nSir:\n\nI have to draw your attention to a matter arising out of the report of Travelling Nurse E. P. Johnston. During the month of November, when she visited the Blue Quills Boarding School at the Saddle Lake agency, she noticed that no fire drill was practised. In view of the structure of the building, I feel that a proper fire drill should be initiated immediately.\n\nMiss Johnston also states that she found the girls of the school to be much cleaner than the boys. You might draw the attention of the Principal to this matter as well as the need of a fire drill, in as kindly a way as possible. The rest of the Nurse's report on the Blue Quills Boarding School was quite favourable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nGeo. B.

I have to confirm my telegram of this date, as follows:\n\n\"Department does not provide for defense of Indians except when charged with murder. Writing.\"\n\nI have referred to official communication of December 10th, last, concerning this matter, and I notice that, before legal proceedings were initiated by the Department, more information was requested. I might add that to date no information has been received from you.\n\nThe Department's policy, concerning the defense of Indians charged under the Criminal Code, is that no action will be taken unless the defendant is in danger of the death penalty. While Section 299 of the Criminal Code referring to rape provides for the death penalty, yet such punishment is never imposed in Canadian courts of today. Further, I might add, for your information, that when the defendant in a murder charge is able to bear the expense, the Department does not interfere.\n\nThe Department will be pleased to learn who laid the information in connection with this case at Saddle Lake, and we would like to be informed as to the outcome of the trial.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

On enquiry, Mary Rose told me that William John wanted to marry her, but that her father objected. Later, I sent for William John, and he stated that at treaty time in July last, he wanted to marry Mary Rose, but now, owing to her present condition, he refused, as he declared that he had had nothing to do with her.\n\nI explained to him the seriousness of the charge under section 301 of the Criminal Code, and told him of the penalty if he was convicted. He still maintained his innocence, and elected to stand trial rather than marry her.\n\nAccordingly on December 10th, he was arraigned before Mr. D. McEachern, J. P., of Ashmont, and the evidence of Mary Rose was deemed sufficient by the Justice of the Peace to commit him for trial at the next court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nWilliam John was taken into custody and he will probably be brought up for trial at the next sitting of the District Court, which I understand will be held at St. Paul during the early part of February.\n\nI had first thought of referring the matter to you, but lately considered that it would come directly under my administration.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeo.

Neither of the teachers are provided with Provincial certificates. The classes were examined by Inspector X. P. Criado in November. I therefore did not make an exhaustive examination.

The time seems to have come when the Sisters can no longer assume the responsibility of the School for reasons, some personal to them, some relating to the greater good of the Indian work in the District.\n\nI made a special trip to Montreal to consult with the Very Reverend Mother General in the matter and she proved more than earnest for a change in the direction of the Institution. The following are some of the points brought in the discussion:\n\n1. - The present condition of the buildings which would necessitate a complete overhauling and in fact would warrant the construction of a new school;\n\n2. - The enormous expenses made by the Sisters for the last five years amounting to $21,000.00 over the per capita grant, the latter being entirely spent for the school. A debt of over $3000.00 is still left and proves a heavy burden for the Sisters;\n\n3. - The reluctance or rather the impossibility for the Sisters to keep boys over 12 or 13 years;\n\n4. - The awkward position of the Principal who though seemingly vested with responsibility before the Department is only a salaried official at\nJanuary 15th 1924\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nUpon my return from my Western trip, last September, I took up with you personally an important question relative to the Sisters of Blue Quills Indian Boarding School.\n\nThis school is under the direction of the Grey Nuns of Montreal and an Oblate Father is the nominal Principal.

The following are some of the points brought in the discussion:\n\n1o. - The present condition of the buildings which would necessitate a complete overhauling and in fact would warrant the construction of a new school;\n\n2o. - The enormous expenses made by the Sisters for the last five years amounting to $21,000.00 over the per capita grant, the latter being entirely spent for the school. A debt of over $8000.00 is still left and proves a heavy burden for the Sisters;\n\n3o. - The reluctance or rather the impossibility for the Sister to keep boys over 12 or 13 years;\n\n4o. - The awkward position of the Principal who though seemingly vested with responsibility before the Department is only a salaried official at\nSchool, with no responsibility nor authority whatever in the management of it.\n\nI have also fully discussed this matter by correspondence with Very Reverend Father Blanchin, C.S.S., Provincial of the Oblates and with his permission and that of Very Reverend Mother Dugas, Mother General of the Grey Nuns of Montreal, I take the liberty of stating the following:\n\n10. - It is of self-evidence that Blue Quills school must be rebuilt before long but at the proximity of a railway station;\n\nSo. - The present policy of discharging boys at 14 years old must be brought to an end on account of the moral difficulties and also on account of the impossibility for these boys to be trained in farming work.\n\nSo. - The school should be placed under the authority of the Oblate Fathers but the latter would not consider such a proposition unless:\n\na) the present debt is entirely wiped off;\nb) the Government agrees to keep the school in a fair state of repair;\nc) a promise is made by the Government to rebuild the school near a railway station in a very near future.\n\nRegarding the debt of $3000.00 above referred to, I would suggest that the Department assume it and even add to that amount a gratuity to the Sisters who have worked so many years without any salary and who also spent so much money on the building and land.\n\nI leave all the above facts, considerations and requests to your appreciation with the hope that a favourable decision will be reached. In such a case I would place before you the official propositions of Very Rev. Mother Dugas and Very Rev. Father Blanchin, C.S.S.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nJoseph [Signature]\nOttawa, March 21, 1934.\n\nDear Father Guy:\n\nI have your letter of January 15th, in which you recommend that the Oblate Fathers take over the responsibility for the Blue Quills Residential School and that the Department wipe off the school debt. I am sympathetic towards the needs of this institution and I read your letter with interest; but I regret to inform you that for the time being it will not be possible to assume added financial responsibilities.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Principal of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School is on sick leave and that Rev. Father V. Cabillon, O.M.I., is acting principal. The Department is pleased to have this advice from you and I should be grateful if you would inform me when Father Dauphin returns to duty.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Jos. Guy, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa, Ont.\nTo the Honorable R. C. Scott,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nI have the honor hereby to apply to the Indian Department regarding the urgent necessity of having for this school some larger and modern buildings. Out of many grounds supporting my humble request, I beg to state the following:\n\n1st. According to our last quarter report ending June 30th, there are 17 pupils 12 years old, which number if taken as an average every year, would make a total of 200 pupils between 6 and 18 years of age. (viz. 17 x 12 = 204).\n\n2nd. As there are in said report, only 13 pupils under 10 years old, this means that though there are on this Reserve many other young children of school age, we do not recruit them, our school since a few years being crowded to its full capacity.\n\n3rd. On our reports you may notice, that in the past we did not keep the boys in school after being 12 years old. Now, realizing that your plan of keeping the boys in school till 18 years old in order that they may be trained in practical work, as it is done in Duck Lake School, is very much desirable, for the future welfare of our Indians, we intend to keep them also till that age. Hence the urgent necessity of having a large and modern school connected with a well equipped and extensive farm.\n\n4th. As your refusal to put an addition to our actual building, considered unworthy to be enlarged, gives us an opportunity to make up our mind regarding the advisability of changing its site. We consider that a school site 10 miles distant from a railway station is very inconvenient and very expensive; and therefore, after having inspected many possible locations, I found that the best suitable site would be within about one mile east of St. Paul de Retin Station, which is only 2 miles east of the Eastern boundary of this Reserve. Should this site be accepted, our school being not far from this Reserve will become more central for two other ones, that is, Long Lake and Cold Lake Reserves, the latter is entirely Catholic, and up to the\npresent time no child attends any Boarding School. So we may expect to get very pupils from there.\n\nTherefore I hope that if you take this plan into consideration, we will be granted in a near future, a modern school for about 200 pupils.\n\nHoping to receive a favorable reply,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nYour humble Servant,\n\nV.

I regret that I cannot give you a hopeful answer, because of the many pressing claims on the Appropriation for Indian Education. The Department is trying to replace the worn out and inadequate buildings as rapidly as possible, but no promise can be made at the present time.\n\nThere has been some correspondence relative to adding small buildings to the present equipment; but such an arrangement is considered unwise, especially when a new main building is not yet in sight.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. V. Gabillon, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Indian Res.

There are many pressing claims upon the Appropriation for Indian Education and I am not hopeful that funds will be provided for the construction of an Indian residential school at Cold Lake in the near future. The replacement and enlarging of the present building at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School has already been urged by Your Grace and others, and, when future estimates are being prepared, the claims of this reserve will not be overlooked.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nMost Rev. H. J. O'Leary, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Edmonton,\n8317 - 105th St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa, October 28, 1925.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to a portion of your 407-7 B of the 16th instant, in which you recommend that a residential school be erected at St. Paul de Metis. I note that such a school would not only replace the worn out buildings at the Blue Quills Institution, but would provide residential facilities for the children of the Cold Lake and Keeheewins Reserves. A note has been made for future Estimates in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nI beg to forward herewith the Estimates for the Saddle Lake Agency.\n\nThere is a matter which requires a special report from me. I refer to the school requirements for the Indians of this Agency and part of the Onion Lake Agency, viz.: Keeweenaw Reserve. In my opinion, the question of building a school on the Saddle Lake Agency should not be considered. The school should be built at St. Paul de Metis, and should be sufficiently large to accommodate not only the children of the Saddle Lake Reserve, but of Cold Lake and Keecheewins reserves as well. I believe that a school of the same capacity as that which we have built for the Roman Catholic Church on the Blood Reserve would meet the requirements.\n\nI understand that the church authorities are anxious to have a school built at Cold Lake as well as at Saddle Lake. This would be a mistake, as a school centrally located would take care of the requirements of Saddle Lake and a great part of the Onion Lake Agency. Of course, if this scheme is carried out, and I think it should be, the Department should insist on closing up the day schools. In my opinion, the operating of these schools is only a useless waste of money, for which we are getting no value.\n\nI believe that the establishing of a school at St. Paul de Metis will meet with the approval of the Archbishop of Edmonton, and the Oblate Order.\n\n(Sgd.) W. M. Graham.\nOffice of\nThe Minister of the Interior.\n\nOttawa Ontario,\nNovember 28, 1925.\n\nDear Archbishop O'Leary,\n\nIn going over the programme for the construction of Indian schools for next year, I find your application for consideration for Hobbema and Saddle Lake.\n\nI find myself in the unfortunate position, however, of having previously promised the purchase and construction of a sufficient number of schools to more than use up the funds to be voted for 1926-27. I regret this very much as I have already promised consideration of your request.\n\nIt also appears that examinations have not yet been made of the Hobbema building or of conditions at Saddle Lake; this inspectional work I have ordered to be done at once and complete reports submitted, and there is just the possibility that we may be able to remove the pressure at Hobbema, but it would be impossible to undertake the construction of a new school at Saddle Lake this year.\n\nRest assured, however, that I shall do my very best under the circumstances.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nThe Most Reverend (sgd.) Charles Stewart.\nH. J. O'Leary, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Edmonton,\nEDMONTON.\nDec. 21, 1925.\n\nYou will remember, Archbishop O'Loughlin of Edmonton, asked \"that a suitable Indian school be erected by the Government in the Saddle Lake district to replace present one.\"\n\nAlso that \"the Modern School be purchased along the lines that other schools have recently been purchased in Manitoba and Saskatchewan\".\n\nIn connection with the above I have replied to the Archbishop as per the circular of November 25th.\n\nThe Archbishop now requests that \"the conditions in Cold Lake where a school hospital is an imperative necessity also be studied\", and I have promised him that this would be done.\n\nChas. Stewart\nSuperintendent General of I.A.\nJanuary 12, 1926.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General has favoured me with a copy of the letter he wrote Your Grace on November 28th with reference to the provision of boarding school buildings in your archdiocese.\n\nI am today instructing our chief officer at Regina to have an examination and valuation made of the property at Hobbsma known as the Ermineskin's Boarding School. We have during the past few years purchased institutions from the Oblate Order, but these buildings have been well adapted to the needs of such institutions as now recognized, and a reasonable amount has been paid for them, even less than their appraised value, and Parliament has provided the money for the purchase. The examination and valuation which I am ordering now is merely a preliminary step, and the question will be very carefully and sympathetically considered.\n\nWith reference to the establishment of a boarding school at Saddle Lake, Mr. Graham has already made recommendation that a school for this district should be established at or in the vicinity of St. Paul de Metis; an institution at this point would, he thinks, serve the Roman Catholic Indians of Cold Lake, Saddle Lake and Kesheewin reserves. I should be grateful for an expression of Your Grace's opinion in this matter. In our experience it is not advisable to establish schools for small pupilage. It is more economical and more effective from an educational point of view to provide for a pupilage of at least one hundred.\n\nI wish to assure Your Grace that it is the Minister's wish to give careful attention to the needs of your archdiocese.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nThe Most Reverend H.J.O'Leary, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Edmonton,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nhave accommodation for at least 120 pupils.\n\nAs to the site, some suggest St. Paul des M\u00e9tis, others Vilna.

I am very grateful to you for having the appraisal of the Indian School at # Hobema made. I think that you will find it well equipped and adapted for the purpose of an Indian School.\n\nWith reference to the establishment of a boarding school at Saddle Lake. This school has been necessary for a long time. The present buildings are no longer sufficient and as they are old nobody would care to add to their accommodation. The school at Saddle Lake, Father Gabillon tells me should be for 150 pupils as it draws from the reserves of Saddle Lake, Good Fish Lake, Keeheewin, and Frog Lake. At the present time it also draws from Cold Lake where there is a large number of Montagnais. This place however being so far away should have something done for it, for instance a small boarding school hospital. In any case the Saddle Lake school should\nhave accommodation for at least 120 pupils.\n\nAs to the site, some suggest St. Paul des M\u00e9tis, others Vilna. It is a matter for examination. Personally I would prefer Vilna or Ashmont nearer to Edmonton. Ashmont might also prove a good station as I understand it is to be made later a junction of a line to go to Bonnyville, passing near two of the reserves, Keecheewin and Cold Lake.\n\nI therefore strongly endorse the building of this boarding School and urge that it be undertaken as soon as possible.\n\nWith sentiments of esteem and best wishes,\n\nI am,\n\nSincerely yours\n\n[Signature]\nArchbishop of Edmonton.\nSir,\u2014 \n\nI beg to inform you that the school authorities at the Blue Quill's Residential School have today made the request that they be granted permission to extend the annual Summer holidays from July 5th to August 25th instead of July 5th to August 18th as at first arranged. The reason given is that as there has been a good deal of sickness on the reserves during the month of July, and as several cases of measles were reported, some of the children would probably carry the disease to the school if taken in too soon and that an epidemic in the institution would probably follow. By extending the holiday period to the 25th August, they consider that there would be less danger of contagion from those who may have been in contact with persons affected.\n\nIn view of the fact that parents or other relatives of a few of the children of this school have had measles, and in two or three cases, typhoid fever, I am of the opinion that it might be advisable to extend the holiday period to the date suggested. If this meets with the approval of the Department, I would be glad to have notice to that effect by wire in order that the parents may be notified in time as to change of date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOTTAWA, August 9, 1926.\n\nW. E. Gallion, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSadule Lake, Alta.\n\nReference your letter second. Blue Quills Residential School may have special leave of one week.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCHC. DEPT. I.A.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the remarks in my report for the month of December, concerning the matter of certain girls running away from school, I beg to submit the following:\n\nOn the 29th December, Rev. Father Gabillon, Principal of the Blue Quill's Residential school, advised me that three of the girls were absent and asked if I would look into the matter. I accordingly went to the school in the afternoon and on my arrival, was informed that the girls had just been brought in. They were Veronica Memmcock, age 17 years, Angela Houle, age 16 years and Celestine Brightsyte, age 15 years.\n\nOn making enquiries, I found that the girls had been out all night with several young Indians. A young man, Maxime Houle, had on the Sunday previous, asked the girls to arrange to run away on Tuesday evening. He had evidently arranged to have two other boys with him but from what I could gather there were from two to six boys out with the girls during the night. The following names of Indian boys were given me by the girls,- Maxime Houle, Leo Gladu, Norrie Delver, Isaac Sampson, Johnnie Cryer and Morria Cardinal. From information given me at the school, it would appear that one or two of these boys have been the source of considerable trouble at the institution on previous occasions.\n\nA suggestion was made that Veronica Memmcock, who apparently acted as leader of the trio, might be discharged at once and allowed to marry Norrie Delver with whom she was with. I advised strongly against adopting this procedure at the present time and suggested that the girl be kept in school for another two or three months at least. I was of the opinion that if Veronica was discharged immediately on account of her escapade, some of the older girls would be inclined to follow her example whenever they wished for an excuse to leave school. In any case, Norrie Delver is still under 16 years.\n\nI should be glad to have your instructions and advice in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nW. M. Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.,\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nREGINA, SASK., January 11th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose a copy of a report received from Mr. W.B. Gullion, with reference to the breaking away at night from the Blue Quill's Residential School, of three Indian girls, a reference to which he makes in his report for the month of December.\n\nI concur in the agent's opinion that the suggestion that the girls' ringleader, Veronica Memmick, should marry Norris Balvar, is not a proper solution of the difficulty and that if it were acted upon, it might form the basis of an excuse for other girls to follow her example. You will note also that the boy, Norris Balvar, is under 16 years of age.\n\nI am writing to the Agent informing him that I agree with the suggestion to keep this girl at school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 15, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 407-11B of the 11th instant, enclosing a report from the Indian Agent with reference to the misdemeanor of three girls, pupils of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.

Farrier,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRev. Father Gabillon, O.M.I., has requested me to place before you a demand for an increase in pupilage from sixty children to seventy-five.\n\nThe Reverend Father says it is impossible for him to refuse children in giving as a reason insufficient space, because the children would probably go to the Edmonton Protestant School as it has been the case with quite a number of our children. Of course the Blue Quills School is in a rather poor condition as you are aware, and it is our intention to ask for new quarters next year. Meanwhile the Reverend Father has appropriated one of the mission's buildings as a dormitory for twelve boys. This temporary arrangement can be kept until the construction of a new school.\n\nWould you kindly consider if anything can be done in this matter and help the Rev. Fr. Gabillon in his present plight.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJoseph [Last Name]\nOttawa, March 3, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, in which you submit the request of Rev. V. Gabillon, O.M.I., Principal of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, that the pupilage at that institution be increased from 60 to 75.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Principal has appropriated one of the mission's buildings as a temporary dormitory for 12 boys. Please inform the Department if these temporary arrangements are satisfactory and state whether you would recommend that the increase in the pupilage be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

The lower floor only is being used at the present time. Extra seating accommodation in the class rooms can be arranged for without any inconvenience. On the date of my visit there were 39 boys and 27 girls in school and 3 girls were absent.\n\nIn view of the arrangements which have been made to take care of extra pupils, I would respectfully recommend that the request for increased pupilage be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, April 5th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, relative to the request for an increased pupilage at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of your report as to the arrangements that have been made to provide for an extra number of pupils, the Department will allow a grant for five extra pupils from the 1st instant. We will also allow an increase in the per capita grant to the amount of $5 from the same date. This will provide a grant for a total of sixty-five pupils at $170 per capita from the date mentioned. This is the total pupilage and per capita grant which we can provide for this school, and I have to request that you will inform the Principal accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Gulliford, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake,\nAlta.\nInspector Murison's Report on School, Saddle Lake Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to report that I visited the Blue Quill Residential School on March 17th last, and made a general inspection of that institution. There are 69 pupils enrolled; 3 were absent on account of sickness on the date of my visit. There are two class rooms provided. The children were assembled and I noted their appearance and made a brief examination. I noted an improvement in the pronunciation of English. There has been a change in the teaching staff since my last visit a year ago. The pupils presented a clean and healthy appearance. There has been very little sickness among them during the past year. They were warmly dressed and their appearance is an indication that they are receiving ample nourishing food.\n\nThe dormitories I found well aired and quite ample for the present enrollment. Authority has been granted for the admission of an additional 10 pupils, and sleeping accommodation for that number of the larger boys is being provided in one of the outbuildings, with a Lay Brother in charge. I examined this new dormitory and would report that it is quite adequate in size to accommodate the extra pupilage authorized and quite suitable for the purpose.\n\nThe school building is kept in a scrupulously clean condition. This is an old building, but the interior\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nInspector Murison's report on school, Saddle Lake Agency.\n\nThe interior is kept in a very creditable manner. A Delco plant provides the lighting facilities. Their laundry machinery is operated with a separate gas engine. The exterior of the building is badly in need of a coat of paint.\n\nThey operate a farm at this school. The crop last year consisted of 100 acres of grain and they will seed 125 acres this year. Their last season's crop was a failure owing to dry weather and did not provide their flour requirements. They have 6 acres for roots and vegetables, the yield from which was poor last year.\n\nTheir stock consists of 70 head of cattle, 10 work horses, 2 colts and 45 hogs, and they have over 100 poultry. They milk from 15 to 20 cows, but at the time of my visit, they were only milking 2. This, however, would only be for a very short period. The stock and poultry produces their requirements for meat, butter and eggs. They derive real benefit from the produce of their farm and stock.\n\nThis school is under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. The Rev. V. Gabillion, O.M.I., is Principal. The Rev. Sister Courneyer of the Order of Grey Nuns, is the business manager. She is assisted by a staff of six Sisters, which includes a trained nurse, 2 teachers, a cook, laundress and seamstress, all of whom appear to be quite capable in their own departments. The girls are taught knitting and sewing, and practically all the clothing of the pupils is made by the girls under the supervision of a sister. They had quite a lot of work under way at the time of my visit and the quality of the work looked excellent to me and reflects credit on their teacher.\nInspector Murison's report on school, Saddle Lake Agency.\n\non their teacher.

Father LeGoff, and I have to request that you will give him any assistance you can in his work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Gullion, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nSir:-\n\nOn the 4th September I received a telegram from Mr. W. H. Gullion, Indian Agent at Saddle Lake, stating that three boys, pupils at the Blue Quill's Boarding School, had attempted to burn down the school and suggesting their transfer to the St. Albert School. I wired stating that, if they would be accepted at the latter institution, the transfer might be arranged. I have now received a letter from the Agent stating that he communicated with the authorities at St. Albert and was told that they did not consider it advisable to take these boys. Later when in Edmonton on business, he visited the school and discussed the matter and was informed that, after careful consideration in view of the boys' records, they did not feel inclined to admit them.\n\nThe names of the three boys are Patrice Castor Cardinal, aged 11, Marcisse Houle, aged 11, and Charlie Gladu, aged 13. They admitted that they planned to burn the school, and apparently had intended starting the fire in the basement, but, owing to the peculiar behaviour during the afternoon, the door to the basement was locked and they had no opportunity to go down. The fire was actually started in a small compartment on the second floor underneath the stairway leading from the boys' dormitory. Papers had been used to start the fire, and it might have had a disastrous result, but for the prompt action of the sisters when the attempt had been discovered. I shall be glad if the department will suggest what action should now be taken to discipline these boys.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have your 407-113 of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the attempt of three pupils of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School to start a fire in the building. You ask if the Department would suggest disciplinary action. As you are, no doubt, aware, the securing of discipline is dependent upon the personal equation between child and teacher, supervisor or principal, and it is very difficult to arbitrarily fix punishments for certain offenses. If these boys were 11 to 13 years of age, then, I believe, they should have been given a good spanking as soon as they were caught. It is doubtful if corporal punishment, when removed from the time of the offense, is advisable. Perhaps the disciplining of these boys can be left for the school management. To request the transfer to another school of boys of these tender years suggests that the school principal is not a very strong disciplinarian.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 118-1-1 of the 14th instant, dealing with the question of disciplining the pupils of the Blue Quill's Indian school who started a fire in the building. In asking what action the Department would suggest to discipline these boys, the question of physical punishment was not implied, as I have no doubt that after they were caught they were chastised. The letter was written with a view to ascertain what the Department could suggest to remove these boys to another environment, an action which has been taken on many occasions before when the misbehaviour of a boy or boys at one school has been considered sufficiently serious to warrant his removal to another sphere of influence. The authorities at St. Albert were asked if they would take over the boys, and would have been glad to had it not been for the nature of the misdemeanor of which they were guilty.\n\nIf the Department, knowing the circumstances, is still of the opinion that these boys should remain at Blue Quills, I shall be glad to be advised so that I can then issue the necessary instructions to Mr. Gullion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 24, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 407-11B of the 19th instant, with reference to discipline at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. You may give instructions that the three boys in question remain at the institution, provided the local management is satisfied that they can be properly looked after.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nHonorable Duncan C. Scott  \nDeputy Superintendent General  \nIndian Affairs  \nOttawa.\n\nFebruary 25\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nHaving been appointed Provincial of the Oblates in the place of R.F. Beys, who has gone to Rome to fill an important position in the General Administration of our Order, it is my privilege to inform you today about the changes I intend to make in some of our Indian Residential Schools, viz.:\n\nBlue Quilta (Saddle Lake) Alberta  \nRev.

Angin O.M.I.\n\nI hope that the new principals at both the above named schools will cooperate with your Department and meet with every success in the work they have so much at heart.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nProvincial\nMarch 6, 1930.\n\nDear Father Langlois:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo, with reference to changes in the management of two of our Indian Residential Schools. I am pleased to approve of the appointment of the Rev. Joseph Anglin, O. M. I., as principal of the Blue Quills School and the appointment of Rev. D. Dubois, O. M. I., as principal of the Thunderchild School. I am informing our local representatives.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nVery Rev. U. Langlois, O. M. I.,\nOblate Fathers' Provincial House,\n9916 - 110th St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa, March 6, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has approved of the appointment of Rev.

SCOTT,\n\nThe Minister has received an application from Mr. J. N. Trudel, of St. Paul, Alberta, with reference to his appointment as Farm Instructor for the Industrial School at that place.\n\nIs the appointment of such an official contemplated? If so, what salary is to be paid, and will the appointment come under the Civil Service Commission?\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOctober 29, 1930.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Buskard.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 27th instant, I beg to say that all appointments to the staffs of Indian residential schools are made by the church authorities who are responsible for the running expenses of the schools, which are conducted under a fixed per capita grant from this Department. Mr. Trudel should, therefore, apply to the Principal of the School.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(HG 10, Volume 6345)\n\nFile 751-1, part 1\nSaddle Lake - Blue Quills Residential. 1889 - 1930\n\nFile 751-2, part 1\nSaddle Lake - Blue Quills Residential - Quarterly Returns. 1943 - 1950\n\nFile 751-4, part 1\nSaddle Lake - Blue Quills Residential - Requisitions for Supplies. 1940 - 1952\n\nFile 751-5, part 1\nSaddle Lake - Blue Quills Boarding School - Building, Equipment & Accounts. 1896 - 1902\n\nFile 751-5, part 2\nSaddle Lake - Blue Quills Boarding School - Building, Equipment & Accounts. 1922 - 1930\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, posting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entering the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blue Quill's Red School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: L. B. Layton\n\nDated: September 30th, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nH. P. B. A.\n\nAuditor Agent\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blue Quill's Creek School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1943.\n\nPrincipal: L. G. Latouche\n\nDated March 31st 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated April 20th 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. This Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: September 30, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated: October 10, 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The term \"number of days in quarter\" means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, any payment shall be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blue Quills Res. School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: L. B. Lipton\n\nDated: June 30, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nH. C. B.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blue Quills Red School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, should any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blue Quill School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: September 30, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Stamp]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 31, 1945.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\n* Form No. I.A. 408\n* Req.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blue Quills School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1924.\n\nPrincipal: L. E. Latourelle\n\nDated: June 30, 1924\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Indian Lake, July 13, 1924\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average number of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blue Quills School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will provision be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blue Quills School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: L. B.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: June 30, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: July 1, 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, ruling it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blue Quills School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: L. G. Lagasse\n\nDated: September 30, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: October 17, 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 31, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated January 11, 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, piling it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blue Quills School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1947.\n\nActing Principal\n\nDated March 31, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at APR 1, 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings hereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blue Quills Ind. R. School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1947.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated February 23rd, 1948.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Saddle Lake this February 23rd, 1948.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils named on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of capital grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

K. Taylor,\nSuperintendent.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days recorded of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly grant allowed. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blue Quills Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30th, 1948.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nW. K. Taylor\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Saddle Lake this 26th day of July, 1948.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nR. 3444\n##

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, piling it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils included in the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blue Quillie Res. School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1948.\n\nDated Oct. 6th, 1948.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated Oct. 9th, 1948.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403 R. 3444\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Saddle Lake Agency**\n\n**School at Blue Quills Res.**\n\n**Report of the School at Ss.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blue Quills Res. School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1948.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated Dec. 31, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at SAGANAY LAKE AGENCY this DEC. 31, 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Saddle Lake Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Blue Quilla Res.

correctly made and entered at the foot of columns.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance during quarter\" by the rate of grant per pupil per day. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blue Quills Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31, 1949.\n\nI have carefully examined

will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 R. 3608\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY/GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the total number of days in quarter.\n\n9. The amount of capital grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the Average attendance of pupils during quarter by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blue Quills Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\nThe amount of capital grant due for quarter is determined by multiplying the \"Average attendance during quarter\" by the rate of the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blue Quills R.S.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blue Quills Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blue Quills Ind. & Res. School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Dec. 30, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nW.K.

Later, O.M.I., Blue Quills Residential School, St. Paul, Alta.\n\nWith reference to your requisition dated December 31st, it is noted that you request a quantity of raffia which would cost approximately $60.00. It is doubtful if we can secure raffia at the present time but, in any event, the quantity which you request appears to be very large. Before placing the order, I would appreciate your advising me if you feel sure that the quantities requested are absolutely necessary.\n\nThe other articles on the requisition considered necessary have been ordered. It is not possible at the present time to obtain erasers, pen nibs, pencil sharpeners, and many other articles.\n\nA number of books for supplementary reading purposes are being forwarded with the other supplies.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nBlue Quill's Ind.

The teachers have therefore requested a larger quantity, in order to use some of it at the end of this school year.\n\nHowever, as raffia is very hard to secure and as the cost is very high, we will be pleased to receive what you can secure.\n\nThanking you sincerely,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL.C.

I have long felt the need of such a journal. In fact, is not a school without a journal like a child deprived of his voice? The \"moccasin Telegram\" will be the voice of Blue Quills. It will be a means of communication with other schools; of sharing ideas and ideals. It will be another link added to the great chain of friendship which binds all the Indian Schools together as well as with those who show any interest in their welfare.\n\nIt is the pupils' work. This, I hope, will foster interest, ambition and co-operation among the children. It may also help them to become conscious of their stand in society which is considerably different from that of fifty years ago.\n\nI sincerely believe that great benefits can be derived from the publication of the school newspaper, therefore I wholeheartedly encourage this enterprise.\n\nTo the pupils, I wish: \"Success\" and to the journal...\"Long Life.\"\n\nMay God bless both children and readers........\n\nFather E.Bernet Rollande, O.M.I.\nThe Apostolic Delegate\n\nHow glad and anxious we were when we heard that we might have a chance to see the Apostolic Delegate. We had been looking forward to the consecration of His Excellency Bishop Maurice Baudoux.\n\nOn the day came! We were to go on the highway where the Delegate was to come. We got up early Saturday morning. After school, it did not take us long to get ready. Sometimes we used to go out for dinner. The whole house, sisters and children were on the road. We waited for the Delegate to arrive at the highway. There, we lined up two boys on the left and the girls on the right. We held our breath and the flags of very bright colors. We had to wait for quite a while. Then, the car came. We did not mind; we were only thinking of the Delegate. Many cars came behind him and went in a cloud of dust. But the one we wanted to see was not there. At last, the car stopped. The Delegate himself stepped out, followed by his wife. He walked between the two rows of children. About fifty-three cars followed. It was a lovely sight. Here they were all lined up. We were very happy. We were very happy, because we had seen the representative of the Pope in our country.\n\nFlorence Lange\nGrade VIII\n\nThe Bishop's Consecration\n\nWe did not see the consecration ceremony. All the sisters said mass to raise it. But many of the Sisters went and they told us about it. We were very happy to hear about it. The Bishop's consecration lasted very long but it was a nice ceremony. We are very glad because now we have a good Bishop who lives near us.\n\nOfficer Vigne\nGrade IV\n\nBenediction\n\nOn the day of the consecration of the Bishop, Father Vigne said that we would have the chance to attend the ceremony of the consecration in the church. Afterwards we had the opportunity to go to benediction. About fifteen of the big boys, seven consecrated boys, three consecrated wives, and eighteen big girls accompanied by Sister Irene and Miss Florence Lange went with me dressed by \"little and \"other Principal.\"\n\nWhen we reached the church, it was already eleven o'clock. We were late. We lined up and walked in. Father Principal was leading the procession. We all looked at the Bishop's throne, because we knew that the sisters of our school had been placed on the Bishop's throne. We waited for a while and then the organ began to play. It was the first time we heard a pipe organ. Two Fathers came in evidently to give\nThen the Bishop came, and we were ready to do our best. The children stood up and sang a song which started with these words: \"O happy day, Heavenly Father, we come to you.\"\n\nAfter Benediction we all came back very pleased with our visit. When we got home we went quietly so as not to wake up those who were sleeping.\n\nWe had a good time and Mr. Painter Principal was kind enough to take us to school.\n\nAlex Janvier\nGrade VII\n\nTHE SUNDAY VISIT\n\nThe Sunday following his consecration His Excellency Bishop Sheppard came to visit our school. We had been told that he was coming and we were very excited about him.\n\nAt five o'clock, all the boys and girls went out in groups to meet him. He came in through the side of the door and walked along the hall, then we saw the Bishop. He looked very tall and handsome. We sang in Gregorian Chant at our Mass.\n\nAfter Mass we went to see the Bishop. He talked to the two rooms of children and went to the chapel. While he was praying there, we went into the chapel and looked at the pictures and statues.\n\nCherrelling Martin\nGrade VII\n\nOn the following morning the Bishop said Holy Mass in our chapel. It struck me during his sermon when he looked towards the people the first time, he did not say \"Gentiles Vocatus\" but he said \"Gentiles Vocatus.\"\n\nBefore Holy Communion, he gave us his ring. He looked very tall and handsome. He is also looking and very tall. I heard him say \"I believe that he likes us. Anyway we always love him much.\"\n\nHe came to see us often as Father Strimpel would invite him to be sure that he will come often because he likes children very much especially our dear Bishop.\n\nArthur Eagle\nGrade VII\n\nIN MEMORIAM\n\nRev. Father J. Batey\n\nBefore we left for the summer holidays last June, we went to say goodbye to our dear Father Batey. We never thought that it was for the last time. He used to be our guide. To pray for him and that he could do the same for us to always turn our prayers because he was a holy man.\n\nIt certainly was a big shock for all the Trudeau parents and children. Who thought that only a few months before, could hardly believe it. In him, we had such a great friend, a kind father.\n\nHe was really devoted to the Indians as he was among them ever since he came here. He joined the Catholic Church and became a member of Holy Priesthood in 1899. He spent his first twelve years with the Cree Indians in Sagide Lake. In 1921, he was transferred to the reserve where he spent another seven years until 1928. He then went to Cold Lake where he stayed until December 14, 1935 when he came here to St. Paul. He died on July 16, 1936.\n\nHe lived here purely and quietly. He always had a kind word for us whenever we met him. He could speak five languages: French, English, German, Cree and Chipewyan.\n\nHe seemed to mean him more than anyone else, because he was the only priest who knew us.\n\nThe chief and the ex-chief came to Father Batey's funeral in St. Paul.\n\n\"He had a golden heart and for him, it was God after his Father.\"\n\nAlthough he was not the bishop, he was our friend. We often think and talk of him. Sometimes pray for him. We feel sure that he does not forget either that and that he is with God and will continue to help us in our needs.\n\nWe hope that he will assist especially Cherrelling Martin a grade V pupil who took his place in teaching the prayers to the Chipewyan children.\n\nJosie Henrie\nGrade VIII\nBACK FROM FRANCE\n\nOUR NEW SUPERIOR\n\nAt last, our dear old Mother De Guif is back from her long sojourn abroad. She has been away among the sisters in England for a real deserved visit to her Sisters. Our dear old Mother De Guif came to Canada in 1925. She was very young then, but she has grown up to be a fine woman. She has been very busy since she came here, and she has done a lot of good work. She has been very kind to us, and we love her very much.\n\nOur new Superior is Sister A. Cardinal. She is a very nice lady, and she will be a great help to us. We are very happy to have her as our Superior.\n\nSister A. Cardinal\n\nTHE ROSARY\n\nThe month of October is the month of the Holy Rosary. We please the Blessed Virgin very much by saying the Rosary. She appeared to some little children and she told them to say it often. Bernadette, the little girl who saw her, said she had seen her too. They thought she was very beautiful and they loved her very much.\n\nSister gave us each a pair of beads, and we were glad because we could say the Rosary every day before we went to sleep.\n\nCaroline Cardinal\nGrade IV\n\n\"Reverend rise unspoken thoughts when we pray.\"\n\nMore things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of.\" Tennyson\nEXHIBITION\n\nNo one can imagine our excitement and happiness when we heard that our school had come first at the Edmonton and Calgary Exhibition this summer.\n\nWhen we came back from the holidays we all went to see our prizes and see who had the most. For the sewing only, we got forty first prizes and about twenty second. In all the school we received over a hundred prizes counting the school exhibits. This is a great joy for us.\n\nWe were glad when the exhibition money came. We all went in the girls' room. Most of the Sisters were present. Father Principal gave us the money for our prizes. On that same occasion the girls received some badges for cooking, sewing and knitting and housekeeping. They have sewed their badges on their school dresses so they could go to wear them. We hope that many more of the pupils will get some badges next year. We also hope to have many prizes at the exhibition and come first again.\n\nHerman Cardinal\nGrade V\n\nPOTATO HARVEST\n\nIn the last days of September all the boys went to pick potatoes. We left in the morning in the wagon and came back late in the afternoon. We did not pick up many pails of potatoes because the potatoes were few. Father Principal had to go and buy some at Hobson in the truck.\n\nJohn Steinhauser\nGrade II\n\nEDITORIAL\n\nThe \"Kocassin Telegram\" was started by the Reverend Sister Catherine Couturier in 1947. She was wholeheartedly devoted to its development and progress. We may well say that her work was crowned with success.\n\nOwing to circumstances in 1948 the publication ceased. We are now attempting to bring back to life and publish the \"Kocassin Telegram.\" It is of course the work of the pupils who are very enthusiastic about it.\n\nFor the printing of this issue we had recourse to the charity of the Reverend Sister L'Estivier. She kind enough to make our copies on her little press. We are indeed most grateful and may she receive here our heartfelt thanks.\n\nWe hope that with the contributions of our friends and subscribers we may be able to buy a machine for the printing of the next \"Kocassin Telegram.\"\n\nThe Editor\n\nBrooches\n\nBesides the girls who received badges, some have received \"Brooches.\" They are: Catherine Joth, Annette Poitras and Doris Pinogos. These brooches were awarded for the three years of training which comprises: Cooking, Sewing, Knitting and Housekeeping.\n\nOur sincere congratulations!\n\nVivian\nDear Father Rollande:\n\nThis morning I received a copy of \"Moccasin Telegram\". I was very delighted to know that you have created enough enthusiasm among the pupils for such a valuable enterprise. I feel that time is well spent in the preparation of such a school magazine.\n\nI noticed that this paper was done on a gelatin duplicator. The Department has been supplying a mimeograph outfit complete with stencils, pens, ink etc., to schools who put out such a paper as its contribution to such a project.\n\nIf you are anxious to receive such a machine, it will be in order for you to prepare a requisition and submit it here.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

IA-413\n\nW.K. Taylor\nIndian Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention Mr. B.F. Neary, Superintendent of Education.\n\nRe: Mymograph for Blue Quills Indian Residential School\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of December 31st, 1948, file 751-E.6, written to Father E.B. Rollande, O.M.I., re the above.\n\nRev. Father Rollande is very anxious to obtain a ditto mimeograph for his school. The Rev. Principal has stated that he would be quite willing to meet the difference in price usually allotted for this purpose and the actual cost of the machine. I am attaching a requisition for one mimeograph, preferably ditto type if possible.\n\nI would highly recommend that this ditto mimeograph be purchased for Blue Quills School as it will greatly assist in educational work for the attending Indian children. Father Rollande has started publishing a school newspaper and this is distributed, not only to the children, but also to the parents and other interested parties. This publication will, I am sure, enliven the interest of the parents in their children's progress at this institution.\n\nIt is hoped that the attached requisition will meet with your favorable consideration.\n\nW.K. Taylor,\nSuperintendent.\nONLY after you have seen a demonstration of this amazing new Ditto Direct Process Duplicator will you fully appreciate the strides that have been made in duplicating efficiency. Here is speed, simplicity and foolproof operation such as you have never seen before.\n\nThe new Ditto Model D15 Duplicator employs the famous Ditto Direct Process Duplicating Principle. There are no stencils to cut, no type to set, no mats to sensitise. The Ditto original is a thin piece of paper. A carbon copy is made by placing a sheet between the typing or drawing and Ditto Direct Process Carbon Paper. The carbon comes in four colors \u2014 purple, red, green and blue. All colors may be applied to the same original and all will reproduce in one simple operation.\n\nThis makes an original, prepared in the same manner as you would write or type a letter, is ready for instant use. Just clamp it to the cylinder of the D15 machine and run your copies. No inking, no make-ready. More than 300 copies per minute \u2014 300 exact copies from each original. If you need only a few copies, your original may be filed and re-used over and over again until all of the dye deposit is exhausted.\n\nThe duplication of drawings in colors is amazingly simple. Just draw on a sheet of paper through Ditto Direct Process Carbon using any of the 4 colors available. Your carbon copy becomes your original or master from which the copies are made.\n\nWhether you need copies frequently or only on occasions, you can find no simpler way to make them than on this new Ditto Model D15 Duplicator. It's ready for instant use. There's no inking\u2014no preparation of any kind.\n\nAnything you write, type or draw becomes instantly available for all who should have copies. The ease is so low you will always say\u2014\"Let's do it on Ditto.\"\n\nProves 300 and More Bright Copies from Each Original\n\n16 FEATURES OF THE NEW D15\n\n1. Copies direct from original writing, typing or drawing.\n2. Copies all colors in one operation.\n3. Makes 100 or more copies per minute.\n4. Produces 300 and more copies from each original.\n5. Copies forms 3\"x5\" to 9\u00bd\"x14\".\n6. Copies on varying weights of paper and card stock.\n7. Originals may be re-used until entire ink supply is exhausted.\n8. Delivers copies face up.\n9. Requires only 1 turn of handle for each copy.\n10. Provides simple, speedy liquid and pressure control for regulating brightness and number of copies.\n11. Provides three different counter.\n12. Provides automatic feeding mechanism for long and short copies.\n13. Receiving tray serves as cover when machine is idle.\n14. Has simple and positive master off/on switch.\n15. Finished in durable hammered grey.\n16. Non-corrosive stainless-steel parts assure years of extra wear.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nMarch 7th 1949\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Blue Quills Indian Residential School - Saddle Lake Agency.\n\nVOTE 516 Allotment 17-433\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

E.B. Rollande, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Hills Indian Res., School,\nSt. Paul, Alberta.\n\nDear Father Rollande:\n\nI have a requisition for a Ditto type mimeograph duplicator for your school.\n\nAs the price of this machine has gone up considerably in the past few years, we have been attempting to get an equal machine at a lower price. We are arranging to send you a Roneo machine complete with stencils, pens, type cleaner, stylus plate and all other accessories required to operate the machine for typewritten work and hand work.\n\nI wish you would give this machine a thorough going over and advise us whether you like the machine. You might also advise us whether there are any faults that you can find and whether you consider it easy and clean to operate. Any other features you might care to point out will be appreciated.\n\nTrusting to hear from you first when you receive it and later when you have used it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDept. of Mines & Resources.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt was with a great joy and a deep feeling of gratitude that we heard we would receive a mimeograph to help us in the printing of our School Magazine.\n\nTo date we have received the accessories and a large supply of paper, but we are yet expecting anxiously the machine itself. This long delay does not seem normal to me, and I take the liberty to bring this fact to your attention.\n\nThanking you for your unceasing interest towards our school and assuring you of our entire co-operation,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. T. Bernet-Rolland O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nMay 14, 1949.\n\nDear Father Rollande:\n\nThe first notification I had that you had not received your mimeograph machine was from reading your bulletin.\n\nAn enquiry to the Department of Public Printing and Stationery was sent immediately as it was felt that this order should have been filled by that time.\n\nAn official of the Stationery Branch advised that an error had been made, whereat some items were sent to you from stock while they should have been ordered from an outside firm as outlined in our request. They are attempting to rectify this error. However, it would be appreciated if you would let me know what items you have been supplied in order that proper corrections can be made.\n\nWhen listing the items, please quote if possible any identification numbers, names and descriptions.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. E.B. Rollande, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Indian Res., School,\nSt. Paul, Alta.,\n\nMFT/HM\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nReplying to your kind letter of the 14 instant, I am glad you have been able to trace back the error causing the delay in the reception of the mimeograph machine you are granting to our School.\n\nHere are the items we have received:\n1 Stylus Writing Plate.\n1 Bottle Corrective.\n3 Roneo Super Quality Ink (H.10)\nStencils Roneo Kleenpad (6 Quires ? T 430 X)\n\nAlso received lately, likely in connection with your order, 6 packages of Mimeograph Paper. No invoice was enclosed, but the parcel bore the No 283650.\n\nHoping that this will be of some assistance to you, we now expect to receive the machine in time for our June issue.\n\nGratefully yours,\n\nRev. P. Bernet-Rolland O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nMay 23, 1949.\n\nDear Father Rollande:\n\nI have your letter of May 18th in reference to supplies received for the Roneo Mimeograph Duplicator.\n\nI trust that by this time you should have received the machine itself and put it to use.\n\nI would like to have your comments on the operation of this machine. A sample of the work would be appreciated.\n\nI might suggest that you use one of the stencils received earlier and one that arrived with the machine for a comparison.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. E.B. Rollande, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Indian Res., School,\nSt. Paul, Alta.,\n\nMPT/PM\nMr. Bernard F. Neary  \nSuperintendent of Indian Education  \nDept. of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nHow glad we are to be in the possession of the Roneo Duplicator No. 86, received on May 21st. However certain accessories which would be very useful for the beautifying of our journal, are missing. I took the liberty to write those items needed on a Requisition Form for School Supplies. We would greatly appreciate a prompt shipment of these items as they would be very handy for the printing of our June issue \"Moccasin Telegram.\"\n\nIt is rather difficult for the time being to give you either criticisms or appreciation of the machine, but after the printing of the next magazine, we shall be in a better position to report on its effectiveness.\n\nIn closing may I express my sincere gratitude in the name of all, and assure you of my entire co-operation.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n[Signature]\nprincipal\nRequisition for School Material\n\nFor completion of req.

We must admit that the lack of detailed instructions on the mechanism, at first, made our experiments quite difficult, but if you have the kindness to order the accessories asked for in our last letter, we hope to send you a \"Moccasin Telegram\" showing the efficiency and the possibilities of this Mimeograph, for which we thank you once more very heartily.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev.

This representative states that photographic stencils and printographed stencils are very complicated to work with and recommends that any printographed work required should be done by people who have the proper facilities, such as a camera and a projector for this type of work.\n\nI am also advised that an ink tin with a hinged lid and scraper is sent with each machine, and you should have received yours. However, if you have not, please advise at once and I will contact the suppliers in this respect.\n\nAttached is a bill in duplicate for items you have received for the duplicator.

L. C. Latour, O.M.I., Blue Quills Residential School, St. Paul, Alta.\n\nWith reference to your requisition dated December 31st, it is noted that you request a quantity of raffia which would cost approximately $60.00. It is doubtful if we can secure raffia at the present time but, in any event, the quantity which you request appears to be very large. Before placing the order, I would appreciate your advising me if you feel sure that the quantities requested are absolutely necessary.\n\nThe other articles on the requisition considered necessary have been ordered. It is not possible at the present time to obtain erasers, pen nibs, pencil sharpeners, and many other articles.\n\nA number of books for supplementary reading purposes are being forwarded with the other supplies.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nBlue Quill's Ind.

The teachers have therefore requested a larger quantity, in order to use some of it at the end of this school year.\n\nHowever, as raffia is very hard to secure and as the cost is very high, we will be pleased to receive what you can secure.\n\nThanking you sincerely,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL.C.

The red cross means that our school is catholic. The blue feathers stand for \"Blue Quills.\" The tepee on the green signifies that in our school there are Indians from the prairies, while the spruce tree stand for the Indians of the forest regions.\n\nThe original of this drawing was done in France, by Mr. Jacques Pecnard, cousin of Reverend Father Principal.\n\nAt last, I have the pleasure to salute the rebirth of the \"Moccasin Telegram;\"...one of my most cherished desires is fulfilled. I have long felt the need of such a journal. In fact, is not a school without a journal like a child deprived of his voice? The \"moccasin Telegram\" will be the voice of Blue Quills. It will be a means of communication with other schools; of sharing ideas and ideals. It will be another link added to the great chain of friendship which binds all the Indian Schools together as well as with those who show any interest in their welfare.\n\nIt is the pupils' work. This, I hope, will foster interest, ambition and co-operation among the children. It may also help them to become conscious of their stand in society which is considerably different from that of fifty years ago.\n\nI sincerely believe that great benefits can be derived from the publication of the school newspaper, therefore I wholeheartedly encourage this enterprise.\n\nTo the pupils, I wish: \"Success\" and to the journal...\"Long Life.\"\n\nMay God bless both children and readers........\n\nFather E.Bernet Rollande, O.M.I.\nThe Staff and Pupils of the Blue Quills Indian Res. School offer their respectful greetings and prayerful wishes to the Most Reverend Maurice Boudoux, first Pastor of the newly established diocese of St. Paul.\n\nThe Apotolic Delegate\n\nHow glad and anxious we were when we heard that we might have a chance to see Bishop Maurice Boudoux at the time of the consecration of his Excellency Bishop Bourgie. At last the day came! We were to go to the highway near our school and go by bus to St. Paul, from Edmonton. After school, it did not take us long to get there. We arrived there only half an hour after we left school. We were very excited and couldn't wait until we reached the highway. Then we lined up, ten abreast, and started off. We were holding large flags of very bright colours. It was cold, but we did not mind; we were very happy. We waited for any cars came, passed by and were lost in a cloud of dust. But finally, at last one car came. It was approaching, slowing down and stopped at us and blessed us. Then he got out and talked to us and blessed us. He was very kind and friendly.\n\nAbout fifty-three cars followed him. When they all had gone out of sight, we started off again. We were very happy because we had seen the representative of the Pope in our country.\n\nFlorence Large\nGrade VIII\n\nThe Bishop's Coronation\n\nWe did not see the Consecration Ceremony, but we saw the sacrifice to altar. But many of the Sisters went and they told us about it. We were very happy. They said it lasted very long but it was a nice ceremony. We are very grateful now we have a good Bishop who lives near us.\n\nChinese Tache\nGrade IV\n\nBenediction\n\nOn the day of the consecration of the most Rev. Maurice Boudoux, we did not have the chance to attend. However, we had the opportunity to go to Benediction. We were very happy. We were accompanied by our teacher Sister Au Toitini and our classmate Sister Marie. Our sister Irene Lefebvre went in the big truck which was driven by Willie. We went to the church, it was near eight o'clock. We jumped off the truck and walked to the church. We joined the line and we gave our places in the front. We were very happy because we knew that the sisters of our school had made some preparations for us. We waited for a while until the organ began to play. It was the first time we heard a pipe organ.\n\nTwo Fathers came in evidently to give\nTHE VICAR'S VISIT\n\nThe Monday following his consecration His Excellency Bishop J. Baudoux came to visit us at school. We were very glad to see him coming and we were all eager to see him again. We went to see him in his study and he went up to second floor to visit our chapel. They liked to see him very much and they asked him many questions. After the chapel evening, we rang the bell and Father Principal came out to meet him. He was very kind and I believe that he liked us. Anyway we always thought so much of him because Father Principal likes children and especially our dear Bishop.\n\nCherrelling Corbin\nGrade V\n\nTHE NEXT DAY HOLY MASS\n\nOn the following morning the Bishop said Holy Mass. The thing that struck me during his mass, is that when he turned around to give the blessing, he did not say \"Dominus Vobiscum\" but he said:\n\n\"Te Vulte.\"\n\nBefore Holy Communion he gave us Holy Communion. He looked very kind to our pastor; he is also looking very tall and thin. He seemed very kind and I believe that he liked us. Anyway we always thought so much of him because Father Principal likes children and especially our dear Bishop.\n\nAbraham Eagle\nGrade V\n\nTH HISTORIA\n\nHer Father J. Heller\n\nbefore we left for the summer holidays last June, we went to say good-bye to our dear old Father Heller, but we never thought that it was for the last time. He used to be such a kind father for him and that will do last time. He used to be good girls, but he was very kind to us. He died at the end of August, just before we came back from our trip. He was certainly a very kind man, a true friend to his pupils, parents and children. We who had seen him only a few months before, could hardly believe it. In him, we lost our dear old friend.\n\nHe was really devoted to the Indians as he was among them since he joined the Oblate Order in 1908 and came to Canada after his Holy Priesthood in 1909. He spent his first twelve years with the Cree Indians in Saskatchewan, then he went to work among the Ojibway Indians in Ontario. He came to Ontario to study take until 1919. In that year, he came to our parish as a missionary. He worked among the Ojibway Indians in Chapleau, Le Griff and Cold Lake. He worked in Chapleau for two years, after that he went back to Ontario to study at the Oblate Seminary in Toronto. In 1923, he came to Cold Lake where he stayed until December 26, 1944. In that year he became assistant priest and in 1945 he became parish priest. He lived here piously and quietly. He always had a kind word for everyone. He was very modest, but he was humble. The Chippewa Indians spoke his language and he knew their customs. He was very kind to everyone. He died on July 27, 1945.\n\nThe chief of the tribe chief came to Father Heller's funeral in St-Paul. He had a special place for him at Le Griff after his consecration. Although we do not see him often, we feel sure that he does not forget us either and that now that he is with God he will continue to help us in our prayers.\n\nWe hope that He will assist especially Cherrelling Lartin a grade V pupil who took his place in teaching the prayers to the Chippewa children.\n\nJamie Eganlie\nGrade VIII\nOUR NEW SUPERINTENDENT\n\nWe came back from our holidays only to find that nearly all the staff were changed. We were very disappointed when we heard that Sister Josephine had gone. We were sorry to hear that even the superior had left. We thought that she was a good teacher and we would miss her if she had not returned.\n\nI guess all nuns are kind but we were glad to see that the new ones were just as nice. We hope they will stay here with us. The staff of teachers is complete; classes are also.\n\nSister Josephine was replaced by Sister Immaculate. Sister Immaculate is replaced by Sister Josephine. Sister Josephine is replaced by Sister Immaculate. The students who were taught by Sister Josephine are now taught by their teacher now. This year we have a new nun in charge of the school. She is very nice and we are glad to have her.\n\nOUR LAST TICNIC\n\nWe did not enjoy playing \"Go Fish\" very much because we were all anxious to go home. We were very glad to see the boys and girls who have been so devoted to our welfare. We are very grateful for their kindness and our assistance of our prayers.\n\nEliza Cardinal\nGrade V\n\nMr. Alex Goddard, the new Substitute teacher, is very kind. He is very nice because he is kind and lovely. We shall do our best to do as he likes us to do.\n\nEliza Cardinal\n\nTHE ROSARY\n\nThe month of October is the month of the Holy Rosary. We please the Blessed Virgin very much when we say the Rosary. She answered our prayers when we asked her to say it often. Bernadette saw her. They taught her how to say it. We love her very much. Our Mother gave us each a pair of beads and we were glad before we went to sleep every day.\n\nCaroline Cardinal\nGrade IV\n\n\"Peace and rest rise unspoken thoughts when we pray.\"\n\nMore than ever sought by prayer than this world dreams of.\n\nTennyson\nEXHIBITION\n\nNo one can imagine our excitement and happiness when we heard that our school had come first at the Edmonton and Calgary Exhibition this summer.\n\nWhen we came back from the holidays we all went to the sewing room to see who had the prizes. For the sewing only, we got forty first prizes and about twenty second. In all the school we received over a hundred prizes counting the school exhibits. This is a great joy for us.\n\nWe were glad for the exhibition money and we all went in the girls' room. Most of the girls got their present. Father Principal gave us the money for our prizes. On that same occasion the girls received some badges for cooking, sewing and knitting and housekeeping. They have sewed their badges on their school dresses and they are proud to wear them. We hope that many more of the girls will get some badges next year. We also hope to have many prizes at the exhibition and come first again.\n\nHerman Cardinal\nGrade V\n\nPOTATO HARVEST\n\nIn the last days of September, all the boys went to pick potatoes. We left in the morning in the wagon and came back late in the afternoon. We did not pick up many balls of potatoes because the potatoes were few. Father Principal had to go and buy some at Rhome, in the truck.\n\nJohn Steinhauser\nGrade II\n\nEDITORIAL\n\nThe \"Tocassin Telegram\" was started by the Reverend Sister Catherine Coutelle in 1927. She was wholeheartedly devoted to its development and progress. We may well say that her work was crowned with success.\n\nOwing to circumstances in 1942 the publication ceased. We are now attempting to bring back to life and publish the \"Tocassin Telegram.\" It is of course the work of the pupils who are very enthusiastic about it.\n\nFor the printing of this issue we had recourse to the charity of the Reverend Sister Valletivier. She kind enough to make our copies on her Ditto. We are indeed most grateful and may she receive here our heartfelt thanks.\n\nWe hope that with the contributions of our friends and subscribers we may be able to buy a machine for the printing of the next \"Tocassin Telegram.\"\n\nThe Editor\n\nBroaches\n\nBesides the girls who received badges, some have received \"Broaches.\" They are: Catherine Roth, Elaine McFetters and Doris Pinone. These broaches were awarded for the three years of training which comprises: Cooking, Sewing, Knitting and Housekeeping. Our sincere congratulations!\n\nVivian\nDear Father Rollande:\n\nThis morning I received a copy of \"Moccasin Telegram\". I was very delighted to know that you have created enough enthusiasm among the pupils for such a valuable enterprise. I feel that time is well spent in the preparation of such a school magazine.\n\nI noticed that this paper was done on a gelatin duplicator. The Department has been supplying a mimeograph outfit complete with stencils, pens, ink etc., to schools who put out such a paper as its contribution to such a project.\n\nIf you are anxious to receive such a machine, it will be in order for you to prepare a requisition and submit it here.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard E. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. E. Bernet Rollande, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Residential School,\nSt. Paul's, Alberta.\n\nMFT/HM.\nREADERS\n\nGRADE TWO:\n- Friends and Neighbours\n  Workbook - Friends and Neighbours\n- More Friends and Neighbours\n  Workbook - More Friends & Neighbours\n  Guide-book - Second Grade Program\n\nGRADE THREE:\n- Streets and Roads\n  Workbook - Streets and Roads\n  Guide-book - Third Grade Program\n- Highroads to Reading Series:\n  Highroads to Reading Book 4\n  Highroads to Reading Book 5\n  Highroads to Reading Book 6\n\nENGLISH Language Workbooks:\n- Living Language Series (See Article No. 15)\n- Word Ways (Grade 3)\n- Words at Work (Grade 4)\n- More Progress (Grade 5)\n- Casey (in Grade 6)\n- Living Language (Teachers' Manual)\n- Opportunity Workbooks in English, (Grade 7)\n- Opportunity Workbooks in English, (Grade 8)\n- Workbook in English Grammar, (Grades 7 and 8)\n\nNATURE STUDY:\n- Natural Science Through the Seasons (Teachers only)\n\nHEALTH:\n- Safe and Healthy Living Series:\n  FOR TEACHER'S USE ONLY:\n- Spick and Span (Grade 1)\n- Health Parade (Grade 2)\n- Growing Big and Strong (Grade 3)\n- Safety Every Day (Grade 4)\n  FOR PUPIL'S USE:\n- Health, Safety and Success (Grades 5 and 6)\n- Your Health & Safety Grades 7 & 8\n\n(Please print carefully or type)\n\nName ____________________________\nSchool ___________________________\nPost Office (nearest) _______________\nExpress office (nearest) ____________\nProvince _________________________\n\nENROLLMENT OF INDIAN PUPILS BY GRADES\n\n| Grade | Grade | Grade |\n|-------|-------|-------|\n| 1     | 2     | 3     |\n| 4     | 5     | 6     |\n| 7     | 8     | 9     |\n| 10    | 11    | 12    |\n\n(PLEASE PRINT)\n\nIndian Agent.\n**ORDER FORM FOR STANDARD SCHOOL SUPPLIES**\n\nThese supplies are for Indian children only.\n\n**Note:** Order by exact quantity and not by dozens; e.g., do not ask for \"three dozen\" but say \"36\".

Neary, Superintendent of Education.\n\nRe: Mimograph for Blue Quills Indian Residential School\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of December 31st, 1948, file 751-E.6, written to Father E.B. Rollande, O.M.I., re the above.\n\nRev. Father Rollande is very anxious to obtain a ditto mimograph for his school. The Rev. Principal has stated that he would be quite willing to meet the difference in price usually allotted for this purpose and the actual cost of the machine. I am attaching a requisition for one mimograph, preferably ditto type if possible.\n\nI would highly recommend that this ditto mimograph be purchased for Blue Quills School as it will greatly assist in educational work for the attending Indian children. Father Rollande has started publishing a school newspaper and this is distributed, not only to the children, but also to the parents and other interested parties. This publication will, I am sure, enliven the interest of the parents in their children's progress at this institution.\n\nIt is hoped that the attached requisition will meet with your favorable consideration.\n\nW.K. Taylor\nSuperintendent.\nONLY after you have seen a demonstration of this amazing new Ditto Direct Process Duplicator will you fully appreciate how much time and money have been saved in duplicating efficiency. Here is speed, simplicity and foolproof operation such as you have never seen before.\n\nThe new Ditto Model D15 Duplicator employs the famous Ditto Direct Process Duplicating Principle \u2014 there are no stencils to cut nor type or carbon to use. The Ditto original is a sheet of paper. A deposit of dye is placed on the sheet by writing, typing or drawing thru Ditto Direct Process Carbon Paper. The carbon comes in four colors \u2014 purple, red, green and blue. All colors may be used from the same original and all will reproduce in a simple operation.\n\nThis master or original, prepared in advance, is equivalent at any time to a typed or written original for instant use. Just clamp it to the cylinder of the D15 machine and run your copies \u2014 10 inking, no make-ready \u2014 more than 100 copies per minute \u2014 3/10 and more copies from each original. If you run only a few copies, your original may be used again and again over and over until all the dye deposit is exhausted.\n\nThe duplication of drawings in colors is amazingly simple. Just draw on a sheet of paper through Ditto Direct Process Carbon using any of the 4 colors available. Your carbon copy becomes your original or master from which the copies are made.\n\nWhether you need copies frequently or only on occasion, you can find no simpler way to make them than on this new Ditto Model D15 Duplicator. It's ready for instant use. There's no inking \u2014 no preparation of any kind.\n\nAnything you write, type or draw becomes instantly available for all who should have copies. The cost is so low you will always say \u2014 \"Let's do it on Ditto.\"\n\n16 FEATURES OF THE NEW D15\n\n1. Copies direct from original writing, typing or drawing.\n2. Copies 4 colors in one operation.\n3. Makes 100 or more copies per minute.\n4. Produces 300 and more copies from each original.\n5. Copied size \u2014 9\" x 5\" to 9\u00bd\" x 14\".\n6. Copies varying weights of paper and card stock.\n7. Originals may be re-used until entire ink supply is exhausted.\n8. Ditto copies face up.\n9. Requires only 1 turn of handle for each copy.\n10. Provides simple, ready liquid and pressure control for regulating brightness and number of copies.\n11. Provides three digit reset counter.\n12. Provides reversible feeding mechanism for long and short copies.\n13. Housing also serves as cover when machine is idle.\n14. Has simple and positive master attachment.\n15. Finished in durable hammered grey.\n16. Non-corrosive stainless-steel parts assure years of extra wear.\n\nProduce 300 and More Bright Copies from Each Original\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nMarch 7th 1949\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Blue Quills Indian Residential School - Saddle Lake Agency.\n\nVOTE 516 Allotment 17 - 433\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

E.B. Rollande, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Cuffs Indian Res., School,\nSt. Paul, Alberta.\n\nDear Father Rollande:\n\nI have a requisition for a Ditto type mimeograph duplicator for your school.\n\nAs the price of this machine has gone up considerably in the past few years, we have been attempting to get an equal machine at a lower price. We are arranging to send you a Roneo machine complete with stencils, pens, type cleaner, stylus plate and all other accessories required to operate the machine for typewritten work and hand work.\n\nI wish you would give this machine a thorough going over and advise us whether you like the machine. You might also advise us whether there are any faults that you can find and whether you consider it easy and clean to operate. Any other features you might care to point out will be appreciated.\n\nTrusting to hear from you first when you receive it and later when you have used it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDept. of Mines & Resources.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt was with a great joy and a deep feeling of gratitude that we heard we would receive a mimeograph to help us in the printing of our School Magazine.\n\nTo date we have received the accessories and a large supply of paper, but we are yet expecting anxiously the machine itself. This long delay does not seem normal to me, and I take the liberty to bring this fact to your attention.\n\nThanking you for your unceasing interest towards our school and assuring you of our entire co-operation,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. F. Bernet-Rollande O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nMay 14, 1949.\n\nDear Father Rollande:\n\nThe first notification I had that you had not received your mimeograph machine was from reading your bulletin.\n\nAn enquiry to the Department of Public Printing and Stationery was sent immediately as it was felt that this order should have been filled by that time.\n\nAn official of the Stationery Branch advised that an error had been made, whereby some items were sent to you from stock while they should have been ordered from an outside firm as outlined in our request. They are attempting to rectify this error. However, it would be appreciated if you would let me know what items you have been supplied in order that proper corrections can be made.\n\nWhen listing the items, please quote if possible any identification numbers, names and descriptions.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. E.B. Rollande, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Indian Res., School,\nSt. Paul, Alta.,\n\nMFT/HM\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nReplying to your kind letter of the 14 instant, I am glad you have been able to trace back the error causing the delay in the reception of the mimeograph machine you are granting to our School.\n\nHere are the items we have received:\n1 Stylus Writing Plate.\n1 Bottle Corrective.\n3 Roneo Super Quality Ink (H.10)\nStencils Roneo Kleenpad (6 Quires ? T 430 X)\n\nAlso received lately, likely in connection with your order, 6 packages of Mimeograph Paper. No invoice was enclosed, but the parcel bore the No 283680.\n\nHoping that this will be of some assistance to you, we now expect to receive the machine in time for our June issue.\n\nGratefully yours,\n\nRev. E. Bernet-Rollende O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nMay 23, 1949.\n\nDear Father Rollande:\n\nI have your letter of May 18th in reference to supplies received for the Roneo Mimeograph Duplicator.\n\nI trust that by this time you should have received the machine itself and put it to use.\n\nI would like to have your comments on the operation of this machine. A sample of the work would be appreciated.\n\nI might suggest that you use one of the stencils received earlier and one that arrived with the machine for a comparison.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. E.B. Rollande, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Indian Res., School,\nSt. Paul, Alta.,\n\nMFT/HM\nMr. Bernard F. Neary  \nSuperintendent of Indian Education  \nDept. of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nHow glad we are to be in the possession of the Roneo Duplicator No. 88, received on May 21st. However certain accessories which would be very useful for the beautifying of our journal, are missing. I took the liberty to write those items needed on a Requisition Form for School Supplies. We would greatly appreciate a prompt shipment of these items as they would be very handy for the printing of our June issue \"Moccasin Telegram.\"\n\nIt is rather difficult for the time being to give you either criticisms or appreciation of the machine, but after the printing of the next magazine, we shall be in a better position to report on its effectiveness.\n\nIn closing may I express my sincere gratitude in the name of all, and assure you of my entire co-operation.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Name]  \nprincipal\nRequisition for School Material\n\nFor completion of req.

We must admit that the lack of detailed instructions on the mechanism, at first, made our experiments quite difficult, but if you have the kindness to order the accessories asked for in our last letter, we hope to send you a \"Moccasin Telegram\" showing the efficiency and the possibilities of this Mimeograph, for which we thank you once more very heartily.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev.

This representative states that photographic stencils and printographed stencils are very complicated to work with and recommends that any printographed work required should be done by people who have the proper facilities, such as a camera and a projector for this type of work.\n\nI am also advised that an ink tin with a hinged lid and scraper is sent with each machine, and you should have received yours. However, if you have not, please advise at once and I will contact the suppliers in this respect.\n\nAttached is a bill in duplicate for items you have received for the duplicator. Please certify this and return in order that the account can be put through for payment.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nRev. E.B.

W. Sibbald.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, Assa.\nLac la Biche, 14th April, 1897.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\n\nSir,\n\nAs the number of our pupils has much increased in the last year and as there are some applications for admission of new pupils as soon as we can receive them, I must put up new buildings for new buildings for the accommodation of our children. The School room, Dormitories have become too small and we have made plans for the erection this year of a building 60 x 30 feet with an elevation of 21 or 22 feet. This building will of course be a source of great expense and as it is for the benefit of the Indian children that we undertake it, it seems to me that I am justified in applying to the Indian Department for their help and assistance. All the materials are now ready and His Lordship Bishop Grandin has kindly lent me his best carpenter to take charge of the construction. We will have a good stone foundation made under the whole building and its addition of 15 x 20. With this information it is easy for you to figure the amount of the expenses already incurred for the lumber, stones, lime, &c., &c. I think myself that the buildings when completed will cost not very far from $4,000.00 to $6,000.00. I know that the Department has taken upon itself the greater share of the expenses in the construction of other Boarding Schools, and this knowledge makes me hope that you will be willing to help me also.\n\nI am told that the Blue Quill's and Saddle Lake Reserve Indians are agitating just now for a Boarding School of their own. It is needless to say that most of our pupils come from Blue Quill's.\nQuill's, the granting to them or to one of the other Reserves of a Boarding School would be the closing of our own. We are willing to receive all the Indian Children that the Department will provide for, and with this school for Catholic Indians, and that of Red Deer for Protestants, Indians of this Agency have not much ground for complaint.\n\nWould it be too much to ask the Department to instruct their Agent to use his influence with his Indians in order to bring the parents of pupils to leave their children at School until we are satisfied that they know enough to be benefitted by their stay with us. This is our greatest difficulty just now. After three or four years, and even sometimes after only two years in the School, parents must take their children away, to have their help in their work. Good advice from the Agent or Instructor at such time would induce some of the parents, if not all, to leave their children with us and it would be a great help to us.\n\nI am anxious to know your answer to the Indians' petition, because I want to start work on our new building as soon as possible. If you wish, I will send you a copy of the plan I showed to Mr. Agent Sibbald when he came to visit our School.\n\nHoping to receive a favourable answer to my request for assistance, I remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd. H. Grandin.\nOffice of the Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T. 29th April, 1897\n\nNO. 013.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of\nthe 16th instant, making application for aid from the\nDepartment for the proposed enlargement of the School under\nyour charge.\n\nIn reply I have to say that in the Estimates for\n1897-98, which are now before Parliament, and cannot therefore\nbe changed, no provision has been made for an item of this\nnature, so that it will not be possible to deal with the\nmatter before preparing the Estimates for 1898-99.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. A.H. Forget,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nRev. H. Grandin,\nLac la Biche.\nSaddle Lake, 1st July, 1897.\n\nSir,\n\nFor the last two days I have been busy looking around this reserve for a good site for our Boarding School. After visiting with the Reverend Fathers Boulenc and Therien all the places that were likely to suit us, we have come to the conclusion that the best situation of all would be the location of our Mission on Blue Quill's reserve. The only drawback is the scarcity of water. You told us when we met you at St. Albert that you were to send soon some kind of a drill or boring machine to Onion Lake, and that we might have the use of it after they were done with it at that point. Could you not invert the order of things and send the drill here as soon as possible to enable us to see if we can find water on our present station. We can hardly begin our building without being sure of a good supply of water, and as we are ready to begin our school house at once, you will understand how much we wish to have the use of your machinery as early as it can be brought here.\n\nIn the hope that you will grant our petition,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nsgd. H. Grandin.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nOffice of the Indian Agent,\nSaddle Lake Agency,\n2nd August, 1897.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that with a view to removing the Boarding School from Lac la Biche, the Roman Catholic Authorities are now moving building material to the Mission on Blue Quill's Reserve.\n\nI understand that it had been decided to erect the new school on the Mission Site on Blue Quill's Reserve, but now I am informed by Rev. Father Grandin that a decision will not finally be arrived at until His Grace, Bishop Legall comes to see the place, and he is expected at the Mission this week.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd. W. Sibbald.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nOffice of the Indian Agent,\nSaddle Lake Agency, 12th August, 1897.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to my letter of the 2nd instant, No. 178, I beg to inform you that I understand that it has been ultimately decided to remove the Lac la Biche Boarding School to the Mission Site on Blue Quill's reserve.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nsgd. W. Sibbald,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nOffice of the Indian Commissioner,\nNo. 065. Winnipeg, 21st August, 1897.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, No. 166, informing me that you understand that it has been ultimately decided to remove the Lac la Biche Boarding School to the Mission Site on Blue Quill's Reserve.\n\nI beg to say in this connection that pending the removal the Blue Quill's School having been dropped in this year's Estimates, the Department has informed me that it does not see its way to promise a continuance of the Teacher's salary. The Church authorities have already been informed of this.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. A.E. Forget.\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nSaddle Lake Agency.\nOffice of the Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, 3rd June, 1898.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that provision has been made for\n50 boarders at the rate of $72.00 per head a year, for the\nSaddle Lake (Lac la Biche) Boarding School, for the fiscal\nyear 1898-99. This number must not be exceeded.\n\nYours truly,\n\nsgd. A.E. Forget,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nRev. H. Grandin, O.M.I.,\nLac la Biche,\nAlberta.\nThe amount of costs for work performed is larger than the amount of costs for materials. The reason for this seemingly anomaly is because all the doors, window-frames, windows, &c. have been made by the Contractor himself and the other Carpenters employed by him, instead of having been supplied ready made from Edmonton or Calgary.\n\nThe nearest points to have all the lumber required were Edmonton and Lac la Biche, both places being about ninety miles distant from Saddle Lake.\n\nThe price of hauling from both places was eight dollars ($8.00) per thousand feet B.M. The average price of lumber used in the buildings, bought either at Edmonton or at Lac la Biche, has been sixteen dollars ($16.00) per thousand feet B.M., which with the price of hauling added, brings up the price of lumber delivered at Saddle Lake to twenty four dollars, ($24.00) per thousand feet B.M.\n\n---\n\nAffidavit\n\nJe, Dominique Henri Landrieu, principal de l'\u00e9cole pensionnat de la Reserve de Blue Quills, en Lac la Biche, affirme solennellement que l'\u00e9tat de compte ci-dessus de P.

Bowes, Contractor, A. Nemoz, B. Orillon and O. Vermette, carpenters, were busy finishing the buildings and will not likely get through before the end of the month.\n\nWe, moreover, want without delay and at whatever cost, a system to pump water and force it in the establishment. Pending this water has to be carted from the Saskatchewan, nearly two miles away, at great cost.\n\nAt the end of the month there will consequently be an additional expenditure of about $1,000.00, which we will have met. The Department, when you have communicated this information, will I am sure, consider all these circumstances, as you yourself will do, when preparing the next Estimates.\nI hereby declare to the best of my belief that the quantities of material mentioned in this Statement have been used in the erection of the Roman Catholic Boarding School, that the values placed thereon and on the labour, are fair and just.\n\nWall 103 feet, 6 feet square.\n\nHad to go through 6 feet of rock, 92 feet down.\nEdmonton, 4th September, 1895.\n\nMy dear Mr Forget,\n\nThe Statements attached were handed over to me yesterday evening by Mr Sibbald himself, Indian Agent at Saddle Lake.\n\nHe said that not being notified by the Department to meddle in any way with the buildings of the Boarding School removed from Lac la Biche to my Agency, I do not think I have anything to do with them. Nevertheless having seen what has been done, I am ready to sign the attached declaration, written in my own hand before leaving the Reserve to come here yesterday. I willingly will sign said declaration, if Mr Forget thinks I ought to.\n\nIf therefore the testimony of the Agent is necessary, he is ready to sign the declaration.\n\nYours,\n\nSgd. H. Leduc, O.M.I.\n\nPt.\n\nA.R. Forget, Esq.\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg.\nEdmonton, 4th September, 1898\n\nMy dear Mr Forget,\n\nI am forwarding today a detailed statement of expenditure incurred by the Roman Catholic Mission upon buildings erected for the Blue Quill's Boarding School.\n\nYou know under what condition and circumstances the Lac la Biche Indian Industrial School was removed to Saddle Lake. This too place at the request of the Indians, with your approbation and the incentive of the Indian Department.\n\nWe operated the removal and paid all expenses in this connection being sure that we would be recouped by the Government in good time for this institution no longer out of a reserve but immediately on Blue Quill's and for the use of the Indians only.\n\nI therefore beg to ask you in the name of His Lordship Bishop Grandin and also in that of His Lordship Bishop Legal to be good enough to include in your Estimates, and recommend the reimbursement of our expenses aggregating from 31st July, 1897 to 1st of August, 1898, to the sum of $5,650.86.\n\nYours,\n\nsgd.
