This provision is intended to prevent the escape of debtors from the jurisdiction of the courts, and to compel them to pay their debts.\n\nWe believe that this ordinance is unnecessary and undesirable, and we hope that it will be repealed at the next session of the Council.\n\nFREEMASONRY\n\nClergymen are but human, but how often do they fail to see the true nature of Freemasonry? They are too often swayed by the opinions of others, and fail to see the true nature of Freemasonry.\n\nFreemasonry is not a secret society, but a system of moral instruction. It teaches the principles of morality, charity, and benevolence. It is open to all men of good character, and it is not necessary to be a member of any other organization to be a Freemason.\n\nWe believe that Freemasonry is a valuable institution, and we hope that it will continue to exist for many years to come.\n\nTHE WEST END HOUSE\n\nOffice and Workshop\n\nNear Presbyterian Church.\n\nFIRE!
