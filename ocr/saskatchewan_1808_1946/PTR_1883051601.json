H. MACDOWALL.\nTHE PRINCE ALBERT TIMES\nWEIDENSDAY, MAY 16, 1883.\n\nOUR LANDS.\nThe want of tact displayed by the Government in dealing with our case is really dangerous, as it is likely to produce misunderstanding and confusion in the minds of those who are interested in the question. The delay in granting compensation and the lack of proper attention to all matters connected therewith are very serious. The interests of those parties who have been injured by the action of the Government are being neglected, and they are entitled to receive prompt and just compensation.\n\nTHE NOMINATIONS.\nBefore the next session of Parliament, the election of the District of Lewis will have taken place. The candidates for the representation of the District in the North West Council. What the outcome of an election will be cannot be foreseen. The respective candidates have held meetings in every part of the District, and the result of placing their claims fairly before the public has been most satisfactory. The claims which were presented in the beginning have been received with the utmost enthusiasm. The views and opinions of the people have been expressed in a manner which cannot be ignored. The claims have been fairly and impartially considered, and the result of the election will be known shortly.\n\nEDITORIAL NOTES.\nThe question of the C.P.R. from the Pacific to the Atlantic is now being discussed in the House of Commons. The Government has promised to consider the matter at its earliest convenience. The question of the C.P.R. is of great importance to the country, and it is hoped that a decision will be reached soon.\n\nSTAPLE & FANCY DRY GOODS!\nAll the Latest Novelties.\n\nBUFFALO HALL\nOUR STOCK CONSISTS IN PART OF\n\nJUST RECEIVED\na large and complete stock of\nNew Spring Goods,\nWhich we are offering very cheap\nto make room for our Cumberland freight, expected shortly.\n\nSTAPLE & FANCY DRY GOODS!\nAll the Latest Novelties.\n\nBOOT & SHOE\nOur Stock in this Line is very complete, and prices will be found very low.\n\nMens' Shoes from $1.25.\nLadies' Newport Tin Shoe $1.50.\n\nClothing,\nA choice assortment of Ready Made Clothing.\nMens' Fancy Shirts in great variety.\n\nHATS,\nKid Hats in all sizes.\n\nGroceries,\nWe show the latest stock of Groceries and Canned Goods ever imported.\n\nMISS MACK & CO.,\nCAMPBELL'S BLOCK,\nPRINCE ALBERT, N.W.T.\n\nW.
