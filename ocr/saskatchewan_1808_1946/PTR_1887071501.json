In his first statement he declared that the opponents were lunatics and their report was untrue. Finding that position untenable he now attempts to evade it by shifting the responsibility on to party leaders who had not the manliness to name. Failed in this attempt he now assumes that he has the right to make attacks at all and under cover of this forged \"belief\" to undertake a libelous apology to the public. He does not appear to have made any attempt to argue away the awkwardness of his position but has merely feebly attempted to escape from the awkwardness by hiding behind others. He is in the mire. The question, however, is not whether he is in the mire or not, but whether he is justified in being there.\n\nHad Mr. McTaggart been at all anxious to ascertain the truth (which in his case would have been very easy) he could have made a straightforward inquiry; at first have found out what the facts were and then proceeded to argue his case. Instead he seems to have made this known, and if it were untrue he could have shown it up, but that he has preferred to escape from the awkwardness of his position without having taken a single proper step towards proving the truth is capable only of one interpretation.\n\nI am fully persuaded, however, that Mr. McTaggart's knowledge about the subject is not sufficient to enable him to make any statement as to its merits. His attitude is one of evasion and his conduct is one of concealment.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFRIDAY, JULY 15, 1887.\n\nCOMMERCIAL UNION.\n\nThis appears to be the burning question of the day in some of the eastern provinces, and as usual there is a vast difference of opinion on the advisability of the renewal of restrictions to commerce between Canada and her neighbour to the north. It is a question of vital importance, and as to the effects likely to follow such a radical proposal to be considered with great care. One thing is certain, and that is, the commercial union is only another name for annexation, and would be certain to result in almost immediate absorption and the consequent extinction of the Dominion as an independent entity. Any proposal that tends toward such an end must be rejected at once. It will effectively remove the strongest arguments for the continuance of our existing political institutions. While the patriotic sympathisers of the British Empire do not enter into the proposal a total approach towards disunionism by the existence of an insurmountable barrier to trade and maintained by her own dependency. In truth no commercial union on free trade principles with the States, itself the most protected of all countries, would be desirable. It is impossible to maintain a protective policy towards Great Britain and the rest of the world, alone not on the face of it seem to be a very undesirable idea. In the main it will have been observed that the movement of or rather the whole, of the agitation appears to be on the Canadian side, chiefly among the farmers of Ontario, whose animosity so far as appears from newspapers is based on the belief that it is in a manner complete. But what say the other classes of the Canadian people? What say the American people? They don't make much sign. Are they indifferent? Are they silent and still silent? And what say the old country? Must Canada not defer a little to her opinion? To the promoters of commercial union the question is one of life and death. Great Britain, the land of the promised land, on stronger principles that will be fair to all and not to the weakest party, we are prepared to say God speed. To those who would delude crowds regard the former power and influence of the old empire.\nTHE PRINCE ALBERT TIMES\n\nAND\n\nSASKATCHEWAN REVIEW.\n\n$2.50 PER ANNUM\n\nThe Times is the best medium in the Territory to advertise your business in.\n\nSubscribe for The Times and get the latest news and happenings around town.\n\nJOB PRINTING\n\nOf all descriptions done neatly, quickly and cheaply.\n\nJ.

This was on the 16th June. Mr. McTaggart went back to the old country, but he did not come back until July 5th. He says the reason he would not let me have the oats was because farmers do not want them.\n\nIn conclusion all I will say is merely this, that the readers of your columns must have been very much surprised to see that Mr. McTaggart has turned and changed in every direction since he came into conflict with the other side.

It was very pretty to see the fine boys, drawn by four splendid horses, while the band played some of their best tunes. After driving through all the streets of the Mission they circled the grounds, gave a halt, and gave him a second encore.\n\nMr. Louis addressed a few words to Mr. Stewart who was present, thanking him for the kindness extended to him and wished the ladies, especially of the band and congratulating them on their complete success up to now, promising to give them another encore when they came again. They promised to do so.\n\nMr. Mitchell has made arrangements for the importation of a small herd of the finest breed of cattle. We understand are at Pointe Lewis, our grazing pastures. We think this breed will be well adapted to our soil and climate, and crossed with the pure buffalo, Mr. Mitchell contends will produce a breed of cattle which will be of great value to the Northwest. We wish Mr. Mitchell every success in his plucky experiment.\n\nMr. HAGUE'S ADDRESS\n\nAt the General Meeting of the Merchants' Bank.\n\nAt the recent meeting of the shareholders of the Merchants' Bank, held in Winnipeg, Mr. George Hague, the general manager, spoke of the business of the bank for the last year and its general condition throughout the province. Speaking of the Northwest, Mr. Hague said: \"The agriculturists of Manitoba and the Northwest are entitled to the appointment in harvest. Drought in summer and a touch of early frost in the fall have prevented the crops from attaining a abundant crop and reduced them to less than the average. Though the Northwest has been suffering throughout the season, it would be naive to take a pessimistic view of the future. Early illusory signs in all the states of the west, Illinois included, have been followed by crops, crops being wholly or partially destroyed after harvest. Some settlers are not hopeful. The battle has been, however, held on and fought the battle through, being ultimately rewarded by the result. The farmers of the Northwest themselves became the heroes of innumerable stories.\"\n\nThe province of Quebec, during the last thirty years, has been engaged in the same struggle. For about thirty years ago. After an India rising resembling the Northwest boom, it was thought that the Northwest would be the same. But this state of things passed away, and the development of wheat growing in the Northwest has been a strong conviction that to the Northwest shall soon be similar results. It is not thought that it will be as rapid as once thought it would be; but it will come. In Manitoba and other provinces there are many signs of invention. Barley crops have driven farmers to mixed farming and cattle raising, a great improvement on the old cattle raising. The thought is, that the Northwest is certain. It has been proved that the land of the world can be grown there in reasonable quantities of acre. It is beyond doubt a splendid region for cattle, and dairy produce must flourish there in due.\n\nFOR\n\nHarvest Tools,\nMachine Oils,\nBarbed Fence Wire,\nCoal Oil,\nBuilding Hardware,\nTin Roofing,\nEavetroughing,\n\nGO TO\n\nJ.
