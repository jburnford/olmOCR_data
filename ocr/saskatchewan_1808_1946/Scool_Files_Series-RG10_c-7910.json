If this work is carried out, it is considered that it should be done during the coming Christmas holidays, in order that it would not interfere with the regular classroom work. If the cost is not excessive, the Department will approve of having the work done.\n\nI am having a set of Corona Flash Cards sent to you, also some requisition forms. Twenty-four tooth brushes were sent to you on the 27th ultimo. If these were received, it is thought they should be sufficient for the number of pupils in attendance.\n\nWith best regards,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nGeo. Dill, Esq.,\nTeacher, Sucker Creek Indian Day School,\nLittle Current, Ont.\nOttawa, October 15, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nA requisition has been received from the teacher of the Sucker Creek Indian Day School for a supply of paint sufficient to paint the interior of the school building. He states the walls are in a filthy condition and that it would be necessary to first have them washed, and that the painting could be done by the Indians. He states it would take between three and five gallons of paint for two coats.\n\nI would request that you give this matter your consideration. If the cost of having the painting carried out would not be high, the Department would favourably consider authorizing same. You might also state, if you approve of the work being done, when you would recommend that same be performed. It is considered that it should be carried out during the coming Christmas holidays, in order that it would not interfere with the regular classroom work. If you recommend same, you should state the quantity of paint required and the approximate cost of the labour in having the painting carried out. We are informing the teacher that this matter is being referred to you. A report giving the information asked for at your early convenience is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacIntosh\nActing Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning,\nOnt.\nFrom Mr. Southland:\n\nI should have mentioned in my letter of the 12th instant that I had spoken to Mr. Lewis about this paint before I wrote to you. If you want a straight estimate on the work you will find one in the estimate submitted in connection with the proposed repairs. My thought was to employ Indian labor to lessen the cost.\n\nAlso I should suggest closing the school on Friday and having the work done over the weekend. I can reach this following Saturday to make up for this. We might as well have the benefit of the sunshine!\n\nThe toothbrushes I send ahead of me were distributed by the teacher and have been taken away. The number I asked for was needed to equip one to each child. I am anxious to have tooth-brush shall in school.\n\nI gave Mr. Lewis a requisition for some soap etc. for the school. Be good to it!\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeorge Scott\nLITTLE CURRENT, ONT.\n\nL. A.

D. Buck is for\nlumber which was authorized for the Duncan\nCreek School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeorge Hill\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nOctober 22nd, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report that the teacher in Sucker Creek Indian Day School, Mr. G. Dill, has asked for the following articles to be furnished for use in the class-room.\n\n6 bars toilet Soap\n6 \" laundry Soap for scrubbing\n4 yards Towelling\n6 drinking Cups\n1 Sauce Pan and lid\n1 Dishpan\n6 lamp Mantles\n1 gal. Gasoline\n1 Axe Handle\n2 Tea Towels.\n\nHe also asks for a supply of Cod Liver Oil, and that soup be supplied for the pupils to serve with their midday meal instead of cocoa which was served as a hot drink during the last winter past.\n\nAs soap, towelling, cups, mantles, gasoline and an axe handle are required at this school I would recommend the purchase, and if the Department approve of a hot drink being served to the pupils with their midday meals it will be necessary to furnish a dishpan, sauce pan and tea towels. The cost of a supply of cocoa, milk and sugar will be much less than a supply of canned soups, therefore, I would recommend that hot cocoa be served if the Department will approve of a hot drink being served in the Day Schools during the incoming winter months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nLittle Current, Ont.\nOctober 24, 1932.\n\nTo Mr. Sutherland:\n\nYou will remember that the Dept. placed an order for some seats for the Little Current School on July 12th. These were sent by an inland line and I signed the accounts in Ottawa. They were not opened until my return and I found that the following were missing.\n\n1 # 2 Front\n1 # 2 Rear\n\nThis is undoubtedly my fault\u2014and I don't know what can be done. I am wondering if I could write to the firm. I really need the seats and they may replace them. Certainly they were not in the two cases received.\n\nI shall be glad to know how to act in their behalf.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeorge Hill\nOttawa, October 26, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Dill:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, informing the Department that one No. 2 front and one No. 2 rear were missing from the equipment supplied by the Globe Furniture Company for the use of the Sucker Creek Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that I am taking this matter up with the above Company and requesting them to check up on this shipment. They are being requested, if they supplied the front and rear seats, and they were lost after arrival at Little Current, to duplicate the order and supply another No. 2 front and No. 2 rear, and to forward their account, in triplicate, to you covering the cost. You should certify this account in the usual manner and forward it to the Department for payment. It is thought the above Company, no doubt, forwarded the full number of front and rear seats, but something happened to them after their arrival at Little Current and before your return to the school. I presume you have made full enquiry.\n\nRegarding the painting of the interior of the school, we are awaiting a reply from Mr. Agent Lewis. I am again drawing this matter to his attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nGeo. Dill, Esq.,\nTeacher, Sucker Creek Indian Day School,\nLittle Current, Ont.\nOttawa, October 26, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, regarding the request of the teacher of the Sucker Creek Indian Day School to be supplied with materials as mentioned therein.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the following:\n\n- 6 bars toilet soap,\n- 6 lbs laundry soap,\n- 4 yds towelling,\n- 6 drinking cups,\n- 1 saucepan and lid,\n- 1 dishpan,\n- 6 lamp mantles,\n- 1 gal. gasoline,\n- 1 axe handle.\n\nPlease obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, to which you should attach a proper voucher form, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nThe Department will approve of a hot drink being served to the pupils at midday, and you may purchase the supply of cocoa and sugar required for the purpose. We understand that the Indian children can supply the milk required. Only the quantity of cocoa and sugar needed for the balance of the present school year should be supplied at the present time, and certified accounts covering the cost should be forwarded for payment. We are not prepared to supply canned soup.\n\nI would refer you to official letter of the 15th instant regarding the painting of the interior of the school building, and would be pleased to have a reply thereto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning,\nOnt.\nOttawa, October 26, 1932.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI wish to refer you to letter dated July 12th, last, placing an order with your firm to supply a number of front and rear seats for delivery at Little Current, Ont. The Department is now informed that the cases in which these desks were packed were not opened until recently, and that it was found the following were missing:\n\n1 No. 2 Front,\n1 No. 2 Rear.\n\nThe Department is not aware whether this equipment disappeared after arriving at Little Current or if, by oversight, your firm did not forward same. I shall be pleased if you will check up on this shipment and inform me if the full number of front and rear seats as ordered in letter above referred to were shipped.\n\nAs it is necessary that this equipment be supplied, I would request, if there was no oversight in shipping the previous order, that you forward by freight, charges prepaid, addressed to Geo. Dill, Esq., Teacher, Sucker Creek Indian Day School, Little Current, Ont., one No. 2 front and one No. 2 rear, of the same type as the other equipment which you supplied in July, last. They should be shipped knocked down, securely crated. Please forward your account, in triplicate, addressed to Mr. Dill. This account should cover the cost F.O.B. Little Current, sales tax included.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie\nSecretary.\n\nGlobe Furniture Co. Ltd.,\nWaterloo, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\n19-4-5\n\nh. t. but\n10-25-37.\n\nYou may think me all over the place. I only thought you shouldn't done anything about the seats concerning which I wrote you yesterday. I counted them today and in number they are alright. It is in size they made the mistake and so there is nothing to do.\n\nSorry to have made a fuss about nothing.\n\nYrs,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, October 28, 1932.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nReferring to our letter dated the 26th instant, regarding the No. 2 front and rear seats which were stated to be missing from the order supplied by you in July, last, for delivery at Little Current, Ont., I now have to inform you that, after a check up, the teacher informs us today that this equipment has been received. I regret any inconvenience that may have been caused your firm in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F. MacKenzie, Secretary]\n\nGlobe Furniture Co. Ltd.,\nWaterloo,\nOnt.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nLittle Current, Ont.\nNovember 25th 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Duthie:\n\nWhen we ordered the chairs for Sucker Creek in July I wrote on the understanding that #2 was the small size. This was the size I really wanted two backs and 2 fronts for. I have discovered today that the small ones are #6. I am writing by this post to the manufacturers asking them to hold your new order for these until they hear from you again. Will you ask them to send the #6 instead of #2.\n\nI am sorry to have created such a mix-up over these.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeorge Hill\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nOctober 26th, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Departmental Letter N. I9-4-5 of the 15th instant in regard to the request by the teacher at Sucker Creek School to have the interior of the school building repainted as the walls are in filthy condition; I have the honour to report that the interior walls and ceiling of this building are in a dismal condition and require renovating with paint. I estimate that the cost of having this work carried out will be approximately $38.00,-\n\n4 gals. paint at $4.75 $19.00\nLabour wash walls & ceiling 5.00\n\" painting, cleaning etc 14.00\n\nThe teacher is of the opinion that this work could be carried out on a week end and would not interfere with the regular classroom work to any extent, but as the walls require cleaning before they are painted, which will take some time, I believe that if the painting is authorized it would well to let the work stand until the Christmas holidays.\n\nThe old structure is hardly worth the expenditure but if maybe that this building will be made use of for some time, before it is replaced by a new school, I would recommend that the painting of the interior walls and ceiling be carried out, and the work to be performed by Indian labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 31, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, giving an estimate of the cost of the paint and labour in cleaning and painting the interior of the Sucker Creek Indian Day School building.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging to have this work carried out during the coming Christmas holidays. You should purchase the paint required and arrange for Indian labour in the cleaning of the walls and ceiling, and for the painting. You should see that the walls and ceiling are thoroughly clean and dry before the paint is applied, and you should see that a satisfactory job is performed.\n\nAfter the work has been completed, please forward an account, in triplicate, covering the cost of the paint, also accounts, in triplicate, in favour of the Indians who perform the labour. The number of hours employed and the rate paid per hour should be stated in detail. The total expenditure should not exceed your estimate of approximately $35.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The roof leaks badly and I have to run the new paint.\n\n4. Two Coats of whitewash for the school and woodshed.\n\nThere are estimates for all this work on the file (July 1932). The last two items would have to be done by a contractor, but the shingling and whitewashing could be done by the Indians.\n\nWith these improvements the building would serve until such time as finances permitted a new school \u2014 several years!\nI shall be grateful if you are able\nto give these requests favorable consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGeorge Leake\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1933 March | To miscellaneous expenses in connection with the Sucker Creek Indian Day School, as per receipt attached: Stamps - $3.00 | $3.00  |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nForm 52\n\nAgent\nIN INDIAN TRUST FUND\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nTo Mr. Thomas Trimble,\nLacolle, Quebec, Ont.\n\nDATE\n1932\n\nAMOUNT\n\nMarch 15th, To cocoa, milk and sugar supplied to the Sucker Creek Indian Day School.\n\n$4.00\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. 109\n| Date   | ARTICLES       | Folio | Debit | Credit | Balance |\n|--------|----------------|-------|-------|--------|---------|\n| Feb 8 | 2 lbs Cocoa    |       | $5    |        |         |\n|       | 10 lbs Sugar   |       | $4    |        |         |\n|       | 24 Cans Milk   |       | $88   |        | $90     |\n\nGoodnight\n\nGeorge Hall\nOffice of the Manitouining Indian Agency,\n\nMarch 15th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos.,\n\namounting to $4.00 in favour\n\nof Mr. Thomas Trimble, Little Current, Ont.\n\nfor cocoa, milk and sugar supplied to the Sucker Creek Indian Day School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\n\nLetter No. 19-4-5 dated October 26th, 1932.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

It was built in 1884 of log construction. The classroom is 20 x 25. Sixteen pupils on the roll and an average attendance of twelve. The classroom floor is worn out and has sunk nine inches in the centre. The walls and ceiling are dirty. The roof leaks badly. In wet weather the pupils have to move from place to place to keep out of the drip. The window frames, sills and foundations are rotten and have given way in places. The whole appearance of the building, outside and in, shows decay and neglect. No amount of repairs would put it in condition for school purposes. A new school is badly needed, it is only a matter of a very short time when the present structure will have to be abandoned.\n\n(sgd) Thos McHookin,\nInspector.\n\nA.S. Williams, Esq.,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nManitowaning, August 24th, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report that the Sucker Creek Day School building is in a dilapidated condition, and beyond having repairs carried out to any advantage.\n\nThis building has been in use for over fifty years, and only a cheap construction when first built. The timber foundation has gone to pieces with age which has let the walls drop and effected the classroom floor to such an extent that it is not within a foot of being level.\n\nThe roof is in a leaky condition and will not stand to be re-shingled as the roof boarding is in such a state of deterioration that will not allow the old shingles to be removed without the whole roof being replaced.\n\nAs this building is in such a miserable condition, and totally unfit for any further use, and will have to be replaced by a new building as soon as possible, I cannot recommend that any extensive repairs be carried out to this old building but would recommend that a small expenditure not exceeding $10.00 be allowed in patching the roof for the time being.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 29, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th instant, I beg to say that you may expend an amount of approximately $10 for repairs to the Sucker Creek Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning,\nOnt.\nManitowaning, December 4th, 1934.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honour to report that a number of the pupils in attendance at the Sucker Creek Indian School reside a long distance from the school, and therefore, they have to take a cold lunch with them for their mid-day meal. As the cool weather is now approaching, and a cold dry lunch for dinner is not any too favourable, during the cold weather, towards the health of the children, I would recommend that the school be supplied with cocoa, milk and sugar at a cost not exceeding $5.00 per month during the winter in order that these children may have a hot drink with their mid-day meal.\n\nThe teacher is willing to co-operate in preparing this hot drink for the children if the Department will supply the cocoa, milk and sugar.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nManitowaning, December 4th, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report that a number of the pupils in attendance at the Sucker Creek Indian School reside a long distance from the school, and therefore, they have to take a cold lunch with them for their mid-day meal.

Olotosaway\nManitowaning, July 25th, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith a motion in council by the Indians of Sucker Creek Band with regard to the condition of Sucker Creek Indian School and that it is necessary that a new school building should be erected.\n\nThe chief was advised as to the contents of Official Letters No. I9-5-5 of June the 17th and July 4th to the effect that the Department was aware of the need of a new school but will have no funds this year for the purpose, and that certain repairs would be carried out on the school building in use at the present time in order to place it in a suitable condition for another year. After advising him that the Department would not have funds available for the purpose of erecting a new school he was quite in favour of having the necessary repairs made to the old school building and let the matter of erecting a new school building stand for the time being.\n\nThe necessary material required for repairs to the old school building has been purchased and delivered. The work is being carried out under the supervision of the chief, which I expect will be completed within the next two weeks.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDiocese of Algoma\n\nBISHOP: THE RIGHT REV.

Marie, Ontario\n\n2nd August 1935.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn my recent visit to the Sucker Creek Indian Day School on the Manitoulin Island, I was disappointed to find into what a bad state it had got. The building is really in a deplorable condition, and the Chief told me that the band had resolved to close it. They cannot, of course, do this; but I simply mention the fact in order to show how discontented they have become with the school.\n\nThere are at present 14 children on the roll, and this number will be increased to 16 or 18 this fall, and they are expecting that there will probably be over 20 next year. This is the information which I got from our missionary and the Chief.\n\nIt is now a considerable number of years since the Department promised to rebuild this school, and I very much hope that you will do your utmost to take the matter in hand at the earliest possible date, especially as this is quite a respectable band of Indians who deserve all consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n+ Rocksborough R. Algoma\nOttawa, August 7, 1935.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to the Sucker Creek Indian Day School.\n\nThe condition of this building was brought to the Department's attention by Mr. Agent Lewis in letter dated June 25th, last. In reply, he was informed that, owing to lack of funds, the Department was not in a position to erect a new school. Mr. Lewis was, however, authorized to incur an expenditure of approximately $105 in making the necessary repairs to the present building.\n\nMr. Lewis advised us in letter dated the 25th ultimo that the work was being done and that the Chief of the Band was satisfied.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

There is seating accommodation for 20 pupils with 23 on the roll. Twelve or fifteen other children in the section are coming up to school age. For the year ended 31st March, 1937, the number on the roll was 16, and the average attendance of 12.\n\nThe building has become totally unfit for school purposes. No amount of repairs can make it suitable. The foundation, door and window frames are completely rotted away. The front part of the classroom floor is sunk 10 inches. In wet weather, mud springs up between the boards with every step.\n\nOn referring to file 19-4-5A, it will be seen the matter of providing a new school for this band has been under consideration for the past eight years. It has reached the stage now where parents state they will not allow the children to attend school during the winter months. Chief Obotossaway requests that steps be taken to close the school from Christmas to 1st April in the interest of the pupils' health. Under existing conditions, I can only add my recommendation to such action.\n\nThos. McGeekin,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nOntario.\nOttawa,\nNovember 10, 1938.\n\nH.X.D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA report has reached the Department indicating that the Sucker Creek Indian Day School is in bad condition and not worth repairing. I am further advised that a new site has been tentatively selected for a school on the Sucker Creek Reserve.\n\nAt the present time there are 2 or 3 former school buildings not in use. In this regard I refer particularly to the former Sheguinandah C.E. Day School.\n\nPlease secure the services of a contractor to advise you whether or not it would be possible to move this building to the proposed new site on the Sucker Creek Reserve and, if so, you should let me know what expenditure would be involved.\n\nIn the event of this building being moved would the Sucker Creek Indians excavate the earth in order to permit of a basement in the proposed new school? You should also have the contractor let you know what it would cost to provide a cement foundation.\n\nNo special funds have been provided in the current year's appropriation for a new building at Sucker Creek but if the proposals mentioned above can be carried out at a reasonable figure an endeavour will be made to secure the necessary funds. An early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\nR. A.

Turner, Little Current, Ontario, for Christmas gifts furnished for the pupils of Sucker Creek School, Dec. a/c.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 19-1-5 dated November 29, 1938.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRJL/JH\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. IA. 518\nManitowaning, January 26th, 1939.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Official Letter No. 19-4-5 of the 10th of November last, in regard to having me secure the services of a contractor to advise me whether or not it would be possible to remove the Sheguinandah C.E. Day School to the proposed new site on the Sucker Creek Reserve, and if so, to advise me Department what expenditure would be involved; I have to report that this matter has been taken up with different contractors. They all advise me that the cost involved to move this building to Sucker Creek Reserve would compare with the cost of building a new school, as it would have to be demolished and the poor class of material in the construction of the building would be of little value in the building of another school.\n\nI have made enquiries from the contractors if it would be possible to move the building without being demolished. They advise me that on account of the building being poorly constructed, a distance of twelve miles, narrow road between the two Reserves with several big hills it would be out of the question to make an attempt to move it without being wrecked.\n\nOn taking this matter up with the Chief at Sucker Creek on different occasions, he does not feel favourable towards an old building being moved on the Reserve. He states that they never had a habitable school building at Sucker Creek, and now they should have a new modern school similar to those the Department have built on other Reserves.\n\nI might say for the information of the Department that after making an inspection of the school building at Sheguinandah I consider that the Department would not save any money to move it to Sucker Creek Reserve instead of erecting a new building, as the material is in a state of deterioration and only a small quantity would be of use in the construction of another building.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 31, 1939.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nWith reference to Mr. Pratt's telephone message yesterday afternoon regarding the Sucker Creek school, I may say that Inspector McCookin, in reporting on a visit he made to the Manitowaning Agency last November, stated that it is an old log building and has become unfit for school purposes. We had so many other pressing demands for new day schools when preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1939-40 that it was not found possible to include Sucker Creek.\n\nIf funds are provided for a special building programme it would be possible to include Sucker Creek.\n\nDirector.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** W.

The water has been seeping through the concrete walls of the basement making a nasty discoloration on the inside of walls and floor. I believe the chief cause for this, is the result of no eave troughs on the school, and the surrounding ground is high at the back and two sides of the school, which does not permit the surface water to get away, and consequently lies close to the building and seeps in.\n\nI have gotten an estimate from John King, Indian tinsmith at Manitowaning on the eave troughing, and I imagine if thirty dollars were spent in banking the building a little more, and levelling off the grounds, the water could be kept away from the building, thereby eliminating most of this trouble.\n\nJohn King quotes on the eave troughing to make the trip from here, twenty cents per foot installed, for ninety two feet of trough and conductor pipe $18.40, and eight elbows @ .30\u00a2 each..$2.40, making a total of $20.80.\n\nThis work should be carried out as soon as possible, or the basement is going to be badly disfigured.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nORJ / JH\nOttawa,\nSeptember 10, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to requisition of the 31st ultimo you may purchase the articles shown on the attached list, with the exception of the tooth brushes which will be forwarded to the teacher from the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Johnston on the above, it is noted that the interior wall and floor finish in the basement is being discoloured apparently by the seepage of water through the concrete walls.\n\nIn this connection I may say that drainage tile was provided around the walls and under the floor slab of this building, and the exterior surface of the basement walls, below grade, were waterproofed with two coats of hot coal tar pitch. Under normal circumstances there should be no seepage through the foundation walls, and since Mr. Johnston's report does not state the location or extent of the leakage it is difficult to determine the cause of the trouble.\n\nIt may be possible, however, that the earth fill around the building has settled, creating the depression described by Mr. Johnston, which would allow roof and surface water to lie close to the building. The site generally is flat as shown by photographs submitted to you under cover of my memorandum of November 3rd, 1939. Any settlement of fill should be corrected and sufficient banking provided to raise the grade line at the building high enough to produce a fall away from the foundation walls.\n\nNo eavestroughing was provided in the contract for this school. Regarding the suggestion that eavestrough would prevent water from entering the building, it should be realized that unless the downspouts were connected to a vitrified tile drain and conveyed to a sump, some distance from the building they would be of little value. Further, in view of winter ice conditions prevailing in the vicinity, damage to eavestroughing would be frequent and maintenance costly.\n\nUnder the circumstances, it is felt that the contractor for this work should be requested to report regarding the cause of the trouble before any work is undertaken by the Department. We propose therefore to request Harper Brothers, Little Current, Ontario, to investigate the matter and to report on the situation as soon as possible.\n\nI shall be pleased to advise you further regarding the matter as soon as this report is received.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nChief Engineer.\nOctober 2, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nReferring to your memorandum of September 10th regarding the report of your Indian Agent that water has been seeping through the concrete walls of the basement of the new Sucker Creek School, I am attaching herewith a report, dated September 28th, from Mr. Mills, Chief Engineer.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Mills considers the contractor should report on the cause of the trouble before any work is undertaken by the Department and that a request in this connection has already been made to Harper Brothers, of Little Current, Ontario.\n\nIt is noted from your memorandum that your Indian Agent was instructed to proceed with necessary repairs, but it is possible that this work has not yet been done.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, October 5, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS & ENGINEERING BRANCH.\n\nRe: Sucker Creek Indian Day School.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your memorandum of October 2 and also a report received by you from Mr. T. S. Mills, relating to the above noted subject.\n\nI may state that the Agent, in a letter dated September 24, states that the necessary repairs to this school have been undertaken and completed. The last paragraph of the Agent's letter reads:\n\n\"This work was necessary in order to keep surface water from seeping into the cellar. A satisfactory job has been done. Please forward an advance cheque together with the enclosed paylist, to pay wages.\"\n\nDirector.\n| Names                  | Min. | Tues. | Wed. | Thurs. | Fri. | Sat. | Price Per Hour | Amount of Wages | Received Payments |\n|------------------------|------|-------|------|--------|------|------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Frank Obotoseesway     |      |       |      |        |      |      |               |                 |                  |\n| Richard McGraw         |      |       |      |        |      |      |               |                 |                  |\n| Sam Owl                |      |       |      |        |      |      |               |                 |                  |\n| Levi Owl               |      |       |      |        |      |      |               |                 |                  |\n| Peter Nedahbee         |      |       |      |        |      |      |               |                 |                  |\n| Thomas McGraw          |      |       |      |        |      |      |               |                 |                  |\n\nCheque No.: B 30850\nVote: 41\nBalance: $29.60\n\nI hereby certify that the services have been performed, materials supplied, and prices are fair and just.\n\nAgent: Mr. John T.

For making money for such organizations as the Red Cross, of which organization we have a sub-branch and work in union with Little Current Branch. Furthermore, I have been instructed to ask if the Classroom is locked may they be granted permission to have dances in connection with the above mentioned social gatherings.\n\nI believe at the time of the opening the Inspector disallowed a dance in the Classroom which can be readily understood because of its beautiful walls, floors and etc. But the basement has concrete walls and floors and would do the building no harm.\n\nThanking you for your explanation.\n\nMrs. Joe Morrison (Teacher)\nOttawa,\nJanuary 31, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter received from the teacher of the Sucker Creek School.\n\nThe Department has no objection to the use of the basement in this school for vocational training work or for sewing classes held intermittently for the adult Indian women on the reserve. We do not favour the use of the basement for social gatherings and certainly no dances can be allowed.

The seats have been turned to face the back of the room for conveniences in church services. It may serve this purpose well but it causes light to fall from the children's right, hence I cannot approve same.\n\nThe school is clean and good housekeeping meets the eye. The outside toilets should have the floors scrubbed now that the muddy season is over. In general the property shows good care.

No attempt has been made to arrange for a school garden.\nOttawa,\nMay 23, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reporting on his inspection of the Sucker Creek School on April 28, Inspector Geiger writes as follows:\n\n\"The children are comfortably housed. The seats have been turned to face the back of the room for conveniences in church services. It may serve this purpose well but it causes light to fall from the children's right, hence I cannot approve same.\"\n\nThis building is primarily intended for school purposes and not for church purposes. Consequently, the seats should be so arranged that the light falls over the left shoulders of the children during school hours. If the seats were attached to wooden runners they could be turned when church services are being held in the building. We have no objection to the Indians using the building for church purposes, but the Department must insist that the use of the building in this manner does not interfere with the school work.\n\nThe Inspector recommends that the floors of the toilets be scrubbed as the muddy season is now over. He also states that the lawn in front of the school requires some attention. To carry out these recommendations will not involve any heavy expenditure and you should arrange to have them done at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. C.R.

These were quoted at $1.25 each, as I presumed they would be only half size of window. On further examination, I found they must be full size of window, so only had three made at a cost of $5.00.\n\nOne of the outside panel doors got a tenant broken, and had to be repaired immediately and repainted, so while the carpenter was there, I had him fit the screens and paint them, and repair two other door locks, which were out of commission.\n\nThe carpenter supplied all paint, hooks and buttons for screens, screw nails etc. for a total cost of $16.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nCRJ / JH\n| DATE     | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Oct. 23  | To.

We have reviewed our file very carefully but cannot find that any authority was given to you for this expenditure. In addition, it is difficult to understand why it took the two women such a long period of time to clean this school, especially in view of the fact that we pay $5.00 a month for janitor services. It is doubtful if we can consider payment of this account, but a final decision will not be made until your explanation is received.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. C.R.

Mrs. Surrey assured me that if we cleaned the place up well for her to begin duties, she would see that it was kept clean during her term as teacher.\n\nI had to dispense with hauling the gravel to place around the two entrances, but have had a man in Little Current repair the storm window. The account for this has not come in yet.\n\nUnder date of September 29 File 19-4-5, I was authorized to proceed with this work.\n\nAs the two Indian women who done the work, have large families, and in very poor circumstances; I paid them from my own pocket.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nORJ / JH\nManitowaning, Ontario.\n\nDecember 3, 1942\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nOn a requisition for Sucker Creek School dated June 4, 1942, the former teacher asked for a sand table quoted at $6.00 and a water barrel at $4.00.\n\nI would now like permission to get a better sand table made, lined with galvanized iron, painted and fitted with castors. This table will cost $10.00, and if necessary, Mrs. Surrey would prefer to dispense with the barrel and have the better table.\n\nIt is thought the cheaper table would soon become raked with no castors and the sand would sift through if not lined. Will you please advise.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nCRJ / JH\nOttawa,\nDecember 9, 1942.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMr. C.R.

Johnston, Indian Agent, Manitowaning, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant, the Department approves the purchase of the articles shown on the attached list, with the exception of an expenditure for manual training supplies. This will mean that the cost of the articles will be approximately $35.\n\nPhilip Phalan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nI wish to report a few repairs are required at Sucker Creek School.\n\nThe Inspector has commented that there is no flag pole at this school. I have requisitioned for the necessary rope and pulley, and would ask to have a flag included and sent from Ottawa for this school.\n\nThe purchase of a pole, and cost of erection is estimated at $15.00 and will be supplied by the Indians.\n\nThe two outside toilets should be moved as the pits are caving in allowing the toilets to tip over. The doors also need replacing, which altogether will cost about $30.00 for the two toilets.\n\nThe teacher has asked to have the floors thoroughly scrubbed and oiled before opening of school, and there should be more gravel applied outside both school entrances. The clay soil tracks in the school badly in wet weather.\n\nThere is, I believe sufficient oil on hand for the floors, and I would estimate the cost of labour for scrubbing and oiling floors, and hauling gravel at $30.00, making a total expenditure of $75.00. I would be glad to have an advance cheque of $70.00 to pay for labour at your earliest convenience.\n\nORJ / JH\n\nIndian Agent\nREQUISITION FOR CHEQUE\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\nDEPARTMENT: MINES & RESOURCES\nBRANCH: INDIAN AFFAIRS\nDATE: August 15, 1944.\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE NO. | IN FAVOUR OF                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n|            | Manitoulin Island Indian Agency Trust Account     | $70.00 |\n\nSend cheque to:\nMr. C.R.

J. Smith and Kingsboro and Baxter. The quotations on other supplies were secured from S. W. McPhee & Co., C. W. Hinds and Eaton's Catalogue.\n\nThe cost of labour for washing walls and ceilings, and painting amounts to $50.00.\n\nI would suggest approval of this work as it was badly needed. I would recommend local purchase of the other supplies, with the exception of crayons, and brushes for water colours, which could possibly be supplied from Ottawa, as they are not obtainable locally.\n\nC.

A.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 15th April, 1903\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nIn reply to your enquiry as to the necessity for a school for the Temagami Indians, I beg to say that Mr Agent McLean in his last Annual Report states that the population of this band is about 86, about 20 of whom are children of school age for whom no educational facilities are as yet provided.\n\nThe question of establishing a school for these Indians has been before the Department for several years but owing to no reserve having been allotted to this band and their unsettled habits, the Department did not consider it practicable to establish a school for them.\n\nIn Sept. '02 the Deputy Minister of Education for Ontario forwarded a petition for the establishment of a school on Bear Island where most of these Indians reside. Mr Agent McLean was asked for a special report on this petition and in replying he stated that while he was quite in accord with the tenor of the petition if it were practical to establish and maintain a school on Bear Island, he pointed out that there were difficulties in the way which would, he thought, prevent the project from being carried out. He called attention to the difficulty there would be in securing a teacher to go there the frequent absence of the Indians for prolonged\nperiods while hunting; and also to the fact that a considerable number of the Temagami Indians do not reside permanently at Bear Island, but live at White Bear Lake about 20 miles distant.\n\nThese Indians, Mr McLean says, are bright and intelligent, but until they are permanently settled I do not see how the Department can undertake to establish a school for them.\n\nA church is in course of erection near the Hudson's Bay post but the Agent says he does not see how services are to be conducted, except at long intervals. In case the Roman Catholics place a missionary permanently in charge there, the Department might contribute something towards the education of the children, provided he is willing to teach them while they are in the neighborhood of the mission. I do not see that we could grant a fixed annual salary as teaching could only be undertaken at irregular intervals.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, April 16th, 1903.\n\nDear Mr. Harcourt,\n\nMr. Caldwell, M. P.

I am directed by the Minister of Education to suggest that owing to the migratory habits of our northern Indian people, the erection of a permanent school building would scarcely be warranted. In no case does the Department of Education give grants for building purposes.\n\nWould not a camp school answer the immediate necessities of the case? A suitable tent could be provided by the Federal Government, and its equipment and maintenance for the Spring, Summer, and early Fall would not be a great expense.\n\nI understand that in other parts of Canada provision is made by the Dominion Government for grants to various organizations for the education of its wards. Would not the case of the Temagami Indians, who are on an Indian Reservation, under the control of your Government, come under your general provisions? The difficulty of obtaining a teacher, at least for the first season, appears to be obviated by the offer of Mrs. Woods, wife of the Hudson Bay Factor, who agrees to undertake its control.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.\nDeputy Supt.

It suggests how the difficulty of obtaining a school and a teacher might be obviated. A camp school is suggested, which might be maintained during the spring, summer and early fall, and the wife of the Hudson Bay Factor is mentioned as willing to take control.

The attendance for the months of July and August was very satisfactory; there being\nan average of about seventeen pupils daily. We discovered one difficulty in encouraging all the children in the district to go to school every day. Some would be found loitering around their tents and neglecting their education.\n\nThe total number on the register was twenty seven\u2014the majority of whom were males. Ten of this number were very irregular\u2014much owing to the fact that their parents\nwere constantly changing their camps. Even, however, when they were with in the school section their parents did not give them much encouragement in regard to their education.\n\nGenerally speaking the progress of those who attended regularly was good. The grades ranged from \"one\" to \"four\"\u2014most of whom were in the first two (grades). Some of these children showed signs of more than ordinary\nability, for, considering the opportunities afforded them, this fact could be clearly seen.\n\nI trust this brief report will meet with your approval, and if my work has been satisfactory I would be glad to accept the same position for the next term.\n\nremain\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nIrene M.

The monthly cheque of fifty dollars barely covers the cost of board and lodging at the most special rate I have been able to secure. It is needless to point out that there should be a margin for clothing and the other necessaries of life, and a reasonable percentage for savings. I feel justified in thinking that originally the salary paid was intended to be a fair compensation and\nthat the only reason has not been\na change to meet changed conditions,\nis simply because the matter has\nnot been called to your attention.\nI therefore ask you to make a liberal\nreadjustment of my salary, dating\nfrom the first of May of this year.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nMary Gallagher\nTeacher\nOttawa, August 8, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant enclosing return from the Bear Island Summer School for the month of July, last, also a communication from the teacher, Miss Gallagher, requesting an increase of salary.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has decided to increase Miss Gallagher's salary to $60.00 a month and she will be paid at this rate from the time she took charge of the school in May, last.

Evain, O.M.I.,\n15 Oblats Ave.,\nQuebec, P.Q.\nSaint-Sauveur de Qu\u00e9bec, le 20th of January 1928\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your last letter, dated January 16, No 43-4-1, re an application from Miss Irene Spottwood, teacher at Bear Island, Summer school, 1927, asking me if I would approve her re-appointment for next summer. I appreciate your kindness.\n\nIndeed, it is always for me a delicate point to do so. But I must look first the better welfare of the children and the Indians families to whom I devote myself. I heard several criticisms about Miss Spottwood; I gave her some advice, but noticed that she was not liked in her ways, which appeared wrong to me and to the Indians.\n\nAnyway, in order to do not make a false report by myself alone, I have referred to Miss Honan, who has been teaching at Bear Island many years, and who makes visits to the people of the place.\n\nI take the liberty of sending to you her answer,\nwhich, please, you will be kind to forward back to me.\n\nThe two mentioned persons, in her letter, who complained,\nare the most serious and capable to form a judgment\nabout school business, on the island. Mrs. Smith\nis the wife of the H.B.C. manager. The two ladies had\nchildren going kindly to the school.\n\nMiss Moran, as I have told you before, has\nalways taken a great interest to the welfare of\nthe school and people of that locality. So I appreciate\nher advice. She is recommending a Miss Jean\nDermott, Butler, Ont. I would like to try\nher ability.\n\nBusting on your kind discretion towards my name\nand my situation in this,\n\nI remain always your faithful\nand devoted servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Name]\n15.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, relative to the obtaining of the services of a teacher for the Bear Island Indian Summer School for the coming summer, and enclosing a communication from Miss Honan, a former teacher, in which she recommends the appointment of Miss Jean McDermott.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that at the present time Miss McDermott is teaching in an Indian day school at Serpent River, Ont., and we are not prepared to consider her transfer to Bear Island. Miss McDermott's services for the present school year will not terminate until the end of June, and as the summer school at Bear Island reopens on or about May 1st, it would interfere with the work at Serpent River to transfer her. If you have any other teacher in view, I shall be pleased if you will forward particulars as to the name, qualifications and experience. Please give this matter attention at your early convenience.\n\nThe communication which you forwarded is returned herewith as requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

The school at Bear Island is only open from the 1st of May to the end of September, and in the event of your transfer, it would be difficult to place you in another school after that date. We have already communicated with Father Ewain and informed him that we were not prepared to authorize your transfer to Bear Island on the 1st of May, next. It is hoped that you will remain and complete the present school year at Serpent River.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

The Department has received a communication from Miss J. McDermott, the present teacher of the Serpent River Indian Day School, requesting to be transferred to the position as teacher at Bear Island. As you were informed in our letter of January 24th last, the Department is not prepared to consider her transfer as it will seriously interfere with the work at the school at which she is at present teaching.\n\nWe have no other teacher in view except the application from Miss Irene Spottswood, who taught this school last summer. It may be that other applications will be received before the school re-opens on May 1st next and, if you have no teacher in view, the matter may remain in abeyance for the present unless you agree to the re-appointment of Miss Spottswood.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

It will, therefore, not be necessary to take any further action in the matter, and you can inform any applicants for the position of teacher accordingly.\n\nThe Department is writing Miss Mary Tallon and Mrs. Rose Archambault, who both applied for the position of teacher, that this school will not be reopened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

BUSKARD,\n\nI have your memo of the 12th instant, with letter attached from the Honourable Mr. Finlayson, Minister of Lands and Forests for Ontario, suggesting the establishment of a school to be conducted during the entire school year at Bear Island, Lake Temagami.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, during the past number of years, a school was conducted at this point from May first to September 30th - a five month period, each year. Last summer, during the period the school was open, there was an enrolment of 34 children, with an average attendance of 27.\n\nMr. George P. Cockburn, Sturgeon Falls, the local Indian Agent, was requested, in April, last, to state whether, in his opinion, the school should be conducted this summer or not. In replying, he stated he considered the opening of the school for the present spring and summer months could be dispensed with, in the interests of effecting a saving in expenditure. Our Vote has been so extremely reduced, that it is necessary to discontinue a number of summer schools this year, and Agent Cockburn was advised that the Bear Island School would not be re-opened.\n\nFormerly, the Indians at this point were at Bear Island only during the summer months, going to\ntheir hunting grounds in the fall and winter. As the hunting is gradually becoming exhausted, the Indians are more and more remaining the entire year at Bear Island.\n\nThere are no funds this year for the establishment of a permanent school. The question of a year-round school will, in view of the number of Indian children now located at this point, receive consideration and the amount required for the salary of a teacher and other current expenses, if possible, be provided in our Estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nI would beg to suggest that Mr. Finlayson be advised that the question of conducting a permanent school will receive consideration but that, for the present fiscal year, there are no funds to pay the salary of a teacher and other expenses. Mr. Finlayson's letter is being returned herewith, as requested.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nChapman, March 6th 1934\n\nOffice of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOnt.\n\nSir,\n\nIf you intended opening Bear Island school this coming term I would be pleased to accept it.\n\nBeing a widow, and having the misfortune of losing my work about three weeks ago, I trust you will take this into consideration, and give me a favorable reply.\n\nI am Yours Very Respectfully,\nMrs Rose Archambault\nChapman P.O\nOnt.\nOttawa, March 12, 1934.\n\nMadam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant, I beg to say that it is not the Department's present intention to re-open the Bear Island Summer School this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It was discontinued last year, but I believe it is advisable to reopen it this year.\n\nFormerly the school was conducted for a period of four or five months, and the teacher was allowed salary at the rate of $85 a month. As a building is available, the school could be commenced as soon as the services of a teacher are secured.

Roy\nSturgeon Falls\nOnt.\nFebruary 14, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nI wish to refer you to my memorandum dated June 14, 1934, regarding the operation of a summer school at Bear Island, Lake Temagami, Nipissing Indian Agency, Ont., (Federal District of Temiskaming South). This school is not located on a reserve. This Department pays annual rental to the Provincial Government for the site.\n\nFor a number of years, summer school only has been conducted at this point, from May first to September 30th. Last summer, the school was not in operation until July first, but classroom activity was continued until the end of October.\n\nAn application has been received for the position as teacher for the coming summer from Miss Minnie T. Cox, Saugeen Falls, Ont., who holds a First Class Medal Diploma for the Province of Quebec, has had 6 years' teaching experience in White schools and 5 months' experience in an Indian school.\n\nLast summer, Miss Mary C. McLaren, Bear Island, was, on your direction, appointed teacher (see your memo July 10, 1934). She taught for a 6 month period - July first to October 31st, 1934.\n\nProvision is made in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the fiscal year 1935-36 for salary of a teacher for the summer school at Bear Island this coming summer, for a five month period, at the rate of $85 per month.\n\nI should be pleased to have your approval for the opening of this school for the period from May first to September 30th, next. A Roman Catholic teacher will be required, and I would appreciate your directions regarding who is to be employed.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nFebruary 16th, 1935.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nAt the request of several people of the community in the Bear Island vicinity who think that the children of that area are not receiving an adequate education, the Department of Education has deemed it wise to establish a public school section there. A section has been formed consisting of an area five miles square with Bear Island as its centre, and we are now taking steps to have a trustee board elected so as to have a school in operation as soon as possible. This school, like all public schools, will be open to all children of school age who are not separate school supporters, and that will include the Indian children.\n\nSince it will not be necessary for the Indian school to be continued we would like to know if we might secure the use of the school building there and save the expense of building another at the present time.\n\nWill you kindly take this matter up with your department and let me know the terms upon which we might secure the use of the building. We intend to put a fully qualified teacher in the school and give the children as good a chance as possible for an education.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP.W. Brown.\nSturgeon Falls February 18th 1935\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward letter received from Mr. P.W. Brown, Public School Inspector of North Bay, Ont., with reference to the Department of Education of Ontario establishing a public School Section consisting of an area of five miles square with Bear Island, Temagami, as its centre.\n\nMr. Brown in his letter states that the school will include the Indian children and that it will not be necessary for the Indian school to be continued, and requests to know if they can secure the use of the Bear Island school building and the terms.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nThe Secretary\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa,\nOttawa, February 23, 1935.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, enclosing a letter from Public School Inspector P. W. Brown, with reference to establishing a Public School Section in the vicinity of Bear Island.\n\nAs the Department understands that the children attending the Bear Island School are Roman Catholics and as we have always supplied a Roman Catholic teacher at this school, the arrangement proposed by Inspector Brown would not meet our purposes.\n\nAt the present time, it is our intention to conduct a summer school at Bear Island during the summer of 1935 and you will be advised later regarding the name and qualifications of the teacher who will be in charge of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nGeo. P. Cockburn, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSturgeon Falls, Ont.\nMarch 26, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nI have to refer to my memorandum dated February 14th, last, regarding the operation of a summer school at Bear Island, Lake Temagami, Nipissing Indian Agency, Ont., (Federal District of Temiskaming South). This school is not located on a Reserve.\n\nI should be pleased to be advised if you approve of this school being conducted during the coming summer months - for the period from May 1st to September 30th, next. If you approve, I should appreciate your directions regarding the teacher to be employed. These Indians are all Roman Catholic, and it would be necessary to engage the services of a teacher of that denomination.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nToronto, April 4th, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to state that during the latter half of 1934 and early in 1935 an attempt was made through the local Public School Inspector, Mr. P.W. Brown, B.A., of North Bay, to open a Public School on Bear Island. Mr. Brown formed the School Section and the formation received the official approval of this Department.\n\nIt seems, however, that there is some doubt as to whether the residents desire a Public School or a Separate School. It will be impossible to maintain two schools.\n\nIt would be quite possible if most of the parents concerned are Roman Catholics to open the school as a Public School and to engage a teacher of Roman Catholic faith if the board of trustees so desires. It would not be possible, however, to have religious instruction given during school hours if the school were a Public School. The Regulations for Public Schools would permit the giving of this instruction before or after school hours only.\n\nIt would be quite possible, if the people so desire, to organize a Separate School in accordance with the Separate Schools Act. Please see Sections 18, 19 and 20, of the Separate Schools Act, a copy of which is being sent to you under separate cover.\n\nThere is no doubt that a school to be open throughout the full school year is needed and the Department of Education stands ready to give support to either a Public or a Separate School.\n\nWill it be possible for your Department to determine definitely the wishes of the people in order that a school may be opened with as little delay as possible?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.D. Sutherland, Esquire,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nChief Inspector.\nOttawa, April 5th, 1935.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to the desire of School Inspector P. W. Brown, B. A., to open a public school on Bear Island.\n\nFor several years past, this Department has conducted a summer school for Indian children at this point. We have the use of the land on which our school is situated under License of Occupation No. 2307, Lot 106, Bear Island, and we have always paid a yearly rental to the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests. If a year-round school was established, it is doubtful if our Indian children would receive much benefit from it. It has been found that the best time to secure the attendance of Indian children is during a period extending from May 1st to September 30th.\n\nOwing to the arrangements we have already made, it will not be possible to consider the establishment of a joint Indian and White school this year but the matter will be considered for next year. In the meantime, in the event of a combined school being formed, you might let me know how many White children would attend; also what salary you consider should be allowed the teacher and what proportion of the total expenses this Department would be expected to provide. Would it be your intention to conduct such a school during the regular academic year, viz.: from September 1st to June 30th?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nV. K. Greer, Esq.,\nChief Inspector,\nDepartment of Education,\nToronto, Ont.\nToronto,\nApril 10th, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am directed by the Minister of Education to inform you that upon receipt of representations made by the community resident at Bear Island for improved educational conditions, the Department of Education made a survey which showed that there are 32 children of school age almost equally divided between treaty and non-treaty children. These are cared for by a school operating as a part year school mainly in the summer months. The Department feels that with so large a school population in a district which is becoming so widely known through its tourist connections in the summer months, this community should be brought into harmony with other schools of the Province and should operate for the entire school year under a fully qualified teacher. With a view to arriving at some arrangement which will be satisfactory to your Department as well as to the community in question, it is felt that direct consultation with you is desirable, and Dr. J.B. MacDougall of this Department will confer with you in your office some time early in the coming week.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSec'y, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDeputy Minister of Education.\nToronto, April 12th, 1935.\n\nDear Sir\u2014\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant having reference to the proposed school for Bear Island.\n\nAt midsummer, 1934, Dr. J.E. MacDougall of this Department visited Bear Island and found that 25 children were enrolled, none of them being white children. He found also that there were in the community 15 Treaty Indian and 17 non-Treaty children.\n\nIn the Fall of the year Mr. P.W. Brown, B.A., Public School Inspector, North Bay, organized a school section in order that a public school might be opened if deemed desirable. Later it was found that almost all the pupils were Roman Catholics and there seemed a doubt as to whether the school, if organized, would be a public school or a separate school. Mr. Brown, therefore, took no further steps toward organizing a public school until it would become definitely known whether a school could be organized, and, if so, whether it would be a public or a separate school. Since there was already a school in operation from May 1st to September 30th, it would not seem advisable to take any steps toward the opening of a school at the present time. The Department of Education, however, will be pleased to give support in the form of grants to one school if the people of the area will, in turn, give the school some support and assure the Department that there will be a worth-while attendance throughout the year.\n\nI shall be pleased, therefore, if through your officials some attention will be given to the matter during the coming months, and if some further information can be given to us as September 1st draws near.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJ.

Sutherland, Esq.,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\n[Signature]\nChief Inspector.\nToronto, April 12th, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant having reference to the proposed school for Bear Island.\n\nAt midsummer, 1934, Dr. J.B.

The Department of Education, however, will be pleased to give support in the form of grants to one school if the people of the area will, in turn, give the school some support and assure the Department that there will be a worth-while attendance throughout the year.\n\nI shall be pleased, therefore, if through your officials some attention will be given to the matter during the coming months, and if some further information can be given to us as September 1st draws near.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJ.

Also time elapsed from April 15 (the usual opening date for Bear Island school) until actual date of opening should be...\nSt. Elizabeth's Church\nTemagami, Ontario\n\ncourse be made up, before the end of the school year.\n\nI shall await your advice, before announcing the date at which classes will start.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Rev.)

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nBear Island,\nLake Temagami, Ont.,\nJuly 26th, 1943\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFor years His Majesty's Canadian Government placed someone in charge of the school-house here, and was paid the sum of $20.00 a year. William Pishato, now a very old man and destitute, looked after this for 12 years after Old John Turner died 13 years ago. It was always that way until Mr. J.A. Marleau became Indian Agent. It was then stated that if any repair work was to be done to the school, this was to be paid separately, and the bill to be sent to the Indian Agent. I would like to know, as chief, why the said Indian Agent has cut this off, as he has done with most everything.\n\nTake the old and destitute people for example. They get only $4.84 a month to live. I would ask you who could possibly live on such a pittance. Please let me hear from you at your earliest, and believe me to remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nJOHN TWAIN, CHIEF.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 28, 1943.\n\nEX'D.\nA.\n\nMr. J.A. Marleau, Indian Agent, Sturgeon Falls, Ont.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Department has now purchased Bear Island it has occurred to me that possibly we should operate the school on a regular ten-month basis, rather than as a seasonal school only. I should appreciate having your comments on this suggestion.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of September 28th concerning Bear Island Seasonal school. Your idea of operating this school on a regular ten-month basis is a very good one, although I do not think it could be put into practise immediately.\n\nIt has been the custom for the past years for all the Temagami Indians, with the exception of a few old people, to move to Temagami for the winter months. Therefore, the matter had better be left in abeyance until we see what attitude these Indians will take now that they own a reserve. I will discuss it with them the first time I am up that way.\n\nJ.

Since starting school April 24th, I have received one cheque, for the sum of $48.87, and I would like them thrown up. I hope insurance to pay, will have to make a trip to N Bay late this month for medical attention. Here, plus a few more debts gathered up, will come close to $10.00, and I could use some of my back pay. This job teaching school is not attractive, at best, and the Department's attitude in this way makes it hardly bearable. If they aren't satisfied with any work, I'll quit pay day of any week, gladly\u2014all they have to do is let me know.\n\nEveryone is fine up here\u2014no sickness or present.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am attaching hereto Reverend J. J. Delaney's letter of July 5th in connection with his salary as teacher of the Bear Island Seasonal School.\n\nOne can hardly blame Father Delaney for his attitude, his cheque has been held up every year for the first three or four months. I would be obliged if it could be forwarded more promptly.\n\nJ.A. Marleau,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 11, 1945.\n\nWITH CHEQUE\n\nMr. J. A. Marleau, Indian Agent,\nSturgeon Falls, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to payment of the salary of Father Delaney. I regret that there has been some delay in this office and I now enclose cheque No. T 003428 for $118.58, which covers his salary from May 9 to June 15, inclusive.\n\nThe cheque for $48.87, which he mentions in his letter, was in payment of his services from April 24 to May 8. At the end of this week I will arrange to have another cheque sent to him for the period June 15 to July 15.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDiocese of Sault Ste.

He would only be available when\nthe University examinations shall have finished.\n\nIn the event of such a proposal being agreeable, what\nwould his salary be, including board allowance or exemption\nfrom income tax etc.\n\nWhen I know these things, I shall be in a better\nposition to propose the name of a suitable teacher.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n+ A.H. Ryan\nBishop of Sault Ste Marie\nOttawa, March 13, 1946.\n\nDear Bishop Dignan:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant, it is noted that Father Delaney will not be in charge of the Temagami School during the coming summer.\n\nWe would be prepared to accept the services of a seminarian and would allow him salary at the rate of $100.00 a teaching month, plus bonus. I presume that the amount paid would constitute the total amount of his earnings for 1945, and consequently he could complete a TD 1A form. As the total paid him would be less than $660.00, there would be no income tax.

Many thanks.\n\nThings are going well with me at the University\nhere. I was able to pass the Christmas exams all right, and am not\ntoo fearful of the finals in May. I shall be through here on May\n24th, and, should it meet with your approval, plan to open the\nBear Island School on Monday, June 2. Will this opening date be\nsatisfactory?\n\nHow is the building situation up North. I hope\nthat it has improved and that you may carry out your plans as\nregards the school. It must be annoying for you not to be able to\nget the things done that you wish to do because of scarcities of\nall kinds. Should things have improved, could I also hint that a\nlittle cabin beside the school would be most welcome and desirable\nfor the teacher. As you know from your regular visits to the Island,\nliving accommodations there are very limited and not too desirable.\nAnything that you might be able to do in this respect would be\nmuch appreciated. I received word a short while ago that a pump\norgan would be donated to the school, so we should have musical\nlittle Indians after this summer at least.\n\nI also have been considering a gardening project\nin connection with the school, so that the children could be trained\nto take an interest in gardening and have such later on when they\nsettle down. However, will have to see if I can find a patch of\nground not too rocky, and not too far from the school. But, I\nhave kept you long enough from your work.

I trust I completed them properly.\n\nMay I request that you consider increasing the salary allowed for teaching the school here. The prices charged for room and board are very high here, and since a cabin has not yet been built for the teacher, I am forced to pay whatever is charged. As a result, my summer work is not quite as remunerative as it could be.\n\nThis summer I also have the additional responsibility of the medical supplies and the consequent extra work as the emergency medical attendant. Although, as a medical student, I enjoy such work, yet it does take up a portion of my extra time after school.\n\nLast summer we were able to complete the equivalent of a standard school year's work in the four month in which our school was opened. I was pleased to learn this spring that four of my former pupils, who attended a regular separate school during the winter, were promoted an extra grade because of these few months of hard work. I hope this summer, with the added experience that I have, to try to do even better. To help towards this end I took a course in child psychology at university last winter. We shall soon see if the psychology is worth much.\n\nI trust that you will give my request due consideration and I shall be very grateful for an increase, should you see fit to give it to me.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n$50\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER\n\nRe: Temagami (Bear Island) Indian Bay School #439\n\nMr. Thomas A.

Therefore I would not recommend the re-opening of the Garden Village Day School.

In Mr. McGuire's letter he states that he is in the employment of the Department as school teacher and medical attendant on the Bear Island Indian Reserve, located in Lake Timagami, and the nearest Justice of the Peace is about seventeen miles away. Would you be good enough to let us have your request for this appointment, if it is considered that the services of a Justice of the Peace are necessary on this particular Indian Reserve. Upon receipt of this information, the matter will receive consideration, and be submitted to the Honourable the Attorney General for his approval, or otherwise.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSgd. Hugh H.

However, we will have one or two vacancies in January in our day schools. With your qualifications, you could probably qualify for a position as a welfare teacher. Naturally, we have on file the recommendations received from Mr. Maclean concerning your work on the Bear Inland Reserve. If you would be interested in a position as welfare teacher, I would recommend that you advise me of this fact as soon as possible. It is felt that, while vacancies do not exist at the present time for assistant Indian agents, you can best prepare yourself by getting further experience with the Indians. One of the most suitable ways of doing this is by teaching them as several of our superintendents have had experience as teachers.

Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI am writing concerning the Indian Day School opened each summer for the Indian children of the Bear Island Reserve in this Sturgeon Falls Agency.\n\nFor the past three summers I have been employed by your department as teacher and medical attendant for the island. As the only resident representative of the Department, my duties have been many and varied, and oftentimes onerous. I have been called upon to settle everything from family quarrels to epidemics. I have always tried to give a full measure of satisfaction.\n\nMy purpose in writing is to seek a more satisfactory adjustment in my salary. I have been re-appointed to the task for this coming summer, and I am grateful for your continued confidence in me. At the same time, my summer earnings are very necessary for the continuance of my medical course. I have had to secure leave of absence from University this year because I could not make enough during the past summer.\n\nBecause of lack of living quarters, I have had to rent a cabin in which to live while on the Island. Food prices are exceptionally high because of the extra water transportation. These combined with other factors tend appreciably to reduce my net savings.\n\nMay I further mention that my training in applied psychology has enabled me to work with the Indians with a minimum of friction. My medical training has cut down appreciably the work of the Indian doctor, Dr. Arnold. In fact, the times I have sought his aid have been few.\n\nI am at present employed by the H.E.F.C., at La cave, as camp purchasing agent and doctor. They are paying me $236.00 per month. I shall be very pleased to return to Bear Island this summer and for the next 4 or 5 summers, if you can make the position more attractive, financially.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nThos. A. McGuire, B.A.\n25th January, 1949.\n\nMr. J.A. Marleau,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nSturgeon Falls, Ontario.\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter just received from Mr. McGuire, who has taught Bear Island Seasonal School during the past three summers.\n\nPlease let me have your comments on the contents of this letter.\n\nI may say that we might be able to give him a small increase in salary and also allow rent for the cabin in which he resides. We would not be able to allow him the amount mentioned in the last paragraph of his letter.\n\nPP/ST Attach.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nSturgeon Falls, January 27, 1949.\n\nLt.

We sincerely appreciate the good work you have done in the past at Bear Island but could not pay you the $236.00 a month which you are at present receiving from the H. E. P. C. It was our intention to offer you a salary of $160.00 a teaching month during the next summer. Could we please hear from you as to whether you will be able to accept this salary, as we have had several applications from university students interested in these summer schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

McGuire, former teacher at the school, which is self-explanatory.\n\nOn March 30, I wrote to Mr. McGuire, asking him to have Reverend Moore send in his application in writing, upon receipt of which same would be forwarded with Mr. McGuire's letter to the Department.\n\nThe question of appointment is left to the decision of the Department, however Reverend Moore's application will be forwarded when it is received.\n\nJ.

Marleau,\nSuperintendent,\nSturgeon Falls Indian Agency,\nSTURGEON FALLS, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Marleau:\n\nI wish to request leave of absence from the Bear Island Seasonal School for this coming season. I am at present employed by the Hydro, at a salary considerably higher than the Department can offer me. Since it is my purpose to make as much as possible for my return to school next Fall, I am sure you will understand my reason for wishing to continue with them until Fall. I shall miss Bear Island and the pleasant relationship which has existed with you and your department. I sincerely hope that my application for re-appointment for the 1950 season will be favourably considered.\n\nMay I recommend at this time the appointment of the Rev. R. W. Moore of Timagami to succeed me on the Island. He is definitely interested in teaching this summer, and I am certain he can handle the job to the advantage of the Indian children. He plans to live on the Island this summer, and I think the arrangement would be ideal. I shall be only too pleased to assist him in any way in getting things organized.\n\nI am certain that the coming school season will be a successful one, and that the new incumbent will prove an asset both culturally and spiritually to the Indians. In closing, let me again express the appreciation I feel for the consideration and co-operation I have always received from you and the Indian Affairs' Branch.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nThos.

The return also shows that the school was open for ten days during the month of May. Under these circumstances, the Department considers that the half month's salary which was allowed is ample for the period the school was open during that month. I might add that it was through oversight that she was allowed a full month's salary for May, 1928, and May, 1929.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell F.

Ferrier,\nSuperintendent Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour unlocked for letter of Oct. 21st was duly received and contents noted. Many thanks for same.\n\nMay say am not now expecting any special consideration from Dept. of Indian Affairs since my application for a position in an Indian Day School was overlooked when a vacancy occurred on a nearby Reserve to Sudbury beginning of current year and preference was given a teacher who had only served Dept. a few terms.\n\nAnother injustice: When placed in charge of Bear Island School spring of 1928 was advised Term would be from May 1st, condition that teacher should be ready to go to the Island soon as possible after navigation opened on Lake Temagami. I rushed up spring of 1929 found no regular boat making daily trip was obliged to hire special for which I paid $10. Enclosed please find receipt for same.\n\nIt was a well known fact that navigation on Lake Temagami was late spring of 1930. Was advised Navigation Co. sent first boat to Bear Island Sat. May 11th, second boat May 15th I arrived at Temagami next day found no boat making the trip that day and was again obliged to hire a special launch.\nTrust you see that it was practicably impossible for me to have opened school less one day sooner than I did. Yet when I received my pay Cheque my salary for said month was curtailed $42.50.\n\nDoubtless such treatment had never been meted a teacher in the history of the Bear Island School and it was my twenty-first year in the service of the Department.\n\nAgain thanking you for your letter\n\nI am,\n\nMost respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM. D. [Last Name]\nOttawa, November 20, 1931.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, relative to your teaching services at the Bear Island (Temogami) Indian Summer School, and the amount of salary you received for the month of May, 1930.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you only left Sudbury to proceed to the school on May 15, 1930, and the school was opened on Friday May 16th. The return which you forwarded showing attendance, days taught, etc., for that month shows that the school was open for only ten days. Under these circumstances, the Department considered that a half month's salary, which was allowed, was ample remuneration for the period the school was open during that month.\n\nI regret that it will not be possible to reimburse you for the amount you paid for a special boat to take you to the school in May, 1929, as the Auditor General would take exception to the payment of an account which has been outstanding for so long. I am returning the receipted account for special boat hire which you forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMiss Jean McDermott,\nSudbury,\nOnt.\n\nRussell T.

In view of the recent orders for strict economy, the Department is unable to provide any increase in salary over that allowed her for her services last summer.

Will you please see that this is forwarded as quickly as possible as Father O'Neill is in need of it to live.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. A. Marleau,\nIndian Agent.\n\nT. K. L.

However, I regret that due to the recent reduction in our appropriation it is only possible to provide salary for 4\u00bd months. Consequently the teacher can only be paid to September 1. I presume that the school will be closed at that date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J. A.

D. L. H.,\nSales Manager.\nThe Canadian Office & School Furniture Co., Limited\nPRESTON, ONTARIO, CANADA\n\nManufacturers of\nThe New \"Ball-Bearing\" School Furniture\nAwarded the Silver Medal at the Paris Universal Exposition; the highest award given on School Furniture.\n\nIt Stands To-Day Above Criticism, the Standard of the World\n\nB. B. Automatic Single Desk\n\nThe title, Canadian Office & School Furniture Co., is synonymous with accuracy, desirability and honesty of construction. The manufacturers have never inflicted the public with experiments. For years they have been masters of perfect mechanism. The New \"Ball-Bearing\" School Furniture embodies essential principles that are made possible by experience and expert construction, aided by the best material that the ingenuity of man can produce. Our New \"Ball Bearing\" Desk combine grace and beauty with the highest form of durability and rigidity. They embody every requirement\u2014durability, simplicity, comfort, beauty of outline, superb finish, accuracy of fittings and an absolutely, permanent, noiseless, Automatic Folding Seat.\n\nThe Desks made by The Canadian Office & School Furniture Co. are in use in all the civilized countries of the Globe, a quarter of a million in Canada alone.\n\nPatented, Manufactured and Controlled by\nThe Canadian Office & School Furniture Co., Limited\nPRESTON, ONTARIO, CANADA\nFastening of Wood and Iron\n\nBy Means of Our Combined Double Wedge and Dove-Tail Fastener\n\n(PATENTED 1898)\n\nThe accompanying cut plainly shows our exclusive method of fastening woodwork to iron. B represents upright standard. A represents the double wedge and dovetail, which slips into holes bored in the woodwork. When the wood is placed over the iron, wedge A fitting into hole D, and the back is driven downward, the wedge A forces the flange on standard firmly into the recessed groove C in wood work, thus effecting a continuous fastening throughout length of the woodwork.\n\nThe wood work of seat and top of desk is fastened to the iron in a similar manner. This is the only common sense method of putting school desks together, and we are the inventors, and have a monopoly of its use.\n\nNote the perfect tongued and grooved glued joints; we make our tongues and grooves a large size, thus giving an extra large surface for the glue to spread, thereby making the most perfect joint possible. Our method of jointing has stood the test of years.\n\nNo Keys or Bolts Used in Setting Up This Desk\n\nIn Process of Setting Up\n\nThe accompanying cut represents a \"Ball Bearing\" Automatic Double Desk with entire seat, partly set up with legs off, showing how flange and wedges on the side fasten the holes and recessed groove in the wood back. When the solid top, seat and back are driven home they wedge themselves firmly, locking all parts securely.\n\nEvery Slat Supported by the Flange, and Each Lug a Part of the Main Casting.\n\nThe Locked Book Shelf\n\nThe Locked Book Shelf is secured in place by being pushed into groove in the standard from the front, before the back of seat is placed in position. It can never be opened by mischievous boys, allowing books, pencils, etc., to fall on the floor to the great annoyance of the teacher and orderly pupils.\nFrictionside Adjustable Chair Desk\n\nIT FITS THE FIGURE\n\nThe World's Greatest and Only Perfect Adjustable School Seating\n\nIt was an infant yesterday; it is a giant today. Someone has said: \"Blessed be the man who invented sleep.\" Countless thousands will hereafter say, \"Blessed be the man who invented Adjustable School Desks, adding thereby to the health, strength and life of the human race.\" The manufacture of School Furniture is our business; we have followed it as a trade and made it our life's study. The creation of a perfect school desk is not an accident, it is a carefully thought out problem that requires brains seasoned and developed in the business to solve. Our life's service in the business, and phenomenal success therein, is an assurance that we understand every detail. In the Frictionside Adjustable Chair Desks we combine that which is most desirable in school desk construction. It is no visionary experiment, but a carefully studied development of men who are past masters in the art of school desk architecture.\n\nWe invite your study of adjustable desks, and ask your comparison of our \"development\" with the experimental desks made by other concerns. It will surely result in our favor. All the essential features of this style of desks are fully patented. Avoid infringements.\n\nStyles, Sizes and Range of Adjustment\n\nWe make two styles of Book Boxes. One that is known as the Normal Box, which has a hinged lifting lid, and the other does not have this feature, but has what is known as the Open Box\u2014that is, an open book shelf. The Normal Box is intended for the more advanced or high school pupils and is made in two sizes, as shown below.\n\n| Size of Desk Top | Range in Height of Desk | Range in Height of Chair | Age of Children designed for |\n|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Normal Lid, A Box, 30 x 26 in. | 30\u00bd in. to 23\u00bd in. | 19 in. to 18 in. | 12 years and upwards |\n| B Box, 18 x 24 in. | 30\u00bd in. to 23\u00bd in. | 19 in. to 13 in. | 11 years and upwards |\n| No. 1 Open Box | 16 x 24 in. | | |\n\nAll Measurements of Height of Desks are Taken from Lower Edge of Top of Desk Top.\n\nDesks are regularly made of first quality maple with a handsome cherry finish, but if preferred, can be made of genuine cherry at a slight additional cost.\n\nWe carry a full line of Teachers' Desks and Chairs. If interested send for our Circular which will be gladly sent on Application.\n\nTHE Canadian Office & School Furniture Co., LIMITED\n\nPRESTON, ONTARIO, CANADA\n\nJaffray Bros., Limited, Galt, Ont., Printers\nIncomparable for Ease of Operation\n\nOur Double Desks have entire seats or separate seats, and with the \"Ball-Bearing\" Automatic Double Desk with separate seats, each pupil can take, vacate or resume his seat without disturbing his neighbor or obstructing the aisle. No sliding back and forth in this seat. The pupils do not slide into the aisle before they rise up as in other seats. Some manufacturers of the old style turn-up seats, to meet the demands for double desks with separate seats, have put in a centre leg, to make the separate seats, for which they charge you from 50 to 75 per cent extra, and which are no better than our double desk with one long or entire seat. Can you fold one of their seats in the school room without getting into the aisle first? You might as well have their entire seat, for you cannot fold their double seat with separate seats; they are not practical. The convenience of this seat is acceptable in singing, breathing, reading or enthusiasm, where a large number of the pupils are engaged simultaneously.\n\nOur arrangement virtually gives both occupants of a double desk a separate seat. Also more room with less floor space than any other desk made.\n\nWe also make a Double Desk with an Entire Seat which is less expensive.\n\nOur New Desk Top Joint\n\nThis represents a section of our school desk tops showing the double wedge joint we are now using, which on account of the extra glue surface obtained and the wedging of the wood together makes a joint fully seventy-five per cent stronger than the old plain joint still in general use.\n\nGuard against trouble with joints of tops opening up by purchasing our school desks.\nSizes and Dimensions of Desks\n\n| Single Seats and Desks | Double Seats and Desks |\n|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Size | Height of Seat Inches | Height of Top Inches | Width of Top Inches | Length Inches | Floor Space Inches | Age Accommodated | Size | Height of Seat Inches | Height of Top Inches | Width of Top Inches | Length Inches | Floor Space Inches | Age Accommodated |\n| Normal | 1 | 17 | 28\u00bd | 16 | 24 | 28 | Adults | Normal | 1 | 17 | 39 | 16 | 40 | 28 | Adults |\n| High School | 2 | 15\u00bc | 27 | 16 | 24 | 27 | 16 to 20 | High School | 2 | 16 | 27\u00bd | 16 | 40 | 27 | 16 to 20 |\n| Grammar | 3 | 14\u00be | 26\u00be | 14 | 21 | 26 | 12 to 16 | Grammar | 3 | 15 | 25\u00be | 14 | 38 | 26 | 12 to 16 |\n| 1st Intermediate | 4 | 13\u00be | 26\u00bc | 14 | 21 | 26 | 12 to 16 | 1st Intermediate | 4 | 14 | 24\u00be | 14 | 38 | 26 | 12 to 16 |\n| 2nd Intermediate | 5 | 12\u00bd | 23\u00be | 12 | 19 | 22 | 8 to 12 | 2nd Intermediate | 5 | 13 | 22\u00bd | 12 | 36 | 22 | 8 to 12 |\n| Primary | 6 | 11\u00bd | 20\u00bd | 12 | 19 | 21 | 5 to 8 | Primary | 6 | 12 | 20\u00be | 12 | 36 | 21 | 5 to 8 |\n\nFlush Top Ink Wells\n\nSupplied with All of Our Desks\n\nNICKEL PLATED\n\nOur Ink Bottle is securely locked in place.

The shield protects the seat in front from being marred or rubbed by the occupant of desk in rear. Boys cannot place a pin in their shoes and \"electrify\" the studious pupil in front and neither can they fold the seat down when once up. The shield braces the desk latterly, supporting the castings where the leverage is the greatest when leaning against the side of the desk.\n\nThere is no uncertainty in dealing with us.

LIMITED\n\nPRESTON, ONTARIO, CANADA\nThe Ball Bearing Combination Adjustable School Desk\n\nThe Ball Bearing Combination Adjustable School Desk is the Success of the Times\n\nOf all the improvements that have thronged the last decade of school room advancement, the modern Adjustable School Desk is conceded to be the most far reaching in its effects, giving to the pupil lasting health, strength and vigor. As the ordinary adjustable school desk is to the old fashioned spine distorters so long used in schools, so is the modern Ball Bearing Combination Adjustable Desk to all other adjustable desks made\u2014supreme.\n\nIt is unnecessary to enumerate the advantages of an adjustable desk. They are too self-evident to every intelligent thinking person. To put an eight year old boy into a suit designed to fit a boy of sixteen wouldn't probably please him but it certainly does him no particular injury. To put the same boy into a school desk that is made to fit a larger boy than he is for months and even years would result in inevitable injury. If clothes are made to fit isn't it much more important that desks should also be made to conform to the size of pupils? The leading physicians of the world are united in favor of adjustable desks, and your study of their merits will convince you of their necessity.\n\nSchool desk building requires brains. Take the best of material, but unless you add the Q. S (quantum sufficit), as the physicians' prescriptions say, of intelligent brains, you can never make a perfect school desk.\n\nWe are believers in this proposition; we are convinced of the time-honored maxim originating new successes instead of feebly imitating the past. We believe, therefore, in our Ball Bearing Combination Adjustable Desk, we have achieved the greatest success of the world in school desk construction. It is no accidental success, but the result of years of painstaking, brain using study and advancement.\n\nWe ask your study of adjustable desks and the advantages claimed for them. We invite your comparison of our Ball Bearing Combination Adjustable Desk with any other adjustable desk made. We fear no comparison. We are too great for imitators, too strong for rivalry.\n\nOUR GOODS ARE THE STANDARD OF THE WORLD\n\nThe Canadian Office & School Furniture Co.\nPreston, Ontario LIMITED\nBall Bearing Combination Adjustable Desk\nExplained in Detail\n\nNo Cogwheels. No Ratchets.\nNo Unwieldy Levers or Appliances.\n\nFigure 2 shows the desk both top and seat extended to full height. Either desk top, or the back and seat, can be adjusted to desired height independently of each other.\n\nNote in standard the heads of two bolts. The bolts are for the purpose of clamping parts together. There is a main upright standard fitted with grooves, in which run the lugs or projections on castings of the desk top, also back and seat.\n\nTo raise or lower the desk top, loosen top bolt on each standard (right and left) and adjust the top to desired height. Then secure bolts tightly and everything is as secure as though made in one piece, owing to the peculiar construction of the grooves or corresponding lugs, or projections, spoken of before. The back and seat adjust together, that is, they raise and lower together. To make adjustment, loosen lower bolts on standards, adjust to desired height, fasten the bolts, thereby clamping parts together, and everything is accomplished securely and well.\n\nAn important item. As desk top is lowered, it moves on an incline, bringing it closer to the occupant of the accompanying seat. The seat and back also works the same way, i.e., as it is lowered it moves on an incline, bringing it closer to the desk in front. A necessary and very important feature, and to be found only in our Adjustable Desk.\n\nStudy this point well. The ordinary adjustable desk simply moves up and down in a vertical way. To adjust a desk and seat properly it is just as important that their relative distance should be changed as their height should be changed. A small pupil requires less room than a large one and the seat should consequently be closer to the desk and vice versa.\n\nFigure 3 shows desk top lowered for the pupil using it, while the seat in front for a larger pupil is raised to full height. This, of course, could be reversed, the desk at a high point for a large pupil and the seat in front lowered for a smaller pupil.\n\nFigure 2 shows both top and back, and seat extended to full length.\nOur Patent Measuring Gauge\n\nThe illustrations show our measuring gauge in various forms. In figure 4 we give merely a sectional view showing working parts. 'A' represents main standard, which as you will see in another illustration, is firmly fastened to a metal base which enables the gauge to stand alone, which is a very great convenience in adjusting desks.\n\n'B' is a supplementary standard which, by means of cog wheels inside of casting (E), is raised or lowered as the arm (C) is adjusted to size of pupil. When the arm (C) is adjusted to proper height the top of standard B is the proper height for lower edge of desk top.\n\n'C' is the arm by which measurements are taken. The pupil sits in chair with feet resting on floor. Measurement is taken on lower side of pupil's limb just behind the knees as shown in figure 7. When measurement is ascertained the outer edge of seat should be the height indicated by height of arm C. The height of the desk for the pupil measured should be that indicated by the extreme height of standard B, measuring the lower edge of desk lid.\n\n'D' is a thumb screw which holds the gauge in position while the desk is being adjusted.\n\n'E' is a metal frame containing cog wheels which turn on cogs in standards A and B. The arrangement of these wheels is such that standard B is raised 1\u00bc inches for every inch that arm C is raised, that is, for every inch that the seat is raised or lowered the desk top should be correspondingly raised or lowered 1\u00bc inches.\n\nIn figure 5, we show gauge extended almost to its full height as it stands on floor when measuring. Figure 5 shows gauge folded compactly for pupil's use. Folds in this way it occupies a space of 18 x 3 inches, which readily admits of its being placed in teacher's desk and kept under lock and key free from the reach of mischievous boys. This is the only gauge that folds compactly, permitting it to be securely put away in an ordinary drawer. Other gauges are unwieldy affairs, unsuited in every way for the purpose for which they were intended, awkward to handle and difficult to understand. Our gauge is compact, convenient to use, and so simple that any one can adjust desks perfectly without any extended explanations, which are necessary with other gauges and which none but an expert can understand.\n\nThe Use of a Measuring Gauge\n\nThe use of a measuring gauge is an indispensable adjunct to adjustable desks. Without it the adjustment of desks is mere guess work and, moreover, it is much more convenient to use the gauge. Without the gauge the desk and seat must be adjusted without opening the same, which is very inconvenient, as the work must then be done in school house, creating much confusion and inconvenience. With a gauge the teacher goes through the room taking the measurement of each pupil, as shown in figure 7. The teacher makes a record of the size of each pupil, which she hands to the janitor and, after school hours, he takes the list of measurements and, with our patent measuring gauge, adjusts each seat and desk, as shown in figures 8 and 9, at a proper height from the floor, something which is utterly impossible to do without the use of our gauge.\n\nDo not for a moment consider the purchase of adjustable desks that are not adjusted by means of the measuring gauge. An adjustable desk without a gauge is of about as much use as would be a wagon without wheels.\n\nAdjustable desks should be in use in every school room where there is any regard for health, but an adjustable desk that is not adjustable by means of a gauge, thereby insuring its being automatically correct, is a delusion and a sham and should be avoided. An incorrect adjustment is bad or worse than no adjustment at all. Our gauge is our own device and can not be had with any other desks but those made by us. It is endorsed by the leading physicians as being anatomically correct and with its use desks are perfectly adjusted to fit the pupil.\nAdjustment of \"Ball-Bearing\" Combination Adjustable Desk\n\nFigure 7 shows a pupil occupying desk and teacher taking proper measurement for adjustment. As explained elsewhere when gauge arm is adjusted to proper height for seat, the top of gauge is the height for the edge of desk next to pupil.\n\nThe teacher takes the measurement (taking but an instant for each pupil) and makes record of proper adjustments. After school hours the janitor makes adjustment according to the measurement given him.\n\nIn all other adjustable desks operated without a measuring gauge, desk must be adjusted during school hours with pupil occupying it, a very inconvenient arrangement, creating untold confusion and inconvenience. Moreover, without a gauge the adjustment is merely guess work. With our gauge the adjustment is anatomically correct. No confusion in school hours, no distraction from studies.\n\nFigure 8 shows janitor adjusting top of desk. Observe that the lid is on a level with top of gauge. The adjustment may be supposed to have been made and he is tightening bolts, clamping upright standard and desk top castings together. When bolts are loosened the top may be moved up and down very easily, but when they are tightened the castings are as securely fastened and as rigid as though cast in one piece. Note that for desk top adjustment, the top bolts are operated\u2014one on each standard (right and left).\nFigure 9 shows a janitor adjusting back and seat. The back and seat raise or lower together and by releasing the lower bolts on standards (right and left) the adjustment can be easily made by raising or lowering the back as shown in cut.\n\nAfter proper adjustment is made, tighten bolts securely and the parts are practically one piece. They cannot be moved or changed from the position in which they are locked without unlocking the bolts, no matter what pressure is brought to bear.\n\nRange of Adjustment\n\nThe Desks are Made in Three Sizes and Range in Adjustment as Follows:\n\nNo. 1. Seat 18 inches to 15\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches from floor. Top of desk 29 inches to 25\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches from floor. Size of desk top 23\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) x 16 inches. Can be used by children from eleven years of age upwards.\n\nNo. 2. Seat 15\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches to 13\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) inches from floor. Top of desk 26 inches to 22\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches from floor. Size of desk top 20\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches x 14 inches. Can be used by children from seven years of age upwards.\n\nNo. 3. Seat 13 inches to 11\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches from floor. Top of desk 22\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches to 19\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches from floor. Size of desk top 18\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) x 12 inches. Can be used by children from five to twelve years of age.\nConstruction of the\n\n\"Ball-Bearing\" Hinge Dissected\n\nTHREE STEEL BALLS IN EVERY HINGE\n\nCosts no more than Ordinary Iron Hinge with Makeshift Buffer\n\nAccept no Substitute\n\nFigure 1 represents the seat arm showing \"socket\" which fits over the \"ball\" on Figure 2 (which represents upright and standard). This constitutes a \"ball and socket,\" or, as it is termed by some, a \"trunnion joint\" hinge. When the seat arm (Figure 1) is fastened over the standard (Figure 2) the entire weight rests on the ball and socket joint\u2014none whatever on the bolt, it being merely used to secure the seat arm and standard together. On both Figures 1 and 2 you will observe two iron lugs which are the stops when the seat is folded down or up.\n\nFigure 3 illustrates reverse side of seat arm showing inclined grooves in which three bicycle balls run. Figure 4 is a cap which fits over grooves in Figure 3. You will observe that cap 4 is grooved to correspond with Figure 3, and when they are fastened together they form a tube larger in the middle than at either end through which the balls roll as seat is moved up or down. Figure 5 represents the reverse side of Figure 4. Notice that the face of Figure 5 is \"dished\" or concave in shape. When hinges are put together a tempered steel washer, in Figure 6 fits over the dish in Figure 5. The different parts are then bolted together with bolt shown in Figure 6. The tall piece to caps 4 and 5 passes through hole in standard (2) maintaining both cap and standard in one stationary position, the seat arm moving between them.\nTeachers' Desks\n\nThese desks the aim was to bring forth something that would combine convenience, practicability and beauty and in this our efforts have been eminently successful, for no other line of Teachers' Desks on the market begins to compare with these desks in these points. In the manufacture of these desks only the best material on the market is used and the most skilled help employed, and the result is a general ensemble of excellence hitherto unmatched by manufacturers whose first thought was cheapness instead of quality. These desks are guaranteed and warranted in every way, and purchasers can safely rely upon their being as represented and according to specifications.\n\nIn...\n\nDesigning\n\nNo. 38.

Co., Limited\n\nC.E.M.\n\nJ. M. T. VALVES ARE USED FOR ALL PURPOSES\u2014FOR SALE EVERYWHERE\nSuperior Cast-Steel Church and School Bells\n\nThe James Morrison Brass Mfg. Co.\nLIMITED.\n93-97 Adelaide Street West,\nTORONTO.\n\nPoor Copy\n\"Is the Superior Cast-Steel Bell Suitable\nfor Church Purposes?\"\n\nThis is a question that is not by any means as simple as it may seem on the surface, by reason of the endless variety of natural conditions that must be taken into account in order to determine what bell is best adapted to the particular requirements of each individual case. We recommend the purchase of a superior cast-steel bell only when the circumstances demand it; and do not do so from merely mercenary considerations, but from a long, practical experience gained through many years of observation.\n\nWe have found that there are possibilities for small churches, particularly the case with church bells, in which we have had occasion to supply. In such cases, the demand is usually for a small bell, and not for the large, heavy bells required by the larger churches.\n\nThe superiority of our cast-steel bells is evident from the fact that they are more durable than any other type of bell. They are also less expensive than other types of bells, and require less maintenance.\n\nThe lasting power of our bells will amply justify their purchase, and before making what is expected to be a permanent investment, the church should consider the following points:\n\n1. The size of the bell is determined by the size of the church and the number of people who attend services.\n\n2. The weight of the bell is determined by the size of the church and the number of people who attend services.\n\n3. The quality of the bell is determined by the quality of the materials used in its manufacture.\n\n4. The price of the bell is determined by the size of the church and the number of people who attend services.\n\n5. The durability of the bell is determined by the quality of the materials used in its manufacture.\n\n6. The maintenance of the bell is determined by the quality of the materials used in its manufacture.\n\n7. The appearance of the bell is determined by the quality of the materials used in its manufacture.\n\n8. The sound of the bell is determined by the quality of the materials used in its manufacture.\n\n9. The cost of the bell is determined by the quality of the materials used in its manufacture.\n\n10. The satisfaction of the customer is determined by the quality of the materials used in its manufacture.\n\nThe above points should be considered before purchasing a bell.\nmore care in the finishing of the bell and its mountings, and, finally, to our extra care in its test before allowing it to leave our hands. We do not work by guess, and with our long experience as bell-founders cannot be tempted to take chances. A bell that comes safely through the first month of its use successfully has given a hopeful promise of endurance, while in one that has lasted a year the chances of breaking are so trifling as to scarcely be taken into account. As our warranty follows every stroke of one of our bells for five years, the question of any risk whatever in buying one of our superior cast-steel bells is entirely removed.\n\nSchool Bells.\n\nAs an unfailing incitement to punctuality, a stimulus to the naturally prompt, an efficient urge to the tardy, the school bell cannot be overrated, and in this particular no clock can approach it in efficiency. What the ship's bell is to the crew of a well-ordered vessel, the school bell is to the \"crew\" when it assembles; and its ringing at regular intervals, especially in rural districts, is a recognized force on the side of punctuality. Clocks constantly vary\u2014many do not strike, and little children cannot tell the time by them; but when the peal of the well-known bell rings out, big and little, young and older, all set their faces schoolward, and punctuality becomes the rule and not the exception. In villages, or where the population is more or less scattered, the value of a lively, far-reaching bell upon the school-house cannot be overestimated, and for such service nothing can be had better than one of our superior cast-steel bells.\n\nHow Far Can a Bell be Heard?\n\nThis is, of course, a very important question, but one to which a general answer only can be made, as the natural conditions governing the transmission of sound must vary in every case. In a hilly or rolling country a bell cannot be heard half as far as on a plain or flat district. Sound will travel much further up and down\nA valley than over the hill range that enclose such valley. Where the regular belfry or room, in which the bell is hung is lower than surrounding buildings or groves of trees, its sound will be greatly circumscribed. Frequently bells have but small window- or openings and inside the lower boards so close together as to almost stifle the sound those very openings were designed to send abroad. Bells can be heard for a long distance across lakes or sheets of water, but it is a popular error to conclude that the distance a bell can be heard is exclusively a question of weight, and that a bell weighing 1000 pounds can be heard twice as far as one of 500 pounds. The large bell does not furnish anything like double the resonant surface of the smaller one, and, of course, the volume of sound is greatly diminished by such surface. As has already been noted, in the large bell we gain those deep, solemn tones which are impossible in smaller ones; but from small bells, with their sharp, penetrating tones, great sound-carrying power is attainable. A small bell hung out of all just proportion to the performance of a 1000-pound bell in a church-tower comparatively close at hand, and such instances constantly lead to unfair comparison. A sharp, shrill sound penetrates to a long distance; when shrill noise is demanded, but when the quality of that shrilling tone be loud, then enchantment cannot be borne from distance. Great sound-spreaders, decidedly a large bell, as without fire and consequent weight, these features are quite unattainable. When bells are stationary, and struck or tolled, they will not, as a rule, be heard half as far as when rung by swinging, for the reason that the swinging motion, by constantly throbbing the mouth of the bell upward, scatters its tones far abroad, and at the same time superior to those tones a fixed bell.\nSturgeon Falls,\nSecretary Department Indian Affairs April 23\n1909\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI will build the school on Ross Island according to plans and specifications shown for the price of nineteen hundred and seventy-five dollars.\n\nYou obediently,\n\nJohn Parker\nBox 8 Sturgeon Falls\nI hereby agree to build according to plans and specifications shown school at Bear Island Lemagami for the sum of $1,440.50 One thousand four hundred and forty dollars.\n\nGeo Sutherland\nSturgeon Falls\nApril 19th 1909\nApril 26th, 1909.\n\nJ.

O. Cockburn\n385049\nSturgeon Falls\nOntario\n\nDear sir,\n\nIn previous years we have been holding services in the Fire Ranger Hall, but it has been found unsatisfactory. I find that the school house is the most desirable place. Therefore, I desire your permission to hold services in the school house.\n\nNoting that this will meet with your favour, I remain\nyour obedient servant\nC. A. McGillivray\nPresbyterian Missionary, Bear Island.\nOttawa, June 26, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant enclosing a communication sent you by the Presbyterian Missionary at Bear Island applying for permission to hold services in the school building at that place.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department would like to have a special report from you on this application. I may state that it does not approve of school buildings being used for other than school purposes as a general thing. In this instance, as the Indians for whom the school was put up are Roman Catholics, it is a question whether it would be advisable to grant the Missionary's request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGeo. F. Cockburn, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSturgeon Falls, Ont.\nDear sir,\n\nI am just after having a consultation with a person who has received the information from your department that the possibility of the Presbyterian missionary receiving permission to hold services in the school house is at least doubtful. Now, sir, I desire to say a few words on this subject.\n\nNow, to come to the point you desire further particulars before you can grant permission. These particulars sir, I will give you. I am here representing the Presbyterian church in Canada. I have the welfare of my country at heart. I am here to teach neither dogma nor creed; but am, to instil into the minds of these people a high conception of citizenship. Candidly, I was surprised to receive such a letter from this department.\nI am here to teach men to be worthy of the name Canadian. The schoolhouse has been placed here by the Canadian government for educational purposes. It is an institution which aims essentially at development in every sense. What reasons you may have against me holding a service there once a week is something that I am unable to comprehend. What is it that the Indians don't desire it? This because the Indians don't desire it? This is no argument and is not a fact at any rate. I am sure in saying that there is no rational argument that can stand against it. Since I am a student\u2014since I have come here for the summer to work for both church and state and I at least expected that I would have the government of my country to back me up. I was perfectly willing to request your permission that is business, but when it comes to you asking for further particulars I am at a loss to find reasons for your action in this particular connection. This act is essential and must be done by a Christian statesman. I shall not desist from my work here even if I have to hold often\nI am grieved to think that the Dominion Government refused to make up of the greatest citizens in Ireland should fail me in this request\u2014not only this but belittle my work in the eyes of the people both permanent residents and tourists from the United States. Sir, I must investigate the matter and if you have valid reasons for hesitation (\"further particulars\") a blank refusal or am waiting to consider them shall however obey you and hold my meeting elsewhere during the summer\u2014even though I had installed an agen in the school house and made all necessary arrangement believing that my request would be favourably considered.\n\nI remain\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.R. McMillan\nRev. Missionary\nBurland\nOttawa, July 4, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo in reference to your application to Mr. Indian Agent Cockburn of Sturgeon Falls for permission to hold services in the school building on Bear Island.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that prior to the receipt of your letter above quoted the Department has had no correspondence with you on this subject. A copy of your letter above referred to is being sent to Rev. R. P. MacKay, Secretary, Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, and the Department will await his reply before giving a final decision on this application.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. R. McGillivray, Esq.,\nBear Island,\nTemagami, Ont.\nOttawa July 5, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nI beg to inform you that an application was forwarded to our agent at Sturgeon Falls from Mr T.R.McGillivray, Presbyterian Missionary at Bear Island for permission to hold services in the school house there.\n\nThe Department questioned the advisability of allowing protestant services to be held in a Roman Catholic school and before dealing with the application our agent was asked for a special report for the following reasons:\n\nAll the Indians of the Temagami band at Bear Island are shown by the census returns to be Roman Catholics. The building was put up and the school opened at the request of the Roman Catholic Mission and it has always been in charge of a teacher of that denomination.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter received from Mr McGillivray regarding his application and beg to say that he has been told that the matter has been referred to you and that the Department will await your reply before giving a final decision.\n\nYou\n\nRev. R.P.McKay,\nSecretary\nPresbyterian Foreign Missionary Society\nToronto, Ont.\nYou see the position in which Mr McGillivray's application places the Department, and it desires to avoid being a party to any religious controversy; it considers it would be in the interest of all concerned if Mr McGillivray secured some other place in which to hold his meetings.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th June last, in reference to the communication of the Presbyterian Missionary of Bear Island, applying for permission to hold services in the school building there.\n\nIn reply I beg to report that we have been at Bear Island and visited the mission as well as the different families of Indians there, and find that they appear to be all agreeable to having the school used for their purposes.\n\nI also beg to state that there is not an other building available at this place to hold services and during the summer months there are a number of Indians with their bands shipped the department be agreeable to granting the missionary request & do not think that any objection would be raised from the Indians.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\n\nChief of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nIndian Agent\nToronto July 12th, 1911.\n\nMr. D.C.

MacGillivray, re Mission services amongst the Indians of the Temagami Band in the Roman Catholic School.\n\nAs Mr. MacGillivray is a Home Missionary I have shown his letter, as well as yours, to Dr. A.S. Grant, Superintendent of our Home Mission work. We both think that your attitude is the right one. To grant Mr. MacGillivray's request would give just cause of complaint to the Roman Catholics, and put the Department in an embarrassing position. Mr. MacGillivray is not personally known to either of us but the accent of his letter does not impress us favorably. He is probably young and inexperienced and the Department will not, I hope, regard too severely the disrespectful tone of his communication.\n\nHoping you have not suffered from excessive heat,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRPM/LOB.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. R.P. Mackay\nOttawa, July 14, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 3rd instant in further reference to the application of Mr. C. R. McGillivray for permission to hold services in the school building on Bear Island I beg to say that after the receipt of your previous communication on this subject Mr. McGillivray wrote to the Department and a copy of his letter was sent to the Secretary of the Presbyterian Foreign Missionary Society. A reply has been received from that gentleman concurring in the Department's view that it would be in the interest of all concerned if Mr. McGillivray found some other place in which to hold his meetings. You will be good enough to inform Mr. McGillivray that he cannot be allowed to use the school-house any longer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeo. P.

The new foundation under one end of the building is spreading out. The cause of this is thought to be due to the walls and water dripping through the cracks between them. The building's walls also require repainting by connection with the roof to strengthen them. The walls need to be painted inside and outside.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. P.

The probable cost of these affairs equals to $500.00. The probable time to do the work seems to be by the school closed next fall. It seems to me that the condition of the foundations of the building is not very good. The work should be done as soon as possible.\n\nThe work could be done by Ojibwa carpenters who reside at New Orleans. They know the foundation which could be necessary to secure a proper frame inside close out the streets. The material could be purchased at local stores and shipped by railway to Winnipeg where it could be loaded to New Orleans. The Ojibwa carpenters could do the carpentry work by the day or they could take a contract if the material was supplied.\n\nJno. Cleverly, Secretary\n\nCh.

It appears that the ground in that vicinity has a number of springs of water. The Hudson's Bay Company recently erected a new store building which has been affected in the same manner. I think if the building was placed upon cedar posts it would overcome the difficulty created by the frost during the winter. The platform and steps outside of the building also require replacing. The work could be done by resident labour and Indians and would cost about $175.00.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa,\nOttawa, June 12, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, informing the Department of the repairs which will be necessary to the foundation of the Bear Island Summer School building, and furnishing an estimate of the cost of having the work done.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange to have cedar posts of the requisite dimensions put under the building to replace the present stone foundation which has been damaged by frost. It is thought that if the work of putting the cedar posts under the building is completed satisfactorily, it will to a very large extent overcome the difficulty which has been experienced through the heaving of the stone foundation by frost. This work should be carried out by day labour - Indians being employed as far as possible. Proper time sheets in duplicate should be kept for all labour employed. These should be certified by you and forwarded to the Department, in order that payment can be made.\n\nIt is hoped that the Indians will be able to supply the cedar posts, but, if not, please arrange for the purchase of the quantity and sizes required and forward properly certified vouchers in duplicate covering the expenditure incurred for the purpose.\n\nNo unnecessary expense should be incurred in having the above authorized work carried out. The cost should not exceed your estimate of $175 and should be lower, if possible. You may arrange to have the work done as soon as convenient.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nGeo. F.

I even wrote to the minister of Indian affairs, with that, did not do any good. The agent, Mr. Marley, said to us here last summer the school here does not belong to Indians, maybe that is the reason the Indian affairs don't want it repaired. Whoever belongs to the school should let it repaired before it falls apart. We have now loose the best teacher we ever have on account of the condition of the School here. The roof is torn and leaks badly, veranda is broken up, the foundation is rotten, on the outside it's all water and mud. I would very much if you would ask the school inspector, or some officials of the school board to come and investigate to see for yourself.\nthe condition of the school here. We cannot do anything with Indian agent or the Dept of Indian affairs, to see the school repaired, it is too bad to let it stand the way it is as it is a very good building, something should be done about it without any further delay, with kindest regards.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nChief John Truain\nOttawa, April 11th, 1947.\n\nMr. J.A.

Material and help were not available, and cement could not be procured at any cost.\n\nThe school must be raised and some of the heavy timbers replaced, also new piers or a foundation will have to be built, and a veranda and steps.\n\nThe school needs to be painted inside and outside; the interior, walls, and desks, should be cleaned and varnished. I estimate, the labour will cost approximately $100.\n\nPaint can be procured here in the wholesale, and the quantity needed, will be:\n\n- 6 gallons of White paint, at $4.75 a gal.\n- 1 gallon of varnish, at 6.27 a gal.\n- 1 gallon of turpentine, at 2.50 a gal.\n- 1 gallon of boiled oil, at 2.00 a gal.\n\nThere is no doubt, with the increase in cost of labour and material, that $100 should be added to the previous estimate submitted for the repair of the school.\n\nJ. A. Marleau,\nINDIAN AGENT.\nOttawa, April 25th, 1947.\n\nMr. J.A. Marleau, Indian Agent,\nSturgeon Falls, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd instant regarding the Bear Island School, the Department approves painting this building interiorly and exteriorly. It is noted the cost of labour will be approximately $100.\n\nYou may purchase the following paint:\n\n6 gallons of White paint @ $4.75 a gal.\n1\u00bd gallons of Varnish @ 6.27 a gal.\n1 gallon of Turpentine @ 2.50 a gal.\n1 gallon of Boiled Oil @ 2.00 a gal.\n\nWe also approve the other necessary repairs to this building and trust that you will keep the cost as low as possible.\n\nBernard F.

E.W. Gardner has been appointed to take charge of the Anglican Mission at Churchill, and in the prosecution of his work he will open a Day School for the benefit of the Indian and Half-breed children at Churchill. As the Churchill band of Indians are under Treaty No. 5., I apply for a Grant for the School which will help the Mission in the operation of the School.\n\nI enclose an order for School material which the Department will fill out and send to the Rev. E.W. Gardner, Churchill, per S.S. \"Nascopie\". The case of material to be sent to the Hudson's Bay Co., 56, McGill Street, Montreal, in June so as to be ready for shipment.\n\nMr. Gardner will need these supplies in his School work, and I hope the Department will not fail to supply the order.\n\nHoping to receive a favourable reply from you concerning a Grant towards the work of educating the Indians, of Churchill,\n\nI remain\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\nRichard James\nArchdeacon of York\nand\nSupt. of Indian Missions\nin\nHudson Bay\nTo the Officer Commanding at Prince Albert, Sask.\nRe Proposed Indian School at Fort Churchill, Man.\n\nThe missionary is paid a stated monthly sum for the months during which he actually conducts school.\n\nI beg to suggest that no action be taken in the matter of a grant until it be ascertained that a school can be conducted for the benefit of the Indians at Fort Churchill.\n\nThe Fort Churchill Band usually spend between three and four months during the summer at Fort Churchill and I beg to report that, until it can be learned definitely the number of pupils available and for what period each year these pupils would be available, I should be loath to estimate the possibility of successfully conducting a school for Indian children at Fort Churchill where a school is undoubtedly greatly needed.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSIR,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nSergt.\nIn charge Hudson's Bay Sub-District.\n\nThe Commissioner\nR.C.M.P.

This suggestion was accepted and the following articles not shown on the Trout Lake requisition, are considered necessary for the Fort Churchill school:\n\n- 1 set Wall Sheets;\n- 1 box Elementary Arithmetic, Grade 1;\n- 1 box Slates and Pencils;\n- 1 only Syllabus Physical Exercises, Manitoba.\n\nI beg to inform you that the officials of the Hudson's Bay Company at York Factory state that the S.S. \"Hudson\" will sail very early this season.

P.,\nOttawa.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. H. N. AWREY, PAYING OFFICER FOR TREATY 9, dated August 15, 1929.\n\nRev. Mr. Garret, on behalf of Chief Sampson Beardy of the Trout Lake Band, requested me to bring before the Department the question of building a new school at Trout Lake. I promised I would do so though I told him that I thought the time not yet opportune for such a concession to be granted.\n\nI told him that he should keep a proper register of the children whom he is now teaching and submit quarterly reports to the Department, when a grant would be allowed, based upon the attendance. I also told him to make a requisition for school supplies which, if not beyond reason, would be supplied.\n\nI might state that in the Trout Lake Band, there are many bright intelligent looking boys and girls, but as the parents are bush hunters, they assemble at Trout Lake, as a community, only for a short time, and then leave again for the hunting grounds. The request for a new school at present is uncalled for.\nSupplies for Mission School\nFront Lake 1930\n\n10 yards Slated Blackboard cloth\n100 Rubber tipped Pencils\n1000 Sheets Ruled fools Cap\n100 Exercise books Ruled with cloth or boards covers\n100 Canadian Readers Book 1\n1 Globe\n1 Sheet Wall Map of Canada\n1 Rotary Automatic pencil sharpener\n1 large bronze Hand bell\n10 lbs Canadian Wheeling yarn\n25 sets Steel knitting needles size 12\n1 English language Study book\n1 Union jack flag large\nA picture of His Majesties The King and Queen\nalso of His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales\n\nYours truly,\nRev Leslie Garrett Front Lake\nHudsons Bay Co.

Avey\nThe Department of Interior Affairs.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am here enclosing my request for School Supplies, as it was proposed to do last summer. We had quite a severe outbreak of flu just a few days after you left us, which prevented the from opening school before Aug 8th, but from that date until Sep 7th inclusive the children worked very well. I was teaching every day excluding Saturdays. The average daily attendance for that period was Boys 37, Girls 38.\n\nI closed school on Sep 7th on being called away to visit the Indians at Round Lake and decided not to reopen school again until next spring on account of our shortage of School supplies.\n\nWe are also very badly off for drugs this winter having nothing at all off some of the important items such as Castor oil, Cod liver oil and Aspirin. Fortunately though up to the present time the health of the band has been very good this winter.\n\nThe supplies could be shipped by rail now to Port Churchill which might be better than by boat from Montreal.\n\nWe shall be looking forward to seeing you again next summer.\n\nYours sincerely (Rev) Leslie Garrett.\n**Requisition for School Material**\n\n**Date:** March 19, 1930\n\n**For:** [Handwritten]\n\n**Agency:**\n\n**NOTE:** Teachers should secure from the Department of Education, of the Province in which the Indian School is located, a list of the text books authorized for use in the white schools.

These children attend school for only a few weeks during the summer when their parents come out to the Trout Lake post to barter their furs and spend a social time together. The Rev Leslie Barnett had them sing some patriotic songs which was done in a most creditable manner. I took a photo of the pupils but as yet cannot say anything regarding my success in this work. I hope you will see your way clear to allow Mr. Barnett the usual school grant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.M. Moore\nOttawa, September 8, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nMr. Awrey has given me the report concerning school attendance at Trout Lake during June and July last. He has suggested that a grant be given for this work, if possible.\n\nI may say that the usual practice, when Reverend gentlemen are conducting seasonal Indian day schools, is to make a small grant to the diocesan authorities when the Department is satisfied the activity is really worth while and that the results are more or less of permanent value to the Indian children. I presume that your work is under Archdeacon Faries. Does not the Archdeacon report direct to His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land, or are his activities controlled by other diocesan authorities? Mr. Awrey, in conversation, suggests that the grant go direct to you. If this is your wish in the matter, the Department will give consideration, upon receipt of a statement from you, concerning the regularity with which this seasonal summer school will be conducted, etc. I am enclosing a few day school returns, which can be used when the school is operating in future.\n\nEnclosure\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nRev.

You taught for 44 days during June and July of this year, and a cheque for $220 is being sent to the diocesan authorities.\n\nHis Lordship suggests that you report on the possibility of conducting a day school during the entire year. It is understood that a few Indians are resident at Trout Lake during the winter. You might let the Department know how many children of school age would be able to attend classes regularly if they were held throughout the year. I am sure that, when you are next reporting to His Lordship, he would also like this information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev.

As you will see by the enclosed summary of the School Returns, enclosed for the last three seasons, the attendance is keeping up very well, but we are not making the progress in the class work that is desired chiefly due to the need of a suitable building and seating for the pupils. Up to the present as you know the work has been carried on in our church, the pupils sitting in the pews and on the floor with their drill books on their knees. This makes it impossible for me to reach the majority of the children in order to oversee their work during the session.\n\nThe Indians also are convinced of the need of proper seating for their children and have been working hard this summer buying logs and preparing the lumber to erect a frame School House here on the Miss property as we understand it may be many years before they are removed to\ntheir Reservations which have not been surveyed yet\u2014 I feel quite confident that all being well by next Summer we can have all the lumber and timbers necessary. But we are seeking aid to procure Rubberoid and other materials necessary. Could you please obtain from the Department plans and an estimate for lumber required to erect a school to accommodate say 150 pupils as I am intending another year to divide the children when they are all here and take half at a session.\n\nCould you also obtain for us a grant of $1000.00 to assist us in purchasing some of the other materials necessary and to meet the high transportation costs on the same.\n\nLetter received from Rev Leslie Garrett\nShort Lake\nOnt.\n\nTo Canada Airways\nSpring Lockhart\nOnt.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing to you a letter which I received from Rev Leslie Garrett of Scott Lake for your consideration. I have referred to this matter in my report and trust you will give Mr Garrett some information as to your attitude towards his request. At any rate I hope you will have a suitable plan for a school sent to him.\n\nI am a little doubtful about schools but I am quite sure a frame building large enough to accommodate so many children could not be built for less than twenty thousand dollars. However if the project was successfully accomplished, I do think assistance in the way of a grant should be given.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.M.

Mr. Garrett for a grant of One Thousand dollars to assist him in building a new frame school large enough to accommodate say 80 pupils. He also asked me if the Department would be good enough to prepare for him as soon as possible a suitable plan for a frame building, giving him an idea of the amount of lumber required. Kindly send it to him, Trout Lake, Ont. C/o Canada Airways, Sioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nI could not give him any assurances of the above grant asked for, but told him that assistance might later be given when the scheme was well under way.\n\nThere are fully 150 bright little Indian boys and girls here during the Treaty payments, and I am informed that the majority of them are here for about four months during the warm weather. I do think that something should be done for these children who are about the brightest Indian children I meet in my work. The time is fast approaching when these people will have to look to some other vocation for their living, which is a good reason why I think some action along educational lines should be considered. Every year these children are becoming older and older without receiving the benefits of an education to fit them to become better men and women and worthy citizens of our country.\n\nx x x\n\nH. N. Awrey.\nOttawa, September 16th, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn compliance with Mr. Awrey's request, I am today forwarding you the plan for a school large enough to accommodate eighty pupils. By this plan you will observe that the architect has planned for a two-roomed school. I have asked the architect to give an estimate of the amount of material required, but he has refrained from doing so, as he claims he cannot possibly give anything like an exact estimate as he had no idea regarding the materials, etc., to be used.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.R.L.

Abery\nThe Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Abery,\n\nThe Indians are getting out logs again to put up a school building. I am writing to ask if you will send us plans for a smaller building. The plan you sent Sep 1932 provided for a two-roomed school to accommodate 80 pupils.\n\nAs the Indians are going in more for gardening out on their reservations and winter quarters, the general trend seems to be more and more to hang off after treat time from the mission.\n\nOwing also to so much of the transportation being done by plane there is somewhat less freighting for the Indians to do.\n\nSo I feel a small school say to accommodate 50 or 60 pupils would be more practicable and the Church could be used during the few weeks of rush around treaty time. Perhaps an one-room school would be most suitable under these conditions. I will be very if you would be so\ngood as to send us your advice and send us plan and estimates for a smaller building if advisable.\n\nSince you left all our people have been suffering with terrible coughs and colds which seems to be a mild form of whooping cough. One infant took pneumonia and died about a week after you left so far I have not heard of any other deaths. If we by the proposed itinerary you should reach home tomorrow hope you had a good trip all round and arrive safely from your long flight.\n\nI remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Name]\nOttawa, October 12th, 1934.\n\nMemorandum\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRev.

At Trout Lake during my recent visit, I saw the school in session, there being present about one hundred Indian children. Mr. Garrett is certainly doing good work among these Indians who are receiving their instruction in the church. I have no hesitation in recommending that his request be granted.\n\nH.M. Averey\n\nH. M. Averey\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOctober 13, 1934.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nWith reference to the memorandum of Mr. Awrey, regarding the request of the missionary at Trout Lake - that a plan be sent him for a school building, of frame construction, to accommodate 60 children - I understand that the Indians at this point are getting out the lumber, sawing same into boards and that they will put up the building themselves. Later, they will require the Department to provide some finishing materials for the building, such as doors, window frames, etc.\n\nAt present, there are no school facilities provided for the Indian children at this point. There are no funds available to assist towards building costs or payment of teacher's salary. However, as the Indians and the missionary are showing their interest, by erecting the building, there would be no objection to supplying a plan for a building of a suitable type. No doubt, Mr. Orr would be able to supply a plan of a school building, satisfactory to meet the needs of this isolated post. The missionary should understand, however, that no guarantee can be made of any financial assistance.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. H. Duthie\nRev.

Mr. Garrett is certainly doing good work among these Indians who are receiving their instruction in the church. I have no hesitation in recommending that his request be granted.\n\nH. H. Awrey\nAt Trout Lake, the Rev. Mr. Garrett is making preparations to erect a residential school for girls without having received the consent of the Anglican Synod or of the Indian Department. He has started to build a school 46' x 21' with an addition 21' x 21'. He brought the matter to my attention but I informed him that I was not in favour of the project and therefore could not give him my backing or the assurance of aid from the Department.\n\nI told him that he should have had the sanction of the Anglican Church and the approval of the Department before starting the work, but he seems determined to go on with the work.\n\nHe seemed quite peeved because I would not fall in with his idea. I told him that he should take up the matter with Bishop Dewdney who I am sure will not sanction the movement, which in my opinion is premature and inadvisable.\n\nI visited the school in session and counted 80 girls and 50 boys, but as these children remain for only a few weeks at the post and then return with their parents to the hunting grounds, the results necessarily cannot be great.\nDear Mr. Avery,\n\nI am writing to say we are hoping you will be able to have sent us 500 lbs of Esquimo Biscuits for our school children this coming summer, or can you make it 600 lbs this year the Band is still on the increase you know.\n\nI am very sorry to hear of your illness and hope this letter finds you that you will have regained your normal health.\n\nYours truly,\n[Signature]\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, January 17, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, addressed to Mr. Awrey, of this Department, requesting that a quantity of biscuits be supplied for use at the Trout Lake Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the usual supply, viz.: 500 lbs., will be ordered to be shipped, addressed to you, Trout Lake, in care of the Hudson's Bay Company, Churchill, Man., early next spring.

It has an attendance of from 25 to 40 pupils, being better attended during the summer months than in the winter. Mr. Garrett is also the drug dispenser.\nSioux Lookout, Ontario,\nApril 26th, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWe have recently had a request from Reverend Garrett of Trout Lake to re-open the Indian Day School there this summer. During a discussion with the Indians at Trout Lake last month, they also appeared anxious to have the School for the summer months, and I believe it would be possible to have 25 or 30 children in regular attendance.\n\nThere is a Mrs. Hindle now living at Trout Lake, wife of the meteorologist in charge of the Trout Lake weather station, who would be willing to conduct the School. She has the educational requirements for this work, although I understand she has had very little if any teaching experience. However I feel that something worth while could be accomplished if she could be engaged for say from the middle of June until September 1st. There is sufficient equipment on hand including the School register, to start with, and the other necessities could be requisitioned after I have had an opportunity to look over the situation in June.\n\nC. Swartman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nGS:K\nOttawa, May 1, 1946.\n\nMr. G. Swartman, Indian Agent,\nSioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo,\nrecommending the re-opening of the Trout Lake Seasonal School.\n\nWe are prepared to favourably consider your recommendation in this regard, but I would like to know what salary Mrs. Hindle expects to receive. I note that you consider there is sufficient equipment on hand to allow a teacher to commence work. When replying, you might also state the approximate number of children who would attend this school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSioux Lookout, Ontario,\nMay 3rd, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to acknowledge Mr. Phelan's letter of May 1st, File 44-13-1, with respect to the Trout Lake Seasonal School.\n\nRegarding the salary, I am not in a position to state the exact amount Mrs. Hindle expects to receive, but it is recommended that she be paid at the same rate as Reverend Garrett was, while he was in charge of the School, plus a 10% increase. I might add that the salary is only a secondary consideration with Mrs. Hindle, nevertheless I feel she should be adequately compensated for her services.\n\nAs previously advised, it is expected that there would be from 25 - 30 children in regular attendance.\n\nG. Swartman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 9, 1946.\n\nMr. G. Swartman, Indian Agent,\nSioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, the Department is prepared to allow Mrs. Hindle salary at the rate of $90.00 a teaching month, plus 17% bonus. Please let me know the exact date on which she begins duties. You should also arrange with her to forward a return, showing the number of children attending the school and the days the school is open.\n\nEXD.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n538 Dominion Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nJuly 10th, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nI submit the following report on the Sioux Lookout Agency inspected during the month of June 1946.\n\nSCHOOL:\n\nAt Trout Lake a summer school has been authorized. The wife of the Meteorological Observer is in charge. She holds school in the church. They have home-made desks; but there is not sufficient. I visited the class and found 96 present\u201446 boys and 50 girls. The children were clean, well dressed and apparently eager to learn. Equipment and blackboard space is lacking; nevertheless the children are making progress.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nfor Manitoba.\nExtract from letter of September 10th, 1946, from Mr. G. Swartman, Indian Agent, Sioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nOriginal on File - 144-3-1.\n\nRe: Seasonal Schools\n\n\"We had very good success under the circumstances with the schools in the North at Trout Lake and Lansdowne House. Unfortunately an epidemic of measles hit both places and the school at Trout Lake was unable to continue after the first week in August. It is recommended that Mrs. Hindle be allowed $90.00 plus bonus for the month of July. At the time of our visit to Trout Lake in mid-July there were over one hundred pupils in attendance but owing to the limited facilities we reduced the pupilage to about fifty. This shows that in the North where the Indians congregate for the summer they are really interested in the day schools, and I would recommend that arrangements be made in advance during the early Spring, to have more seasonal schools in operation next year. If the right type of teacher can be obtained, he or she can do a lot of good work as well as teach the fundamentals.\"\nOttawa, 21 September 1946.\n\nMr. G. Swartman, Indian Agent,\nSioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your previous correspondence regarding the Trout Lake Day School, please let us know the Christian name of the teacher. In the different letters that we have on file, she is referred to as \"Mrs. Hindle\". Treasury regulations will not permit our drawing a cheque in that manner.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSioux Lookout, Ontario,\nSeptember 25th, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReferring to Mr. Neary's inquiry of September 21st, File 44-13-1 (W.

However, owing to an epidemic of measles, it was only open for the month of July.\n\nMrs. Thelma Hindle was in charge of the school for the period mentioned above, and she is entitled to one month's salary at the rate of $105.00.

Swartman,\nIndian Agent.\nSioux Lookout, Ontario,\nNovember 23rd, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI would be in favour of the buildings being of frame construction when possible, rather than of logs. There is not a mill at Trout Lake, but the Trout Lake Indians living at Bearskin (Mijicon Lake) have a mill. Lumber could be sawn there and transported to Trout Lake by tractor in the winter. As an alternative we might consider the building of a Nursing Station and School first at Bearskin. This would serve the Trout Lake Band at Sachigo as well as Bearskin,- a total of 288 Indians as compared with 423, the number paid at Trout Lake this year.\n\n(Signed) G. Swartman\nIndian Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nThe Indians have asked again for the Summer Day School at Trout Lake.\n\nLast year this school was operated with considerable success and the Indians were very enthusiastic about it, however, the epidemic of measles curtailed the operation of the school to a certain extent toward the end of the summer.\n\nAt the moment I have no recommendation to make regarding a teacher, but may have something definite in this respect after I visit Trout Lake, toward the end of this month.\n\nIn the meantime would it be possible to let us have a quantity of school supplies sufficient to take care of fifty pupils in the lower grades.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG. Schwartzman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 18, 1947.\n\nMr. G. Swartman, Indian Agent, Sioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant, we are prepared to approve the operation of the summer school at Trout Lake in the summer of 1947 provided a teacher can be secured. It is understood from the third paragraph of your letter that you will communicate with us again following your visit to Trout Lake.\n\nArrangements will be made to have a quantity of school supplies forwarded to you.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to acknowledge Mr. Neary's letter of February 18th, file 44-13-1(WT.1) with respect to a Summer School at Trout Lake this year.\n\nDuring my recent visit to Trout Lake I learned that Mrs. Hindle who had conducted the school last summer would not be available this year. The people at Trout Lake are very anxious to have the school in operation again but the passenger transportation charges from Sioux Lookout to Trout Lake and return amount to about $104.00 and since the proposal is only for a Summer School it hardly seems likely that we can secure anyone with qualifications to go in there for the summer months and pay his own airplane fare.\n\nI have asked Mr. Garrett the Missionary at Trout Lake to endeavour to find someone who would be interested in the work and he is to let me know in due course if he has any success.\n\nG. Swartman,\nIndian Agent.\nSioux Lookout, Ontario,\nMarch 12th, 1947.\n\nThe Chief requested that the Department operate a Day School again this season, also, that a Hospital be built at Trout Lake as it would promote employment for a number of Indians as well as take care of the sick. There never has been much T.B. among the Trout Lake Band. They are probably the most progressive Indians in the Agency and with proper planning much can be done toward their advancement.\n\nG. Swartman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 24th, 1947.\n\nDear Bishop Kenison:\n\nWe have been in communication with Indian Agent Swartman regarding the Seasonal School at Trout Lake. Mrs. Hindle, the wife of the Meteorological Observer at Trout Lake opened this school last summer but owing to an epidemic of measles was only in operation for one month.\n\nMr. Swartman points out that the Indians are very anxious to have the school in operation again but passenger transportation charges from Sioux Lookout to Trout Lake return amount to approximately $104.00. Mr. Swartman has asked Mr. Garrett, the missionary at Trout Lake to endeavour to find someone.\n\nIn a number of Canadian universities we placed an advertisement for undergraduates who would be willing to teach in Indian schools during the summer holidays. We have received a number of applications and I am enclosing a list of the names and addresses of these persons. All of them state on their applications that they are members of the Church of England.\n\nPossibly you could use one or all of them at the Seasonal Schools in your Diocese. If so, I suggest you communicate with them direct and you might mention that their name has been supplied to you by this Branch.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Leslie Garrett of Big Trout Lake in the Sioux Lookout Agency has appealed to me for an Indian Day School teacher for the summer. He has also I understand spoken of the same matter to Mr. Swartman, the Indian Agent.\n\nThere is, as you know, no school at Trout Lake, but they have in former years had a seasonal teacher.\n\nI have received a letter from Mr. Harold Garrett, the son of the above-named clergyman, offering his services as teacher in response to the appeal of his father. In his application he states in part as follows:\n\n\"I will be nineteen years old in May, and am in my fourth year at Westdale Collegiate, Hamilton. I expect to have my Junior Matriculation this spring. As a King's Scout and Assistant Scout Master I have had experience in working with boys, and last summer I helped conduct a one week Scout Camp.\"\n\nIt will be seen that he has not technical qualifications of a teacher, but in the very elementary subjects which could be taught at Trout Lake, guided by the missionary, he should be able to provide helpful service, and perhaps lead him to later seek qualifications by further study.\n\nAs his qualifications are thus stated I do not think it would be of any value to send him the usual form, copies of which you sent to me some time ago.\n\nWould it possible for you to approve of Harold Garrett going in to Trout Lake as teacher for the summer? If you would kindly inform me, I will communicate with him further, and if you approve he might go in to the mission with me in June, or by a freight plane from Sioux Lookout.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.

Buchanan, teacher of the Central Tyendinaga School, informs the Department that she has not been paid the portion of her salary due from the white trustees for the quarter ended June 30th. It would appear from Miss Buchanan's letter that the delay in this payment is owing to the fact that the equipment of the school is not up to the standard recommended by the Public School Inspector. If the agreement entered into sometime ago with the white trustees was that this equipment should be up to the standard required by the Ontario Education Department you should take steps at once to comply with the Inspector's recommendations, as it is not fair that the teacher should be kept out of her salary. In any event it is considered that these schools should be well equipped, both for the advantage of the white children and the Indians.\n\nBe good enough to let the Department know by return mail how this matter stands.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I feel confident that after these goods are placed in these two schools there will be no further trouble, as in talking with the Rev. of Lygonmaga he told me he could see that money was provided for the White Indians' share of support of these schools since which he had had a bylaw passed in the Lygonmaga Council setting apart the money needed for these schools.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLean\nSecy. Dept. Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nAct\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 23 September 1910\n\nNo. 153807/5\n\nIn reference to complaint of Miss Elva Buchanan not having received her salary from the White Butte for June quarter in reply I was not aware of this until some time in August when she informed me of the fact. I immediately wrote the Inspector who informed me that the Butte claimed the schools were not equipped according to the Provincial act. And on August 15th 1910 he sent me a list of articles needed to complete the equipment since that time I have had some minor repairs done which he ordered have bought and placed in two schools a set of scales a melon cutter from Wells & Wells as per his order. There is still a list of equipment a copy of which I beg to enclose if you could send them to me with as little delay as possible I will at once place them in the schools as ordered. Mr. R.J. Clark is a little enraged because I took the matter up with the Minister of Education when a settlement was made and a bill in the Ontario House was passed governing the white tenants as to the support of their schools, but there was nothing else for me to do as I tried to get a settlement with the tenants but they refused to settle then I took the matter up with the Inspector who told me he had nothing to do in the matter hence I had to then appeal to the Minister of Education thereby getting a settlement which I trust the Inspector\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of No.\n\nInspector has been very careful to see that comply with the Ontario School Act in the matter of equipment and when these closed lists are filled we will have schools better equipped than any eight reserve school in this town which is under the same Inspector. I feel confident that after these goods are placed in these two schools there will be no further trouble, as in talking with the Reeve of Lepanto he told me he could see that money was provided for the White Terrains' share of support of these schools since which he had not a bylaw passed in the Lepanto Council setting apart the money needed for these schools.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

The Inspector should submit a list of supplementary readers, from which a selection should be made by the teacher. These will then be ordered at once. It is to be distinctly understood that these readers are for the use of Indian children, as the whites will be required to furnish their own.\n\nThe covered water tanks are not considered necessary, as they are not specified in the list of articles of equipment by the Ontario Education Department.\n\nWith the assurance that these articles will be supplied by the Department at as early a date as possible it is hoped that the white trustees will no longer withhold the balance of salaries due the teachers, who were in no way to blame for the delay in equipping the schools according to agreement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. R. Stainton, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, October 3, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nIn September of last year an agreement was entered into between the Indians of the Tyendinaga reserve and the whites who are lessors of Indian lands in reference to the management of the schools.\n\nBy the terms of this agreement the Indians are responsible for the equipment of the schools in accordance with the regulations of your Department.\n\nIt appears that there was some delay in equipping the schools as ordered by the Public School Inspector, Mr. Clarke, and in consequence the moiety of the teacher's salary payable by the whites was withheld. The teacher complained to this Department and instructions have been given to the Indian Agent to provide the equipment called for without loss of time. The Department, however, wishes to point out to you that Mr. Clarke is insisting upon the maximum equipment for these schools; in fact some of the articles are not to be found in the public schools of the city of Ottawa, nor in the school in the village of Deseronto, which is in the same inspectorate.\n\nIt is the wish of this Department to have these schools so equipped that satisfactory work can be performed by the teachers, but, in view of the difficulty experienced\n\nA. H. U. Colquhoun, Esq., B.A.,\nDeputy Minister of Education,\nToronto, Ont.\nIn coming to a solution of the educational situation on the reserve, it is thought that every effort should be made by all concerned to maintain pleasant relations.\n\nThere is apparently a lack of harmony between the Public School Inspector and our Agent. If Mr. Clarke finds difficulty in having reasonable demands complied with it is thought he should communicate direct with this Department. In this case the teachers, who were in no way responsible, are the sufferers, as their salaries have not been paid in full since last spring.\n\nThis Department is anxious to do all in its power to make adequate provision for the education of the Indians and whites, but the co-operation of all interested is essential to success.\n\nI shall be glad if you will bring the matter to Mr. Clarke's attention and advise him of the wish of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Mr. Clarke has been communicated with and a further reply will be sent to you on receipt of the information.\n\nThis Department is at one with the Department of Indian Affairs in desiring to maintain satisfactory relations in all cases where white and Indian pupils attend the same schools.

I have communicated with the Inspector in three counties who informs me that no teachers are available. However Mr. Inspector Clark informs me that after Easter probably a teacher can be obtained owing to teachers coming from the Model School.\n\nI could have placed my daughter who is qualified at the central school but prefer not to do so as it might have been a cause for complaint.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.S.

Sincerely Yours Florence Fletcher Shamrockville P.O.\n\nStanton informed us at the last that we could receive our salary every three months we have since been told that the final school Indian Reserve Hyndingaga sent cheque comes in the last of September.\nOttawa, September 9, 1912.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that you did not get satisfactory information with regard to your school duties from the Agent, Mr. Stainton, who will be written to in the matter.\n\nI am sending you herewith two copies of the regulations governing Indian day schools, one of which you will be good enough to hand to Miss Picard. You should follow the curriculum used in the Ontario schools as far as possible. Your school will be inspected by the Public School Inspector and the Agent will be required to make monthly reports. Your salary will be paid quarterly, the first installment at the end of September. Mr. Agent Stainton will be asked to give you full instructions with regard to making out your returns. I may add, however, that you will only be paid at present for the time that you actually teaching during this quarter, i.e., for the month of September, and if there is any readjustment of salary to be made it will be done at the end of the school year. The Department will be pleased to hear from both you and Miss Picard at intervals.\n\nMiss Florence Fletcher,\nTeacher,\nTyendinaga Central School,\nShannonville, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, September 9, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nThe teacher lately appointed at the Tyendinaga Central School advised that the Department that she has had to take charge of this school without proper instructions and from the questions she asks it is quite evident that this is the case. She has been sent two copies of the regulations, one for herself and one for Miss Picard.\n\nYou will be good enough to at once give both these teachers, who are new to the work, full instructions and all assistance that you can. Even with such assistance the position is one that is difficult for teachers strange to Indian work.\n\nThe Department is going to insist upon receiving your monthly reports on each of the four schools in your agency on the forms provided and it will be well for you to make a note of this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJos. Stainton, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nReferring to your communication of Sep. 9th 1912 no. 1538071 regarding your request for instructions to Miss Leckie and Miss Picton two teachers recently engaged by the Department to teach at the Central and Western Schools in the Lytton Indian Reserve.\n\nIn reply it would be difficult to say how I could provide more assistance since there has been nothing to these teachers who came here. They arrived at Lytton on Saturday Aug. 31st 1912. During the remainder of September until school opened on September 3rd not knowing where to stay at the Relate they requested me to get them a place at a Boarding House while in Lytton which I did so they remained until Sep. 4th as Sep. 5th was a very wet day. On Sep. 4th I hired a carriage took them and their trips to their respective reserves for them what I consider very comfortable boarding places with white people and left them after having them the location of the schools...regarding instructions until delivery to these schools I instructed them that they must first establish order firmly yet kindly, and as naturally involve children into doing this and therefore should be hard to get acquainted with but when once acquainted and liked kindly the teacher would find them very faithful and nice children. I also advised that these schools used the same books as authorized by the Provincial Board.\nSir,\n\nOf Education work that these schools were inspected by the Clark Public School Inspector et al., which therefore appears that perhaps not have done any more in this connection.\n\nHowever permit me to ask if you will kindly allow me to have a copy of regulations regarding Indian Schools, in order that I may see therein I have some short from my instructions to these teachers.\n\nReferring to the latter clause of your communication, I beg to advise that it will be a pleasure to me to make monthly visits to the four schools as per your commands and have made a note of their advancement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I understand Mr. Clarke recommended an increase in my salary, may I expect it?\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nJ. B. Fletcher\nBox 348\nShannonville\nOnt.\n\nPoor Copy\nOttawa, March 6, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to official letter of September 9th, last, in reference to monthly inspection reports on the four schools in your agency and your reply thereto of the 11th of that month, in which you state that it will be a pleasure to you to make monthly visits.\n\nIt is noted that notwithstanding the explicit instructions given you and your ready promise of compliance reports have only been received for one month, viz., November, last. Kindly submit your report for the month of February and see that they are forwarded regularly in future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJos. Stainton, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nOttawa, June 24, 1913.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 21st instant I beg to say that the Department will be pleased to continue your services as teacher of the Central Tyendinaga School and will pay you at the rate of $450.00 per annum from the beginning of next quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss F. E. Fletcher,\nTeacher,\nCentral Tyendinaga School,\nBox 343,\nShannonville, Ont.\nOttawa, June 24, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that Miss F. E. Fletcher has been informed that the Department will be pleased to continue her services as teacher of the Central Tyendinaga School and will pay her at the rate of $450.00 per annum from the beginning of next quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJos. Stainton, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nMemorandum to Chief Accountant:\n\nIn view of the fact that conditions, past and present, with regard to our schools at Tyendinaga reserve have been and still are far from satisfactory, I think that it would be advisable for Mr. Benson to visit the agency and schools with the new agent with a view to having the work properly opened at the coming school term.\n\nThe present agent has not been long in office and consequently is not familiar with our school work. I understand that certain repairs are necessary to the buildings, new desks are needed, (in some cases), and that maps and certain other requirements are sadly lacking. It is not likely that the new agent would be in a position to take these various matters up and deal with them as intelligently as would Mr. Benson. There seems to be some dissatisfaction, also, with regard to the matter of teachers which could also be taken up at the same time. If my suggestion is followed, the new agent would be started with a proper equipment and a clean slate, so far as school work is concerned and the department could reasonably expect more favorable reports than otherwise.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, August 20, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. Benson of this Department will call on you on Friday, the 22nd instant.\n\nI should like you to make arrangements to accompany Mr. Benson who will visit all the school buildings with a view to having them put in a proper state of repair as soon as possible. You should see that the keys are obtainable. Mr. Benson has been instructed to authorize any repairs and improvements to the buildings and grounds that may be considered necessary and you will be good enough to see that his instructions in regard to these matters are carried out with the least possible delay.\n\nComplaints have been made in regard to some of the teachers and Mr. Benson will inquire into these matters while he is there. You might notify Mr. John A. [signature] to this effect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Donnelly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nOttawa, August 20, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to request that you will proceed to the Tyendinaga Indian Reserve and in company with Mr. Agent Donnelly examine the school buildings and premises with a view to finding out what repairs and improvements are required. You will then instruct Mr. Donnelly to have the necessary repairs made with the least possible delay.\n\nYou should also inquire into the complaint made by Mr. John A Loft against Miss Fletcher, teacher of the Central School, and look into any other school matters that may be brought to your notice. You should give Mr. Agent Donnelly any information and instructions required in connection with the school work.\n\nOn your return trip you should call at St. Regis and see how the new Chetlain school building is progressing and also the repairs which were authorized to the other schools.\n\nYou may bring up the neglected children referred to in your report made in the spring and place them in the St. Patrick's Orphanage here, as you say they will be received there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMartin Benson, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSecretary of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe are having some trouble with the Indians here.\n\nMr. John Loff, one of the councilmen, claims that the Department\nwith a contract, which, when they hire teachers if we would sign all for the Indians, would be well, and if he informed us that you not school would be closed. In other words, it is your duty to follow their wishes, and in fact he went so far as in future they would to threaten us. This contract contains nothing tangible whatever, it is merely a lot of words that could be made to\nmean almost anything. Of course we did not sign. I opened school today with only four Indian children present. I was told that Mr. Scott sent children home when they were on the way telling them there was no school. I'm sorry to trouble you again but these things may as well be stopped first as last. Very Sincerely Yours Florence Fletcher Shannomville Ont.\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, September 4, 1933.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 2nd instant I beg to say that the Department regrets to learn of the annoyance you have been put to by Mr. John Loft, who is interfering with the school under your charge.\n\nMr. Agent Donnelly will be instructed to inform Mr. Loft that the Department will not tolerate any interference on his part and in the meantime you will be good enough to continue this school.\n\nI may add that your salary will be at the rate you were formerly advised, viz.- $450.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Florence Fletcher,\nTeacher,\nCentral Tyendinaga School,\nShannonville, Ont.\nOttawa, 8th September, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nMiss Fletcher and Miss Picard the teachers of the Central and Western Tyendinaga Schools, respectively, have complained to the Department of the interference of Mr. Loft with respect to school matters. It appears that he interviewed them asking them to sign a new contract and threatening them with dismissal if they refused to do so. Miss Fletcher states that she was told that Mr. Loft sent children home when they were on their way to school telling them that there was no school.\n\nThe Department desires you to inform Mr. Loft that his action was entirely unwarranted and that the Department will not tolerate such interference with the conduct of school matters and that he should govern himself accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

For a teacher holding provincial qualifications the Department would be prepared to pay a salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum.

She attended the Training School for First Class Teachers some time ago but was unfortunate in her final examinations. She has an excellent general education, holding the Non-professional standing for a First Class Certificate. She has also had the Professional training as I have stated, and has had several years experience as a Public School Teacher in another County I understand. If she is appointed to your vacancy, I fully believe that she will give you satisfactory service.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.J. Clarke\nMonday Dec. 4, 1916\n\nMr. J.

Warren for the position of teacher of the Central school on the Tyendinaga Reserve and also a recommendation on her behalf from Mr. Inspector Clarke.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Miss Warren may take charge of this school after the Christmas holidays and the Department will pay her at the rate of $500.00 per annum for her services. You will be good enough to advise her of her appointment and also give her every assistance in your power in carrying on her work at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. M. Campbell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nThis is to certify that Miss Lena J. Warren has taught in this Inspectorate for five years and that her work was very satisfactory to all concerned.\n\nMiss Warren is an earnest efficient teacher, presents her subjects well, has the faculty in no small degree of making her pupils take a deep interest in her work, is a good disciplinarian, and possesses withal an irreproachable character.\n\nIt gives me pleasure to recommend her to any Board desirous of securing the services of a successful teacher.\n\nD.A. Nesbitt, I.P.S.\nBelleville, Ont., Dec.16,\n\nM. Benson, Esq.,\nOttawa,\nOntario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMiss Picard has written to say that you wish a letter from me as your Department wishes to express your appreciation of her work.\n\nI do not understand just what you desire. Is she leaving the Reservation?\n\nYou may have noticed on my last report that matters were not altogether satisfactory in that school. I should be glad to help her if I could for she is a bright little thing, but I would hardly like to sign an unqualified statement that I considered her an expert teacher. And qualified statements are not very forceful.\n\nJust what is it that you wish from me?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.J. Clarke\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith reports of the four schools on the Tyendinaga Reserve. You will see by the report of the western school that there is trouble there at home if the Indians will not send their children to that school. And the teacher says she has no right to teach the children who belong to the western school. The only way that I can see is to let these children go to the centre school till the end of this quarter and that Miss Warren get a grant of $500. I do not think if the children were made to go back to the Western that they would go regular as the parents are so bitter at the teacher.\n\nOne woman said all that her child had learned for the last year was to cut paper and toys out of plasterine.\n\nHoping you will look into the matter and let me know.\n\nThe Secretary\nof Ind. Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nG.M. Campbell\nAgent\nBelleville, Ont., May 18th, 1917.\n\nG.M. Campbell, Esq.,\nDeseronto, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will find enclosed your copies of my reports on the mission and central schools. As far as I am able to determine, Lewson intends to retire, and if he does so use every effort to secure a teacher with training. From what Miss Warren is doing, it is quite evident to me now, that these children are capable of a lot more than we have demanded of the teachers. The difference between these schools and the Public Schools is largely a matter of teachers' ability I am inclined to believe.\n\nYesterday I went to visit the Eastern School but found it locked and had to make other arrangements. This teacher knew that I was likely to call any time now, and it would have been a very small matter on her part to have dropped me a card saying that there would be no school. I have been told that the Eastern School is frequently late in opening, because the teacher is late. I know nothing of the facts, but if this is true it should be corrected at once.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.J. Clarke\nSir,\n\nMr. H. J. Clarke, B.A., Public School Inspector for Hastings County visited the schools on this Reserve during the month of May and reports that the Mission, Western, and Eastern Schools have not made much progress since his visit last fall. Mr. Leween of the Mission school is quitting and Mr. Clarke thinks that we should get Qualified Teachers for the money we pay.\n\nI would like to come down to the Department and talk the matter over with Mr. Benson before any of the Teachers are Engaged for the above schools.\n\nLast Christmas we engaged Miss Warren for the Central school and there has been such a change in this school that the Inspector puts it on a level with the White schools.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter which I received from Mr. Clarke.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nG.M.

I have several teachers who have not her ability as teachers, but with better paper qualifications, who are drawing considerably higher salaries than you mention for her.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.J. Clarke\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the requisition for the Central school all the details asked for are needed in this school and would recommend them to be sent. And as to the increase in salary of 50c she is worthy of it and I hope the Dept will grant it if not I do not think we will be able to keep her. I am attaching a letter which I have received from H.J. Clarke Inspector regarding teaching in the Central School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nG.M.

Campbell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nOttawa, January 24, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant in reference to the Mission and Central Schools on the Tyendinaga Reserve and asking that the salaries of the teachers of these two schools be increased.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has decided to increase the salary of Mrs. Brant, teacher of the Mission school, to $500.00, and that of Miss Warren, teacher of the Central school, to $600.00 per annum. These increases will date from the first of the current quarter and you will be good enough to advise these two teachers accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. M. Campbell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have been looking for a school teacher for the Central School on the Reserve and cannot get one. I went to Belleville on Wednesday to see the Inspector H.J. Clarke if he knew of any one, and he said he did not and advised me to advertise for one. The White schools near the Reserve are offering $600 for third class teachers. I do not think we will be able to get a teacher under $550, so the Board is very high, and if we have to pay $550, we will have to raise the other two teachers to the same.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nyour obedient servant\nJ.M. Campbell\nAgent\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nWas named teacher at Central School to take charge of Eastern School after summer holidays.\nBelleville, Ontario\nAugust 14, 1918.\n\nMrs. G. M. Campbell,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI hereby make application for teacher of the Central School on the Ridge Road. I have passed the Entrance Examinations, and also attended High School going as far as the third form. I am enclosing a letter from one of my teachers certifying to the above. I understand the salary for teachers is $500.00 a year. I would be satisfied with that amount for the time being at least.\n\nHoping to be successful in my application, I remain\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nM. E.

Brant, was a student at the Belleville High School and completed three years' successful work. During that time his conduct both in regard to his teachers and his fellow-students was uniformly good and he showed ability and mental keenness that should stand him in good stead, if entrusted with any position of responsibility.\n\nNorman A. Irwin\n(teacher, Belleville H.S.)\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI hear through a friend that the central school on the Indian reservation is in need of a teacher and I beg to make application for same.\n\nI have only a Limited Third Class certificate but have been teaching in the Severonts Public School since Christmas 1917. That is the only experience I have but can supply references from Mr. H.J. Clark of Belleville in whose inspectorate I was teaching.\n\nIn regard to salary I would very much like six hundred dollars.\n\nTrusting to hear from you soon,\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nMarguerite E. Miller.\nDear Secretary,\n\nI am enclosing herewith two applications for the Central School, one from Mr. Manley Brand who has had no training or experience and one from Miss Miller who taught six months in the public school at Deseronto and Mr. Clark spoke very highly of her teaching. Miss Miller is a very clever girl and I think that she would do good work if engaged for the Central School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. Please let me know what you intend to do with these applications.\n\n[Signature]\nAugust 19, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant enclosing applications from Miss Marguerite E. Miller and M. E. Brant for the position of teacher of the Tyendinaga Central School.\n\nIt is noted that in Miss Miller's application she states that she can supply references from Mr. H. J. Clarke of Belleville, in whose inspectorate she was teaching. I have to ask you to be good enough to ascertain from Mr. Clarke whether he considers Miss Miller would make a suitable teacher for this school and advise the Department. Kindly attend to this matter at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secre\n\nG. M. Campbell, Bq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of Aug 19th I beg to say I have written Mr. Clarke for a reference for Miss Miller. I have also tried to get him by phone but he is out of the city and I could not find out where he will return. I also tried to get Miss Miller over the phone but could not get her.\n\nI was speaking to Miss Warren who taught the school last year and she thinks Miss Miller would fill the bill OK. The trouble is this Miss Miller has two other schools waiting for a reply from her and she is waiting for me as this school is nearest home. I think she would take $50.00 for a start, and as the schools start on Tuesday Sept 3rd I do not think the Dept would make a mistake in securing her at once as teachers are very scarce around here.\n\nPlease wire me on receipt of this letter as what to do as I do not want this school vacant. I will send the reference as soon as I get it.\n\nMartin Benson\nSchool Branch 2nd Dept\nOttawa\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJim Campbell\nAgent\nOttawa, August 24, 1918.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant in reference to Miss Miller's application for the position of teacher of the Tyendinaga Central School; also your telegram of the 23rd instant, addressed to Mr. Benson of this Department, which reads as follows,- \"Just saw Miss Miller and will not except less than 600 dollars must know at once\".\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may engage Miss Miller as teacher of this school at a salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum. As she gave Mr. Clarke's name as reference the Department would like to receive a recommendation from him as soon as you can obtain it.\n\nYou will be good enough to advise the Department as soon as possible whether Miss Miller accepts this position or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated should be forwarded for the approval of the Department. This matter should receive your prompt attention. We prefer to obtain the services of a fully qualified teacher, if possible. The salary we could allow will be at the same rate as was paid Mrs. File, viz., $5 per teaching month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. M. Campbell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nOttawa, August 2, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received an application from Miss Eva M. John, Deseronto, for the position as teacher of the Western School on the Tyendinaga Reserve. In this connection I have to refer you to your letter of the 25th ultimo, in which you recommend that she be given an opportunity at this school and that Miss Lena M. Bell, the former teacher, be transferred to succeed Mrs. File, who has resigned as teacher at the Central School.\n\nWhile Miss John did not succeed in her recent examinations at the Peterboro Normal School, it is thought that her services might be satisfactory at the Western School and the Department would be prepared to favourably consider her appointment. I have to request that you will ascertain from Miss Bell whether she would agree to a transfer to the Central School. The salary allowed her would be at the same rate as was previously paid, viz., $65 per teaching month. If she consents, you should advise the Department as soon as possible, and we would then be prepared to consider the application of Miss John for temporary appointment at the Western School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Campbell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nDeseronto, Ont,\n\nAugust 1st, 1928\n\nSIR,\n\nIn reference to your letter of July 31st Re a Teacher for the Central school on this Reserve I would like to give Eva John a chance as it has cost her Parents a lot of money to send her to normal school, I think it would encourage other Indian children now attending the High school to stick to school until they get finished, Eva John could be given the Western school which is a small school and Miss Bell could take the Central.\n\nNow if this girl cannot do the work we could let her go, as we would have the Inspectors report to go by if this does not meet with your approval I will endeavor to secure applications from qualified Teachers hoping to have a reply in a few days.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nG. M. Campbell\nAgent.\nOttawa, August 4th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, which crossed the Department's letter to you of the 2nd instant, relative to the application of Miss Eva John for a position as teacher in a school on the Tyendinaga Reserve. You should ascertain whether Miss Bell, the present teacher of the Western School, will accept a transfer to the Central School, and advise the department, when the temporary appointment of Miss John as teacher of the Western School will receive favourable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. M. Campbell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nI will have an application in a day or two from Miss Helen Schell of Duschonito. This girl has a second class normal and she has a car and could drive to this school while the roads are good. I think this girl would make a good teacher for this school and I would ask you not to hire a teacher for this school until you receive her application.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nG.M.

Campbell,\nDeseronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have already made a personal application for one of your schools on the Indian Reserve, and am now forwarding my qualifications.\n\nI have my Senior Matriculation and have been taking a First Class Course at the Peterborough Normal this year. I have obtained my Trade B Certificate in Physical Culture and my Religious Training Certificate.\n\nIn preparation for the Continuation School work I took a course in Elementary Art, which would enable me to teach the Lower School work of the High School more efficiently.\nI am a Protestant.\nI would expect a salary of $900.\n\nFor references as to my character, ability, etc., I refer you to Dr. Bannister, Principal of the Peterborough Normal School, Peterborough, Ontario and also to Rev. Mr. Harrison, Deseronto, Ontario.\n\nI remain\n\nYours respectfully,\n(Oma) Helen Schell.\nI am enclosing herewith the application of Miss Helen Schell for the Central school, who lives in the Town of Deseronto and is a daughter of a widow woman. I have known Miss Schell for some time and she is a very quiet girl and has done well at school and I would recommend her for the Central school as she could drive to school most of the time as a boarding place at this school is hard to get, and I would ask you to let me know as soon as possible, as she has applied for several schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nG.M.

The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $65.00 per teaching month. Please inform Miss Schell of the approval granted for her appointment. Salary at the above rate, which was the amount paid the former teacher, Miss Bell, is the full amount which is available for this school. It is hoped that Miss Schell will meet with every success. Please give her every assistance you can upon her taking up duties at the Central School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nG. M.

During the past month the weather conditions have been fair with the exception of two days when a very heavy fall of snow made it necessary to close the schools for two days, owing to the fact that the roads on the reserve were completely blocked, however as soon as roads were cleared of snow the schools re-opened and attendance was very fair for the time of the year. At the close of schools for the Xmas. vacation, each teacher arranged a concert programme to which the parents were invited to attend, the pupils singing carols and giving short plays in memory of the Xmas. season, at the close of the programme each pupil was given a bag of candies and an orange the usual treat supplied by the department.\n\nH.

She resigned to accept a position of teacher.\n\nMiss Schell was in charge of young children, from five to eight years, in the junior residence. Her duties included caring for the children, supervising them in and out of the residence and assisting them at the table during meals. Miss Schell was very conscientious in the discharge of her duties. Her experience with these young children should be of considerable assistance to her in preparation for the management of children in school or elsewhere.\n\nTruly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose my application form in applying for the position as teacher at Central School on the Tyendinaga Indian Reserve.\n\nI expected to have a reference from my Inspector, Mr. M.

During that year I taught her in the Geometry and Electricity classes, and found her to be an attentive and painstaking student; punctual and regular in attendance and in the execution of work assigned.\n\nBeing of a pleasant disposition, I would recommend Miss Schell to any person or persons requiring the services of a young lady with ability and of the highest moral character which would be an excellent example and an incentive especially in the training of young people.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.B.

The attendance since the opening of the fall term has been poor. In every case this is due to the bigger boys and girls being kept at home to help on the farm. The younger pupils have been attending very well.\n\nThos. McGookin,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nOntario.\nOttawa, October 27, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th instant and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nI note with interest that it is your intention to discuss the matter of school attendance with the truant officer and the local constable, and it is my hope that you will find it convenient to do so at an early date. You might also discuss the matter with the School Inspector, himself.\n\nI want to state frankly that it is not the intention of the Department to keep the schools at Tyendinaga open and in operation for a full 10 month period next year, unless the attendance during the month of September is substantially increased. I cannot overlook the fact that there are a great many public schools throughout Canada operating on the 8 month basis, and I do not feel that we would be fair to the tax payers to keep schools open and in operation in the early months of the academic year with about one third of the pupils enrolled in attendance. Would it be possible or practicable to have two schools remain closed until October and two kept open? This is a matter that should be discussed with the members of the Band, the parents and the teachers in charge of the schools. The Inspector takes the position that the attendance has been unsatisfactory over a period of years. The Department feels that the time has come when a definite understanding should be reached with respect to the operation of the schools in the future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nH. J. Eade, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nSir,\n\nMiss Lena Warren, of the Town of Deseronto, who some years ago taught school on the Tyendinaga Indian Reserve, has requested that I communicate with the Department and ascertain if possible the number of years she taught school on the reserve, and also the date of her appointment and discharge together with the yearly salaries paid her during her term of employment. Miss Warren thinks she started teaching on the reserve in 1916 and resigned in 1922; however, she is not sure.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nH.J.

She was increased to $600.00 on January 1st, 1918, and to $650.00 on September 1st, 1920. She resigned on March 1st, 1922.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nH. J. Ends, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDESERONTO, Ont.\nDeseronto, Ont., Nov. 30th, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report in connection with Tyendinaga Indian Agency, for the month ending November 30th, 1938.\n\nSchools\n\nThe school attendance has improved during the past month but there is still room for further improvement. I find that in a good many cases of absentees that it is the children of white parents, tenants holding lands under lease, that are keeping the average down. I think it might be as well if the Department considered some system in regard to children of white parents attending Indian day schools, especially since under the new regulations no school taxes are charged on leases now being issued. My opinion is that if parents of white children resident on the reserve wish to receive the benefit of our schools, then they should at least send their children regular, and if they are not interested enough to do so, then the Indian Agent should have authority to refuse them admittance. At the present time the Indian Agent has no jurisdiction over white parents resident on the reserve who have children of school age; the Indian Act applies to Indian children only.\n\nH.J. Eade,\nIndian Agent.\nDeseronto, Ont., Feb. 28th, 1939\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON TYENDINAGA AGENCY FOR FEBRUARY 1939.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nThe school attendance for the past month has not been very good, this is owing to weather conditions which have been very severe. The Central School and Western school have been closed some days during the month owing to snow conditions, the roads on the reserve have been completely blocked several times during the month owing to bad snow storms. The teacher of the Western school suffered an accident resulting in the school being closed for several days, this has been a hard month for children attending school as it has been almost impossible to keep the roads on the reserve open. The health of the children, however, has been very good.\n\nH. J. Eade.\nAgent.\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following monthly report, in connection with Tyendinaga Indian Agency, for the month ending March 31st, 1939.\n\nThe school attendance during the month has been fair, although the Central school has been closed on various days owing to weather conditions, and the fact that the teacher, a resident of the Town of Deseronto, has been unable to reach the school on account of the roads on the reserve being blocked with snow. I think it would be advisable for the teacher to make arrangements during the winter months, to reside on the reserve, because it is quite a distance from Deseronto to the Central school, and road conditions are always bad for car travel especially during the months from December to April. The past month has been bad for travel for children attending school, it has been very difficult to keep the roads open.\n\nH.J. Eade.\nAgent.\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is noted from your report for the month of March, 1939, that the Tyendinaga Central school has been closed on different occasions during the month of March due to the fact that the teacher was unable to reach the school owing to bad roads.\n\nThe Department agrees with you that the teacher of this school should reside on the Reserve during the winter months. You should so inform Miss Snell and if she is not prepared to promise that she will meet the Department's wishes it will not be possible to consider re-engaging her for the academic year 1939-40.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Eade, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nDeseronto, Ont., May 1st, 1939.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON TYENDINAGA AGENCY FOR APRIL 1939.\n\nThe teacher of the Central school, Miss Schell, was advised that the department will expect her to live in close proximity to the school during the winter months as school was closed some of the days last winter due to the fact that the teacher encountered difficulties getting there on account of the snow. Miss Schell agreed to take up residence on the reserve during the winter months next Season.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nActg. Indian Agent.\nDeseronto, Ont., Feb. 3rd, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON TYENDINAGA AGENCY FOR JANUARY.\n\nOur Central school was closed four days, Jan. 12, 15, 16 and 17th owing to the inability of Miss Schell to drive the roads on the 12th and getting the \"Flu\" due to her efforts in shovelling her car out of the drifts. I notified Miss Schell both verbally and by letter that she must take up residence on the reserve at once for the balance of the winter and since that time she has been boarding at the home of Robert Hill, very near her school.\n\nH.

In this connection I would refer you to my letter of April 5, 1939, addressed to the former Agent, Mr. H.J. Eade, in which he was advised that the Department expected Miss Schell to reside on the Reserve during the winter months.

Crerar,\nMinister of Mines & Resources,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nI understand that Indian Affairs comes under your supervision, & am writing to you to take a personal interest in the teachers of Indian schools here, on the Tyendinaga reserve near Deseronto.\n\nWe read in our 'Daily' papers, nearly every day of salaries being increased on account of the higher cost of living, & yet the teachers of these four schools had their salaries decreased by one month's salary in 1940.\n\nMy daughter, Jean Schell, has been a teacher on the reserve, 6 miles from Deseronto, until last month when she ree'd leave of absence to go into war work. Her year's salary had been $900. However, last year she was notified that the Indian schools on the reserve would be closed for the month of Sept. to save expenses for the Government, & my daughter & the other three teachers on the reserve lose a month's pay & the Indian children were deprived of their school.\n\nThere was no good reason for this move on the part of the Indian Department. I ask that the salary for the month of Sept. 1940 be restored to these teachers.\n\nThe Indian schools here are under the Inspector of Public Schools for the Province of Ont., & the teachers are expected to cover the same work & course of study that the other Ont. schools do, & that means that 10 months work has to be covered in 9, & a great deal more work for the teacher, & they earn their money & need it in every case.\n\n**********\n\nNow, I am taking this matter up for these teachers & hope you will give this your own personal attention & if necessary I would be glad to have a personal interview.\n\n*******\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nCarrie E.

This was partly due to the fact that our records showed a very unsatisfactory attendance at Indian day schools during the month of September.\n\nAll teachers were advised in May of 1940 regarding the proposed change which would take effect in the academic year 1940-41. This Department does not bind any teacher with a contract and in view of the date on which we notified each teacher of the change in length of the academic year 1940-41 any teacher was at liberty to secure a better position if desired.\n\nAll teachers of Indian day schools in the Dominion of Canada were treated in a similar manner and you will, therefore, realize the impossibility of carrying out your suggestion regarding the teachers on the Tyendinaga Reserve.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMrs. W.

I think the teachers were at liberty to take any other months than Sept. When I read the letter sent at that time, the main interest seemed to be saving money for the Government. While not so long before, when Mr. Jones was appointed, his salary was raised, above what Mr. Eade has received as Indian agent, an amount equal or more than the cut in the teachers salary. Of course this rumor may not be true & did not come to me through anyone living in Deseronto. Possibly Mr. Jones had good friends in the department.\n\nIn my daughter's school, she had a large class of new beginners who should have gone to school in Sept. as they are often kept at home in winter through bad roads & extreme weather, etc. There are a few older children who are needed at home to help in Sept. & come in winter. Last term the attendance was much too large for one teacher a good deal of the time & yet her work was covered to the satisfaction of her inspector.\n\nNow I would like to hear from Mrs. Crerar personally when he returns & if these salaries are not refunded I would like to arrange a personal interview.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nsgd) Carrie E.

Claus (nee Monture), wife of Leslie Claus of Tyendinaga Reserve has been in this office with regards this school, claiming that Mr. Rendell had asked her to accept the position. Mrs. Claus, whose husband is at present a teacher on the reserve, states that she did turn down another position on this account and expected to receive the appointment to the Central Indian Day School, as she has had previous to her marriage, five years experience as a teacher on the Six Nations reserve.\n\nMrs. Claus did teach a part of last term at Lonsdale, Ont. and states Mrs. McAuliffe is of the Roman Catholic faith and that her appointment will be protested as all the Indians of this reserve are of Protestant faith.\n\nIn a telephone conversation with Mrs. McAuliffe, I have verified this statement and would suggest that the confirming of the appointment of Mrs. McAuliffe be held in abeyance and an endeavor made to secure a teacher of the Protestant faith and that if Mrs. Claus did give satisfaction while in the employment of the Department as a teacher at Six Nations reserve, that her application be given further consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I must express regret that this misunderstanding has arisen. You were recommended to the Department by Inspector McGuire, and I am of the opinion that it did not occur to Mr. Phelan that Inspector McGuire would recommend a Roman Catholic teacher for this particular school.

D. Moore, in which he states that it is his understanding that you are Roman Catholic and consequently ineligible to take charge of this school under the Indian Act. Sub-section 2, Section 10, of the Indian Act reads:\n\n\"Such school shall be the nearest available school of the kind required, and no Protestant child shall be assigned to a Roman Catholic school or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices, and no Roman Catholic child shall be assigned to a Protestant school or a school conducted under Protestant auspices.\"\n\nIn view of this fact, it would be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, for the Department to justify your appointment to this position.

Arneil,\nInspector for Ontario.\nLondale, Ont.,\nAug. 25/41.\n\nIn reference to your letter of Aug. 19, I feel that the section of Indian law quoted therein does not exclude me from the position. Catholic teacher does not necessarily mean Catholic \"auspices,\" as I have taught in more Public schools than in Separate schools. Since this is a Public School, Mr. McLeire would not consider any capable teacher ineligible. However, if this state of affairs had arisen between an ordinary Public School board and teacher, the teacher would be entitled to a month's salary. As for accepting a position in another Indian school, that would be impossible.\n\nI trust that the Department will give this matter their consideration, and that I shall receive an early reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMrs. J.

Claus has been away from the reserve for a few days, thus causing a delay in my reply.\n\nIf Mrs. Claus has not already got an application at the Department I am enclosing one that I have found on the files at this office. Mrs. Claus holds a Interim Second Class Certificate and did teach for 5 years at the No. 6 Indian Day School and for one year as Senior teacher at the No.11, Indian Day School on the Six Nations Reserve, during the years 1933 to 1939 at which time she left to be married. She possesses a letter of recommendation from Major Randle, Indian Superintendent of the Six Nations.\n\nOn making discreet inquiries among some of the leading men of this reserve, I find that they and their people look with favour of the appointment of Mrs. Claus, who during her sojourn at Tyendinaga has taken a very active part in the affairs of the young people and is quite well liked and should make an efficient teacher.\n\nThe appointment of Mrs. Claus is recommended for your approval, providing that her teaching at the Six Nation Reserve met the requirements of the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nA.D.

However, in view of the difficulty of obtaining teachers this year it has been decided to approve the appointment of Mrs. Ella M. Claus as teacher of the Tyendinaga Central School. It should be definitely understood, however, that her appointment is only temporary and that if another qualified teacher can be secured she will be expected to give up duties on short notice.\n\nI enclose questionnaire form which you should have Mrs. Claus complete and return to the Department as soon as she begins duties.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. A.D.

First, due to the fact that your husband is also employed and is paid bonus the regulations do not permit payment of bonus to you. Besides, as you are an Indian the National Defence Tax should not have been deducted from your salary.\n\nThe amount of your November cheque was computed as follows:\n\nBasic salary ........................................... $ 90.00\nLess overpayment of bonus ............... 9.90\n\nMrs. Ella M.

Moore, Indian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nSchools on the reserve opened on October 1st with the following enrollment, Eastern 58, which includes 2 first year high school pupils; Mission 21; Western 20 and Central 25. The attendance during the month has been fairly good, some children still being employed at local canneries and assisting at home harvesting and plowing. Some children in the western end of the reserve are still attending Shannonville school as their parents have arranged themselves for the necessary tuition fees at this white school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nA.D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nI would wish the decision of the Department as to whether Winston Fuller aged 14 and Kenneth Fuller aged 13 should be allowed to attend Central Indian day school on the Tyendinaga Reserve.\n\nThese two children are sons of Clayton Fuller, a white citizen of the Township of Thurlow in the County of Hastings and their mother was a daughter of Mrs. Joe Hill and a member of the Tyendinaga Band before her marriage to Clayton Fuller. Some ten years or so ago and while resident off the reserve Mrs. Clayton Fuller died and after her death the grand-mother with the consent of the father of the children removed them to the reserve where they have been ever since and Mrs. Joe Hill from time to time received funds from Clayton Fuller for the support of the children.\n\nThese Fuller children of whom there were four at the time their mother died have all been allowed to remain on the reserve for years and received their education at the Central School and recently Mrs. Joe Hill complained to me that she was not receiving any support from their father for their keep and I instructed her that this was a matter for the court to decide and that in my opinion these children should not be on the reserve but should be with their father in Thurlow Township. Mrs. Hill took Fuller to court for non-support and lost the case, but Fuller did agree to pay Mrs. Hill $20.00 a month if she would see that the children secured proper schooling, which they have not been procuring in the past and in retaining the two children Mrs. Hill cannot send them to any other than an Indian school.\n\nI might add that there are other children of a like nature going to the reserve schools and your decision in this case would be applicable to them and I would appreciate an early reply.\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nDecember 22, 1942.\n\nEX'D\n\nMr. A.D. Moore, Indian Agent, Deseronto, Ont.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to Winston and Kenneth Fuller.\n\nI note from the third paragraph of your letter that Mrs. Hill advises you that she was unable to secure support for the two children from their father. If the facts are as she has stated, it is difficult for the Department to understand how any court would make such a decision. Please let me know at what point the case was tried and the name of the Magistrate. There must have been some other circumstances which influenced the decision. I would like to know these.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nI have your letter of December 22nd with reference to Winston and Kenneth Fuller, sons of Clayton Fuller, who are resident with their grand-mother Mrs. Joseph Hill on the Tyendinaga Indian Reserve and would wish to advise you that these boys are now reported to be 14 and 15 years old.\n\nTheir father was charged before Magistrate J. L. Lloyd, Magistrate, Belleville, Ont. on December 17th, with non-support under section 242(3B) of the Criminal Code and the case was dismissed by the Magistrate. From information that I have gained the plaintiff in this case Mrs. Joseph Hill did have to admit to the court that these two boys did considerable of the work on the farm of the plaintiff and that they milked cows, ran the farm tractor, ploughed land, harvested hay and other crops and in fact were doing most of the farm work and were considered by the court to be self maintaining.\n\nThe father of the children wanted to take them home with him, but the grand-mother would not agree to this claiming that they could not run their farm without the boys who on account of their age and ability are valuable to grand-mother who has raised them since they were small and who is entitled to some consideration for her past outlay on their behalf. The father of the children then agreed that he would pay $20.00 a month towards their keep, but that the children would have to go to school, which has brought up the point as to their being allowed to attend an Indian school as the children are of white status. These children have always been only fair attendants at the Central school due to their being kept at home to assist on the farm and this is the point their father objected to in not paying for their support in the past. Personally I do not see that these children should be deprived of an education and do consider that there are others in the farm household that could show more exertion and use the boys less to do the farm work, which is the contentious point put up by the defendant at the court.\n\nA.

Moore, Indian Agent, Deseronto, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant, the Department is not prepared to approve Winston and Kenneth Fuller attending any of the Indian day schools on the Tyendinaga Reserve.\n\nFrom the information given in your letter the Department is inclined to feel that these boys are being retained by the grandmother simply for the assistance she is obtaining from them. I am inclined to feel that it would be in their best interests to return to their father who should support them.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDeseronto, Ont. January 18th 1943.\n\nMr. R.A. Heey, Supt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nI have your letter of January 14th 1943 and would advise you that instructions have been given to Mr. and Mrs. Leslie Claus, teachers of the Western and Central Indian day schools respectively, that they are to interchange one full day each week in accordance with your suggestion and which should work out with satisfaction and without inconvenience to the either teacher.\n\nSince School re-opened in October the enrollment at Western School has increased some and so has the attendance thereby giving Mr. Claus more pupils to work with and this has given him more incentive in his duties and he is so far displaying more interest in his work. This teacher has always shown more aptitude in his teaching of manual training than he has in academics and his work along that line has been quite satisfactory and for what he is adapted. No complaints have been received from the parents of the children attending this school since school re-opened in October, whereas last school term I was in receipt of a number of complaints and I have had no information that he has not been on time in attending his duties or that he has ever left the school before the regular closing time.\n\nLast Fall Mr. Claus intimated that he expected a call to the R.C.A.F. some time in the New Year, but I have not been advised further in this connection and as I was unable after advertising, to procure a teacher for the Mission School, I have not raised this point, for when Mr. Claus joins the armed services it is the intentions of Mrs. Claus to join some ladies service corp and it would create an awkward situation if both these teachers would decide to leave before the end of the present academic year.\n\n(Sgd) A.D.

Manual training materials were supplied for woodwork and sewing materials for the girls to all schools during the month. Miss Stoddart, teacher of Eastern School reports that her 9th grade pupils are doing well in their studies and the Ontario Department of Education examiner does give them very good marks on their papers submitted to that department. The new Council of the Tyendinaga Band have again been requested to give their co-operation in an endeavor to increase the attendance at the schools by contacting their fellow band members and advising them of the benefits of educating their children. I reported to the Council the case of one young Indian named Baptiste, whose home was a mile from the Western school and who was rejected from the Armed services due to the fact he could not read nor write and this was the fault of his parents in not sending him to school and I believe there are others of a like nature which should not be on a reserve that is advanced in all other progressive pursuits.\n\nA.D.

I have two other grandsons coming 14 & 15 who need more education. I see by your letters to Tolliver that you think the boys should return to their father still I don't agree with you there. He can't have them I told the court that & I say it again is its to much of a good thing for him to walk away with. After me bringing them up he had a good chance when they where infants to look after them I got them out of the slums in Point Carle Anne. He never took no interest in them for he was immoral & with fast women & wine he wasn't was not fit for a child to be with him. He is not capable of looking looking after them. If this goes ill have to take the law to him.\n\nI Remain Yours Sincerely\n\nMrs Joseph D Hill\nREPORT ON TYENDINAGA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH, 1943.\n\nEducation. While the weather improved and it was somewhat warmer during March, certain sections were flooded from spring freshet making it impossible for children from these districts to attend school from time to time and in spite of this the attendance was better than in February. The parents of a number of 14 and 15 yr. old pupils have applied at this office seeking permission to remove their children from school to take employment and I have granted permits to two boys over 15, whom the teacher reported as wasting their time at school and were a poor influence on the younger children. Children under 15 were ordered to remain at school despite the protests of the parents who desire them to secure employment which is plentiful.\n\nA.D. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nApril 2, 1943,\nShannonville, Ont.\n\nMr A.D. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nDue to ill health, I find it impossible to continue my duties as teacher of Central Mohawk School. I hereby offer my resignation to take effect at the end of April.\n\nMay I take this opportunity to thank you for your kind co-operation and sympathetic understanding in matters pertaining to the school.\n\nYours truly,\n(Mrs) Ella M. Claus.\nDeseronto, Ont. April 14, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI would wish to advise you that Mrs Ella Claus teacher of the Central Indian Day School has submitted her written resignation to this office. This resignation to take effect at the end of April and is due to ill health as Mrs Claus is an expectant mother in the fall. The written resignation is enclosed and recommended for approval by the Department.\n\nThere is on the Reserve, living a third of a mile from the school, a Mrs Eva Brant whom I have interviewed and who is agreeable to take over this school to complete the present academic year. Mrs Brant while holding no certificate has had a year at Normal School and taught over 2 years, previous to her marriage, on a permit and I am sure she has the ability to take charge of this school and would recommend she be engaged for May and June at $85.00 a month.\n\nAs there are 2 entrance pupils and the regular promotion examinations during this period, it would be very much to the disadvantage of the pupils to close the school for want of a teacher. This position could be advertised during the coming summer holidays in an endeavour to procure a proper qualified teacher holding a certificate.\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 19, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Tyendinaga Central School\nNo. 441\n\nThe Department has received and accepted the resignation of Mrs. Ella Claus, teacher of the Tyendinaga Central School. She should be paid salary for the full month of April, but no further payment should be made to her.\n\nTo succeed her the Department has appointed Mrs. Eva Brant as teacher of this school for the months of May and June, 1943, at a salary of $85.00 a month, plus bonus. I enclose copy of letter of appointment and the other forms will be forwarded to you when received.\n\nMrs. Brant is an Indian.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nApril 19, 1943.\n\nMr. A.D. Moore, Indian Agent, Deseronto, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant, the Department accepts the resignation of Mrs. Ella Claus as teacher of the Tyendinaga Central School, effective April 30.\n\nWe also approve the appointment of Mrs. Eva Brant as teacher of this school for the months of May and June at a salary of $85.00 a month, plus bonus. I enclose the necessary forms which she should complete and return immediately on beginning duties.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nREPORT ON TYENDINAGA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1943.\n\nEducation;\n\nThe attendance at the reserve schools during June was lower than in May, due to children being kept at home to assist in planting canning tomatoes and garden crops. Six children of the reserve have tried their entrance examinations, two being promoted on their years work and the other four having to take the exams. The school and grounds at the Eastern, Western and Central schools have been well kept by the pupils in their program to improve the looks of these schools. Little improvement was made at the mission school, where the grounds are not very favourable for much improvement.\n\nA.D. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nDeseronto, Ont. July 2nd 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nSo far as is known at the present time all teachers with the exception of Mrs. Eva Brant have signified their intention of returning to their duties at the re-opening of the schools of the Agency in September next.\n\nMrs. Brant took over the duties of Mrs. Ella Claus on the 1st of May last at the Central Day school and very capably did her duty to the satisfaction of all concerned. Mrs. Brant was only engaged for the two months and your authority is requested to advertise in the Toronto Globe and Mail for a new teacher, as I have already been making enquiries locally and am unable to line up a teacher for this school. If the Department has not a candidate in view for this school the only recourse is advertising and I would wish to be advised of the salary offered, which in my opinion should not be less than $90.00, plus bonus, per month, in an endeavor to get a properly qualified teacher at this time when they are quite scarce.\n\nMrs. Gladys Maracle, teacher of the Mission Day School was to be replaced when a suitable teacher could be procured for that school and in advertising it is possible enough applications would be secured that a replacement could be made from the applicants for Central School, if not it may be necessary to carry on with Mrs. Maracle for another term. On account of the residence available at Mission School, the salary would be fair at $85.00 a month, plus bonus.\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, July 6, 1943.\n\nMr. A. D. Moore, Indian Agent, Deseronto, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, in reference to the teacher of the Tyendinaga Central School.\n\nIn a recent report on his inspection of this school, Inspector McGuire reported quite favourably on the work of Mrs. Eva Brant. Is she willing to continue for the academic year 1943-44? If so, I believe we should retain her services. Teachers are extremely scarce this year, and this applies all over Canada. Consequently any teacher that we have in our employ at the present time, who is reasonably satisfactory, should be kept, if at all possible.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDeseronto, Ont. July 16th 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI have your letter of July 6th with reference to the engagement of a teacher for the Central Indian Day School and reporting that Inspector McGuire had given Mrs. Eva Brant a quite favourable report and inquiring as to the willingness of Mrs. Brant to continue for the academic year 1943-44.\n\nWhile Mrs. Brant in June signified that she was not willing, on account of help shortage on their farm, to continue teaching for the new academic year, she has now agreed that she will return to the school in September and continue teaching as long as it is possible and she is able to obtain the services of a girl to do her housework while teaching.\n\nAs Mrs. Brant has met the approval of the Inspector and gets along quite well with the pupils of her school, her appointment for the coming academic year is recommended for your approval and her appointment will be on the understanding that should she desire to leave she will give a month's notice, to which she is agreeable.\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJuly 20, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Tyendinaga Central Indian Day School, No. 461.\n\nIn my memorandum of April 19, I advised you of the appointment of Mrs. Eva Brant as teacher of this school for the months of May and June, 1943.\n\nMrs. Brant has now accepted the appointment at this school for the academic year 1943-44 and salary should be paid to her at the rate of $85.00 a teaching month, plus bonus, effective September 1, 1943. I enclose copy of letter of appointment and, as she has already supplied the forms required, new ones will not be necessary.\n\nMrs. Brant is an Indian.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nJuly 20, 1943.\n\nMr. A.D. Moore, Indian Agent, Deseronto, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, in which you advise that Mrs. Eva Brant is prepared to continue as teacher of the Tyendinaga Central School for the academic year 1943-44.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAugust 5, 1943.\n\nThe attached letter has been received by the Department from Leslie Claus, who is teaching in one of the schools.\n\nAfter considering Mr. Claus' letter, it has been decided that the Department will accept medical accounts regarding this and similar cases as long as they reside on the Reserve.\n\nP. E. Moore, M.D., D.P.H.,\nActing Superintendent of Medical Services.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ontario.\n\nEMR\nREPORT ON TYENDINAGA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF AUGUST, 1943.\n\nSchools;\n\nThe work of repairs to the interior of the Mission School was practically completed, with a small amount of painting to be done, through inability to procure at short notice the kind of paint that was supplied through the Dept. The schools have all been cleaned and are in readiness for the opening of school Sept. 1st. It is suggested that the opening and closing of Indian Schools be adjusted in future to confirm with the dates of other schools in Ontario, which are not to open till the 7th of September, the date when I expect to see the Indian pupils return, although the schools will open on the 1st to confirm with your schedule.\n\nA.D.
