She obtained the keys from him and was here the rest of Feb. There is no attendance marked in the register. On Fri., Feb. 8, the marked attendance was 19 present.\n\nHoping this is satisfactory and what you require,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours Truly,\n\nH. H. Taylor.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nFile No. 32-1-3.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 19th ultimo with reference to the employment of substitute teachers for Six Nation Schools Nos. 8 and 10, I would say that the qualifications of Mrs. Hunter and Mrs. Daisy Hill are that they both have second class certificates and were former teachers on the Reserve.\n\nThe attendance at No. 8 on the 6th was 25 and on the 7th was 24. The attendance at No. 10 on the 8th was 19 and on the 7th was small. I am allowing Mrs. Hunter a half day for the 7th.\n\nI enclose vouchers in favour of Mrs. Mildred Hunter for $4.50 substitute teacher for No. 10 school and Mrs. Daisy Hill, substitute teacher for No. 8 for $6.00 and to ask that cheques be issued in payment.\n\nI have not replied to this letter sooner as it was necessary to wait for a report from the Teachers regarding the attendance, which was the second question asked.\n\nI am in receipt this morning of a Departmental letter No. 15-32 upon this subject which is a reply to a letter I wrote to the Deputy Superintendent General regarding Truant Officers and it appears that the purpose of my letter was not fully understood as it was far from my intention to suggest the re-appointment of a School Board or to infer that the Truant Officer should carry out all the duties formerly performed by the Trustees.\nI was under the impression that could it be arranged it would add to the efficiency of the school service should the duties of Truant Officer be performed by one person but if it is not possible, there is, of course, nothing to be said.\n\nWith regard to the question of teachers temporarily ill, I regarded the instructions contained in Departmental letter of February 19 as orders upon which I was required to act and the teachers who were temporarily incapacitated were to close their schools and I have issued instructions to that effect.\n\nThe teachers live at places widely separated from each other as for instance Mr. Daniel Green who teaches at No. 3 School lives to the west of Brantford and Mr. Taylor who teaches at No. 10 School lives at Caledonia which are 30 miles apart and as the teacher cannot possibly estimate the period during which he is going to be incapacitated, it will be difficult to decide upon what occasions it may be necessary to employ a substitute or otherwise. Anyhow I will do the best I can.\n\nI would say that I anticipate no difficulty in obtaining qualified substitutes should they be required as we have several former teachers on the reserve whose services can be enlisted and there are usually one or more names of qualified teachers on the waiting list.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt.

Taylor, teacher of the No. 10 School, to be the senior teacher at the No. 11 School, replacing Miss Violet Hill (deceased). The salary allowed him will be at the rate of $100 per teaching month - the same as was paid him as teacher of the No. 10 School.\n\nThe appointment of Mr. Rae Green, R.R.

The salary allowed him will be at the rate of $90 per teaching month.\n\nMiss Nina Hill, the junior teacher of the No. 11 School, is transferred as teacher of the No. 10 School, to replace Mr. Wm.

While the Indian Superintendent at Brantford has received applications from several Indians who are qualified teachers, he states that the following appear the best qualified:\n\n1. Mr. Joseph Garlow - 22 years of age; second class certificate; graduated from Normal School in 1934. He is a fine, upright type of young man.\n\n2. Miss Mary Anderson - 19 years of age; possesses a first class certificate.\n\nThe Indian Superintendent at Brantford prefers Mr. Garlow, as the last Inspector's report regarding conditions at the No. 10 School was not very favourable, and it is considered that a man can restore the standard of progress and discipline more quickly.\n\nI would appreciate your concurrence in the appointment of Mr. Garlow as teacher of the Six Nations No. 10 School.\n\nO.K.\n\n(SGD.)

I also enclose the tenders and the plans and specifications as prepared by Mr. Inspector Jamieson. The schools are large enough to seat fifty pupils and are on the same plans as the new school No. 4 at Capton's corners. Nos. 1 & 7 will be situated on the southeast corner of the cross road and No. 3 will be on the North-east corner of the cross road, therefore provisions is made for the porches so that they may be on the corner of the building next to the corner of the roads.

Hill at $1880.00 and No. 3 school to Robert Martin at $1940.00 but afterwards these two men decided to exchange schools because Martin lives closer to No. 1 and Hill closer to No. 3, but it appears that Martin wants $1940 for No. 1 school.

The weather for the last two or three days has been very mild causing the snow to rapidly disappear and as a good deal will have to be done from Brantford of heavy building material it is hoped that the Department's decision will be given within a week if possible as the cost of teaming was an important item with these contractors when they filed their tenders.\n\nI trust that the Department will furnish me with definite instructions at an early date.\n\nI am\n\nsir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S.

Thomas for the No. 7 School at $1958.00, as they are in each case the lowest tender.\n\nWith regard to the No. 1 School it is noted that there are three tenders lower than that of Mr. Martin, viz.: Mr. Miller's, $1875; Mr. Hill's, $1850 and Mr. Bradley's, $1896. Unless there are exceptionally good reasons to the contrary the Department cannot approve of the acceptance of any tender except the lowest. If such reasons exist no mention is made of them in either of your letters. Be good enough to state why Mr. Martin's tender is recommended for acceptance.

The\nnext lowest tender was J.W.Hill's of $1830. and his\ntender was accepted.\n\nIn considering the tender for No. 3 the lowest\ntender was J.W.Hill $1830. and as he already had\nNo. 1 school it was considered that was all he\ncould properly look after and complete within the\ntime limit. The contract was accordingly\nawarded to Robert Martin at $1940. The plans &\nfor both these schools are the same and as a matter\nof convenience Martin and Hill after the awards were\nmade decided to exchange buildings. I mentioned\nthis in my letter of the 19th instant.\n\nThe secretary-\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\ncouncil had some doubts as to the price Martin should receive as there was a difference of $20.00 in his two tenders the matter was not finally disposed of until a special council meeting held on the 21st. Instant when the exchange was confirmed and Martin was to receive $1830.00 for No. 1 school and still $1830.00 for No. 3 school. As Mr. Martin is a particularly good contractor, the best of the three in my opinion I think much better work can be done by him and I beg to recommend that he be awarded the contract for No. 1 school for the reasons stated above.\n\nI am\n\nsir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nsupt-\nOhsweken Council House,\nFebruary 7th, 1912.\n\nThe adjourned Council of the Six Nations opened in due form by Chief Alex Hill, one of the Fire Keepers.\n\n---\n\nThe Council decided that the Contractors selected for building School houses and for supplying wood for the Schools upon the Reserve, are hereby permitted to take advantage of sleighing.

In order to have these tenders approved of by the Department as soon as possible I sent the School tenders on the 19th and the tenders for wood today and again beg to recommend that an early reply be received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) Gordon J. Smith,\nSup't.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nIn August, last, the Six Nation Council decided to build three new school-houses on the Reserve in Sections Nos. 1, 3 and 7 on the plan of the No. 4 School, which was approved by the Department, and they were authorized to call for tenders. Tenders were opened by the Council on the 7th instant and forwarded to the Department.\n\nWith regard to the tender for the No. 1 School the Council wish to award the contract to Robert Martin at $1920.00. The list of tenders shows that Miller, Hill and Bradley were each lower than Martin. Mr. Agent Smith, who was asked to say why Martin should have the preference, states that Miller is not a mechanic and the Council considered him incompetent to undertake the work. Hill's tender for No. 3 School has been recommended for acceptance and the Council considered that one school building was all that he could properly look after and complete within the time limit (August 1st, 1912). Mr. Smith makes no special mention of Bradley's tender, which is ignored, but he\nhe states that Martin is a particularly good contractor, the best of the three in his opinion; he considers much better work would be done by him and recommends that he be awarded the contract at $1920.00.\n\nMartin's tender is $24.00 higher than Bradley's and $30.00 higher than Hill's, but the Council and Agent are agreed that he should be given the work.\n\nIf you accept the Agent's recommendation to award the contract for No. 1 School to Martin a memorandum to Council should be prepared accepting the three tenders of Hill, Martin and Thomas.\n\nAll the tenderers are members of the Six Nation Band, who are to pay for the buildings, and the Council should know who would give the best satisfaction.\n\nA Minute of Council has just reached the Department asking that the tenders be approved at once, as the contractors wish to take advantage of the snow roads to get in materials.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Indian Supt. reported that the old buildings were very old and not at all suitable to the growing needs of the Indians.\n\nThe consent of a band is necessary under Sec. 30 of the Indian Act for an expenditure of their capital on a work of this nature. Under the same section the consent of the Governor in Council is required before such expenditure can be made; and under sub-section 2 of section 36 of the Public Works Act tenders have to be submitted to the Governor in Council and the contracts awarded under his direction.\n\nIn the case of No. 1 section, the lowest tender is not recommended for acceptance owing to the fact that the Indian Supt. and the Indian Council show the advisability of accepting Martin's tender, on the ground that, although there is a difference in the amounts of the tenders - amounting, however, to only $55 between Martin's and the\nthe lowest - Martin is capable of doing much better work than the others, as in one case in fact the tenderer has never done any building and is not a mechanic.

F. Hill for the construction of the school in section No. 3 for the amount of his tender, namely, $1,880.00; and -\n\nTo Thomas J. Thomas for the construction of the school in section No. 7 for the amount of his tender, namely, $1,928.00;\n\nAnd that the cost be charged to the capital at the credit of the Six Nations Indians, which amounts to $847,026.08, they having given their consent as required by section 30 of the Indian Act.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nConstruction of three schools by tender, on Six Nations reserve.\n\nOn the 3rd August last the Six Nations passed a resolution to put up these school buildings and to charge the cost to their capital, and the Dept. approved of the project, the old buildings to be sold and the proceeds added to the band funds. The Indian Supt. reported that the old buildings were very old and not at all suitable for the growing needs of the Indians.\n\nUnder Sec. 90 of the Indian Act the consent of the Governor in Council is required before the expenditure can be made; and under subsection 2 or section 36 of the Public Works Act tenders have to be submitted to the Governor in Council and the contracts awarded under his direction.\n\nIn the case of section No. 1 school, the lowest tender is not recommended for acceptance owing to the fact that the Indian Supt. and the Indian council show the advisability of accepting Martin's tender, on the ground that, notwithstanding the difference in the tenders - amounting, however, to only $75 - Martin is capable of doing much better work than the others, as in one case in fact the tenderer has never done any building.\nbuilding and is not a mechanic. The Supt. and the Council therefore favour acceptance of Martin's tender.\n\nThe tenderers are all members of the Six Nations tribe.\n\nIndian Affairs,\n5th March, 1913.\nFurther reference to Memo. to Council of 5th March, 1912, referred back from Council on 28th March, regarding acceptance of tenders for construction of schools Nos. 1, 3, and 7, Six Nations reserve, and for charging cost to band capital.\n\nThe Six Nations have a council of their own and also an Inspector of Works whose services are paid for from band funds. The specifications for buildings, etc., on the reserve are prepared by the Inspector of Works, and the tenders are called for and opened by the band and the band advises the Department, through the Indian Superintendent, which tenders have been accepted by the band. In fact, in the case of the three schools now under consideration, on the Department's telegraphing the Indian Supt. on the 10th instant as to whether any work has been done on the contracts, the following wire was received:\u2014 \"Stone, brick, sand and heavy timbers for 3 schools on grounds. Excavations begun on No. 1. Contracts made for all material.\"\n\nHowever, in so far as the expenditure of band capital on any work is concerned, the consent of the Governor in Council is required under Secs. 89 and 90 of the Indian Act, and as these buildings are to be paid for from Six Nations capital, authority for the expenditure will require to be obtained from the Governor in Council.\nAs to acceptance of tenders, subsection 2 of section 86 of the Public Works Act requires that any tenders received must be submitted to the Gov. in Council and the contract be awarded under his direction.\n\nPossibly, as these are the Indians' own funds, more latitude might be allowed the band council in the matter of acceptance of tenders than if the money were being obtained from public funds by way of Parliamentary appropriation. It may be remarked that the Six Nations are an advanced and intelligent tribe, and, as above mentioned, have their own Inspector of Works, who is undoubtedly a competent man.\n\nAn analysis of these tenders, in conjunction with correspondence had with the Indian supt., shows the position of the matter to be as follows:\n\nNo. 1 school.\n\nHardy Miller, $1,275. Out, owing to incompetency.\n\nJ. W. Hill, $1,880. Accepted at first but afterwards exchanged with Robt. Martin for No. 3 as he lives nearer No. 1, and Martin nearer No. 3, and the band council do not want one tenderer to have two contracts (the council accepting Hill's lowest for No. 3).\n\nBradley, $1996. Out, owing to Hill-Martin exchange.\nNo. 1 school (continued)\n\nRobt. Martin, $1920.\n\n&c., &c.\n\nNo. 3 school.\n\nJ. W. Hill, $1880. Accepted.\n\nOut\n\nThos. J. Thomas, $1938. Being given lowest contract for No. 7, and the band do not want one tenderer to have contract for two buildings.\n\nRobt. Martin, $1940. Accepted at first, but exchanged with Hill for No. 1.\n\nNo. 7 school.\n\nThos. J. Thomas, $1938. Lowest. Accepted.\n\n&c., &c.\n\nThe council of the band threw out Miller's tender, the lowest for No. 1, owing to his not being a practical builder and not therefore being considered a competent contractor. The next lowest, Hill's, was accepted at $1880 for this school. The lowest tender for No. 7 was accepted, viz., that of Thos. J. Thomas, and consequently, in considering No. 5 (as the council of the band do not want one tenderer to have more than one contract) Hill's and Thomas's tenders were considered as being out, and Robt. Martin's was accepted for No. 5, at $1940.\n\nThen, as Hill lived nearer to No. 3 and Martin...\nMartin lives nearer to No. 1; these two men exchanged contracts. Hill's tender in each case is for $1880; Martin's was $1940 for No. 3 and $1920 for No. 1, but he has agreed to perform the No. 1 contract for $1920; so that the band saves $60 by the exchange.\n\nThe Indian Superintendent remarks as follows in connection with the matter: \"In considering these tenders the whole transaction should be considered as each school was taken up and considered on its own merits. I beg to recommend that the contract for No. 1 school be given to Robert Martin as he is a good workman and will get the work completed in good time.\"\n\nThe tenderers are Indians, and the labor will be performed by Indians.\n\nIndian Affairs,\n15 May, 1912.\n\nRe-submitting case to Council, with the same terms as were sent back to the Deptt. from P.O.\n\nHanded the new explanation, and the original M.C., to D.M. 6-5-12 PM.\nOttawa, March 11, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to the tenders submitted by you for the erection of school buildings in sections Nos. 1, 3 and 7 on the Six Nation Reserve I beg to say that the Department has recommended to Council the acceptance of the tenders of Robert Martin for the building in section No. 1 at $1920.00, J.

W. Hill's tender it was stated that his tender for the No. 3 school had been recommended for acceptance and it was not considered advisable to give him any more, but no reason was given why the tender of George Bradley for $1896.00 was passed over in favour of Mr. Martin's tender for $1920.00, which is $24.00 higher. Unless there are good and sufficient reasons for passing over Mr. Bradley's tender he should be awarded the contract. No action will, however, be taken until the Department hears from you. Kindly give this matter immediate attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGordon J. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nIndian Office, Brantford,\nApril 27th., 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nFile No. 154 851 -5.\n\nIn answer to your communication of the 22nd. inst regarding the tenders for No. I school, I beg to explain the matter more fully. On the 7th of Feb. last tenders were opened for the building of school houses in No's 1 & 3 sections, and the tender of J.W. Hill for No. 1 school was accepted it being the lowest tender with the exception of Hardy Miller which was not considered because he was not a practical builder. The tender for No. 3 school was not given to J. W. Hill although it was the lowest because he already had No. 1 school and it was considered that he could not build both schools. Accordingly No. 3 was awarded to Robert Martin at $1940. After the award was made Martin and Hill got together and decided to exchange contracts because Martin lived closer to No. 1 school and Hill closer to No. 3 and the exchange was ratified by the council on the 20th of February with the exception that Martin's figure was reduced from $1940. to $1920. thus saving the Nation $20.00 by the exchange. In considering these tenders the whole transaction should be considered as each school was taken up and considered on its own merits. I beg to recommend that the tender for No.\n\nThe Secretary-\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs-\n\nOttawa-\nNo. 1 school be given to Robert Martin as he is a good work-man and will get the work completed in good time.\n\nI am sir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nsupt-\nOttawa, May 1, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo in further reference to the tenders for the erection of the three new school-houses on the Six Nation Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in the Department's letter of the 22nd ultimo you were asked to explain why the tender of George Bradley for $1869.00 for the erection of the No. 1 School was passed over in favour of Mr. Martin. In your reply you make no mention of Bradley at all and confine yourself to explaining the exchange made between Mr. Martin and Mr. Hill of their tenders for the Nos. 1 and 3 schools. It is necessary that you should state positively why it was decided to ignore Mr. Bradley's tender and until sufficient reasons are given the Department cannot submit a memorandum to Council recommending the acceptance of any other tender for the erection of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGordon J.

Thomas for the construction of the school in section No. 7 for the amount of his tender, namely, $1,938.00;\n\nAnd that the cost be charged to the capital at the credit of the Six Nations Indians, which amounts to $647,026.08, they having given their consent as required by section 80 of the Indian Act.\n\nSuperintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nTenders for erection of schools Nos. 1, 3 and 7 on Six Nations reserve.\n\nThe tenderers are all Indians - members of the Six Nations confederacy.\n\nIndian Affairs,\n28 March, 1912.\nConstruction of three schools by tender, on Six Nations reserve.\n\nOn the 2nd August last the Six Nations passed a resolution to put up these school buildings and to charge the cost to their capital, and the Dept. approved of the project, the old buildings to be sold and the proceeds added to the band funds. The Indian Supt. reported that the old buildings were very old and not at all suitable for the growing needs of the Indians.\n\nUnder Sec. 90 of the Indian Act the consent of the Governor in Council is required before the expenditure can be made; and under subsection 2 of section 36 of the Public Works Act tenders have to be submitted to the Governor in Council and the contracts awarded under his direction.\n\nIn the case of section No. 1 school, the lowest tender is not recommended for acceptance owing to the fact that the Indian Supt. and the Indian council show the advisability of accepting Martin's tender, on the ground that notwithstanding the difference in the tenders \u2014 amounting, however, to only $35 \u2014 Martin is capable of doing much better work than the others, as in one case in fact the tenderer has never done any building.\nbuilding and is not a mechanic. The Supt. and the Council therefore favour acceptance of Martin's tender.\n\nThe tenderers are all members of the Six Nations tribe.\n\nIndian Affairs,\n5th March, 1912.\nFurther reference to Memo., to Council of 5th March, 1912, referred back from Council on 25th March, regarding acceptance of tenders for construction of schools Nos. 1, 3 and 7, Six Nations reserve, and for charging cost to band capital.\n\nThe Six Nations have a council of their own and also an Inspector of Works whose services are paid for from band funds. The specifications for buildings, etc., on the reserve are prepared by the Inspector of Works, and the tenders are called for and opened by the band and the band advises the Department, through the Indian Superintendent, which tenders have been accepted by the band. In fact, in the case of the three schools now under consideration, on the Department's telegraphing the Indian Supt. on the 10th instant as to whether any work has been done on the contracts, the following wire was received:\u2014 \"stone, brick, sand and heavy timbers for 3 schools on grounds. Excavations begun on No. 1. Contracts made for all material.\"\n\nHowever, in so far as the expenditure of band capital on any work is concerned, the consent of the Governor in Council is required under secs. 89 and 90 of the Indian Act, and as these buildings are to be paid for from Six Nations capital, authority for the expenditure will require to be obtained from the Governor in Council.\nAs to acceptance of tenders, subsection 2 of section 38 of the Public Works Act requires that any tenders received must be submitted to the Gov. in Council and the contract be awarded under his direction.\n\nPossibly, as these are the Indians' own funds, more latitude might be allowed the band council in the matter of acceptance of tenders than if the money were being obtained from public funds by way of Parliamentary appropriation. It may be remarked that the Six Nations are an advanced and intelligent tribe, and, as above mentioned, have their own Inspector of Works, who is a competent man.\n\nAn analysis of these tenders, in conjunction with correspondence had with the Indian Supt., shows the position of the matter to be as follows:\n\nNo. 1 school.\n\nHardy Miller, $1875. Out owing to incompetency.\n\nJ. W. Hill, $1880. Accepted at first but afterwards exchanged with Robt. Martin for No. 3 as he lives nearer No. 1, and Martin nearer No. 3, and the band council do not want one tenderer to have two contracts (the council accepting Hill's lowest for No. 3).\n\nBradley, 1896, Out, owing to Hill-Martin exchange.\nAs to acceptance of tenders, subsection 2 of section 86 of the Public Works Act requires that any tenders received must be submitted to the Gov. in Council and the contract be awarded under his direction.\n\nPossibly, as these are the Indians' own funds, more latitude might be allowed the band council in the matter of acceptance of tenders than if the money were being obtained from public funds by way of Parliamentary appropriation. It may be remarked that the Six Nations are an advanced and intelligent tribe, and, as above mentioned, have their own Inspector of Works, who is a competent man.\n\nAn analysis of these tenders, in conjunction with correspondence had with the Indian Supt., shows the position of the matter to be as follows:\n\nNo. 1 school.\nHardy Miller, $1875.

Martin, $1920.\n\n&c., &c.\n\nNo. 3 School.\n\nJ. W. Hill, $1880. Accepted.\n\nOut\n\nThos. J. Thomas, $1938. Being given lowest contract for No. 7, and the band do not want one tenderer to have contract for two buildings.\n\nRobt. Martin, $1940. Accepted at first, but exchanged with Hill for No. 1.\n\nNo. 7 School.\n\nThos. J. Thomas, $1938. Lowest. Accepted.\n\n&c., &c.\n\nThe council of the band threw out Miller's tender, the lowest for No. 1, owing to his not being a practical builder and not therefore being considered a competent contractor. The next lowest, Hill's, was accepted at $1880 for this school. The lowest tender for No. 7 was accepted, viz., that of Thos. J. Thomas, and consequently, in considering No. 3 (as the council of the band do not want one tenderer to have more than one contract) Hill's and Thomas's tenders were considered as being out, and Robt. Martin's was accepted for No. 3, at $1940.\n\nThen, as Hill lived nearer to No. 3 and Martin\nMargin lived nearer to No. 1, these two men exchanged contracts. Hill's tender in each case is for $1880; Martin's was $1940 for No. 3 and $1920 for No. 1, but he has agreed to perform the No. 1 contract for $1920; so that the band saves $20 by the exchange.\n\nThe Indian Superintendent remarks as follows in connection with the matter,\u2014\"In considering these tenders the whole transaction should be considered as each school was taken up and considered on its own merits. I beg to recommend that the contract for No. 1 school be given to Robert Martin as he is a good workman and will get the work completed in good time.\"\n\nThe tenderers are Indians, and the labor will be performed by Indians.\n\nIndian Affairs,\n13 May, 1912.\nIndian Office, Brantford,\nOcto. 18th., 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 7th ultimo, in which you state that the Inspector of Works purchased three bells for the new schools from Harvey Wilson, Paris, Ont. I beg to state that the Inspector was requested by the Council to purchase the bells at once in order to have them in position when the new schools were opened.

There has been no public advertisement and the public has not been invited to tender, it being the desire of the Six Nations to award these contracts to members of their own Band. The tenders are less than $5,000.00 and the payments are made from funds of the Band.

Robert Martin offered $120.00, the Grand River Band offered $1.00 more than the highest bidder. As this latter tender is a repetition of the scheme introduced by Perry Davis when he purchased a portion of the Joshua Williams Estate I do not think it should be received as a proper tender and in fact the council in its council stated that it was irregular. If such tenders are recognized in any way in future I fear the road will be opened to great irregularities. In connection with this minute it will be observed that the Grand River Band has an account of $25.00 against the Council for its services at the Labor Day Tournament which tournament turned out to be a failure. The tournament was organized with the object of raising funds to send delegates to England to protest against the alleged improper interference of the Department with the decisions of the Six Nations council and as no authority was given for this Tournament, the account of the band has never been passed by the Council. Taking into\n\nThe secretary-\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs-\n\nOttawa-\ninto consideration that these various irregularities and with the advice of the Inspector of Works who says the building is worth more than $120.00, I beg to recommend that this decision be not approved but that the building be again offered for sale by tender.\n\nI am\n\nsir\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Date]\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 29th ultimo 154851-5 I have the honour to state that I think the case that you put is fully covered by the opinion given by this Department on 11th July 1906 to which you refer viz., that whenever tenders are invited those received must be submitted to the Governor in Council before the contract is awarded and that whether the invitation is by advertisement or otherwise.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrancis H.

John Clark,\nInspector.\nExtract from Report of Superintendent Gordon J. Smith on the Inspection of the Schools, Six Nations Reserve, Date January 20, 1913. Original on File 154851-6\n\nSIX NATIONS NO. 1.\n\nThe buildings and grounds of the various schools are placed in charge of the trustee especially assigned to that school and because the trustee of No. 1 school has not been diligent, the fencing and out buildings have not been attended to as they should, but I will endeavour to have the new trustee remedy these defects. In reference to Mr. Clark's comments on alterations in the ventilating system of the new school buildings I beg to state that Mr. Standing never made any objection to the system at No. 4 School which was the first new building put up. It is true that the outlet for foul air is directly behind the teacher's desk and there is always a considerable draught blowing into it, but the teacher at No. 4 has never complained and I am not in a position myself to know whether it is unhealthy for the teacher or not.\n\nSgd.

Original on File 154851-5\n\nSIX NATIONS NO. 1\n\nBUILDINGS and PREMISES.\n\nA new frame school has been erected this past summer. A good heating and ventilation system has been installed but the only foul air exit is at the rear of the teachers desk, which arrangement might be somewhat remedied.\n\nThe closets are in a very bad condition, the girls being insufficiently screened, and the boys having almost totally disappeared, except a few upright beards. The pit or box of the boys closet has almost disappeared and is no longer used at all. The boys must use the girls privy.\n\nx x x\n\nThe fence is also almost gone, the teacher claiming that it has been necessary to use it for kindling wood.\n\nSgd.

Original on File 154851-6\n\nSIX NATIONS NO. 1\n\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\nIn this, as well as in the other new schools recently built upon this reserve, it would be well to have double entrances as the present arrangement of a single entrance necessitates the passing of the girls through the boys' ante-room, or vice versa, which in the confined space is undesirable. A small double entrance in the rear would also add much to the convenience in maintaining discipline exemplifying good ethics, etc.\n\nSgd John Clark,\nInspector.\nExtract from Report of Superintendent Gordon J. Smith on the Inspection of the Schools, Six Nations Reserve. Date January 20, 1913 Original on File 154851-6.\n\nSIX NATIONS NO. 2\n\nMr Clark endeavoured to get Mr. Standing to inspect this school for him but was unable to do so. He secured the Rev. Mr. Park, one of the school board to make the inspection and he signed the report. I agree with what has been said in regard to the ventilating at No. 2 which has never been satisfactory and the heating has not been good in spite of the alterations made some three years ago to the furnace. I believe a coal stove properly jacketed in each class room would remedy the defect to a large extent.\n\nSgd. Gordon J.

The pupils are well advanced for their ages. There are 65 of school age in the section, average attendance 40.\n\nThere is need of more seats, as sometimes they have 50 at school. There is room for twelve more without crowding. Air space is sufficient for 59 pupils.\n\nThe school grounds are low on two sides, with thicket growing on them. This should be cut off and the low places drained.\n\nLater in the season I will prepare plans for draining school yard, if authorized by your department.\n\nThis school should have a school garden. It could be made in the school grounds as they are large enough. I would recommend that one half an acre be ploughed up this fall and top dressed in the spring with manure, for garden purposes. Hoes, rakes and sprinkling cans should be provided for this purpose.\n\nMiss Jamieson is making good use of the agricultural lessons.\n\nA truant officer should be appointed for this section.\nOttawa, July 12th, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. R.H. Abraham, recently, visited the Six Nations No. 1, day school.\n\nHe states that this school requires more desks, as there is, sometimes, an attendance of 50.\n\nHe recommends that the thicket on the school grounds be cut off and the low places in the grounds drained.\n\nHe, also, recommends that half an acre of the school grounds be ploughed, this fall, and top-dressed with manure in the spring, and, that hose, rakes and sprinkling cans be provided.\n\nHe states, also, that a truant officer should be appointed in this section.\n\nKindly bring these several matters with regard to No. 1 school to the attention of the School Board and it is hoped that every encouragement will be given to the teaching of agriculture.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC.

W. Hill\nOhsweken Council House\n\nJuly 22, 1919\n\nThe Chiefs refused to accept the tenders of F.J. Thomas and J.W. Hill for the repair of No. 1 School as they felt that a much less figure would complete the work required. The tenders are as follows:\n\nF.J. Thomas $319.00\nJ.W. Hill 240.00\n\nI hereby certify that the above is a true copy from the minute book of the Six Nations Council.\n\nAnn R. Hill\nSeyi S.N.C.\nIndian Office, Brantford,\nJuly 30th., 1919.\n\nNos. 29 & 30.\n\nI beg to enclose tenders received for repairs to No. 1 School and also the specifications prepared by the Inspector of Works. The tenders were T.J. Thomas $319.00 and J.W. Hill $240.00. The Council decided that these figures were too high and refused to accept any of them, but Mr. Jamieson the Inspector thinks that Hill's contract at $240.00 is reasonable and should be accepted. Hill is a good workman and Jamieson is quite satisfied that he will make a good job of it.\n\nBy decision 30 the council instructed Chief Andrew Staats to ascertain the nature of the repairs required and if necessary to hire for the work at the lowest figure, he to oversee the work. Chief Staats is not a farmer and not a carpenter and has no special knowledge of work of this kind and I believe that if the repairs were carried out as desired by the council the cost would be quite as much as if not more than Hill's tender.\n\nThe repairs are caused by reason of the joists supporting the floor rotting which will necessitate the hard wood floor being taken up, new joists put in and the old floor put back. I beg to recommend that the council's decision be not approved but that the contract\n\nThe Secretary-\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\ncontract be awarded to J.W.Hill at $240.00.\n\nI am\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nsupt.\nMy Notes\n\n40 x 28\n90\n165\n112\n72 88\n\n40.\n\n75- 1600 feet finished flint to be cut & carried\n20- Joists (grounded to corners)\n35- \" three to cut & provide\n10- \" to bury\n25- air wells in foundations to provide\n\n25-\nWater closets to be repaired\n\n240-\n10- Carvings\n10- Hardware\n\n260-\n34- Profits 14%\n\n999.\nOttawa, August 2, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 30th ultimo in reference to repairs at No. 1 school, Six Nations reserve, with tender enclosed, and in reply to say that as the tender of J.

Sutherland for supplies furnished in connection with the Indian schools on the Six Nations reserve. In sending this voucher to the Department you overlooked the fact that you should attach to it abstract forms. Kindly refer to circular letter of the 29th August in which you were given instructions in regard to the use of the same with a view to complying with the requirements of the Purchasing Commission.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGordon J. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nIndian Office, Brantford,\nNovember 3rd., 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 14th ult., regarding the account of James L. Sutherland amounting to $258.56 for school supplies, I beg to state that I did not consider the purchase of school supplies to come under the requirements of your circular letter of the 29th of August last.\n\nWhen the question of purchasing supplies in Brantford was first considered I was instructed to secure tenders for same and James L. Sutherland and Stedman Bros. both tendered at the same rates they were supplying the public schools in Brantford which was 10% less than usual price. Ever since that time the supplies have been bought from Mr. Sutherland and in the case now under consideration tenders were not asked from Stedman Bros'.\n\nWould it be satisfactory if I secured new tenders and if they are bought the same to give future orders to Stedman Bros', up to the amount now rendered by Sutherland and in this way would distribute the business. If tenders have to be asked for every individual requisition for school supplies delay will be caused in having delivery made and very much extra detail would have to be made. I beg to ask for advice in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGordon J. Smith,\nSupt.\n\nThe Secretary-\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 8th, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant reporting regarding the purchase from Mr. James L. Sutherland of supplies to the value of $258.56 for use in Indian schools on the Six Nations Reserve, and in reply, I may say that in view of the explanation which you have furnished regarding failure to obtain competitive prices before placing the order, you may return the voucher to the Department and it will be submitted to the Purchasing Commission with a view to payment being made.\n\nIn this connection I may say that in future you must obtain competitive prices before making purchases or it will be necessary for the Department to refuse payment on accounts. The instructions which you received, bearing upon the competitive prices covered purchases with respect to schools as well as other supplies and it is necessary to strictly observe the regulations in regard thereto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSUBJECT: School Supplies - Six Nations Band, Ont.\n\nAttention of: Mr. F. H. Paget, Accountant and Purchasing Agent.\n\nFile returned herewith.\n\nWith reference to your statement that \"James L. Sutherland allows a discount of 10% off regular prices\" - it is noted that many items are charged at net prices and that on the majority a discount of 5% only is allowed.\n\nAssistant Director.\nOttawa, 16th November, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to Mr James L. Sutherland's accounts for school supplies, which you returned to the Department under cover of your letter of the 3rd instant, I beg to point out that you stated he gave a discount of 10% on usual prices, but it has been observed from the original accounts that in the majority of cases a discount of 5% only has been allowed. Under the circumstances it is necessary for an explanation in the matter to be furnished. If Mr Sutherland tendered at 10% less than regular prices his accounts should be further reduced. I may say that the Purchasing Commission has refused to pass the accounts for payment, pending the receipt of explanation such as requested.

I have secured tenders on supplies for Nos. 1, 2, 3 & 6 schools on the Reserve but it has taken over a week to get xxxxxx and is not in shape that I can figure out which is the lowest. Harold Creasor only gave me prices on scribblers, pencils etc. while Stedman Bros. would only give me a percentage basis namely 15% for text books and for scribbler etc. 15% on cost. James L. Sutherland has stated prices with a discount of 5% in most cases. I beg to enclose the tender of Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Creasor being the only ones given me in writing.\n\nRequests for supplies come in two or three times a month and by xxxxx the time the requisition is returned from the Department there will be a delay of a week or ten days in getting the figures from the booksellers. The delay will be more than the teacher will expect and there will be complaints. I beg to suggest that a contract be let to one of these three booksellers on a percentage basis to cover all supplies asked for up to midsummer of next year. I expect to have a percentage tender from Mr. Sutherland in a day or two.\n\nI am Sir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGordon J.

Copy of the said list should be furnished to the different dealers in school supplies, and they should be asked by you to give quotation of prices for a period of three months.\n\nWhen you have received the said quotation of prices, you should prepare a list showing the lowest prices, and submit the same to the Department together with a recommendation regarding purchase. When your list is received, it will be forwarded to the Purchasing Commission for approval. Action such as indicated, will overcome the necessity for obtaining competitive prices every time supplies are required at the schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Sutherland\nIndian Office, Brantford,\nDec. 8th., 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nAs requested in your letter of the 21st. ult. I made out a list of the school supplies required for the Six Nations School and sent a copy of this list with a letter on the 24th of November to H. Creaser, Stedman Bros. Bookstore and James B. Sutherland requesting quotations for the supply of all that is required on the Reserve up to the 1st of April next.\n\nI received no quotation from Harold Creaser which is perhaps a good thing as street rumour places him financially in a critical position. Stedman Bros. Bookstore delayed sending in a tender although I personally spoke to them several times and again this morning when they stated that they would not make any tender. I received a tender from James L. Sutherland which I enclose stating that he would furnish all supplies \"at 10% advance on laid down cost.\" Mr. Sutherland has been furnishing supplies for some years and has given satisfaction and I therefore beg to recommend that his tender be accepted; I also enclose abstract of tender.\n\nI am\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGordon J.

It is true we gave a discount of 10% on a great deal of the supplies for a long time, but when we found the big increase in the cost of Packing Cases, Freight, Express, & other expenses in connection (about doubled up in fact) was eating it up, & the cost from the Publisher & manufacturer made greater we were compelled to reduce our discount to 5% at that time.\nBrantford, Oct. _______ 192\n\nis nothing in it or the great book\nof everything. The majority of the\narticles are subject to a trade discount\n20% and in some instances perhaps 25%\nwhile quite a number we price up\nof furnish at exactly what they cost,\nBooks supplied to Pupils oftentimes have\nto be ordered specially & come by mail\nof me positively make nothing on them\nthen the books for the School Libraries\nwe never get more than the cost &\nsometimes less. The Readers have been\na larger discount to the trade since the first\nof the year but as near as I can see\nthere are only 15\u00a2 or 20\u00a2 worth in the whole\nbill, We cannot see how the impression\nis gained that the prices are too high\nfor there is a tremendous amount of\nBrantford, Ont.,\n\nHandling in connection therewith and if we were to add the regular overhead cost of doing business to it, we would certainly be out of pocket. Trusting this explanation will be satisfactory, I am belief me.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJames L. Sutherland\nIndian Office, Brantford,\nDecember 5th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nAs requested in your letter of the 16th November I have at least received an explanation from Mr. James L. Sutherland in regard to the prices of school supplies which I beg to enclose. You will notice that he was forced to reduce his discount from 10% to 5% on account of the increased prices of packing cases, freight and express and other expenses in connection with the supplies, all of which he had no control over, after his original tender was accepted.\n\nIn connection with the same matter I beg to enclose some further accounts for school supplies amounting to $104.46 payment of which I beg to recommend under the same circumstances as the accounts which are now under consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGordon J. Smith,\nSupt.\n\nThe Secretary-\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIndian Office, Brantford,\nDecember 27th., 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nOn the 5th of December I sent tenders for the furnishing of school supplies on the Reserve but have yet received no reply. I beg to request that this matter receive early attention as I have many requisitions here for school supplies which I would like to fill as soon as possible.\n\nI am\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGordon J. Smith,\nSupt.\n\nThe Secretary-\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 30, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 27th instant regarding the question of the purchase of supplies for use at the Six Nations Indian Schools, I beg to say that the tenders which you submitted with your letter of the 8th instant are not satisfactory to the Purchasing Commission, in view of which I have to request that you will submit to the Department a list of the articles which it is likely will be required for use at the Schools during the ensuing three months. In preparing the list you should be guided by the expenditure of the nature mentioned which was incurred on behalf of the schools during the same period last year.\n\nThe Department is aware that it will be impossible for you to anticipate all requirements at the schools, but such articles as you may overlook when preparing the list can be purchased locally later on, and no doubt they can be obtained from the dealer who will receive the contract for furnishing the school supplies.\n\nWhen you forward a list such as referred to, you should submit also the names of dealers in Brantford, or in the vicinity of the schools, who are likely to tender for school supplies. When action such as indicated is taken further instructions will be sent you, and in this connection I may say that the Department has no option in dealing with cases of this kind but must carry out the requirements of the Purchasing Commission.\n\nI may add that, pending arrangements such as indicated, if supplies are urgently needed for the schools purchase may be made locally at the best prices obtainable, but in the event of such action being taken it will be necessary\n\nG.J. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nnecessary for you to obtain competitive prices and submit statement of the same to the Department with the accounts which you forward for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, January 9th, 1922.\n\nDear Sirs:-\n\nI beg to inform you that recently Mr. Gordon J. Smith, Indian Agent at Brantford, was informed that the tenders which he submitted to the Department for the purchase of supplies for use at the Six Nations Indian Schools were not satisfactory to you, and he was requested to submit a list of the articles which it is likely will be required at the schools during the ensuing months. He was told that, in preparing the list, he should be guided by the expenditure of the nature in question which was incurred on behalf of the schools during the same period last year.\n\nI enclose a copy of Mr. Smith's reply, and I shall be glad to receive from you the names of firms other than those mentioned by him from whom prices may be obtained for the articles required.\n\nIf you have instructions to give regarding the mode of calling for tenders, etc., I shall be glad to receive the same.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.

F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGordon J. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nOttawa, October 2, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to draw attention to the fact that on July 7th you submitted to the Department certain accounts in favour of James L. Sutherland, which accounts represented a balance due Sutherland for school supplies furnished. The accounts in question have been compared with subsequent accounts submitted by the same man and the latter have been found to be duplicates. The first accounts received were checked in the Department and paid at the correct amounts. Payment in some cases was made at a slight reduction consequent upon errors in addition, discounts, etc. Payment of the difference between the accounts as submitted and the accounts as checked and passed upon by the Department cannot be considered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGordon J. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nIndian Office, Brantford,\nSept. 28th., 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nOn the 7th of July last I sent an account in favour of James L. Sutherland amounting to $214.70 for balance due him for school supplies and beg to request again that a cheque be issued for this amount. Mr. Sutherland was speaking to me the other day and felt that he should be paid as he furnished the supplies in good faith and the Department received value for it.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGordon J. Smith,\nSupt.\n\nThe Secretary\u2014\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIndian Office, Brantford,\nOctober 12th., 1922.\n\nSir,-\n\nI referred the matter contained in your letter of the 8th. Inst. to Mr. James L. Sutherland who says he is unable to understand your statement. He states that his account was rendered on December 1st., 1921, amounting to $571.60 and on December 31st. he received a cheque for $312.05 leaving a balance due of $259.55; the account rendered on the 7th of July last for $214.70 included this balance of $259.55. He has recently checked over all his discounts on these accounts and states that there was only a difference of $1.50 in what was rendered and what should be rendered and that there is still a balance of $209.55 plus the cost of books furnished to High School pupils since the account of December 1st. was rendered.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGordon J. Smith,\nSupt.\n\nThe Secretary-\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 15th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, regarding an account from Mr. James L. Sutherland for supplies furnished Six Nations School; and in reply it is observed you state that on December 1, 1921, Mr. Sutherland rendered an account of $571.60 and that the Department issued a cheque for $362.05 towards payment. It is apparent that a misunderstanding has arisen in connection with this matter. There is no record of an account of $571.60 having been received at the Department, and the official cheque for $362.05 which was issued covers accounts as follows, viz: one for $104.46 which was submitted with your letter of the 5th December 1921 and another account for $257.59 which you forwarded on the 11th October 1921. I may say also that the records on the Department's file show that all accounts submitted through your office from Mr. Sutherland have been paid, with the exception of the account amounting to $214.70 which you forwarded on the 7th July last, as a balance due for school books, etc.\n\nYou should endeavour to elucidate this matter in order that there may be no misunderstanding in regard thereto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGordon J. Smith Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBrentford, Ont.\nOttawa, November 18, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 13th instant with which you forwarded a voucher, amounting to $46.44 in Mr. James L. Sutherland's favour for books supplied Indian pupils of the Six Nations Reserve who are attending high schools, and in reply I have to point out that the Department does not assume responsibility for payment for books for Indian high school pupils. A grant of $100.00 per annum is made on the said pupils' behalf, which grant should cover the cost of the necessary books, particularly in view of the fact that the Department pays the pupils' tuition fees. The account is returned herewith in order that it may be paid by the parents of the children to whom the books were furnished.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nGordon J. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nSir,-\n\nIn further reference to the accounts rendered by James L. Sutherland, I beg to enclose a statement received from him today commencing on January 6th.,1917, and carried down to the 25th of October 1922 showing a balance due him of $293.04 which he states is correct and he is not able to find any errors in his statements.\n\nI trust you will find this satisfactory.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGordon J. Smith,\nSupt.\n\nThe Secretary-\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nNovember 30, 1922.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart:\n\nRelative to the attached correspondence, I wish to state that all accounts for school supplies submitted by James L. Sutherland, stationer, of Brantford, Ont., were paid regularly when in order. This procedure obtained until the Purchasing Commission, refusing to allow the local purchase, directed that all school supplies for the Six Nation Reserve schools be ordered from the Government Stationery Office.\n\nAs Mr. Sutherland has appealed to his member, I wish to lay before you the facts concerning his accounts. During the calendar years 1917 to 1921, inclusive, this stationer's accounts covering supplies furnished the Six Nation schools have been paid. Some advanced pupils whose parents are given grants to help them keep their children at provincial high schools, have purchased books and supplies from Mr. Sutherland during these years. This Department has never assumed the responsibility for such items, and during the years mentioned above we have not been billed for supplies given individual high school pupils.\n\nIn Mr. Sutherland's final account, which was submitted when patronage was discontinued, there appeared many items for the past five years referring to purchases made by advanced students and which are chargeable to the individual parents. The Department believes that Mr. Sutherland, having failed to collect locally, has billed us with the hope of receiving payment. This final account is generally inexplicit and here and there, inaccurate. The balance due, as claimed by Mr. Sutherland, is for books supplied to high school students without the authority of the Department, and covers both the period when we were ordering school supplies from him and that since the ruling of the Purchasing Commission.\n\nAs no more departmental business is being offered to Mr. Sutherland, I have decided, although his claim on us is weak, that it is good policy to settle the account, and I am directing that a cheque for $259.00 be issued in his favour. Indian band trust funds are used in this connection. Mr. Sutherland will be definitely informed that we are not responsible for the accounts of individual students as from October 26th, last.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, Nov. 30, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nWITH CHEQUE\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant, enclosing a more comprehensive statement of the accounts rendered by James L. Sutherland, Stationer, of Brantford. I have noted that Mr. Sutherland claims a balance due of $293.04.\n\nThis statement has been carefully examined, and I am convinced that those portions of the account which remain unpaid are for school supplies given to individual high school pupils. The Department does not assume the responsibility in this connection, as we provide a grant to the parents of such children who are taking advanced studies and it is understood that books and other school supplies needed by them should be purchased by the parents.\n\nHowever, there has been a misunderstanding, and a cheque for $293.04 in favour of Mr. Sutherland is enclosed. It should be distinctly understood that as from October 28th last this Department will not be responsible for the payment of supplies given to high school pupils.\n\nA similar decision was incorporated in official communication No. 105-32 of the 16th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nGordon J. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nOttawa, December 1, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant, inclosing a more comprehensive statement of the accounts rendered by James L. Sutherland, Stationer, of Brantford.

These should be submitted by return mail. It should be distinctly understood that as from October 28th last this Department will not be responsible for the payment of supplies given to high school pupils.\n\nA similar decision was incorporated in official communication No. 103-32 of the 15th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Smith)\nSupr-\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Jan. 22, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nIt is the Department's wish that each child attending the day schools on the Six Nations Reserve has an individual drinking cup and towel. You are authorized to purchase 400 enamel mugs with handles, 400 yards face towelling and 400 small hooks. One yard of towelling a yard wide is sufficient for two towels for a pupil and the Department considers that the towels should be made by the pupils themselves, under the supervision of the individual teachers.\n\nEach regular attendant at school should have a hook placed on the wall, with his or her number above it and to which can be attached the pupil's cup and towel in use. The pupils will each have two towels and should take one home every week for washing. The children should be taught to take proper care of property not their own and it should be understood that the towels are to be used in the school only.\n\nYou may also purchase 90 yards of narrow white tape, which should be divided among the schools so that each child will have 4 inches for each of his two towels. This tape is to be used for purposes of hanging the towels when not in use. All sewing should be done in the school under the supervision of the teacher. The 400 cups, hooks and yards of towelling should be divided as follows: - No. 1 School, 35; No. 2, 81; No. 3, 43; No. 4, 16; No. 5, 26; No. 6, 18; No. 7, 56; No. 8, 39; No. 9, 22; No. 10, 42; and No. 11, 42.\n\nPlease secure competitive prices when purchasing this material and obtain at the best possible price equipment that will give satisfactory service. No unnecessary expense is to be incurred. You should give each teacher careful instructions as to the use of the new equipment and insist upon the wishes of the Department being carried out in this respect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

It appears that at some of the schools neighbouring farmers water their cattle at the school well or cistern during the winter months, fouling the ground, and leading to serious danger of water contamination.\n\nSome system of individual drinking cups should undoubtedly be provided. At present, in several of the schools at least, one drinking cup does service for all the children, with an inevitable spread of disease. The lavatory accommodation is also entirely inadequate. Small plants are today being supplied to country people for individual residences at a cost of a few hundred dollars each. I think it would be quite possible to instal similar conveniences in the various schools.\n\nI discussed this lavatory scheme with the R.M. & we decided no action at present.\nOttawa, January 22, 1924.\n\nMr. Ferguson,\n\nIncl.\n\nI am inclosing herewith an extract from the report made by Lt.

F. Crowley the President of the Kaustine Manufacturing Company, Dundas having notified me that during an interview he had with the Deputy Superintendent General last week, Dr. Scott expressed a desire that he should get into touch with me. I met Mr. Crowley in Hamilton yesterday February 25th.\n\nWe together visited the Public school at Fruitlands near Grimsby where there is an eight bowl installation together with a three foot urinal. This installation of four bowls on the girls side of the school and four bowls and a urinal on the boys side has been working since 1922 and appears to be in every way entirely satisfactory. It is clean and except for a slight and not unpleasant chemical odour, without smell.\n\nThe last time I was in Ottawa I discussed this question of sanitation of the Reserve schools with Mr. Ferrier as I consider the fly nuisance a serious menace.\nBrantford, Ont.\n\nFebruary 26th, 1924.\n\nSecretary,\n\nmenace to the health not only of the children but generally throughout the Reserve and he will remember that I suggested the award of a prize to the cleanest school with the least number of flies.\n\nI have had a lot of experience in sanitation of both native towns and villages and large military camps and I have seen a death rate equal to that of Panama in its bad days reduced to that of Paris or London or the West Coast of Africa by the abolition of mosquitoes and flies.\n\nI do not think that with this Kaustine system flies could exist and that in itself is the strongest argument in its favour.\n\nThe initial expense is I understand not high and depends upon whether it is \"ex sales tax\" so that at the time Mr. Crowley preferred not to give a definite estimate and the upkeep amounts to about .15\u00a2 per annum per pupil.\n\nIt would be necessary to have the girls and boys separated and we should require I estimate, roughly, somewhere from 28 to 35 of these pans, and it might also be worth consideration for the Doctors House, the Council house and Rectories, while the men are on the ground.\nI estimate for fifty pupils and under two pans, and over fifty, four pans.\n\n| SCHOOL | PUPILS | PANS |\n|--------|--------|------|\n| 1      | 50     | 2    |\n| 2      | 90     | 4    |\n| 3      | 50     | 2    |\n| 4      | 50     | 2    |\n| 5      | 40     | 2    |\n| 6      | 40     | 2    |\n| 7      | 60     | 4    |\n| 8      | 40     | 2    |\n| 9      | 40     | 2    |\n| 10     | 40     | 2    |\n| 11     | 60     | 4    |\n|        | 560    | 28   |\n\nI feel considerably attracted by this system and I think that sanitation and the advantages of indoor latrines will improve health conditions will justify the initial cost of its installation.\n\nI am leaving for Ottawa today and will discuss this matter with you during my visit.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nLt. Col. C. E. Morgan,\n\nYour obedient servant.\nOttawa, February 29th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 10B/363 of the 26th instant, relative to the installation of the Kaustine chemical lavatories at the Six Nations schools. You should communicate with the representative of the Kaustine Manufacturing Company and, after explaining that the Government Departments pay the new sales tax, ask him to estimate the cost of supplying the equipment and installing 25 lavatories in the 11 schools on the reserve.\n\nYou should also bring this matter to the attention of the school board and the Indian council, as it is a question that affects the reserve as a whole, and secure an expression of their views.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Morgan,\nSuperintendent Six Nations Reserve,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFurther to our proposal of the 22nd, and agreeable to your verbal request made to the writer yesterday, we have amended our quotation on the Kaustine Equipment which we consider necessary for the eleven schools on the Reserve.\n\nAs mentioned to you yesterday, we believe that two Units would be sufficient in Schools No.7 and 11, and that the only School that requires four units is the two room School Oseweken, namely #2. In addition to making the deductions to cover the equipment in both the Schools in question, we have estimated on installing the two Units in Schools No.6,8 and 9, without making any additions. As pointed out to you yesterday we have hundreds of School installations where we have installed our equipment in cloak rooms, and in many cases the floor space is not as great as you have in Schools No.6,8, and 9. We have figured that there will be approximately 45 square feet in the boys cloak room and the same amount in the girls cloak room at Schools No.6,8 and 9 without making any additions.\n\nTaking the above amendments to our proposal into consideration our price for twenty four Units in all, installed complete with the necessary partitions, cess pits, etc., would be $4,950.00, with the Government Sales Tax, and $4,775.00 without sales tax. We are preparing blue prints showing the layout on the Stock Schools namely No.'s. 1,3,4,5,7,10 and 11, also a blue print showing the layout without any alteration to No.'s., 6,8 and 9, and a blue print of the installation at #2. Trusting that our action in this connection meets with your entire approval, we are\n\nVery truly yours,\nKaustine Manufacturing Co.Ltd.,\nJ.F. Crowley\nPresident\n\nIndian Affairs.

Morgan,\nSuperintendent Six Nations Reserve,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to our correspondence with you regarding the question of equipping the Schools on the Six Nations Reserve with Kaustine Equipment, and also to our tour of inspection of the various Schools.\n\nAfter going over this whole proposition very carefully, figuring the cost of installing this equipment, making the necessary alterations in the case of the stock schools and the necessary additions to school Numbers 6-8-9, we have the honor to submit to you the following figure for which we agreed to do this work. Our price including the Government Sales Tax of 5% would be $6,350.00 and if this tax is not applicable, our figure in that case would be $6,190.00.\n\nAs suggested by you, we have figured on closing up the door between the boys and girls cloak rooms of the following schools, Numbers 1-3-4-5-7-10-11, and in place of this door, which will be sheeted up to conform with the interior scheme of the buildings, we would remove the one window in the girls' cloak room and replace it with a door which would then give a separate entrance to the girls and boys from the outside of the buildings. The understanding is that we will use the present door and frame which leads from the boys to the girls cloak rooms.\n\nIn compliance with your request, we have figured on 28 Units in all for the eleven schools, divided up as follows:\n\n| #1 - 2 Units | #4 - 2 Units | #7 - 4 Units |\n|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| #2 - 4 Units | #5 - 2 Units | #8 - 2 Units |\n| #3 - 2 Units | #6 - 2 Units | #9 - 2 Units |\n| #10 - 2 Units | #11 - 4 Units |\nLieut. Colonel Cecil E. Morgan:\n\nIt is understood that the Kaustine Equipment installed will be covered by our regular 15 year service guarantee, and that in the event of our being authorized to go ahead with this work, it is agreed that each School will be left in a clean and workmanlike manner after alterations or additions.\n\nIn the event of our being authorized to go ahead with this work, we are in a position to proceed immediately with the manufacture of the necessary equipment, so that operations could be commenced immediately the Schools are closed for the Summer Holidays, so as to make absolutely sure that all this work would be completed before the Fall Term commences.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nKaustine Manufacturing Co. Ltd.\n\nJ. F. Crowley\n\n[Signature]\n\nPresident\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith communication from the Kaustine Manufacturing Company Limited with reference to the sanitary closets for the Six Nation day schools.\n\nI also enclose plans.\n\nThis matter has been referred to the Six Nation Council but as yet has not been dealt with by the Council.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt. Col. Cecil R. Morgan,\nSupt. Six Nations.\n\nHH/B.\nENGS.\nOttawa, May 5, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, enclosing a communication which you received from the Kaustine Manufacturing Co., Limited, Dundas, Ont., containing an estimate of the cost and plans for the installation of their sanitary closets in the day schools on the Six Nations Reserve. In reply I beg to say that the Department will await the decision of the Council, to whom you have referred the matter, before any action is taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nLt. Col. G. E. Monger,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nOhsweken Council House,\nApril 1st, 1924.\n\nMinutes of Council Meeting.\n\nNo-2.\n\nCol. Morgan introduced the matter of putting in Kaustina Toilets in the schools on the Reserve, at an estimated cost of $5500.00.\n\nNo.3.\n\nAfter some discussion the Council decided to investigate the matter and appointed the following a committee to consider the subject and report:\u2014 Chiefs C. Garlow, Jno. A. General, Geo. Johnson and Dan McNaughton.\n\nDavid S. Hill,\nSec'y., S.N.C.\nIndian Office, Brantford,\nMay 9th, 1924.\n\nSir,\u2014\nNos. 2 & 3.\n\nA Committee was appointed but nothing as yet has been done. The Chiefs were hostile and I do not think that this will be approved by the Council. If it is considered desirable, should be proceeded without waiting further for the Committees' report.\n\nCecil E. Morgan,\nSupt. Six Nations.\nYou will remember that Col. Thompson recommended chemical lavatories for the schools on the Six Nations Reserve. An estimate of the cost of supplying the equipment and installing 28 lavatories in the eleven schools has been prepared by the Kaustine Manufacturing Company of Dundas. It will cost at least $5,000 to undertake this work and the Indian Superintendent was requested to bring the matter to the attention of the School Board and the Indian Council as it is a question that affects the reserve as a whole. The Council appointed a committee on the first ultimo and the Superintendent reports nothing has been done and he believes that it will not be approved by the Council.\n\nThere is no provision made for this improvement in the Estimates. I shall be pleased to have your instructions.\n\nRussell T. Oliver\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, May 16, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your letter of the 9th instant which has reference to the action of the Indian Council relative to chemical lavatories for the Six Nations Schools. In reply I regret to inform you that at the present time funds are not available in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the proposed installation. The matter will have to stand for the time being.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nLt. Col. C. E.

T. Ferrier Esq.,\nSuperintendent Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt the school board meeting held yesterday it was found that owing to the large increased attendance, consequent upon sending these children to Chapleau, there is a shortage of desk accommodation in the Six Nations Schools.\n\nIn the case of No. II the overflow was so great that it has been found necessary to hire the building and start a subsidiary school, which I have called II A, at which on the 20th of April when I inspected there were 24 children in the course of their studies and there will be some more in the next few days.\nThe school board has approved of the engagement of Miss Mildred Froman to conduct this school, subsequently the addition which is to be made to No. 11, for kindergarten classes at a salary of $800.00 a year.\n\nIt is found that we urgently need thirty-five new desks and a new teacher's desk and I would ask for authority to purchase these at once as the children are crowded two or three on one seat.\n\nI take this opportunity to say that I am extremely gratified with the result which the sending of these children to Chapleau has had upon truantage in the Reserve, it is quite wonderful.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt. Col. C.E. Morgan,\nSupt. Six Nations.\n\nGM/B.\nOttawa, April 25th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, in which you state that owing to the increased attendance at the day schools on the Six Nations' Reserve you have found it necessary to start a subsidiary school in connection with the No. 11 School, and that there is urgent need for more seating accommodation.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that approval is granted for you to arrange for the purchase of 35 new single desks and a teacher's desk and also a teacher's chair, if the latter is required. It will be necessary, however, for you to obtain competitive prices from the following firms, and you should place the order with the firm quoting you the lowest price F.O.B. the nearest railway station to the point of requirement:\n\nGlobe Furniture Co., Ltd., Waterloo, Ont.,\nCanadian Office & School Furniture Co., Ltd., Preston, Ont.,\nE. N. Moyer Co., Ltd., 100 Front St. W., Toronto.\n\nI may say for your information that single desks are manufactured in the following sizes to accommodate pupils of the ages mentioned:\n\n| Size No. | Pupils |\n|----------|--------|\n| 6        | 5 to 7 years |\n| 4        | 7 to 9     |\n| 3        | 10 to 13   |\n| 2        | 11 to 14   |\n| 1        | 15 to 18   |\n\nIn asking for quotations, you should be careful to give the size required and the number of each size. The teacher's desk we usually supply has three drawers down side and a drawer over knee space, size approximately 42\"x 26\". The chair supplied should match the teacher's desk.\n\nYou should obtain an account, in duplicate, from the firm from whom you make the purchase and this you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and send to the Department, when payment will be made. A memorandum should accompany the voucher showing the prices quoted by the above mentioned firms.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nLt. Col. C. E. Morgan,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nMay 4th, 1925\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir:\n\n\"Purchase of bats and balls for Six Nations Schools\".\n\nI note from your 32-7-5 of the first inst. that permission should have been obtained from the Department to order playground equipment as listed in the vouchers for $8.80 in favour of W. G. Hawthorne.\n\nThe question of the supply of playground equipment for the Six Nations Schools was discussed at the school board meeting, at which the Superintendent of Indian schools was present, earlier in the year and I then understood that he gave authority for the order of necessary supplies and it was for this reason that upon teachers requisitioning I purchased the goods.\nI regret that acting under this impression and the requisitions arriving from the schools simultaneously I have already ordered playground equipment for schools Nos. 7, 4, 10, 1 and 2.\n\nIn future all requisitions for such articles will be forwarded to the Department for sanction.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt. Col. C.E. Morgan,\nSupt. Six Nations.\n\nGM/B.\nOttawa, May 7, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your LOB/25/688 of the 4th instant, with reference to the purchase of playground bats and balls for the Six Nations Schools. I note that you have already placed an order for several sets of this equipment. With reference to purchasing equipment for the schools, I should be pleased if you would be guided by official letter of this file number of February 19th, last.\n\nYou were authorized to purchase, after securing competitive prices, two soft balls and two playground bats for each of the Six Nations Schools that have not already been supplied with this equipment. When you are submitting a certified account, in duplicate, in favour of the firm given the business, support it with an Abstract of Tender form showing who were asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nAs you were informed by Mr. Ferrier at the time of his last visit to Brantford, it was also intended to introduce Volley ball to the pupils of the Six Nations schools. The Department has special arrangements for the purchase of volley ball equipment and eleven outfits will be purchased and sent to you for distribution to the schools. Under separate cover you are being instructed to release Mr. W. G. Green from his duties as teacher of the No. 9 School and place him in charge of the athletic activity and physical instruction for all schools on the reserve. Mr. Green should make himself thoroughly acquainted with the game of volley ball and should make the best arrangements for hanging the nets at the different schools upon the occasion of his first visit to each. There may be some expense in connection with the standards for the nets. I believe it advisable to use poles which can be cut on the reserve and placed on suitable corners of the playgrounds as economically as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt. Col. C. E. Morgan,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. B. McLean,\nAsst.

Each outfit should consist of one net, one book of rules and two balls complete. The price usually charged this Department, plus express charges, will be allowed. When you are submitting your account, in duplicate, please attach the receipt for carrying charges.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMessrs.

As Mr. Orr, the Department Architect, has no doubt already explained, competitive prices will be called for the supplying of the paint necessary and the labour will be engaged on a day labour basis.

While the initial cost is somewhat higher, it is the cheapest in the end because of the fact that you cannot break it and it is so constructed that it cannot get out of order. It will give you better service and will stand up longer than any other desk yet produced.\nApril 30th, 1925.\n\nLt. Col. C. E. Morgan,\nSuperintendent of the Six Nations,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nRef: No.10B/25/632\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of April 28th addressed to Canadian Office & School Furniture Co. Limited, has been referred to us for attention owing to the fact that we are their Sales Representatives, and in reply we are pleased to enclose one of our booklets containing particulars of \"Preston\" Desks.\n\nWe presume that the style you have in mind is the Ball-Bearing Automatic Single, on the first inside page, and on the quantity you propose purchasing the prices would be as follows:\n\n| Size | No.5 | each | $6.25 |\n|------|------|------|-------|\n|      | No.4 |      | $6.50 |\n|      | No.3 |      | $6.50 |\n|      |      |      | $5.95 |\n\nRears, if desired, any size $5.95\nFronts, \" \" \" $5.95\n\nF. O. B. Caledonia, Ontario.\n\nIf you would like to have these desks set up, ready for screwing to the floors of the rooms, there would be an extra charge of 20\u00a2 each.\n\nYou are no doubt already familiar with the high qualities of the \"Preston\" Make. The iron standards are of a much heavier nature than those used in other similar makes of desks, while the wood parts are of maple, dovetailed, glued and finished to withstand the hard usage of the schoolroom. They will last a lifetime with little or no expense for maintenance. We hope that these features combined with the low prices quoted will enable you to favor us with the order immediately, and shipment will be made within twenty-four to forty-eight hours from the time instructions reach us.\n\nRespecting the Desk and Chair for the Teacher, you will find illustrations on pages 10-13 and the rates for\nthese, if requisitioned with the pupils' seating, would be -\n\nNo.1220 Teacher's Desk, Oak, each $17.50\nNo.1660 \" \" \" \" 27.50\nNo. 1880 \" \" \" \" 27.50\n\nNo.2060 Side Chair, Oak .... \" 6.00\nNo.2080 Arm \" \" \" \" 8.50\nNo. 720 Arm Tilter, \" \" \" \" 16.50\nNo. 500 Side Chair, \" \" \" \" 8.00\nNo. 510 Tilter \" \" \" \" 12.00\nNo. 520 Arm \" \" \" \" 13.00\nNo. 520 Arm Tilter, \" \" \" \" 20.50\n\nF. O. B.

M. HENDRY CO. Limited.\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary - Treasurer\n\nM/B\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI enclose herewith vouchers in favour of the Globe Furniture Company for the sum of $247.00 being for school desks and one teacher's desk and chair supplied the school board of the Six Nations Reserve and to ask that cheque issue in payment as duly authorized by your letter of the 25th. of April last.\n\nThe account is certified correct by the Trustee in charge of No. 11 school.

He has already paid out this amount for wages and indicates that another $450 is required. If it meets with your approval, I propose to send a further accountable cheque for $450 for labour and ask him to forward the account for paint, approximately $300, to the Department for payment.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education,\n\nIndian Affairs.

In this connection I beg to inform you that in August, 1925, we forwarded a number of books for the library at each of these schools. If it is considered that a further supply should be furnished, requisitions should be prepared by the teacher for a small number of books suitable for the purpose.\n\nNo. 3 School. The Inspector states that he found the pump broken.\n\nNo. 4 School. The new boys' closet is without an urinal.\n\nNo. 5 School. The pump needs attention, and the grounds are badly overgrown with coarse weeds, which should be mown. The clock needs repairing.\n\nNo. 6 School. The maps are in poor condition. They have been removed from the case, but have not been mounted on a board and so cannot be hung for use. The blackboards are unsatisfactory, and there should be an additional board on the north side.

The closets are on too low ground for wet weather. They need a little repairing, and both should be removed further from the school on to high ground.\n\nNo. 11 School. The closets are badly planned for privacy, as they are too near the open windows of the school room. It is also desirable that there should be a separate toilet for the use of the family occupying the residence. There is also not sufficient drainage for the cellar of the residence.\n\nPlease refer the Inspector's suggestions regarding the above named schools to the School Board for the necessary action in having any of the suggestions made by the Inspector considered advisable carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Minute No. 4 asks for a grant for money prizes for best attendance. It is not the practice of the Department to give money prizes for attendance at Indian schools and I doubt the advisability. Please ask the School Board to discuss this carefully and, in your next letter in the matter, let me know if was ever the practice of the Band to pay such grant from their own funds.

Six Nations.\n\nLt. Col. C.E. Morgan\n\nHH/MH\nNovember 14th, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to report that at my recent inspection of the Six Nations Schools and Class rooms I found the following matters requiring immediate attention:\n\nSchool No. 1 - Teacher Miss Julia Jamieson.\nThis school is much overcrowded the attendance being 51. The outhouses are in a bad state requiring repair and a general overhaul at a cost of about $25.00.\n\nSchool No. 2 - Teacher Senior Room, Miss Vera Davis.\nTeacher Junior Room, Miss Nora Jamieson.\nMiss Davis requires a new chair, the one she uses being broken beyond repair, and a new bell rope.\nThe board walk approach to the school is broken, full of holes and dangerous. I recommend that either a crushed stone walk with concrete curbs, or a concrete walk be installed.\nThe fence is in a bad state needing a number of new pickets.\nThe down pipes from the eave troughs have blown off and become lost in two places, and the eave trough flow is undermining the foundation.\nThere is one window broken.\nThe Class rooms are in good condition, and all else in this school is entirely satisfactory.\n\nSchool No. 3 - Teacher Miss Sylvia Jamieson.\nThis school is greatly overcrowded, the attendance being 62.\nThe pump is broken and useless and should be replaced.\nThe outhouses need repair.\nSchool No. 4 - Teacher Miss Elva Miller.\nThis school is satisfactory, the attendance being 27.\nThe pump is broken and practically useless.\n\nSchool No. 5 - Teacher Miss Mildred Frohman.\nThe outhouses are in a very bad state. They are hardly usable. The pits are full, and the majority of the boards require to be replaced. I estimate $50.00.\nThere is no pump, the old one having been broken for some time.\nThe hinges on the front door need repair.\nThe teacher complains that she has not seen her Trustee, Mr. Ed. P. Garlow since June. This Trustee does not attend to his duties satisfactorily, although he is a Councillor.\n\nSchool No. 6 - Teacher Mr. Winton Loft.\nThe outhouses are in need of repair.\nThe school is overcrowded, the attendance being 51.\nI think room could be made for from six to eight desks by moving the stove.\nThree window panes are broken.\n\nSchool No. 7 - Teacher Mr. Melvin Johnson\nRather crowded, attendance being 47.\nThe outhouses need repair.\nOtherwise satisfactory.\n\nSchool No. 8 - Teacher Mr. Oliver Smith\nSmall attendance 30. Good School.\nSlight repairs to outhouses.\nRooms rather dark.\nTeacher asks for another Black Board, 9 ft. x 3 ft.\n\nSchool No. 9 - Teacher Miss Helen Miller.\nThis school is in a dangerous condition, the wall bulging at the north-west corner. I have reported upon this under separate cover.\nThis is one of the schools which I recommended last year for re-construction.\nIt is small and very much overcrowded there being but 36 desks and 39 pupils, exclusive of the 8 Mississauga children for which there is no room.\nIf possible, instead of merely shoring up the back wall the room should be enlarged.\nFor present emergencies a further six or eight seats might be squeezed in by moving back the stove nearer to the back wall.\nSchool No. 10 - Teacher Miss Mary Hill\nAverage attendance 27 - 42 on list.\nThe outhouses good.\nEverything satisfactory.\n\nSchool No. 11 - Senior Teacher, Miss Violet Hall\nJunior Teacher, Miss Mina Hill\nSatisfactory except that the outhouses are much too close to the school and to the Teachers residence.\nThe Teachers complain both of the odour and the multitude of flies.\nThese outhouses should be moved away altogether.\n\nResume of report\nPumps - The system of pump and water supply in all Schools needs revision.\nThe pumps are open to the weather, to violent use by children and outsiders, and pump and well repairs form a considerable item in consequence.\nI think that a definite universal pattern of pump should be adopted as the old pumps wear out.\nOld pumps should be turned in and stored in the Roads Storage Yard where their unbroken parts would be available for repairs to others.\nA small lock up well house should be erected over each pump and pitchers or filters supplied to be kept full by the Janitors. The children who swing on the pumps and otherwise break them should not be allowed near them, and their use for watering cattle or other purposes by others should not be permitted.\n\nRelief of congestion.\nOwing to the depression, and the return to the Reserve of Indian families which work elsewhere in more prosperous times, some of our Schools show an increase which overcrowds them beyond their capacity and that of the Teacher to instruct them properly. This congestion is worse in No. 1, No. 3, No. 6 and No. 7. Number 9 being the worst I have dealt with under separate cover.\nThe congestion in Nos. 1, 3, 6 and 7 might be temporarily met by moving two walls at convenient locations, employing teachers who occasionally do supply duty temporarily.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt.Col. C.E.Morgan\n\nSupt. Six Nations.\nOttawa, November 24, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, reporting the various repairs, etc., required at each of the Indian Day Schools on the Six Nations Reserve. In this connection I would request that, in future, any matters affecting each of the schools form the subject of separate communications. This is necessary in order to meet the requirements of our filing system. We have separate files for each school and it was necessary, upon receipt of your letter, to have an extract made of your report regarding the needs at each school. You are being written separate letters regarding the repairs, etc., mentioned by you as being required at each of the schools.\n\nRegarding the No. 1 School, it is noted that the outhouses are in bad condition requiring repairs and a general overhaul, at a cost of approximately $25. Our funds this year are extremely limited and it will only be possible to authorize the work absolutely required. You may arrange to have the outhouses thoroughly cleaned and any minor repairs required to place them in a serviceable condition until next summer carried out. Please see that no unnecessary expenditure is incurred. After this work has been completed, please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost. You should keep the accounts for the expenditure incurred at each school separate, and, in forwarding the vouchers, state definitely thereon the school for which the work was carried out.\n\nWith reference to the resume of your report on the schools, regarding the system of pump and water supply, I have to request that you will inform the Department as to the type and cost of any new pumps that should be installed and the number required. Only the pumps absolutely necessary at the present time should be reported. The Department has no funds to provide a well house to be erected over each pump. When we have information as to the cost, etc., of the pumps, consideration will be given as to the new pumps that can be authorized.\n\nAs stated above, you will be informed in separate communications regarding the various repairs, etc., mentioned by you as being required at each of the other day schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I now beg to enclose copy of his estimate for the entire repairs necessary to schools, amounting to $854.34.\n\nI would say that I consider these prices fair and reasonable and recommend that Mr. Anderson be granted permission to carry out the work, as these repairs are all necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLieut.-Col. C.E. Morgan.\nCEM/WA.\nEnc. - Copy Estimate.\nOttawa, April 1, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, reporting on the repairs required to the various Indian day schools on the Six Nations Reserve, and enclosing a statement showing what repairs are required at each of the schools, together with an estimate of the cost.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that our funds for the present fiscal year are extremely limited, and, owing to the recent orders for strict economy, it will not be possible to authorize all the work as mentioned in the detailed estimate which you forwarded. Regarding the repairs at each school, I would request that you again closely check same and forward a further report stating only the repairs absolutely necessary at the present time and giving an estimate of the cost. The Department will be unable to authorize any large expenditure this year for repairs at these schools. When we have your revised estimate stating, in detail, the urgent repairs, consideration will then be given to authorizing having the work carried out.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to authorize the erection of well houses at the schools mentioned, or to supply water filters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nLt. Col. C. E. Morgan,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\n\"Repairs to Six Nations Schools\"\n\nIn accordance with instructions received in Departmental letter 32-1-5 of April 1st, I have gone further into the estimates for repairs to Six Nations schools with a view to reducing them to the minimum of cost. The following repairs are absolutely necessary and estimates as furnished by the Road Superintendent, Mr. Cleveland Anderson, are as low as they can possibly be kept. These are merely estimates by the Road Superintendent. I will call for local tenders on the reserve from men who do this kind of work and I cannot guarantee that the tenders received will synchronize absolutely with the prices I have given you, but I will do my best to have the work done as cheaply as possible.\n\nSchool No. 1. - Repair Outbuildings and fences; Material and Labour -- 15.55\n\nSchool No. 2. - Repair Fences, Eave Pipe and Windows, new gutter pipe -- 21.25\n\nIt is reported that the doors are not safe in this school as they open outward instead of opening inward and on windy days are liable to sweep the children off the raised steps. These are cheap pine doors and should be replaced, but I have not been able to obtain an estimate for replacing these doors with better doors and altering the method of opening at the time of writing, and I wish to show them to Mr. Orr. It has been suggested that porches should be erected outside these doors, and I feel that the Department would possible consider the expense unwarranted at the present time.\nSchool No. 3. -- Repair toilet and fences and Porch Floor; Porch supports are dangerous and must be replaced; concrete base of pump needs repair -- $50.00\n\nSchool No. 4. -- Repair fences and pump. -- $15.00\n\nSchool No. 5. -- Move Toilet and reshingel, Repair windows to school and doors. -- $50.00\nMoving of the toilet can be left till another year.\n\nSchool No. 6. -- Repair Toilet and Wood Shed; Smoke stack needs raising as the smoke blows down into the school room. I have, in consequence, raised this from $19 to -- $25.00\n\nSchool No. 7. -- Repair Toilet and fence; -- $20.00\n\nSchool No. 8. -- Repair Toilet and fence; -- $22.00\n\nSchool No. 9. -- Being inspected by builders in accordance with Departmental instructions next Thursday, and I will report under separate cover.\n\nSchool No. 10. -- Repair toilet and fence; -- $23.75\n\nSchool No. 11. -- Repair fence and pump. Move Toilet. Repair Junior Room Floor. Roof over porch leaks and new locks required on side doors. I will, therefore, increase this to -- $100.00\n\nThe item for cement walk for No. 2 School I have entirely omitted this year. I am asking the Roads Committee to give enough gravel to fill in between two curbs which will be temporarily made from the old wooden side walk. Labour and time for this will, of course, have to be paid, for which I have not as yet obtained an estimate.\n\nThis totals $342.55 and I would ask for authority to expend $400, which leaves a margin and the Department may rely upon the price being cut down as low as possible.\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt. Col. C. E. Morgan.\nCEM/WA.\n\nSupt. Six Nations.\nOttawa, August 3, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, stating, in detail, the repairs considered absolutely necessary at each of the Indian day schools on the Six Nations Reserve, together with an estimate of the cost.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging to have the various repairs as mentioned by you carried out at each of the schools. The total amount that may be expended for material and labour must not exceed the sum of $400, as this is the full amount available. This amount is to cover the cost of repairs at all the schools, with the exception of the No. 9 school. It is noted that you will forward a report as to what you would recommend be done at this school.\n\nIt is also noted you consider that the moving of the toilet at the No. 5 school could stand over for another year. However, if there are sufficient funds available from the above authorized amount, this work should be carried out when the other repairs are being made. If not, the moving of the toilet may stand over.\n\nIf there are sufficient funds, you may have the present pine doors at the No. 2 school replaced. We will have no funds this year to erect outside porches.\n\nAfter the repairs have been carried out, please forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, showing, in detail, the expenditure incurred for each of the schools separately.\n\nI am not enumerating the repairs, etc., to be carried out at each school, but only the work as mentioned in your letter above referred to is to be performed. The work should be completed before the schools reopen after the present summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nLt. Col. G. E. Morgan,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nAugust 8th, 1932.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\n\"Six Nations Schools Repairs\"\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd inst., No. 32-1-5, and have asked the Road Superintendent, Mr. Cleveland Anderson, to undertake the repairs to the Six Nations Schools referred to. As the time is drawing near for the resumption of school work, he will put the matter in hand immediately, and I would ask the Department therefore to be good enough to forward me a cheque for $400, receipts and vouchers for the expenditure of which, I will forward as the expenses are incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt.

This is to be used in payment for the labour only. All accounts covering the cost of materials should be in triplicate, certified by yourself and forwarded to the Department, when a cheque in payment will be sent direct to the firms from whom the purchase of materials is made. Later, you should account for the expenditure of the cheque by forwarding vouchers, in triplicate, in favour of the individual labourers employed.

The labour account paid by cheque No. 6283 contains payments to C. Anderson totalling $28.50 for services as foreman.\n\nThe labour paylist paid by cheque 6283 includes payments to A.E. Hill for seven hours work on School No. 2 and eight hours work on School No. 4 on Friday, August 19th.\n\nThe same paylist includes payments to Oliver Gurley for ten hours work on School No. 7 and ten hours work on School No. 5, on Thursday, August 18th.\n\nWill you please inform me if these payments are in order.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nAuditor General.\n\nThe Deputy Supt. General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 10, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to draw attention to the fact that on the 10th August the Department sent you official cheque No.10093 for $200.00 to defray expenses in connection with labour performed on Six Nations Day Schools. You submitted vouchers in this connection to the amount of $164.20, which vouchers are now with the Auditor General. The Department has received a letter from him in which he asks for particulars with regard to payments made.\n\nCleveland Anderson is on a regular salary of $75.00 per month as Road Superintendent. The labour account paid by cheque No.6283 contains payments to C.Anderson totalling $28.50 for services as foreman. If C.Anderson who is employed as Road Superintendent is the Anderson who was employed as foreman, a refund of $28.50 should be obtained from him.\n\nThe labour paylist paid by cheque No.6283 includes payment to A.E.Hill for 7 hours' work on School No.2 and 8 hours' work on school No.4 on Friday, August 19th. Explanation is required regarding the number of hours worked by A.E.Hill on the date mentioned. Did he work at two different places on that date?\n\nThe paylist includes payments to Oliver Curley for 10 hours' work on school No.7 and 10 hours' work on school No.5 on Thursday, August 13th. Explanation in this connection is required.\n\nIf an overpayment has been made in any or all\n\nLieut.-Col. G.E.Morgan,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nall of the above mentioned cases, refund of the same should be made. Your prompt attention to this matter will be appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN.C. Allen\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\nOttawa, April 10, 1933.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe: Labour Paylists - Six Nations Reserve -\nVote 201 - 1932-33\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 5th instant in regard to the above mentioned matter, I may say the Department is in correspondence with Mr. Indian Superintendent Morgan, and will write you when his reply is received.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN.C. Allen\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nThe Auditor General,\nOttawa.\nApril 21st, 1933.\n\nN. C. Allen Esq.,\nRepresentative of the Treasury,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\n\"Cheque No. 10093 - $200.\"\nRepairs to Six Nations School.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 32-1-5 of the 10th inst., reply to which has been delayed for information from the Roads Superintendent, Mr. Cleveland Anderson.\n\nI will reply to your queries in the paragraphic order in which they appear in your letter:\n\n(1) Mr. Anderson is employed as Roads Superintendent and is paid from Band funds and by the Province of Ontario. There is nothing in his appointment to debar him from undertaking work for the Department in other connections but as School Repairs are paid from appropriation neither the Indians nor the Province can be reasonably expected to bear the cost as would be the case if Mr. Anderson carried out this work in his capacity of Roads Superintendent. Mr. Anderson is the best man on the Reserve to carry out this supervision which he undertook cheerfully without interfering with his Road Superintendency work at my request, but if payment is refused on the grounds that he is a Departmental employee then a demand for a refund of the amount chargeable against the school grant on this work may be expected from the Roads Committee and the Provincial highways. This will complicate matters and create ill feeling all round. It will deprive me of Anderson's services for many such small jobs as he is most capable to undertake and add substance to the Indian contention, which I am anxious to avoid, that Band funds are used towards defraying school expenses.\n\nIt consequently seems that there are no grounds\nwhatever upon which we can ask Mr. Anderson for a refund. His efficiency leads to a considerable saving and higher standard in the work and I shall regard with regret any action by the Department that may bar me from engaging his services in future work of a similar description.\n\nThe pay lists of A. E. Hill and Oliver Curley were erroneously dated, separate services on different days being duplicated as having been performed on the same day. The pay sheets have been corrected and are returned herewith.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nLt. Col. C. E. Morgan.\nSupt. Six Nations.\n\nC.E.M.\n\nNote: Since writing the above I find that you did not return the Departmental copies of these pay sheets. The enclosed are therefore from the records of this office. Please return them.\n\nC.E.M.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDr. McGill:\n\nOn the 5th April the Auditor General called attention to a payment of $28.50, which was made by Col. Morgan, Six Nations Reserve, to Cleveland Anderson, the Roads Superintendent, for supervising some carpenter work done at No. 11 School. The Auditor General questions the propriety of this payment to Anderson in view of the fact that he is regularly employed as Roads Superintendent at a salary of $83.33 per month. (Until recently the rate was $75.00 a month), 50% of which salary is recoverable from the Ontario Government.\n\nThe matter was referred to Col. Morgan who has replied under date of April 21st, first letter down.\n\nThe point for decision is whether the Department wishes to authorize Col. Morgan to employ Anderson from time to time as foreman of small repair jobs so long as his road work is not interfered with and pay him from General Vote such wages as he may earn as foreman, in addition to his salary as Roads Superintendent.\n\nI understand that in view of half of Anderson's salary being paid by the Ontario Government and half from Trust Funds that he is not regarded as a Civil Servant; his position is, therefore, not covered by a certificate from the Civil Service Commission. For this reason I do not think Sec. 17 of the Civil Service Act applies, which prohibits any Civil Servant from receiving compensation for more than one position.\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo James L Sutherland, Limited,\n\nCHEQUE TO BE SENT\nCARE OF SUPT.

However, before any repairs are undertaken, the cost of which exceeds the above amount, you should report the matter to the Department, giving, in detail, full particulars as to the cost of materials and labour, as it is necessary that an encumbrance be raised to cover the funds required for the purpose. The cost of minor repairs which you are authorized to have undertaken, as stated above, is covered by a blanket encumbrance obtained from the Representative of the Treasury here. I may add that our funds this year for repairs are extremely limited, and no request should be made unless the work is absolutely urgent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt. Col. C. E. Morgan,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, May 5th, 1933.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 5th and reply of the 10th ultimo regarding what appeared to be irregularities in paylists covering labour on Indian Schools, Six Nations Reserve, during August and September, 1932, I beg to say that the Indian Superintendent has stated that the paylists in question were erroneously dated. He has submitted corrected paylists which are transmitted herewith.\n\nWith regard to payments made to Cleveland Anderson, the Roads Superintendent for supervising some repairs made to the Six Nations School, I might say that as Mr. Anderson is employed jointly by the Band Council and the Ontario Government as Roads Superintendent, he can hardly be classed as a Civil Servant. Therefore, any regulations relating to compensation for more than one position would not appear to be applicable in this case.\n\nIt might also be pointed out that Mr. Anderson is a very capable mechanic and his employment by the Department from time to time on minor repair jobs is felt to be in the interests of efficiency and economy.\n\nI trust you will find these explanations satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nThe Auditor General,\nOTTAWA,\nOntario.\nBrantford, Ont., May 25th, 1933.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nTo James L.

The cost of the wood for the schools on the Six Nations Reserve is paid from Parliamentary Appropriation, and it is, therefore, expected that you will arrange for the purchase of all wood required, and certify the accounts and submit them to the Department for payment.\n\nPermit me also to point out that it is unnecessary to have the Six Nations Council pass accounts covering expenditure at day schools. These expenditures are paid from Parliamentary Appropriation and should be certified by you and forwarded direct to the Department for payment.\n\nIt is noted that Norman Jamieson delivered mixed wood to the No. 4 school, but that you have arranged to have him replace the wood supplied by the proper wood.

Turnbull & Son for repairs to the furnaces at the Six Nations No. 2 School.\n\nThis account is much larger than we expected, and, as there are so many demands on our Appropriation, it will be necessary for you to keep the repairs at the other schools to the lowest possible point, as the amount of money which is available for repairs and improvements at the Six Nations Indian Day Schools is limited.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

No.3. and 2.No.5., which please supply with as little delay as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt Col C.E.Morgan.\n\nSuperintendent Six Nations.\n\nGEM/GEM.\nOttawa, September 4, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, regarding the repairs which have been carried out to the various schools on the Six Nations reserve. The Department notes that you have inspected the work and found it has been satisfactorily completed. It is noted, also, that you have arranged to have wooden covers placed on the small well houses erected over the wells at the No. 6 and No. 11 Schools and that the cost will be small. Certified accounts, in triplicate, covering the expenditure incurred, should be forwarded in the usual manner.\n\nRegarding the five additional desks required at the No. 6 School, I would request that you state the name of the manufacturer of the desks at present in use and also whether single or double desks are required. As it is necessary to have uniformity in seating equipment, if new desks are supplied, they should be of the same type as those at present in the school. The name of the manufacturer will, no doubt, be found stamped in the metal casing. When this information is received, consideration will be given as to whether the extra desks can be supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nLt. Col. C. E.

The walls are likely to crumble in sooner or later.\n\nSchool No. 10\nStake fence all round school is broken down here and there, requiring some scantlings, stakes and post. $10.00 would cover cost of repairs.\n\nSchool No. 11\nOnly repairs required is horse side walk, but this was authorized by the Dept. last winter, but weather would not permit, so it will be carried out now.\n\nIt will take 113 rods of nine wire woven fence to repair fences at schools 3-4 and 6. This will cost with discount $57.00.\nIn addition about 75 cedar and anchor posts will be required at the various schools for replacements, amounting to about $35.00 and whatever the labour costs of erecting these.\n\nEach fence fence is in a really bad condition, permitting stock to roam in the school yards at will.\n\nThe windows inmost of the boys and girls toilets are broken and I am informed they are frequently damaged after school hours. As they must be replaced to prevent snow drifting in during the winter and to save constant replacement I would request to be permitted to place over each window the heavy wire screening farmers use over box stall windows. The cost will not be great as they are not large windows, and I am sure it will be an improvement and economy.\n\nThere are a few other minor repairs at all the schools not detailed such as locks and hinges on doors, but I trust my discretion in the matter is sufficient.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nE.

Randle,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nSeptember 4th, 1936.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nThe returns of labour enclosed are for repairs to school floors, porches, sidewalks, etc., as authorized by your letter 32-1-5 of August 15th and letters 32-11-5, and 32-6-5 of December last.\n\nI regret to say the repairs on No. 1 School floor were much more extensive than expected. On taking up the floor where it was sinking it was found that dry rot had set in on all the sills except two along the entire north half of the School floor. A slight knock or kick with one's feet and the sill end resting in the concrete slot crumbled away.\n\nAs a result the whole half of the floor had to be taken up and re-silled adding considerably to labour and material cost.\n\nI am informed that this dry rot is caused by insufficient ventilation as the dampness that collects under the floor lies there instead of dispersing as it would if there were larger and more frequent ventilators.\n\nI would request that cheques be issued with regard to this labour as follows:\n\nD. Porter Jr. $8.80; D. Burning $22.05; O. Curley $22.05;\nD. Porter Sr. $2.00; and C. Capten $3.85.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. P. Randle\nSupt.

Bothwell, Hardware, Brantford, Ont., for supplies to Schools 1, 2, 3, 4 & 7, Six Nation Reserve.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. P. Randall\nIndian Agent, Supt.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI beg to submit for the consideration of the Department some work, repairs, etc., which I feel is necessary for certain of the Six Nation Day Schools.\n\nIt would be appreciated if your approval could be forwarded immediately if possible, in order the work may be carried out before the commencement of the school term.\n\nNo. 1. This school badly requires exterior painting, and would cost, using Indian labour and one coat of paint, approximately $50.00.\n\nNo. 2. This school is brick, but the window frames and doors outside require painting which I would recommend, as being in the Village its condition is most noticeable. It would cost approximately $20.00 to do the painting, and there are some repairs necessary to the eavestrough, costing about $15.00 including labour.\n\nNo. 4. This school must be eavestroughed complete at a cost, with labour of about $40.00.\n\nNo. 6. This school is in the worst condition of all and urgently requires painting inside and out at a cost of approximately $75.00 for one coat.\n\nThere are also some eavestroughing repairs necessary, costing about $15.00 including labour.\n\nThe stove is also warped and broken open on both sides and it is doubtful if it can be repaired. I would request the Department to give me authority to purchase a new one in the event of it being beyond repair. A new one is quoted locally at about $50.00 though hardware prices are constantly changing.\nNo. 7. This school should have one coat of paint on exterior at a cost with labour of approximately $50.00.\n\nNo. 8. This is the smallest school on the Reserve and badly requires painting inside and out at a cost of $60.00 with labour.\n\nNo. 9. This school as previously reported, urgently requires re-building and it is useless spending money on building repairs.\n\nIt however urgently requires a new woven wire fence. It will require 11 rods at 50\u00a2 per rod or a cost of $5.50. In addition there will be labour costs and some posts, which can be bought off the Reserve at about .20\u00a2 per post; Labour costs would be at .25\u00a2 per hour.\n\nA cupboard is also urgently required for books, etc.\n\nNo. 11. This is a two roomed school and should be painted inside and would cost approximately $60.00 with labour.\n\nIt is also urgently requires a new wire fence, taking 16 rods at .50\u00a2 per rod or a cost of $8.00 plus a certain number of posts and labour costs, the same as at No. 9.\n\nThere are of course, in addition, some minor repairs to all schools, such as window panes, door knobs, latches, etc.\n\nAlso each school needs one or two new blinds, and a certain number of new stakes for the front fences which in each case are stake fences.\n\nMost caretakers request extension ladders which they do not have, and it is really impossible for them to do much of the cleaning and repair work without them. A 33' extension ladder can be bought for $12.00 each.\n\nAll work and labour can be carried out by Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. P. Randle\n\nMajor E. P. Randle.\nIndian Superintendent.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, August 13, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of August 10th, in which you submit, for the consideration of the Department, a list of repairs which you feel are necessary at a number of day schools on the Six Nations reserve. It is noted that you estimate the approximate cost of the repairs in each case.\n\nYou are authorized to proceed with these repairs, on the understanding that the work can be undertaken and accomplished by Indians and that the cost of the work will not exceed the amount stated by you in your communication. It would be highly desirable if this work could be completed before the re-opening of the schools on September first.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor E. P. Randle,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nOn August 5th, under cover of my letter IOB-1338/37, requisition was forwarded to the Department for Supplies for the Six Nations and New Credit Schools.\n\nI would ask that these supplies be forwarded as soon as possible as the Teachers desire to have them for the opening of School on September 1st.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

I notice none of the schools are protected from lightning. This is a very rare occurrence in not having lightning protection on public schools. In fact, I don't think any more than five per cent are so protected.\n\nAs we will be here for a short time doing this work, I would like to know if you have any intentions of placing any protection on any of those schools in the Beaufort reserve. Please write to me at Hagenville if you want any work done on those buildings within a week.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nSix Nations Indian Day Schools.\n\nI beg to recommend after a recent inspection of the above schools, that the following improvements and repairs be carried out immediately while the summer holidays are on and the schools vacant.\n\nNo. 1 School. This school requires painting inside one coat will be sufficient, and using an Indian painter at .38\u00a2 per hour would cost with material approximately $60.00.\n\nSome eavestroughing repairs are also necessary, which will cost with labour approximately $20.00.\n\nNo. 3 School. This school requires painting inside and out at an approximate cost with labour of $120.00.\n\nThree large blinds 40\" x 8' at approximately $2.65 each, and two small 40\" x 4' at approximately $1.55 each.\n\nNo. 4 School. Three large blinds 40\" x 8' at approx. $2.65 and two small blinds at approx. $1.55.\n\nNo. 5 School. This school requires painting on the outside at a total cost with labour, of approximately $60.00.\n\nA new stove is required, local quotations being around $55.00\n\nTwo new blinds costing approximately $3.23, 48\" x 8'.\n\nThe fence surrounding the school is in good condition but requires taking down and restretching. This would require two men's time at .25\u00a2 per hr. in addition to a few new fence posts.\nNo. 6 School. A new stove is required at this school costing approximately $55.00, and five blinds 40\" x 6' at approximately $1.95 ea. Also a new fence, requiring about 40 rods at .50\u00a2 per rod, with labour at .25\u00a2 per hour and a certain number of posts at approximately .20\u00a2 each.\n\nA cement cover should replace an old wooden top over the well at a total cost of $20.00.\n\nNo. 7 School. One large blind at approximately $2.65 40\" x 8' and two small blinds 40\" x 4' at approximately $1.55 ea.\n\nNo. 9 School. Two large window blinds 36\" x 8' at approximately $2.30 ea. and all the walls should be washed, which would cost just the labour at .25\u00a2 per hour.\n\nNo. 10 School. This school require a new front door costing approximately $12.00 and a new desk for the teacher. Also four blinds 36\" x 8' at approximately $2.30 each, and eavestroughing completely at a cost with labour of approximately $50.00.\n\nNo. 11 School. Five large window blinds 42\" x 8' at approximately $2.65 ea. are required at this school.\n\nMost of the schools have some minor repairs necessary, such as a leaky roof, broken sidewalks, pump troubles, or outhouse repairs, mostly requiring the services of a carpenter and a little material, which with the Department's approval will be carried out, using Indians at .38\u00a2 per hour.\n\nAs none of the schools have flag poles, I would appreciate being given authority to place them at least six of the schools this summer. The original wooden poles rotted away and it is proposed to build the new ones from used piping, as the one recently built at the Council House, with a concrete base and would cost approximately $25.00 each.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. P. Randle\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nMajor E. P. Randle.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6167, file 434-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, July 15, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your LOB-1318/36 of the 8th instant, with reference to repairs and improvements that you consider required at the Day Schools in the Six Nations agency. As the cost of the materials necessary will not exceed $50.00 in the case of any one school, you may proceed with the repairs which you recommend at the following schools:\n\nNo. 1: - Interior painting - material and labour ... $60.00\nEaves troughing - material and labour ... 20.00\n\nNo. 2: - Purchase three large blinds and two small ones at prices quoted in your letter.\n\nNo. 4: - Purchase three large blinds and two small ones at prices quoted in your letter.\n\nNo. 5: - Paint exterior school, at cost, for material and labour, of ........... 60.00\nPurchase two large blinds.\nRepair fence.\n\nNo. 6: - Purchase five blinds at $1.95 each\nRepair fence.\nPlace new cement cover on well.\n\nNo. 7: - Purchase one large blind and two small blinds at prices quoted in your letter.\n\nNo. 8: - Purchase two large blinds and wash all walls.\n\nNo. 10: - Purchase new front door.\nPurchase four blinds.\nRepair eaves troughing at cost of .... .... 50.00\n\nNo. 11: - Purchase five blinds at cost mentioned in your letter\n\nAs the cost of the material required at the following schools will probably exceed $50.00 in each case, it will be necessary for you to let me have more specific information regarding what you require, in order that the matter may be placed in the hands of our Purchasing Agent:\n\nNo. 3: - Quantities and kind of paint required for interior and exterior painting.\n\nMajor E. P. Randle,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nNo. 5: More details regarding the stove required, stating the name of the local firm from whom you have secured quotations and their quotations.\n\nNo. 6: More details regarding the stove required, stating the name of the local firm from whom you have secured quotations and their quotations.\n\nNo. 10: New desk for teacher - Please let me have more details, also catalogue number, if possible.\n\nThe minor repairs mentioned in the second last paragraph of your letter may also be carried out.\n\nFrom the information given in your letter, I feel that we could provide the sum that would be required for the new flagpoles, in view of the fact that we have available an amount of $1,000.00 for repairs, improvements and new equipment required at the eleven schools in the Six Nations agency. At the same time, $275.00 (11 x $25.) seems to be a large sum of money to expend in erecting flagpoles. Is it not possible to erect these at a much lower cost?\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your 32-1-5 of the 15th of July I beg to advise you in regard to the material etc., as requested in the latter part of your letter.\n\nNo. 3 School.\n\n5 gal.

The quantities of these articles authorized in official letter of the 26th ultimo were much less than the quantity shown on the account and consequently it is presumed that this account covers the cost of paint and oil supplied to more than one school on the Six Nations Reserve.\n\nIn the circumstances, you should obtain new accounts from Scarfe & Company and each account should not exceed $50.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. HOBY,\nSuperintendent, Welfare & Training\n\nMajor E. F. Handle,\nSuperintendent, Six Nations,\nBrantford, Ontario.\nAugust 31, 1938.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nOn receiving your letter of August 22 the record was searched and it was found that your account for the washer supplied to the Lady Willingdon Hospital last year had been received by the Department, and recommended for payment, but that the account had not been delivered to the Department of Finance so that the cheque might be issued. I must apologize in this matter. We have many hundreds of accounts to deal with in a month and though we try to take all reasonable care it occasionally happens that one is overlooked.\n\nThe smaller account of $6.17 appears to be a matter for the attention of the educational division. Their attention is being called to it and I believe they will deal with it at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.L.

Painting throughout the interior of the building.\n\nNo. 10 School. Painting throughout exterior of building.\n\nNo. 3 School. Entire roof requires reshingling.\n\nNo. 11 School. East side of roof requires reshingling.\n\nApproximately 22 gallons of paint will be required which can be obtained from local Manufacturers at $2.90 per gallon. Indian labour to carry out this work will cost approximately $100.00.\n\nAbout 24 square of shingles will be required for the two schools referred to above and can be obtained locally for No. 13X quality at $4.75 per sq. In addition about 500 ft. of facia boards at $0.36 per foot, will be required. Indian labour for this work will cost approximately $70.00.\n\nAs the material required for both painting and shingling is not a large sum, it would expedite matters if this office could purchase same from firms on the approved list locally.\n\nIn addition there are minor repairs to most schools in the way of repairs to doors, floors, cupboards, savestroughs, etc. mostly a matter of labour and small quantities of material.\nYour early approval would be appreciated as with the new school and the work at the Mohawk Institute considerable effort will be required to get all done by the time the school year commences.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nE.

Indian labour for this work will cost approximately $60.00.\n\nAbout 37 gals. paint etc. will be required for the schools and can be purchased in 5 gallon lots at $3.05 per gallon. Labour for the work will cost approximately $100.00.\nMost of the schools require minor repairs to either doors, windows, fences, porches and desks, etc., which may run into $100.00 for material and $50.00 for labour.\n\nAll work of course in every case would be done by Indians.\n\nKindly advise if these improvements and repairs may be carried out, and if so may an accountable cheque for payment of wages be forwarded please.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE. P. Randle\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, July 16th, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant with reference to improvements required to the day schools on the Six Nations Reserve.\n\nIn preparing our Estimates for the current fiscal year it was only possible to include an amount of $500 for repairs and improvements to the Six Nations day schools. We have already expended an amount of $18.73 and there is therefore only $481.27 still available.\n\nThe total amount mentioned in your letter of the 12th instant is slightly over $500. Consequently it will be necessary to reduce the amount of work that you first contemplated doing.\n\nA requisition should be forwarded for the materials required in order that these may be secured by our Purchasing Branch. It is understood, of course, that the cost of material and labour will not exceed the amount available, viz., $481.27.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor E. P.

This amount will go largely\nin purchasing the various shrubs and plants required, for grass\nseed, and for other ground improvements.\n\nAs far as the Department goes, I would like to have\nauthority to repair fences where necessary, mostly broken\nposts, and some re-stretching. There will also be some stake\nfencing to repair and general repairs to outbuildings, porches,\nsteps, mostly of a minor nature.\n\nThen No.4 School should be painted on the outside,\nas it has not been done during the time I have been in charge\nof this Superintendency, and if possible on the inside. There\nwould also be some minor painting of fences and outbuildings.\nwhere they are repaired, in the cases of schools entering\nthe competitions - in order they would conform to the re-\nmainder of the woodwork adjoining.\n\nThere is, of course, a credit of $140.00 worth\nof paint on hand, but a certain amount more would be re-\nquired.\n\nAs these improvements etc. in order to gain points\nfor the schools, must be carried out before judging, I would\nappreciate if you would see fit to let me know what sum is\navailable this year for improvements and labour, and then\nallow me discretion in carrying them out as far as funds are\navailable, both to the schools in the competition and after-\nwards the others. If you approve of this arrangement, may\nan accountable cheque for $300.00 for labour be forwarded\nimmediately, please.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMajor E. P. Randle,\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa,\nMay 15, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, I am arranging to forward to you an accountable cheque for labour in making repairs at the day schools on the Six Nations Reserve. I infer, from your letter, that there will be some additional material required to complete these repairs. In this connection I would remind you of the purchasing regulations which provide for purchase to be made by the Purchasing Branch when expenditure for material at any one school exceeds $50.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor E.P.

If you want to put Major Randle to the trouble of securing a band resolution it can be approved under Section 92, Subsection 2, and you would be quite justified in doing so. If you feel, however, that you can pay the account without the resolution I would suggest putting the voucher through. There are so many irregularities of major importance in connection with our dealings with this band that I do not think we should unnecessarily add fuel to that particular brush pile.\n\nD.J.

It is not possible to estimate very closely on the cost of such work.\n\nSome schools require several loads of stone screenings around their yards to do away with the muddy conditions during the Spring and Winter months. We can obtain such screenings for approximately 45\u00a2 per ton laid down in the yards, and the total expenditure should not exceed $50.00.\n\nTwo schools require exterior painting, and we have the paint on hand, if the labour costs of around $150.00 could be provided by the Department.\n\nThen the kitchen in the residence of No.11 schools requires plastering and papering, the total cost of which would be with labour, about $40.00.\n\nLt.-Col.

The best No.1 Shingles 5X are quoted at $7.68 per square so the cost of shingles and nails would be about $385.00. Indian labour can be secured at $2.75 per square - costing $137.50, or a total approximate cost of $522.50.\n\nNo.7 School requires painting inside and out, and that at New Credit on the outside. As the paint is already on hand, there will be the labour costs, which will amount to approximately $250.00.\n\nIn addition there will be general repairs to fences, out-buildings, pumps etc., amounting to possibly $60.00 for material and $100.00 for labour.\n\nApart from the above repairs, this office would appreciate obtaining the following new equipment:- one new teacher's desk for the senior room at No.2 School, as the present one is very many years old and is completely beyond repair.\n\nThe No.4 and New Credit Schools require new clocks as the present ones are of most ancient vintage and no cleaning nor repair work puts them in running order. These can be secured as before locally at a price of $15.50 each, plus Government Tax of $3.88 each.\n\nIf the Department can authorize the above repairs, immediate advice would be appreciated, as workmen are all busy but must be secured at once in order repairs may be completed in time. May also the accountable cheque for $500.00 for wages please be forwarded with your approval.\n\n-over\nThe shingles can be secured locally, and it is assumed need not be obtained through the Purchasing Agent as there would be sure to be delay.\n\nLt.-Col.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: School Repairs.\n\nThe following essential repairs and maintenance should be carried out during the holidays to keep the schools in proper condition.\n\nNos. 4 & 5 Schools.\nThese two schools require shingling, and the shingles are already on hand. They will require approximately 50 squares and the labour at $2.75 per square will amount to $137.50.\n\nNos. 4 & 11 Schools.\nThe three rooms of these two schools, hall-ways, etc. require inside painting, the paint being already on hand. The labour costs are estimated at $400.00.\n\nNos. 1 & 8 Schools.\nThe wire fencing around three sides of these schools is almost useless, and they should be rebuilt. It will take 70 rods of woven wire at .58\u00a2 per rod, 70 posts at .40\u00a2, 6 anchor posts and 6 braces at approximately $1.00 each, or including brace wire and staples, a total material cost of $85.00.

Jarvis, Ont.\n\nI had another enquiry today from the War Assets Corporation, requesting to be advised if we want the above building. I was under the impression that I had written to you in the matter, but I am unable to locate a copy of the letter. I am certain I phoned you because Inspector Arneil told me that when he was in your office two or three weeks ago you were endeavouring to obtain prices but up to that time had been unable to do so.\n\nThe terms on which we can secure the building are as follows:\n\n1. The purpose of this letter is to ascertain whether or not your department is interested in purchase, our price being $500.00.\n\n2. It should be clearly understood that this building will be sold on the following terms:\n\n\"Purchaser is required either to remove or demolish the building, removing all materials from the site, leaving it clean and tidy, levelling any excavations or mounds resulting from the original construction or demolition to the original contour of the ground, to the satisfaction of a duly authorized representative of War Assets Corporation.\"\n\nThe quotation which you will have to obtain is to carry out their requirement No. 2, keeping in mind\nthat it will also cost us the additional $500.00.\n\nI wish you would give this matter your immediate attention and let me know, if possible, by Monday, next. I regret very much if this matter has been delayed due to any oversight of mine, but when I received the second letter from the War Assets this afternoon, I felt certain, as stated above, that I would find a copy of the letter to you on the file, but have not been able to do so.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nRA309 13=BRANTFORD ONT 31 221P\nPHILLIP PHELAND= 0501\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH DEPT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nOTTAWA ONT=\nPLEASE CANCEL REQUEST FOR AIR FORCE BUILDING TOO MANY OBSTACLES IN SECURING REMOVAL=\nEP RANDLE.\n\nCANADIAN NATIONAL TELEGRAPHHS\n\nIndian Affairs.

Employing Indian painters it is estimated the labour costs will be approximately $355.00, while the paint is already on hand.\n\nShingling - No. 10 School requires complete shingling, and while we have the shingles on hand, the labour costs at $2.75 per square will be $60.00.\n\nFencing - No. 1 School requires a new fence which will take 50 rods of wire and approximately 60 posts, with of course, brace wire, staples, etc., at an estimated cost of $46.00. The labour for putting it up will be around $25.00.\n\nGeneral Repairs - There will be the usual general repairs, such as broken fences, doors, gates, outhouses and some eaves-troughing, and the labour costs will run up to about $125.00, with the material costs somewhat uncertain, but probably around $75.00.\n\nIf the Department will approve of these improvements and repairs, may an accountable cheque to cover labour costs be forwarded amounting to $565.00, while the material will be vouchered for in the usual way.\n\nIn addition there will be the two buildings we expect to acquire from the Military Training Camp to be used as temporary school rooms at Nos. 7 & 8 Schools.\nThe possibility of moving these and the cost has not yet been ascertained as the two firms contacted are busy moving other buildings elsewhere, but expect to be through shortly.\n\nAlso after removal there will be some costs fitting them up as school rooms, but that will be mostly labour costs - transferring desks, seats, cupboards and shelves.\n\nLt.-Col. E.P. Randle\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, July 16, 1946.\n\nLt.-Colonel E. P. Randle, Indian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant,\nthe following repairs are authorized:\n\n1. Painting No. 1, No. 6 and No. 9 Schools - Labour $355.00.\n2. Shingling No. 10 School - Labour $60.00.\n3. Fencing the grounds at No. 1 School - Materials - $45.00\n   Labour - 25.00.\n4. General repairs to the other schools -\n   Labour $125.00; Material approximately $75.00.\n\nUnder separate cover you will be forwarded an\naccountable cheque for $565.00.\n\nBernard F.

This firm advises that they sell in carload lots only, and they suggest that the Indian Agent contact the dealers in the vicinity of Brantford for his requirements.

Morris:\n\nRe: Hipples, Internment Camps\n\nI have for acknowledgement your letter of November 13/46, regarding the freezing unit, electric motor, wire, pipe fitting, door, etc. and will be pleased to carry out your instruction regarding shipment of same to Indian Agent, MacKinnon, Sydney, Nova Scotia. In fact, I had a letter written to Mr. MacKinnon, asking him, if and when he could handle this unit, as I will be obliged to move it from its present storage at once.\n\nI have on hand 8 camp or barrel stoves. These will each take a 4' stick of wood and are only suitable for camps or large buildings. I understood you were building a camp on the Restigouche reserve for lumbering, if so, probably you could use some of these stoves. They are not new, but are in fairly good condition. I have no use for them at the present time and feel that they would rust and spoil with age, if kept in storage.\n\nWe also have 3 large water tanks, and two jacket heaters (coal). These might be used to advantage, at some boarding school or other place, if not, we will move them to Kingsclear.\n\n(Signed) Edward J. Whalen\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, November 21, 1946.\n\nLt. Colonel E.P. Handle, Indian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nStoves required for Indian Day Schools\nSix Nations Reserve\n\nThe department has taken over part of an Internment Camp near Fredericton, New Brunswick. We are advised by Mr. Indian Agent Whalen that he has on hand four surplus camp or barrel stoves. These will each take a four foot stick of wood and should be suitable for heating your new schools, until a better type of stove can be purchased. They are not new but are in fairly good condition. Could we please be advised if you would care to have these stoves shipped to you.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training\nOttawa, November 21, 1946.\n\nMr. E. J. Whalen, Indian Agent,\nFredericton, New Brunswick.\n\nReference - your letter of November 15.\n\nWe are writing to Lt. Colonel Randle, Indian Superintendent, Six Nations, Brantford, Ontario, who was enquiring about camp stoves. We will write you further upon receipt of an answer from him. Mr. Morris expects to be with you about December 5 and will advise you further regarding the water tanks and jacket heater. In the meantime would you store these supplies.\n\nCould we be advised as to the capacity of the water tanks.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept.

Randle,\nIndian Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nThis office regrets to advise you that some time on Saturday evening, No.1 School was broken into by apparently some intoxicated men, and a large amount of damage done, estimated at $250.00.\n\nEvery window in the school was broken including in most cases the sash; the teacher's desk and the clock were completely broken up, while the blackboards and school ladder were damaged, and books and papers were scattered all over the floor; one outhouse was demolished.\n\nAs the larger windows are eight feet in length, it may be some time before they can be replaced, as sash and glass are difficult to obtain.\n\nIn view of this the school will have to be closed for a few days, or maybe until September. If the sash and glass cannot be obtained immediately we shall have to board up all the windows, not only to prevent people getting in, but as this is the season of the year for heavy thunderstorms - to prevent heavy rains driving in and ruining the walls and floors, as the interior of this school was painted last year.\n\nIt would be appreciated if the Department would forward an accountable advance for $150.00 so we can pay the carpenters who will be employed repairing and cleaning up the mess.\n\nMay a teacher's desk also be ordered, as the one here is smashed beyond repair.\n\nIf the school remains closed, arrangements will be made to take care of the Entrance pupils elsewhere, and the other forms will have to be promoted on their year's work, as examinations have not yet been held.\n\n---cont'd\nThe caretaker of the school lives nearby, but as her vision of the school is almost wholly screened by trees and bushes, she did not hear anything going on until almost the end, - when the breaking of glass drew her attention.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nThe following essential repairs to the Day Schools should be carried out during the holiday season.\n\nNo.1 School\nPainting on outside. Cost - paint, oil etc. $45.00, labour $100.00.\nWoven wire fencing on three sides, and post and scantling fence at front. While it is not possible to estimate until the old fences are pulled down, exactly the number of posts and scantlings required, - the cost will be approximately material $65.00, and labour $35.00.\n\nNo.2 School\nThe flat tarred roof on this building is leaking in several places, and only expert roofers can repair this, but so far no firms engaged in this work have found time to come out and inspect it, - so the Department will perhaps leave this matter to my discretion.\n\nNo.6 School\nThis school, which includes a teacher's residence, must be painted inside and out. Cost of paint, oil, varnish etc., $80.00, - labour $180.00.\nIn addition, some of the panels of wall-board in the cloak rooms need replacing, as there are holes through them, and the steps and verandahs over the residence and boys' and girls' entrance require repairing, though the actual cost is difficult to estimate.\n\nNo.11 School\nThe stringers under the floor of the senior room have evidently given way through dry rot, and at least half the floor will have to be taken up and repaired as it has already dropped four inches. It is not possible to estimate either the time or material required for this until the floor is actually up, but\nbut it will not be under $100.00.\n\nA new full double bed is required here for the residence - and we can obtain a suitable one for $17.95. Also the wood box stove in the senior room is beyond repair and must be replaced.\n\nIn addition to the major repairs outlined, there are considerable minor repairs to other schools, such as broken doors, steps, toilets, fences, sash. One chimney must be pulled down to the extent of five feet and rebuilt.\n\nThe old stake fences at No.7 and 8 schools, which had to be pulled down to admit the new school buildings, will have to be rebuilt and will then be repainted to conform to the rest of the schools.\n\nTwenty blinds, 8' long, and six blinds 6' long are required, at approximately $4.00 and $1.50 each, are required as replacements.\n\nTwo wells require cleaning out at a cost of about $12.00 each.\n\nSeveral schools require extra cupboard space for books and stationary, but as we cannot get suitable material we shall build them some shelves.\n\nThis office would request your approval to carry out these repairs, and would request an accountable advance of $600.00 be forwarded to cover labour costs.\n\nIn addition your attention is drawn to the fact that the new double-roomed school at No.8 and the manual training school at Ohsweken, have yet to be finished as regards painting and siding, apart from the contractor's work, which is about finished.\n\nLt.-Col.E.P.Randle, Indian Superintendent.\n**APPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:**\n\n| CHEQUE No. | IN FAVOUR OF                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n|            | Sir Nations Indian Agency Trust Account          | $600.00|\n\nSend cheque to:\nLt.-Col.

The old wood shed is part of the former school, which is being moved away for a Community Hall, so we have to build a new one in the rear of the school recently moved in.\n\nConsequently will the Department please forward an additional advance of $575.00.\n\nLt.-Col.

F. Neary, Esq., Supt. Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Inspector's Report on Six Nations Schools.\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter of the 31st of July concerning recommendations made by the School Inspector, which we had not previously seen as Inspector Webster always sends his report direct to the Department.\n\nWith regard to the question of towels, this office is of the opinion that paper towels would be the most suitable in every way, as there would be great difficulty in getting the individual towels laundered and also to arrange suitable placement for them at the schools.\n\nThere might, of course, be some waste to paper towels, but that is a matter for the teacher to supervise and control. It is suggested that we issue them for a year and see as to the cost and the quantities used, and no doubt we could then tell as to whether unnecessary numbers are being used.\n\nIt would be best also to have the towel cabinets as advertised in the Geo.M.Hendry Company catalogue, under No.7-512, as they would probably help in economical use rather than the loose paper towels that many public places have.\n\nThe Water Container you refer to on Page 60 of the Hendry catalogue is suitable, and it would be satisfactory if we are supplied with them. Like the towels, the life of the containers would depend considerably on the supervision and discipline the teachers exercise over their class-rooms, as we have noticed in the use of water cups that some teachers have a much better system than others, and as a result much greater care is taken of them and their life is prolonged.\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF:\n\nVOTE ALLOTMENT ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO Lt.

B. F. Neary, Superintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to your 32-7-5 (WT) of the 30th of September 1946 authorizing the moving of two buildings from the Glebe Lot to the Mohawk Institute, to be used as recreation rooms for the boys and girls, at a cost of $550.00.\n\nThen on your last visit here you authorized an additional building to be used as a junior schoolroom.\n\nThese buildings are all in place now, and while not fully completed, are very nearly so.\n\nConsequently, as the contractor, T.J. Rispin, would like some funds, - this office recommends that he receive $500.00 on account, - and would appreciate an accountable advance for that amount being forwarded this week if possible.\n\nThe cost of the last building will probably be $400.00, as there is considerably more work to be done on a schoolroom than on the other two. All the windows have to be moved and also the doors, - blackboards put in, etc.\n\nLt.-Col. E.P.

Ross Schurr\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: School Bus Routes, Six Nations Superintendency, 1949-1950\n\nAs the present Academic Year is fast drawing to a close, it is probably wise to know the Departmental policy for the coming school year. Both the bus firms concerned who have been transporting the children to High School and the Manual Training Classes this year, are inquiring as to the possibilities of continuing next September. Mr. Schurr is prepared to continue transporting the children to Hagersville High School and to the Manual Training classes, but feels after his years experience that he should be paid at the rate of .42\u00a2 per mile, rather than the .35\u00a2 he now receives. A copy of his offer is attached.\n\nStyres Bus Lines, Ohsweken, which is owned and operated by a member of the Six Nations, is prepared to continue carrying the children to Hagersville High School and also the Manual Training classes and is prepared to accept the same rate this year, .35\u00a2 per mile. Styres Bus Lines are also in a position now, with two first-class Reo Busses, to take over all the School Bus Routes, if the Department consider the offer of Mr. Schurr too high.\n\nLt.-Col. E. P.

Randle,\nIndian Superintendent, Six Nations,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nSchool Bus Routes - Six Nations Superintendency, 1949-50.\n\nReference your 127 (32) of May 5 -\n\nIt is noted that Mr. Schurr wishes to raise the cost per mile of transporting these Indian children from 35\u00a2 per mile to 42\u00a2 per mile, effective 1 September, 1949.\n\nHowever, Styres Bus Lines is prepared to continue carrying the present group of children and also to add those children now being transported by Mr. Schurr. For these two routes the Styres Bus Lines would charge the same rate of 35\u00a2 per mile.\n\nI presume that the service rendered by the Styres Bus Lines has been quite as satisfactory as that rendered by Mr. Schurr and that these children will be transported as safely and carefully at 35\u00a2 per mile by the Styres Bus Line as at 42\u00a2 per mile by Mr. Schurr.\n\nIf this is so, we are prepared to recommend to the Director that the contract for transporting all these children for the academic year 1949-50 be awarded to the Styres Bus Lines at the rate of 35\u00a2 per mile.\n\nIn replying we would appreciate receiving a tender from Mr. Styres in accordance with the terms stated in your letter.\n\nBernard F.

Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Domestic Science Building\n\nWith reference to your letter 466-5 (E.1) of 4th of May, we would appreciate receiving the accountable advance of $300.00 for labour, as we have completed siding the building and have no funds to pay labour costs.\n\nAs material for partitions, door, hardware, will only run around $100.00, it is suggested you permit us to buy this locally, as it will be a lot of small items and acquiring a purchase order for such seems unnecessary and will cause much delay.\n\nThe same stands for the paint, turpentine, oil, etc., it will only take about 20 gallons, or say around $125.00 and if we buy locally, we can exchange colours quickly, whereas with purchase orders recently, we wait weeks.\n\nSince writing you before, we have found we have sufficient linoleum from Army Camp on hand to cover the floors, so as this will make a better appearing job than re-lining, we shall use it, so there will be no cost except putting it down.\n\nLt.-Col. E. P. Randle,\nIndian Superintendent\nJune 22nd, 1949.\n\nExtract from letter dated April 29th, 1949, received from Superintendent Randle. Original on File 466-5:\n\n\"May we also receive the authority to go ahead on the Domestic Science Building, so we can get it in operating order now, rather than wait to the summer holidays when so much other school work is done.\n\nYou have already approved of the installing of kitchen cabinets, etc., at a cost of $496.08, but there is the siding, painting and building of partitions. We have the insul brick siding on hand, but it will cost about $60.00 to have it put on by an Indian carpenter.\n\nWhile we did not reline the floors of the other army buildings used as schools, in this case, in view of the nature it is to be used for, it is felt a new floor should be placed in to give a first rate appearance and some cupboards, also a partition round the kitchen part.\n\nLabour and material for this will cost approximately $400.00. The cost of paint and labour for painting will cost approximately $200.00.\n\nIf the work painting, siding and carpentering can now be authorized, please send an accountable cheque for $300.00 then it will be possible to proceed at once and we can employ workmen who will then carry on with other school repairs after the holidays commence.\"\n\nExtract from official letter of May 11th to Mr. Randle in reply to the above.\n\n\"From the last four paragraphs of your letter, we understand that material and labour for repairing the Domestic Science building will amount to $660.00. You should forward a requisition immediately for the material required so that purchase can be made through our Purchasing Branch. Under separate cover we will forward you an accountable advance for $300.00 for labour.\"\n**REQUISITION FOR CHEQUE**\n\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\n**DEPARTMENT:** Mines and Resources  \n**BRANCH:** Indian Affairs  \n**DATE:** 4 May 1949\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE No. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | Six Nations Indian Agency Trust Account... | $300.00 |\n\nSend cheque to:\nMr. E.F.

The have very good school houses at Sagamore and Spanish schools. The teachers live in the schoolhouse and seem to be quite contented. To teach there attendance has not been very good owing to the Indians having been away working in the woods and having their families with them and as soon as they get back to the woods they have gone to Sugar Moccasin. The school at Cutler (Sagamore River Band) is I think doing pretty well at Mississauga they seem to get along fairly well.\n\nAt Sherraton they are not doing so very well as I would like there is a great many of the people opposed to the teachers and are continually making charges against him which when brought facts to hand they cannot make good. The teachers all complain that the parents are at fault as they will not compel their children to attend school and all wish something could be done to compel them to send their children to school regularly.\nI think the teachers are all doing their duty as far as they can,\nand I am in hopes we will get along better in the future.\nWhen I visited Sagamook and Spanish\nSchools I had a hard time of it.

(RG 10, Volume 6169, file 435-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nDear Mr. Hagan,\n\nReferring to the Church of England Mission on the Spanish River. The first record we have of work done there by us was in the year two thousand eight hundred and seventy-five when four of the Indians were baptized by Rev. Portland Hill of Shingwauk. Visits were made to the Indians from time to time but no establishment was made on the way of building church or school.\n\nI made my first visit in 1875, in the winter. I held Divine Service and...\ncontained my instructions. The following year I baptized an old man and his son. Then I visited the Indians at the Sugar Beach and baptized the family of Kauchibulgha who was formerly known as Big Indian John. There were five or six children\u2014the eldest almost grown up. The following summer I baptized family of Wabaskishing and Ogahie connection. The mother's family were baptized\u2014some of whom were very young. All these were heathen previously. Then Bishop Sullivan visited the village and arranged for funds to build a school house and place of worship. There were then from 25 to 30 persons members of the Church of England.\n\nWhen the matter was proposed by Bishop Sullivan, his lordship emphasized the fact time to time that through Roman Catholic inhabitants there were Roman Catholics in effort had been made to establish a mission or a school. All the Indians agreed to support the school if it were built. The Indians worked building without any remuneration. The Bishop of the Department agreed supplying material. A teacher was found who wished to catechist under my direction. The Department sent the Church together supplying his salary. He left after several years work and the former stipend filled his place. With reference to the others were gathered in others were gathered in other places time to time. Chief\nDear Sir,\n\nAbout two months ago I saw at Wabigoon minister who lives on the shore of the Spanish River. He spoke to me of the so-called School of the Church of England that is on the other side of the river in the Indian reserve. That school, he said, has not been built by the Church of England, but by the Department with the money of the band; the majority of the Indians living there are members of the Catholic Church. Does it not seem that the school ought not to be a Church of England's school, but a public school, if not a Catholic separate school? Besides, he said, I see that the English minister holds his services in the school, whereas he likes, while the minister of the Catholic church, the priest cannot enjoy the same privilege, the key being refused to him.\n\nSince then I notified the Priest in charge of those missions, Rev. Father Smith, and asked him to give the families and make an exact census of the population. Sadly, this Reverend Father wrote to me that there are on the River a total of 99 persons, 60 Catholics, 32 Protestants, 7 infidels. \u2014 Ten children about go to school, among whom only are Protestants, and beside them 2 sons of Bohemia are said to be now at the institution of Shingwak near Baie St. Marie.\n\nMay I ask you, dear sir, to look carefully into the case and to report to the Department. We ask that the school be no more a school of the Church of England, but a public school, and that as long as the majority of the children is Catholic and their teacher Protestant, no teaching of religion be given by that teacher; we ask besides that the priest as well as the minister may have the advantage to use this school building for religious service.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It ought to be moved nearly a mile to the mouth of the River.\n\nS. Demain, dear Sir,\n\nYour servant in the Lord.\n\nG. A.
