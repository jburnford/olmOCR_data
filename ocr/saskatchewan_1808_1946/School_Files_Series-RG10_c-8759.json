July 18th 1901.\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.\nGenl. Ind. Agt.\nVictoria.\n\nSir:\n\nI recently paid an official visit to the Schools and Missions of the Presbyterian Church in Canada on the West Coast of Vancouver Island, and was surprised to learn that the Roman Catholic Church contemplates to send a Priest to Ahousaht. While I admire the patience, & perseverance of the pioneer missionaries of that church here and elsewhere, I certainly think that the sending of a Priest to Ahousaht is a work of supererogation. The Presbyterian Church in Canada opened a School and established a mission there years ago, when the place was destitute of any agency for the Improvement of the Indians. An excellent School house and a dwelling house were erected at considerable cost. For years a Teacher was paid by our church, without any assistance from the Government. We pay now the full salary (minus the Government grant of $300.00) of two Teachers a Principal and an assistant. The School, as you know, is a Government School, conducted under Government regulations. It is one of the largest, best disciplined, and most proficient on the west coast, beside there are now peace and harmony among the Indians, who have confidence in our Church and workers there.\n\nIn view of these facts, I hereby on behalf of the Synod of the Presbyterian Church in Canada enter my protest against any Priest or any Agent of the Roman Catholic Church going to Ahousaht, and respectfully petition that you will not grant permission to the sending of a Priest or any Agent of that Church there, or sanction anything that may endanger harmony among the Indians, or in any way interfere with our school and work.\n\nHoping you will give this matter the consideration it deserves.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours Truly.\n\n(sgd) J. Campbell.\n\nConvr. F.M.Com.\nI have the honor to forward herewith for the information of the Department a copy of a letter of yesterday's date today received from the Reverend Dr. Campbell, of the Presbyterian Church, of this city, in which he states that on the occasion of his making an official visit to the missions of the Presbyterian church on the West Coast of Vancouver Island, West Coast Agency, he learned that the Roman Catholic Church authorities contemplate placing a priest at Ahousaht. The doctor does not give the source of his information and I have accordingly sent a copy of his letter to the Right Reverend Bishop Orth of this city for information relative thereto as well as to Mr. Agent Guillo for a report from him into all the particulars of the case. It is curious to note that the Reverend Dr. Campbell protests against the alleged contemplated action of the Roman Catholic Church authorities in this case, in view of what has transpired in connection with\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nwith the proposed stationing of a Presbyterian missionary at Nootka as reported to the Department in my letter of yesterday's date, No. 176, U. S., and in this connection I herewith enclose for your information and instructions in the matter a copy of a communication of even date from the Reverend Dr. Campbell in which he seeks permission to allow the Rev. Thomas Oswald to enter upon the Nootka Indian reserve in order to conduct general missionary work there. I have asked Mr. Agent Guilled for a full report on this application and when received it shall immediately be transmitted to the Department.\n\nIn the meantime I have advised the Reverend Dr. Campbell that the authority he seeks cannot be granted until such time as the Agent has visited the reserve, ascertained the attitude of the Indians with respect to the question and a full report submitted to the Department for its information and instructions.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obed.

MISSIONARY ACTIVITIES.\n\nBishop Segher and Father Brabant left Victoria on the 15th May 1874, having in that year visited the Indian Bands on the west coast of Vancouver Island and baptised several hundred children. The details of this trip are given by Bishop Segher, and the following are a few extracts from his diary:\n\nMay 13th 1874; arrived at 9 A.M. at Ucluelet. Our boat was heard thundering voice, but we were told he did not translate words with much correctness. Perhaps he thought that he had the desired effect. I baptized seventy-five children this afternoon.\n\nApril 16th, entered Dodger's Cove at 1 P.M. On this day I wrote: \"In this and in every tribe on the coast instructed by stating who we were, what was our object. Then came the story of the creation, the fall of man, the deluge, the languages, the redemption of mankind; after which, the Native baptism was administered to their little ones. If time was left, a few hymns and songs were taught. I also used the teaching of the Sign of the Cross and the making of the sign by the Indians was the great thing and caused real joy. In this camp eighty baptisms of children.\"\n\nThis extract indicates the general mode of procedure employed by the missionary. He returned to Victoria on the 15th May, having completed the visit and baptising between seven and eight hundred children.\n\nIt is upon such work the Roman Catholic Church claims to have pre-empted this whole region, and apparently are credited with baptising Indians in Government reports.\n\nMATS TO SCHOOLS.\n\nOn page 96 of the same book Father Brabant says: \"I discussed with Bishop Segher the idea of a Boarding School for our children. I wrote to the Indian agent who promised that he would see that the support of the teachers and children from the mission funds. Next I was sent for and this same agent urged me to go at once, and said that as soon as the school opened the per capita grant would be available. I was very disappointed by the Agent, and so I returned to Victoria, where I thought that the efforts of the rotester would be more available.\n\nThe school was abandoned at that time, but four years later it was revived. He wrote: \"I am obliged to write to you for information from Bishop Christie with this regard. I want to consult you about the education of the Indian Children of the Mission, and have obtained...\"\nit will be given to one of the sects; your children will be perverted and you will lose the fruit of your labors.\n\nOn page 38 are the words; 'October\u2014our school is now built' i.e. at Clayoquot.\n\nPER CONTRA:\n\nThe Presbyterian Church opened a day School in Ahousaht seven miles from Clayoquot in December 1896. No mission work of any kind had been done there since 1890, until Mr Russell our missionary opened the school. Year after year we made application for a Board Grant until 1900 when it was finally granted.\n\nIt was built in 1896 - Boarding School at Ahousaht to forty children. The Government granted \u00a3500 towards the building, but not until 1900 was the usual boarding grant given although application was made from year to year.\n\nIn the meantime the Roman Catholic Bishop goes to Ottawa with a per capita boarding school grant for fifty children at Clayoquot where they had formerly had no school.\n\nFor several years the tribes in Nootka Sound had been begging for a teacher and school. They had sent delegations to Ahousaht, and stating that although a pilot was stationed at Nootka sixty-seven miles south of Nootka, he only visited them once or twice a year and did nothing for them. We sent a delegation under solicitation and sent Mr. Russell of Victoria to visit them in June last. The Indians there urged him to remain and start a school. He returned to Nootka and signed by the second chief and other leading men of the Band. The first Chief and his son, chief alone, refused to sign. They were very displeased.\n\nMr. Russell accordingly decided to remain, rented a house and opened a school. Probably the Roman Catholics who had formerly been opposed to the Indians opening an opposition day school, opened an opposition day school, probably in Victoria. Mr. Fowl in response to a letter to Mr. Oswald ordering him to close the school, wrote Mr. Oswald thinking it better to keep the school open. Mr. Gillod when asked the reason for the school, said that the Indian Act does not prevent it.\n\nWe have interpreted the interpretation of the act in the manner which we thought best after repeated invitations to Mr. Fowl to attend every step on the approval of the act. We have taken in the meantime, but it seems to us that these measures shall prevent us from seeking to do good to these people. There can be no other purpose of any ecclesiastical advantage.\nToronto, 223118\n\nThe Commissioner thinking that very strong power would raise water such a height, and also that eight hundred feet would be expensive, deems it better to try and get accordingly informs us that he has placed in it purpose.\n\nApplications will receive favorable\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nIt is accordingly deemed necessary in order to keep these children in regular attendance and give them the best possible advantages, that a Boarding School be erected at Ahousaht. With that object in view, application is now made for a Boarding School Grant for fifty children.\n\n3. SHOAL LAKE BOARDING SCHOOL:\n\nThis is a new school and the main building is about completed, and has cost us so far $3000.00. There will be added next summer an addition for kitchen &c., the whole being planned to accommodate forty children.\n\nThere are about four hundred and fifty Indians on the South and West of this Lake for which no provision is made.\n\nThis application has been presented to the Hon. Commissioner Laird, and he has notified us that he has placed in the estimates $2160.00 for this school, being the usual Boarding School Grant for thirty pupils at $72.00 per pupil, and $150 for purchase of school desks.\n\n4. GROWSTAND WATER SUPPLY.\n\nThis matter was already before the Department this Water has hitherto been drawn from the Assiniboine River from a point about one-half a mile away, and up a steep Not only is the labor great, but the quality is at a cent not good.

General of Indian Affairs,\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nI am instructed by the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada to make application to the Department of Indian Affairs for the following Grants:\n\n1. DAY SCHOOL GRANT FOR DODGER'S COVE.\n\nIn this Band located in Barclay Sound there are two hundred Indians. Our Missionary has labored amongst them for six years, and a Day School was opened in March 1899. There are thirty-two children enrolled and an average attendance of thirteen. The application is for a Day School Grant.\n\n2. BOARDING SCHOOL GRANT FOR AHOUAHT.\n\nThere are nearly three hundred Indians in this Band, and there are one hundred and one children under sixteen years of age. A Day School was opened in December 1895. For five years previous no Mission work of any kind had been done in that village. During the last year sixty-eight children received instruction in the School, but fifty-six was the highest number on the roll at one time.\n\nThe Day School Grant was given to this school in 1900.\n\nIt was thought when the Alberni School was built in 1896 capable of accommodating from forty to fifty children, it would afford sufficient accommodation for the tribes on the Coast. But it is already full and very few of these are from the Coast Tribes. It was found indeed that Alberni is beyond the sphere of the Coast Indians and that they will not send their children so far.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 29th November, 1901\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nWith respect to the application made by Rev. Dr Mackay, Secretary of the Foreign Missionary Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada on the 7th instant for grants to certain schools now carried on by them and for the establishment of other schools, I beg to say, regarding the request for a boarding school grant for 50 pupils at Ahousaht in the West coast Agency of Vancouver Island, B.C., that it is for the Department to decide, first, whether another boarding school is necessary in this agency; second, if considered necessary, where it should be located and third, under whose control it should be placed.\n\nThere are two boarding schools now in operation in this Agency, one at Alberni conducted by the Presbyterians and the other at Clayoquot carried on by the Roman Catholics, with provision at each school for 50 pupils, which can be increased if occasion arises.\n\nThe last census of this agency gives a total of 2479 souls including 723 children under 16 which would make the school population of about 400.\n\nIn addition to these two boarding schools there are six day schools situated at the following points:\n\nAhousaht...Presbyterian\nUcluelet...Roman Catholic\nSpitset...Roman Catholic\nActess...known to Dept. as Kyasquet\nNitinah...Methodist\nOhiat...Presbyterian, which receives no grant, and is presumably the Dodger's Cove school for which provision will be made next year.\nThe day school at Ahousaht where the Presbyterians wish to establish a boarding school is the largest and best attended of any in the Agency, nearly all the children of school age (about 60) are enrolled at this school and are fairly regular in their attendance, the average for last year being 40. The Indians of this reserve do not take their wives and families with them when they go salmon fishing, sealing or hop picking as almost all the other Indians on the West Coast do, which accounts for their progress and regularity. While a boarding school would ensure constant attendance and quicker progress it is a question whether what they can acquire at the day school will not be sufficient for their future needs. It is well \"not to forget wisdom in teaching knowledge\".\n\nThis reserve is small and the children as they grow up will have to live as their parents do now by sealing, fishing and native industries, and it seems to me that they will be better fitted to follow these pursuits, which are taught them by their parents while they are young, than after several years residence in a boarding school. Of course there will always be orphan, neglected and infirm children requiring the care and attention afforded by a boarding school, but their number will be small and they can be provided for at existing institutions.\n\nThe West Coast Indians are said to be industrious and fond of earning money and were it not for the competition of Chinamen and Japs in the canneries, they would be well off; as it is they are independent and provide for their own wants and the feeling of dependence and unreliance that life in a boarding school engenders, would be a set-back to the\ncivilization they are working out for themselves through necessity.\n\n2. Although the Presbyterians are in a small majority at Ahousaht the census returns show that all the Indians on the surrounding reserves and to the north are either Roman Catholics or pagans. The Roman Catholic boarding school at Clayoquot draws its pupils chiefly from the section of country in which the Presbyterians wish to locate their boarding school, while the Methodists claim nearly all the Indians about Nitinaht (south-east of Barclay Sound) and would certainly object to any recruiting being done in their mission field. The last census credits the Presbyterians with only 375 adherents out of a total population of 2480 in this Agency, while the Roman Catholics have 961 and the Methodists 178 and the remaining 966 are given as pagans, who offer a field for missionary work for any religious body desiring to enter it, but they should do so at their own expense as the Department should not be expected to pay for making converts to any particular creed.\n\nI do not see, therefore, that the Presbyterians have any strong claim to Government support for another boarding school at Ahousaht or elsewhere in the West Coast Agency at present.\n\n3. In my memorandum of the 26th instant I referred to the trouble the Department has to contend with on account of disputes between opposite religious denominations in their endeavors to obtain Government support for their schools. When preparing the memorandum referred to I had not the \"Notes re Indian Work B.C.\" submitted by Dr Mackay before me, but after reading these notes I am more than ever\nconvinced that whatever concessions are made to the one will be demanded by the other.\n\nI may remind you that the School Vote for the current year is over $400,000.00 and the increases asked for that have so far come under my notice, will, if granted, require a vote of nearly half a million for next year, which is a pretty heavy outlay for the results obtained and I am inclined to think that if the greater part of this money, which is paid over to missionary societies for education, had been expended by the Department under an improved system, Indian civilization would have advanced more rapidly.\n\nMartin Browne\nUcluelet 50 miles from Alberni\nDodgers 12 miles South of Ucluelet\nAhousaht 38 miles North from Ucluelet\nNestighmat 27 miles North of Ahousaht\nNovalka 25 miles North of Nestighmat\n\nRev.

Dr Mackay, contained in his letter of the 7th instant.\n\nThe undersigned begs to say first with respect to the application for a day school at Dodger's Cove that this matter was previously brought to the attention of the Department by Rev. Dr Moore on behalf of Dr Mackay in May last, who was then informed that the Department did not know the locality called Dodger's Cove or whether the Presbyterians had a school there or not. In dealing with applications for the establishment of schools by religious bodies the Department is obliged to have recourse to its own census returns to show how many Indians belong to the particular body making application. The last return shows that the Presbyterians have adherents in the West Coast Agency of Vancouver Island, the Methodists 216, Roman Catholics 269, the remaining 319 being pagans. The largest Presbyterian population is at Ahousaht where there are 80, as against 75 Roman Catholics and 11 pagans.\n\nThe Roman Catholics protested against the Presbyterians carrying on missionary work at Nootka which is in this neighborhood and the Rev. Mr Oswald, the Presbyterian missionary who contemplated establishing a mission in that locality is reported to have discontinued his work and returned to Victoria. A very lengthy protest has been received from Rev.\nMr Swartout, Presbyterian missionary at Ucluelet, against the Roman Catholic bishop and Mr Supt Vowell in, as he says, forcing Mr Oswald to retire. This letter was only received today, and was sent direct to the Department.\n\nThe Presbyterians have a boarding school at Alberni and the Roman Catholics have a similar one at Clayoquot. This about evens matters in this locality. If a further grant is made to a Presbyterian boarding school at Ahousaht, the Roman Catholics will no doubt consider themselves ill-used.\n\nWith regard to the Shoal Lake boarding school I may say that this matter has already been before the Supt. General and is being dealt with by him.\n\nReferring to the water supply for the Crowstand boarding school, I beg to say that the Indian Commissioner who was communicated with in this matter, reported on the 15th May last that the management of most of our boarding and industrial schools has been at fault in this matter. Buildings having been located with very little consideration as to how they are to obtain a sufficient water supply. He considers that tests should have been made at Pelly to ascertain whether an artesian well would have been a success or not before the school buildings were erected and while agreeing that the school should be assisted to improve its water supply, both from a sanitary and protective point of view, he does not think that money should be expended for this purpose until an engineer or other qualified person examines and reports on the best method of ob-\ntaining such supply, whether from a well or from the Assiniboine River.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It may be possible that something may be done with regard to this matter from our general vote but I am not in a position at present to make any definite promise.\n\nI may further add that the estimates for next year contain an item of $750. for a water supply at Crowstand boarding school.\n\nEnclo.

The charge is one that is frequently recorded on the court minute book, supplying intoxicants to Indians, but there are circumstances in connection with this case which, if proven, make one of the offenders liable to further prosecution and punishment of a more severe nature than that provided by the Indian Act.\n\nTwo men named Oleson and Carlson are charged with having been present at a West Coast Indian Maggie and her ten-year-old daughter, Mary Ann. According to the klootchman's story, as told by the child, the mother and daughter on being liberated from the police station last Friday evening went to the Clarks' cabin in the Harbor cottages. Both Oleson and Carlson were there, and at once proceeded to give them liquor. Carlson giving the girl two glasses half full, and mother ten grams to him seventy-five cents to get another bottle of whisky, which he did. Both also drank. The girl were drunk when they went to sleep.\n\nNext morning Oleson gave the child some more whisky. The mother and Carlson got a couple more bottles of liquor, and he did so, but didn't return any of the money. She and the two men drank the whisky.\n\nThe child's evidence substantially corroborated the story told by the mother regarding being supplied with liquor by the two men. Both prisoners asked a number of questions of the witnesses.\n\nThe case was adjourned until this afternoon. The accused unable to speak either English or Chinese, and an Indian woman acted as interpreter while her evidence was given. Later the defense went down to the Harbor cottages on Saturday morning and found both mother and child ill, the mother in particular in most deplorable condition. Both Carlson and Oleson pleaded not guilty.\n\nAn assault case in which a man named Glenn is the accused and John James the complainant was called, but remained uncharged. Erskine was charged with vagrancy and was remanded until Thursday. He pleaded not guilty.\n\nAn Indian and a white man were both fined $5 for drunkenness. Phillip Chalk was also an offender in this particular. He was in a very peculiar state of mind when questioned and pleaded guilty in a mournful tone, while a sombre shadow flitted over his face, testimony as he \"hoped\" of the trouble into which his insatiate thirst was constantly bringing him. He was fined $7.50 or fifteen days' imprisonment.\nTo\n\nThe Honorable Clifford Sifton,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada has instructed me to make application for a grant towards Boarding School Building at Ahousaht, and for the maintenance of fifty children. The reasons for application are the following:\n\n1. Mr Russell, the Missionary there, reports that there are nearly three hundred Indians in this Band, and that there are one hundred and one children under sixteen years of age. The improved condition of their homes under the Missionary's influence has decreased the death rate amongst the children, so that the Tribe is likely to increase in numbers.\n\n2. A Day School was opened in 1895, and the Day School Government Grant was allowed in 1900. For five years previous to 1895 no Mission work of any kind had been done in that village. According to Mr Russell's last annual report (1901-1902) sixty-four received instruction during the year. The largest number on the role was fifty-five. The average attendance for the year was 12.9 as compared with 21.1 during the previous year.\n\n3. This unsatisfactory average Mr Russell states is not owing to any difficulty in getting the children to attend school, but to the wandering of the parents for fishing and hunting purposes. As the sealing industry decreases they go in larger numbers to the Fraser River Salmon fisheries and to the hop fields in Washington and can take more of their children with them.\nThis means not only enforced absence but loss of time and position in the school after their return. This can only be avoided by the erection of a Boarding School.\n\n4. During the last summer in order as far as possible to overcome this difficulty, Mr Russell received into his own home from fourteen to twenty children, utilizing every available corner, and of course at great inconvenience, in order if possible to keep them under instruction. Many more children were pressed upon him by parents but his accommodation was not sufficient to enable him to receive them.\n\nIn a letter dated 17th November, Mr Russell states that some of the parents wish to place their children in the Boarding School in order that they may not be witnesses of so much evil occurring in their homes. This is pathetic.\n\n5. In the same letter Mr Russell states that one little girl who was under his care last summer, was taken from him by her mother after her return from the Behring Sea. She took the child away to Victoria with the saddest result. Both mother and child were debauched by sailors, and all her earnings were of course lost. This case was reported in a Victoria paper, a clipping from which was sent by Mr Russell, which I inclose. It is only a Boarding School backed by Government authority that can protect the children from such treatment.\n\n6. It may be added that a letter was received from the Agent Mr Guilled, 16th August, endorsing this application, and expressing\nhis willingness to write to the Department in support of it.\n\nHe states that whilst he cannot take the initiative in the matter, yet, he writes; \"I would recommend the Government to give you a Boarding School grant because I consider the results small from Day School teaching and the difficulties great. The children are only under supervision during school hours. The English learnt is of little use, because as soon as they are out of school they talk their own language. Mr Russell is a faithful teacher, and has done faithful work at Ahousaht, but on taking the census last year I was surprised to find that although Mr Russell's is the best day school on the Coast out of 55 children at Ahousaht of age from 6 to 15, 25 attended school two months or more in the year, and the average attendance of the 35 pupils was 4 5/8 months per year. This was taken from the school register.\"\n\nFor these reasons the Foreign Mission Committee feels justified in making this application. Not only is the need urgent, but with favorable conditions the prospects seem to be good.\n\nI am\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6430, file 876-1, part 1)\nBritish Columbia\n\nWest Coast Agency\n\nAlberni\nDecember 29th 1902\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that I lately received a letter from the Rev. R. P. MacKay, secretary of the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada advising me that his Committee is making an application to the Government at Ottawa for a boarding school grant for Ahousaht and also a building grant and asking me to recommend the same to the favorable consideration of the Department. In favor of this application I may say that Mr. J. W. Russell has been teaching in the Ahousaht Day School on Makhtok's Reserve continuously and faithfully for over six years and the results I consider are not commensurate to the time and labour expended; take the census returns for 1901, with 55 children of school age in the band there were 44 on the school roll, and an average attendance of 17.\u2014 of the 44 pupils on the register 25 attended two months or more in the year, the average attendance of these 25 being 4 \u00bd months per year, from these statistics it may be seen that, except the principles of Christianity and morality taught on school days and Sundays, the greater...\nnumber of the pupils will hardly gain sufficient knowledge by attendance at the day school to be of practical use to them. Their knowledge of the English language is only gained in school hours. The rest of the day they are speaking their own language and conforming to the Indian irregular and improvident mode of life. The poor attendance is from no fault of the teacher but principally from the moving of the families to their different fishing stations, also their journeys to the Fraser river fisheries and the American hop fields in search of work; besides, Indian children are allowed by their parents to do pretty much as they like and when they are at home the attendance depends chiefly on the personal influence of the teacher with the children. Taking into consideration the good work being done by the two boarding schools already established in this agency, where the pupils being constantly under the supervision of the teachers are taught to speak English intelligently and are being trained to habits of obedience, regularity and industry, I would strongly recommend that the application for a grant to establish a boarding school adjacent to the Markless Ahousahlt Reserve be acceded to.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYours obediently,\n\nHarry Guillod\nAgent\n\nA.W. Vowell\nIndian Sup't\nVictoria\nDepartment of Indian Affairs:-\nOTTAWA, 18th December, 1902.\n\nThe Superintendent General:-\n\nMemo. re application of Rev. Dr Mackay, Secretary of the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, for a grant towards a boarding school building at Ahousaht, B.C., and the maintenance of 50 children.\n\n1. The census returns for the year ended 30th June, 1902, give the population of the West Coast Agency as 2,414, made up as follows:\n\n| Religious Group | Number |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Presbyterians    | 287    |\n| Methodists      | 150    |\n| Roman Catholics | 631    |\n| Pagans          | 1346   |\n\nTotal: 2,414\n\nThe total school population of this Agency is 415.\n\nThe Ahousaht Band numbers 273, two of whom are Roman Catholics, the remainder, 271 being given as Pagans. In the Census Returns for 1901, however, this Band was shown to have 277 members:\n\n| Religious Group | Number |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Presbyterians    | 100    |\n| Roman Catholics | 69     |\n| Pagans          | 108    |\n\nTotal: 277\n\nNo explanation is given by the Agent as to why he counted them all as Pagans.\n\nThe number of children of school age in this Band is only 37, of whom 44 are enrolled at the day school at Ahousaht, which had an average attendance last year of 14.\n\n2. Dr Mackay is correct in stating that the day school was opened in 1896 and only received recognition in 1900. Previous to the opening of this school, the Roman Catholics had been carrying on a\nschool there, but no returns have been received from it since 1891, although it was continued in the estimates up to 1900. They still maintain a church and residence for the priest there.\n\n3. The average attendance at the day school now in operation of 14 out of a highest enrollment of 44 is not satisfactory and is not about on a par with other Indian schools of this class.\n\n4. There are two boarding schools already in operation in the West Coast Agency, one conducted by the Presbyterians at Alberni, and the other at Clayoquot carried on by the Roman Catholics, with provision at each school for 50 pupils. In addition to these there are six day schools, situated at the following points; as shown on the print turned out herewith:\n\n- Ahousaht\n- Ucluelet (.....Presbyterian)\n- Dodger's Cove\n- Clayoquot\n- Kyaquot (.....Roman Catholic)\n- Nitinat............Methodist\n\nFrom the above it would appear that the Presbyterians are fairly well provided for.\n\nThe question of further provision for Presbyterian schools is dealt with on file No.213,103, herewith.\nOTTAWA, 3rd February, 1903\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 3rd ultimo, forwarding a communication from Mr Agent Guillod, I beg to say that the question of the proposed establishment of a boarding school at Ahousaht, in place of the day school now conducted by Mr Russell, is under consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.\nIndian Supt.\nVictoria, B.C.\nIndian Office, Victoria, B. C.\n\nJanuary 3rd, 1902.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to inclose herewith for the information of the Department duplicate of a letter dated the 29th ultimo from Mr. Agent Guillod, West Coast Agency having reference to the establishment of a boarding school at Ahousaht where the Indian day school is now conducted by Mr. John R. Russell. In connection with this report I beg to say that as previously reported upon it has been found that day schools are not a success among the Indians for reasons given, therefore, if practicable, there is no doubt but that this school asked for would be highly beneficial,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B. C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. Frank Pedley,\nDeputy Supt. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nAllow me again to refer to Boarding School Grant for Ahousaht, B.C. I received a telegram from you when in Vancouver at the General Assembly, stating that the matter was under consideration, but that you favored making Alberni the Boarding School centre for the coast and having Day Schools at Ahousaht, Ucluelet &c. The following considerations must I think modify that view, which was also held by our Committee, when the Alberni School was built some years ago.\n\n1. The Alberni school is now full, up to the number for which the plans provided when accepted by the Govt.\n\n2. The Principal reports that there are 16 other children in Alberni, 11 of whom should be in the school now, but are not. That does not take at all into account the probable 150 or 200 children in the Barclay Sound and Ahousaht combined. (Ahousaht is 35 miles north of Barclay Sound).\n\n3. If the Govt. were prepared to enlarge the Alberni school to accommodate all these, it would in my judgement be unwise. Smaller schools of 50 or 60 children are much more effective and economical as to staff, and administration.\n\n4. Even if the building were provided at Alberni the children\nToronto,\n\nfrom the coast could not be got to attend. Indian parents are very fond of their children and are not willing to allow them to go so far away\u2014children having a similar fondness for their parents.\n\n5. When at the coast I discussed the matter with Mr. Vowell and Mr. Fell, and both felt strongly that a grant should be allowed for Ahousaht. I called on Mr. Gilloch when at Alberni but did not see him. I have from him, however, a letter expressing the same conviction. In fact all I spoke to were of one mind. The need is there, and experience has proved that without a Boarding School the work cannot be done.\n\n6. I am sorry to have to report that we are to lose the services of Mr. W. J. Russell, who is perhaps the best teacher on the coast. He and Mrs. Russell felt the necessity of doing something for these children to be so urgent that they had twenty-six of them in their own little home. Of course, the result was inevitable. Her health has broken down and they must withdraw. When asked why they took in so many, the natural answer was, How could we refuse when they were knocking at the door? It was, of course, unwise and yet it is hard to blame such unwisdom. There we stand. The increasingly wandering habits of the Indians\u2014fishing, canneries, hop-picking and sealing\u2014make it impossible to maintain attendance at the Day School. Unless they can be kept, they will go with their parents.\n\n7. The ladies of the Board of the W.F.M.S. feel the urgency\nto be such that they say, we shall provide the building if the Govt. will give the grant. You will remember that when the case was submitted before we asked a grant for building and a per capita for 50 pupils. Is it not possible to give the per capita this session? The work grows upon our hands. Our Committees are straining continually to carry what is already undertaken. The work necessarily expands. Is it unreasonable to ask the Government to enlarge its grants proportionately in a co-operative work such as the Indian work is? Kindly reopen the question if it has been closed.\n\nYours faithfully,\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nFor the Deputy Supt. General of I.A.\n\nI beg to direct your attention to the fact that the Department is asked to aid in the establishment of a Boarding School under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church, at Ahousaht, B.C. There are no funds available for this purpose, and I have therefore included in the Supplementary Estimates for 1903-04 the following amounts:\n\nGrant towards the erection of building.............$1,500.00\n25 pupils @ $60.00......................1,500.00\n\nTotal.........$3,000.00\n\nI have also included for the Clayoquot Boarding School (R.C.) an increase of $130.00 in the per capita grant for 50 pupils. At present this school receives $60 each for 50 pupils, and the Church authorities are anxious to have the Institution placed upon the standing of the Industrial schools in that Province. It will therefore be seen that the proposition is to aid the Presbyterian and Roman Catholic Church authorities to the extent of $3,000 and $3,500 respectively. The whole question, therefore, of establishing a new industrial school and increasing the grant to the existing Institution will come up for discussion when the Minister deals with the Supplementary Estimates. There has been some friction between the two denominations occupying the Missionary on the West Coast Agency, and\nMEMO:\n\nand it is therefore necessary to look carefully at the result of any proposed changes in the grants to schools. At present the money grants to the Boarding schools stand as follows:\n\nPresb'n 30 pupils @ $60.00........... $1,800\nR.C. 50 pupils @ 60.00............. 3,000\n\nIf the proposition to make the Roman Catholic School an Industrial Institution and to provide the Presbyterian school at Ahousaht are favorably considered, after the preliminary grant for a building for the latter school is expended, the money grants would show a still greater disproportion, viz:\n\nPresb'n. 55 pupils @ $60.00........... $3,300\nR.C. 50 pupils @ 130.00............. 6,500\n\nTo state merely what is my own opinion by a careful examination of the documents and consideration of the subject, it seems that the West Coast Agency, B.C., is at present in a rather favorable position as regards educational facilities, and the Department should be slow in establishing any new schools on that coast.\n\nI think we should rather look to the enlargement of the Alberni Presbyterian School, if it is felt necessary to aid the Presbyterians, and to allow them a larger per capita grant. They have now an average attendance of 42, and the vote for the school is for 30 pupils only.\n\nI would also point out that the claim that $60.00 per capita\ncapita is not a sufficient grant for boarding schools in B.C. is not general, and that, so far as this Department is concerned, the Presbyterian Church seems to be pushing for facilities to educate a greater number of pupils, and the Roman Catholic Church, to obtain a greater amount of money for the pupils at present enrolled.\n\nAccountant.\n\nOTTAWA, June 5th\u20141903.,\nDep'y. of I.A.\nMr Frank Pedley,\n\nOttawa,\n\nMy Dear Sir;-\n\nYour letter of the 5th November received in which you state that the supplementary estimates provide $1500. for the erection of a Boarding School at Ahousaht, and also a per capita grant of $60. each for twenty-five children. Allow me to thank you very cordially in the name of the Foreign Mission Committee for this provision, and we shall immediately take steps to secure the best possible site and estimates for the new building.\n\nI have asked Mr Swartout of Ucluelet and Mr Russell who has been there for so many years, to co-operate in the solution of site, and whatever else is necessary to place the school upon the best possible foundation. I trust the result will justify the expenditure.\n\nWe were somewhat disappointed in not finding mention of enlarged per capita grant for Alberni. You will remember that in conference it was stated that we have forty-six children in that school, and only a grant for thirty. It means of course that our funds must provide additional maintenance from year to year, and it also means that the standard of living is always in danger of being cut too low in the interests of the children and the work.\n\nMr Motion the Principal is urging enlarged accommodation, which we were contemplating giving him next year, when we hoped the additional per capita grant would make it possible. The number of children available is sufficient to raise the attendance\nconsiderably beyond the present mark, and we would like it if were possible to utilize our opportunity in caring for as many as possible of these little ones. That however will be a matter for further consideration.\n\nI regret not having been able yet to write you regarding an accountant to look into the affairs at Regina, but think I shall be able to do so in a very few days.\n\nAgain thanking you for what has been done,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa [date], November, 1903.\n\nRevd Sir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Supplementary Estimates provide the sum of $1500.00 for the erection of buildings for the Presbyterian Indian School at Ahousaht. Provision has also been made for a per capita grant of $60.00 for twenty-five pupils. The grant for the pupils will continue, but the amount provided for the buildings will lapse on the 30th June next, if not expended before that date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Supt.

The building is pretty well under way, and they expect to have it completed within the quarter. We sent up from here a practical builder upon whom we could rely, and our hope is that there will be no scamping about the structure.\n\nI write to ask that the $1500.00 allowed by the Department for this building be sent directly to Dr Warden, as he is sending the amount required. Possibly you may require a report from your agent as to the amount expended before paying the $1500.00. If so, it will mean simply the delay of a week or two, but I write especially asking that money sent for this purpose be sent through Dr Warden in order that financial arrangements may be adjusted by him. We have estimated altogether for the building $6500.00, and we are hoping to keep them strictly within the estimate.

Neill Esq.\nIndian Agent\nAhousaht\nB.C.\n\nDear Mr. Neill,\n\nIt is with deep regret we report the death of our very promising young pupil Will Maguina No. 86 of the Ahousaht Band, on Sunday evening Nov 11th/06. He was at home for a few hours on Saturday the 10th Nov. He did not complain on his return about 5 P.M., but about 4 a.m. I heard some noise, and went to his room and he complained of a pain. He got up to the water pot and returned to bed and said he felt better. I did not give him anything. I went in again in early morning and he said he felt better but he looked pale. He came down to breakfast with the others but we put him to bed and gave him Castor Oil. His temperature was low during the day and the actions of the heart weak. We used hot water bottle and heated blankets to raise his temperature and put mild mustard plaster over the heart.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6430, file 876-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nHe gave a little brandy for stimulant but he did not respond to treatment. He did not seem to suffer pain. We kept him in bed in warm room. Towards evening we applied onion poultice to his feet. About 8 p.m. he began to show serious symptoms and died about 11 P.M. The high wind storm made it impossible to send out for the doctor but he had the utmost care from Miss Millar who is a trained nurse. The doctor did not reach here till the second day after death. The Indians who went for him on Monday did not bring him till Tuesday. The boy said he had eaten ten pears and some dried fish eggs at his home.\n\nThe doctor made careful examination and inquiry and decided that the condition of the fish food which he had eaten at home had acted as poison. He stated that the treatment given him during his days sickness was the best that could be given under the circumstances.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ. L. Miller\nOttawa, December 29, 1905.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th inst., including a communication from Mr. Agent Neill advising the Department of the resignation of Mr. Butchart as principal of the Ahousaht boarding school and the appointment of Rev. J. L. Miller as his successor.\n\nWith reference to that portion of the Agent's letter as to the qualifications which he considers ought to be required of all appointees to the staffs of industrial and boarding schools, I beg to say that the Department agrees with you that the time is not ripe for demanding the qualifications suggested by Mr. Neill.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nA. W. Vorrell, M.A.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to forward herewith for the information and approval of the Department a letter, dated the 12th instant, No. 468/7, received from Mr. Agent Neill, of the West Coast Agency, B. C., advising this office of the resignation of Mr. J. G. Butchart, B. A., Principal of the Ahousaht Boarding School and that of Mrs. Butchart, his wife, as Matron, each of whom left the school on the 1st ultimo. The Agent states that the Reverend J. L. Miller, of Byng Inlet, has been appointed in Mr. Butchart's stead and is expected to take over his new duties about the new year.\n\nIt is pleasing to learn from Mr. Neill's letter that Mr. and Mrs. Butchart's efforts were productive of such good results during their residence at the school and to know that they were so much esteemed by the Indian population of the Coast generally with whom they from time to time came in contact.\n\nWhat\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nWhat the Agent suggests as to the advisability of requiring all appointments made to the staff of Industrial and Boarding Schools to be college graduates I feel I cannot give my endorsement. Were such a requirement demanded of the various churches and missionary societies working amongst the Indians throughout the superintendency it would not only be a cause of considerable inconvenience and embarrassment to those under whose auspices the institutions are conducted but it is doubtful if Principals and teachers could in every case be found to fill vacancies or establish new schools where necessary hereafter.\n\nWhile admitting the force of the suggestion proffered by the Agent I do not think the time ripe for taking action along the lines laid down by him, more especially in remote and inaccessible parts of the province where it is often a matter of difficulty to induce men to go who have at all been accustomed to live in more or less close touch with the centres of white population.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B. C.\nWEST COAST INDIAN AGENCY,\n\nALBERNI, B.C., December 12th, 1905\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that I am today notified by the Rev. R.P. Mackay, Secretary of the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church that J.C. Butchart, B.A., Principal of the Ahousaht Boarding School resigned his position and left the school about the 1st of November & that the Committee have appointed Rev. J.L. Millar of Byng Inlet in his stead & he is expected to arrive about the first of next year.\n\nI have pleasure in testifying to the success achieved by Mr. & Mrs. Butchart in the work at Ahousaht. They found the school in a bad condition & have left it in an excellent one. They were esteemed by the Indians whom they treated with kindness & firmness, winning their respect.\n\nMr. Butchart had taken a degree at College & I am of opinion it would be an excellent thing if the Dept. which reserves the right to approve or reject all recommendations made by the various Churches, to the school staff, were to insist that all Principals of Boarding or Industrial schools had passed through some College, not that an extra education is required but a man who has been at College has generally seen something of the world & has learned habits of self-control & tact in dealing with others which qualities are very much needed in handling the Indians & their children successfully & the lack of which often leads to continual friction between the Indians, the school, & sometimes the Dept. also.\n\nFor the present Mr. J.T. Ross is in charge at Ahousaht.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.W. Vowell Esq.,\nVictoria,\nB.C.\nOTTAWA, 25th February, 1906\n\nRev.

They have already 35 pupils and the grant is only for 25. Mr. Butchart says they can reach 50 by July 1st.

It is, however, its intention to go thoroughly into the whole school question at an early date when this application will receive due consideration.\n\nAs requested by you Mr Butchart's letter has been sent to Mr Sloan and that gentleman has been written to in the above terms.\n\nI may add that Rev.

The\npresent provision is for 25 pupils and the last return\nshows an enrollment of 32 with an average attendance\nof 30. He wishes to receive a grant for 50 pupils.\n\nThe Presbyterians have a new building under construc-\ntion which will provide accommodation for this number\nand it will be ready for occupation almost immediately.\nThe Department has contributed $1500 towards the\nbuilding, which has cost over $8000.00. This school\nhas only been recognized as a boarding school since\nJuly 1st, 1903 and I think they could wait another\nyear without asking to have the grant doubled. The\nPresbyterians have a boarding school at Alberni in\nthe West Coast Agency and the Roman Catholics have\nan industrial school at Clayoquot, which is quite near\nAhousaht. The Indians of this Agency will not suffer\nby the delay and as the whole school question is to be\ndealt with shortly, I think the Principal's appli-\ncation might stand for the present.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Clifford Sifton.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nbut there is not ever any complaint\u2014year back the teachers we had then was the Catholic Priest it was all right with them we had respect for them. They made us better people. We kept from work and trade of a Sunday. There was less whisky and gambling. In those days the children went to school but no one was go forget for to give up his children as it is now. Kind if of teachers have come to Ahouset last winter a number of the Indians were frightened and compelled to sign a paper and give up these children to this new teachers, and for them to have control of the children until they are 18 year of age. We know how 2 of the same kind of teacher assaulted an old white man here and took his children by force from him and why because their mother Ahouset Indian was a Catholic and so was the children. We don't want such trouble here, we did not ask for these new people to come here, the church-house belonging to our old teacher the Priest was standing here on our land, and they could see it alright, so why did they come here to make trouble, ***********\n\nSigned\u2014Chief Billy x his mark Billy Father old\nChief Moquiney x his mark\nChief Benson x his mark\nChief Atlin x his mark\nChief Nokhamas x his mark\nBilly's immoral habits. This last child died in the school after the greatest care of him by the staff. Mr. Millar sent to Clayoquot for a Dr. who was not the one paid by Dept., so Mr. Millar would have to pay that considerable expense himself. Since then Billy has left no stone unturned to injure the school. Unfortunately he has considerable influence with the Band. He is one of the worst Indians on the Coast.\n\nLast year I removed him from being Chief but as a Chief receives no remuneration or any privileges of which I could deprive him he still claims his right of Chief which among these Indians is an hereditary one. You will note he wrote to the Dept. & signed himself, \"Chief Billy.\"\n\nNo doubt when the Dept. acknowledged his letter they would naturally address it to \"Chief Billy.\" This alone would strengthen Billy's hand & the letter from the Dept. will be shown & or explained to the whole band as an evidence that the Dept. (& they quite understand that the Dept. is a superior authority to me) still recognises him as \"Chief.\"\n\nWhen the Dept. write again to him I would strongly recommend that they address him as \"Billy\" only & that they tell him that they find he is no longer \"chief\" having been dismissed by the Agent. I trust the Dept. will understand that this is not in the least a question of upholding my petty personal dignity but is really of importance in maintaining my authority & ultimately, the authority of the Dept.\n\nI would also recommend that he be informed that the Dept. do not propose to dismiss the staff of any school when demanded without any reason by the Band but if they have any complaints to make & will state them they will be thoroughly investigated by the officials of the Dept. at the same time warning them to be careful not to make false statements as that might get them into trouble.\n\nYou will note that they threaten not to send any more children.\n\nThis attitude which presupposes that the children go to the school for the benefit of the Dept. or of the staff is in keeping with the sentiments they expressed at a meeting of the Band last year when they told Mr. Millar, the principal of the school, Mr. Ross the retiring Principal, Mr. McDougall, the white Constable from Clayoquot, and myself, that we ought all \"to be thankful\" (thankful was the exact word used) to them as if they did not send their children to the school we would all...\nlose our jobs.\"\n\nIt would be a good thing if the Dept. wrote in fairly sharp terms,\nwarning him that the school is there for their, not our benefit & he had\nbetter take care of how he sets himself to undermine it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Officer\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant in which you state that a petition received by the Department from certain Indians of Ahousht is enclosed therewith.

W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 7th ultimo in regard to the petition received by the Department from certain Indians of Ahousaht, West Coast Agency, B.C., preferring certain complaints touching the management of the Ahousaht Indian boarding school, I have the honor to forward herewith, for the information of the Department, a report from Mr. Agent Neill on the subject in which he deals very fully and, I think, clearly showing that the Indians are actuated by motives altogether apart from those bearing upon the true interests of the establishment. The attitude shown by some of the foremost Indians has been anything but creditable to them and, perhaps, a letter of reprimand to them from the Department in the tone suggested by the Agent would in the end have a beneficial influence upon them.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B.C.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6430, file 876-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of January 25th,\n\nNo. 668-9 requesting a report on a petition sent to the Dept. from Chief Billy & others of the Ahousaht band demanding the dismissal of the staff of the Boarding school there, & threatening if their demand is not acceded to that they will send no more children to the school,- I have the honor to report as follows,-\n\nI consider the petition a piece of gross impudence. You will note they register no complaint against the staff but consider their simple demand will suffice & this is not caused by the ignorance of the writer but I know it to be their actual attitude. Since the matter of the Thornberg children case which I have described in a report on another subject & to which I should be glad if you would refer letter No. 368-9 of date March the 28th these Indians have got the idea that the Dept. will do anything for them while we, you & myself, will do nothing.\n\nI consider Mr. Miller a superior man for his position, a man of good education, an ordained minister & a B.A. Energetic, painstaking and cautious. Miss McNeill, the Matron was formerly while teacher in the day school, rather too much inclined to take the Indians version of everything but since she has been Matron, I have seen no fault to find with her. She has had very long experience. Miss McKay, the teacher, is a competent teacher & has several years experience. Miss Millar the assistant Matron, I know little of but believe she is a very suitable person. The school is run well as far as I can see & if anything they have probably been too lenient with the Indians. The instigator of this trouble is probably Chief Billy whose child died in the school in the fall. I understand he has had a number of children who have all died, most of them, I have been told, because of inherited disease caused by A.W. Vowell Esq.\n\nVictoria, B.C.\nBritish Columbia Inspectorate,\n1076 Pender St., Vancouver, B.C.,\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nApril 16th, 1907.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge your letter of March 23rd., No. 607-C-5, directing me to report on a letter dated the 2nd. of January last, addressed to the Department and signed by Chief Billy and twenty-nine other Indians of Ahousaht asking that the present staff of teachers at the Ahousaht Boarding School be removed and replaced by an entirely new lot of Teachers and the Indians threat that unless this was done they would in future refuse to allow their children to attend the school.\n\nI have the honor to refuse\u2014report as follows\u2014that proceeding & to Ahousaht I met the Indians in Council in the Village on April 6. There were twenty Indians present, all that were home, nine of whom were fathers who had children in the School. Chief Billy was absent from the Village at the time of my visit and I saw him later. I questioned the men very closely. They said they signed the letter because their chief, Billy had asked them to do so. In answer to questions they said they did not have anything against the School themselves, but as Chief Billy was away they were careful to say they could not speak for him. The only point they raised was that sometimes a boy's shoes wore out and so leaked, they said\u2014\"Good for you to tell Mr. Miller, the Principal, to give new shoes to the boys when shoes are bad\".\n\nOn Thursday April the 11th., Billy came with three other Indians to see me at Clayoquot. I spent three hours with him, heard a very long speech, and then I asked him questions and found that all the trouble was because of the death of his son in the School in November last.\nAt first his remarks implied that he blamed the Staff of the School as having caused the boy's death. But when I explained to him the facts and then asked him for a direct answer to the question \"Do you believe and say that the School killed your boy?\"\n\nHe did not answer for some time but finally said, \"No, but I want the Staff changed for they should not let my boy die in the School.\"\n\nHe said he had had four children all of whom were dead. Only the youngest who died in November had been in the School, the other three dying at home. When pressed for the reason of his wish for the Staff to be removed he said, \"My children are all dead. Will died in the School and when I see the teachers at the School I shall feel ashamed, but if new teachers come I can shake hands with them and not feel ashamed.\"\n\nThe death of the boy is the one thing in his mind. He is superstitious, very ignorant in some ways but very shrewd in other things, and evidently has great influence with his people. From the School Staff and from the Indians I gathered the following facts regarding the death of the boy, Will Maquinna, No 36, son of Chief Billy.\n\nHe was admitted to the School on Feb. 1st., 1905, and was eight years of age at the time of his death. He was a very bright clever lad, and a great favorite with the Staff. On Saturday, November 10th., he went to the Village of Ahousaht to visit his grandparents, in compliance with the request of Chief Billy to the Staff before he started for Victoria.\n\nThe boy was in good health on Saturday morning. In the afternoon the grandfather gave the boy nine hard green pears which the boy ate, and then they gave him decayed fish eggs of which he ate a large quantity. He returned to the School in the evening and said he did not want any supper. In the night he was taken sick and complained of pains in his stomach. The Principal arose and waited on him. Miss Miller, one of the Staff, is a qualified trained nurse of long experience, and took charge of him giving Physic, Stimulants etc., but he gradually sunk and died at 10 P.M., Sunday November 11th., about twenty hours from the time he first complained of feeling sick.\nA violent gale raging at the time made it impossible to go for\nthe Doctor, the nearest of which was twelve miles away. The Principal\nsent for him when the weather modified after the death, and from\nexamination and inquiry reported it a case of Ptomaine poisoning.\n\nMiss Miller stated that all the symptoms during the sickness were\nthose of poisoning. Doctor Rolls gave me the following letter:\n\nInsp. Indian Schools,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHaving been called to examine the case of Will\nMaquinna, No. 86 of the Ahousaht Boarding School, I came to the\nconclusion (after full examination) that he met his death on\nSunday November the eleventh 1906 at eleven o'clock in the\nevening, thro' eating some poisonous fish or fish eggs which\nhe obtained at the village of Ahousaht. The treatment which he\nreceived from the Staff of the School all thro' his twenty\nhours of sickness was the best that could be accorded him\nunder the circumstances.\n\nSincerely yours\n\n(Signed) A.M. Rolls, M.B.Tor.\n\nClayoquot,\nB.C.\nApril 9, '07.\n\nThe boy was buried before the Father returned from Victoria. On\nhis return he told the Principal that no more children would\ngo to the School from the Reservations. He has publicly done his\nbest to injure the school. Billy sent a messenger to the Principal\ndemanding fifty blankets for the death of the boy, the messenger\nstating that if these were given Billy would be a friend to the\nSchool as if nothing had happened. The Principal properly refused\nthe fifty blankets which Billy wanted for his Potlatch, but gave\nhim $7.50 to pay for two pairs of blankets which were around the\nbody at burial.\nOne pupil has been signed into the school since the petition was sent in. The Father expressed fear, saying, \"I do not know what Chief Billy will do when he knows what I have done! I believe that the visit and talk with Billy and the Indians has largely cleared away the difficulty. Billy has great power over the Ahousaht Indians and they follow his lead. He was very much more reasonable when we got through the conversation and promised to abide by the decision of the Department in reference to the School.\n\nI inspected the School very thoroughly, looking into all methods used by the Staff in the management of the School and examined the children carefully in the Class-Rooms. After the most careful investigation I am convinced that the petition of the Indians is unreasonable. The Principal and Staff are doing good work and are worthy of the confidence of the Indians and the Department, and there are no grounds for their removal.\n\nI attach the Doctor's letter.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector.\nRev. A.E. Green,\nDept. Indian Schools,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nHaving been called to examine the case of Will Maguima no. 86 of the Ahousat Boarding School, I came to the conclusion (after full examination) that he met his death on Sunday, November the eleventh 1906 at eleven o'clock in the evening, this eating some poisonous fish or fish oil which he obtained at the Village of Ahousat.\n\nThe treatment which he received from the Staff of the School all this his twenty hours of sickness was the best that could be accorded him under the circumstances.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nA.M. Rolls, M.B., M.D.\n\nClayquot, B.C.\nApril 9, 1907.\nOttawa, November 21, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nI beg to report that I made an inspection of the Ahousht Boarding School on Tuesday the 24th day of September. The school is a new three story balloon frame building of good appearance and convenient arrangement. The boys quarters are in one end of the building, the girls in the other having separate stairway giving access to each as well as a separate bathing and washing rooms, fitted up with modern fixtures. The diningrooms and class rooms are common to the boys and girls.\n\nThe buildings are on an elevation overlooking an arm of the sea and afford a very picturesque view of the surrounding mountains, etc...\n\nA small lake has been drained which will provide ample ground for gardening when brought under cultivation. Very little effort has been made to clear other land other than that of reclaiming the lake.\n\nDuring low tide there is abundance of opportunities for exercise and the playground on the beach, in front of the school, also affords splendid swimming facilities.\n\nThe school is badly situated for harborage as no pier can be built for landing either freight or passengers owing to the exposed position of the site. All freight and passengers having to be lowered in-to open boats from steamers which is rather dangerous in rough weather.\n\nIn\nIn my opinion safe dockage should not been have overlooked in the choosing of the site.\n\nThe school is dependent on the rainfall for water supply, the water from the roof of building being stored in tanks for domestic use. This supply would be of very little use in case of fire; a bountiful supply of water good water should be a primary consideration in the selection of a school site (as the health of the pupils will depend to a great extent on the purity of the water supply) and that can be obtained by gravitation at little expense in almost every locality on the coast.\n\nI was very favourably impressed with the internal condition of this building, everything being clean and neat and the children are bright and neatly clothed, and, to all appearances, contented.\n\nThe Principal, Rev. Mr. Miller impressed me as being a very capable and energetic manager and is intensely interested in the welfare of the school and with his efficient staff will no doubt show good results from their combined efforts.\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, April 30, 1907.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of January 26, last, forwarding a petition from certain Indians at Ahousaht, asking for the dismissal of the present staff of the Ahousaht Boarding School and the appointment of an entirely new set of teachers; and in reply I beg to say that, while it is not the practice of the Department to deal with petitions of this class where no specific charges are made, it has, however, in this case instituted enquiries with a view to discovering whether there are any just causes of complaint against the school and its staff, and as a result of such enquiries I have to inform you that the Department is satisfied that this school is well conducted and that the staff are able and efficient and wholly devoted to their work and that the petitioners have no grounds for asking for their dismissal.\n\nFrom the reports received on the investigation held into this matter it would appear that you have taken umbrage against this school on account of the death of your boy in the institution in November, last.\n\nBilly,\n\nIndian,\n\nAhousaht, B.C.\nThe Department learns that your boy's death was occasioned by eating some poisonous fish or fish eggs and green fruit, which he obtained while on a visit to his grandparents, in compliance with your wishes.\n\nHe was in good health when he left the school on November 10, but he was taken ill on his return from the causes above mentioned and gradually sank and died on the evening of the following day, about twenty-four hours after he first complained of being sick. He received most skilful nursing during his short illness and the treatment was the best that could have been accorded him under the circumstances, and the school is in no way to blame for your son's death, which was caused from poisoning.\n\nThe Department is led to make this full explanation in the hope that you will be convinced that the school authorities are in no way responsible for your son's death, which was due to the unwholesome food eaten while on the visit to his grandparents.\n\nIf you or any of the Ahousaht Indians at any time have any specific charges to make against the school or the staff, they will be thoroughly investigated by the Indian Agent, who is the proper person to whom such complaints should be made; but the Department wishes to warn you and the Indians to be careful not to make false statements at any time, as they would only cause subsequent trouble.\n\nI may also add for your information that this school was not established for the benefit of the De-\npartment or of the staff but for the purpose of educat-\ning the Indians of the Ahousaht band, and if they fail\nto take advantage of it, it is their loss and not the\nDepartment's, and you will do well to be careful how you\nset about to impair its usefulness by circulating such\npetitions as the one sent in by you and using your in-\nfluence to undermine the good work the school is engaged\nin.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D.

While Billy's title has been omitted in the letter addressed to him, it is found upon referring to the records of the Department that he is still recognized as second chief, under the name of \"Hoquinna\", as there is nothing on file to show that he has ever been regularly deposed, the Agent not having the power to depose a Chief.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D.

McLean  \nSupt. of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe lighthouse keeper at Eastham (or Mr. James by name) wishes to have his boy sent to our school for education. I do not think he could very well afford to send his boy to Albemarle or Victoria so I beg that you grant me permission to take the boy into our school providing of course that he returns the keeper off the school reports and that he will be no charge whatsoever to the Indian Department. The boy has no opportunity of getting a common school education and is living less than forty miles from the nearest white school.\n\nRapidly let me know as soon as you can about this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn T. Ross\nOttawa, May 9, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your very interesting composition on the Ahousaht Boarding School. This has been read with a great deal of pleasure by the Department in so much as it shows not only that your surroundings are most pleasing, but that you have every opportunity of receiving a good education, which should be the ambition of every Indian boy and girl. The many advantages which will accrue to you from a steady application to your studies will only be fully appreciated when you leave school and go out into the world to earn your own living.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMaster Joseph Titian,\nPupil,\nAhousaht Boarding School,\nAhousaht, B.C.\nOur School\n\nOur School is situated on the Eastern side of Flores Island, B.C., and several Indians of our village built it in the year 1904.\n\nI helped quite a bit with the building.\n\nIn the front of our School is the Clayoquot Sound which separates Flores Island from the main land of Vancouver Island.\n\nIn the north-west of our mission is a little village where most of us live; it is a quarter of a mile from the mission.\n\nEvery Saturday we go home to visit our parents and relations, and when it's a good day on Sunday we have our service at the village. Most of the people like to go to church especially the young men.\n\nThe size of our School house is sixty-eight by forty-eight feet, the height is between fifty and sixty feet.\n\nThe number of the boys and girls in the School is forty and we have four Teachers.\n\nWe go in School two times a day, once in morning once in afternoon. Our Evening School\nSchool hours are ten o'clock till twelve o'clock and our afternoon school hours are from two o'clock to four o'clock in the evening.\n\nWe have one large school room and one small one. The small one was used for the junior classes, but we don't use it now and we use it as a drawing room. The large school room is used for the senior classes. There are twenty-four seats in the large school room and quite a few in the small school room.\n\nThere are eleven children in the fourth reader now because two are not here, five in the third, four in the second and quite a number in the part II class and five in the first reader.\n\nBehind our school is a little farm or a little lake trained by Mr. Miller which is between fourteen or fifteen acres of land. In the summer we like to play in our playground because the ground gets hard enough. We have a football and baseball grounds.\n\nEvery year we plant potatoes and some other vegetables.\n\nUnder the lake house is a large\ntank which contains two thousand seven hundred gallons of water. When our upstairs tanks are empty we have to pump up some more water from the large tank.\n\nIn the month of July 1908 Mr Ross built a launch for our mission. The power of the engine in the launch is three and a half H.P. and she goes more than eight miles an hour. Her length is about twenty-two feet.\n\nIn the same year we build a barn twenty-six by eighteen feet.\n\nWe have a new work shop which was built last year whose size is twenty-four by eighteen feet.\n\nEvery day after four o'clock we cut wood for our furnace, sometimes for our range in the kitchen. When it is raining we scrub or work in the work shop.\n\nThe stumps around the schoolhouse are very many in number, some are large, some are small, some are decaying and some are intact.\n\nThe forests around the schoolhouse are also heavily timbered and it's very hard to walk through the woods.\nIn spring we always have very many different kinds of wild flowers in the woods and rose bushes in the front of the school house.\n\nLast year the boys and Mr. Ross painted the school house and it looks more nicer now.\n\nNot very long ago we made a sidewalk from the front steps to the girls side and we are making one from the edge of the farm to the school room door.\n\nWe have one cow her name is Lucy. We take care of her very much we give her plenty of hay and water every day.\n\nWe have more than thirty four hens here also which gives us quite a number of eggs every day and we feed them every morning and evening.\n\nThe boys over here are fond of foot racing, football and baseball. We are allowed to run a quarter of a mile or an eighth of a mile.\n\nMr. Ross said he will also make a platform in front of our school house for drilling.\n\nWe always have our summer holidays in the month of May and in Autumn.\nDuring our holidays in Fall we fish for the Dog Salmon and some different kinds of fish and besides we always have our Christmas holidays. Before we have our summer holidays we clean every room of the School house.\n\nIn the girls side we are going to build a pavilion. We are cutting the trees and bushes from the best place which we thought would do. This pavilion is going to have eight side of an octagon shape.\n\nThe teachers don't allow us to go home without permission for if we do they will punish us. We are not also to speak in our Indian language for if we do we are to stay in School on Saturdays.\n\nThe teachers also tells us to speak the truth and not steal things that don't belong to us. They are very strict to us in the School especially when we are studying our lessons. They tell us from time to time not to idle.\n\nVery often we have some visitors over here some times from Blayquah.\nand from some other places.\n\nIn the warm days of spring and summer we very often have a picnic to outside places, sometimes in side places. The boys and girls love to have a picnic in summer. The outside places are good summer resorts and the Indians like to live in these places as well as the school boys and girls.\n\nThe boys and girls go to school when they are eight or nine years of age, some sooner. They discharge when they are eighteen years of age.\n\nThe boys work at the carpenter work and shoemaker and they work at it with all their best.\nO. H. M. S.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nJanuary 5th, 1909\n\nMr. Frank Fedley,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nWe have at last secured what we hope to be a satisfactory addition to the Ahousaht staff, Miss Gertrude Whiting as teacher and Miss Rosa Hall as assistant matron. Miss Whiting has a second-class non-professional certificate. She has taught for three years and attended the Model school, but has not been in the Normal, which, of course, does not give her the professional standing. Her success in the schools in which she has taught seems to be such as to justify the appointment. Her inspector has invited her to continue teaching on a permit, but she would like to go out into the west and do some work amongst the Indians. She is but twenty-two years of age, but seems to be vivacious and possessed of that perseverance that will make her a success.\n\nI would be very glad to receive your approval of these appointments by return mail if they commend themselves to you. It is important that they should leave for the west not later than the 13th inst. in order to leave Victoria by the steamer sailing the 20th inst. The staff is now reduced to two and it is extremely urgent that at the earliest date possible they should be reinforced.\n\nWith the compliments of the season,\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have failed in getting what we have been looking for\u2014a principal who would be teacher as well. Mr. Ross has had much experience and we think it would be better to make him principal rather than appoint an inexperienced man to the control of agents who have been on the staff for a good many years. We shall then look for a lady teacher, and have only one man in the school as we had in the past. When Mr. Miller left he recommended that there should be two men because of the amount of work to be done and the discipline sometimes necessary, and so far away from any white community. Mr. Ross, however, is a powerful man and has had much experience with the Indians, and will, I think, as principal keep the school well in hand. If we succeed in getting as satisfactory a lady teacher as Miss MacKay was I think things will be all right.\n\nI would also like to recommend Miss Lillie Morrice of Nadoo as teacher to the Alternate school. Miss Guilled retires and Miss Morrice is highly recommended by the Public School Inspector as well as by the clergyman of the town in which she lives. These two will, I hope, prove satisfactory appointments.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRPM/MBM.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6430, file 876-1, part 1)\nExtract from report of Mr. Agent A. W.

The Boarding school at Alberni has had for years a grant for 50 pupils and has never reached that number yet so that every pupil in that school was paid for while the Ahousaht school was carrying from 10 to 20 more than they received a grant for.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Millar is an ordained man and holds high certificates. Miss McKay, the assistant teacher has also an Ontario teacher's certificate.

Vowell Esq\nSub Indian Affairs B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Vowell,\n\nPermit me to ask your kind consideration of a request on behalf of our school. For six years the Presbyterian Church has endeavored to maintain an efficient boarding school for the education of Indian children. The new school was erected and furnished at a cost of $1000. The average annual outlay for running expenses is about $4000 per annum. The enrolment of pupils for last year was forty-five.\n\nSince the beginning of the school the amount of government grant for running expenditure has been $150 dollars per capita for twenty-five pupils.\n\nIn addition to the heavy share of running expenses which the church has borne we have been obliged to make frequent requests for liberal grants for necessary improvements.\n\nBeing very much isolated we have made it our aim to become industrially independent. In this direction we have recovered a field of about eighteen acres from draining a small lake at a cost of $350. The field is said to be one of the finest on the West Coast and would be very\nproductive with some further outlay for improvement. We have also made a start in shoemaking, blacksmithing, carpentry and machine shop work. We have just completed a two-and-a-half-foot barn with cabin and equipped with kerosene engine at an outlay of $450. A new barn 26 x 18 has also just been completed. We have been trying to help ourselves and the Church has been generous to us, to enable us to meet even our most urgent necessities.\n\nWe feel that while the Indian Department has given much assistance yet considering the work we are doing and more which we wish to do but cannot without the assistance of the Department that we can approach them with confidence of assistance.\n\nWe ask the Indian Department to raise the maximum number of scholars for whom our school can draw the grant of $60 per capita per annum from twenty-five to thirty-five. This assistance would enable us to do very much in realizing the necessary developments for our school. Trusting that this request may meet with your esteemed approval.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nJ. K.

It is hoped you will understand that in case of fire if need be the glass is to be broken and the key used to unlock the door. Also an iron bar is left in each dormitory to break off wooden bars and windows in order to escape through the windows. The bars are not iron but wood 3/4\" x 2\" so that without much effort they can be removed. Each dormitory is provided with a rope fire escape.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJohn E. Ross\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to yours of February the 19th re water supply and fire protection at Ahouseht.- We corresponded with the Principal there, and received a reply that the best possible arrangements have been made for a pure water supply for the school, and that they are having just now samples of well waters tested by the Department at Victoria, and, if it turns out that the water is pure and fit for drinking purposes, we will be able to get a larger supply. As you know just now we have to store rain water to meet the needs of the school.\n\nIt is my intention to visit the Department at Ottawa as soon as possible, and take up with them the matter of the buildings that are necessary for the conduct of work in certain centres where we are now working, as our Board has decided that we are not going to put any more money into buildings or equip-\nment for the conduct of this work.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions\nPresbyterian Church in Canada.\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\nWest Coast Indian Agency,\n\nALBERNI, B.C.

The total capacity of which is 4070 gals. A tank of 500 gal. capacity is kept sealed in the basement for drinking purposes. Charcoal is often put in to clarify it. About 55 feet at the rear of the School, is a well 9 ft. deep. This water is used for washing purposes only. When the drinking water tank gives out, drinking water has to be brought from a distance, or over a mile, but this seldom happens. It is impossible to obtain good well water anywhere near the School.\n\nAs it is practically, an impossibility, to lay a pipe system, owing to land conditions, distance etc., the Principal, Rev. J. T. Rose, suggested that a deep well be dug at the rear of the School, a motor pump be installed, so that the School could be well supplied with water in the over-head tanks. This water to be used for washing purposes only. The approximate cost would be $500. As far as I can ascertain this is the only means of a satisfactory water supply.\n\nFor fire fighting, the appliances consist of force pump, 150 ft. of fire hose, 18 fire buckets, 12 dry dust fire\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nWest Coast Indian Agency,\nALBERNI, B.C.\n\nLETTER NO.\n\nSIR\u2014\n\nfire extinguishers, and two chemical \"Keystone\" fire extinguishers.

Glad to learn that you have decided to increase the pupilage of Ahousaht Indian School from 25 to 35.

So far as the accommodation is concerned there is room in this school for a larger number of pupils and it has been decided to increase the pupilage to 35 from the first of the current quarter, upon condition that the Department receives assurance that a proper water supply has been or will be provided and adequate fire protection installed.\n\nKindly take this matter up with the school authorities and let the Department have the assurance referred to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Dr. MacKay of the Presbyterian Church has renewed the application of that Society for an increased pupilage at Ahousaht School.\n\nYou will see from Mr. Ogilvie's memorandum hereunder that they have accommodation for 40 pupils whereas the Department now provides for only 25. If it is the policy of the Department to increase the pupilage at residential schools where they have sufficient accommodation of a satisfactory nature, I would recommend that the pupilage at this school be increased to 35, upon condition that the Department receives assurance that a proper water supply has been or will be provided and adequate fire protection installed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

MacKay D.D., who visited the Department today, for an increase in the number of pupils for which the per capita grant is paid at the Ahousaht Boarding school, I beg to say that the grant at present allowed this school is for 25 pupils at $100 per capita.\n\nThe quarterly return of attendance just received for the December quarter last, shows that there is an enrolment of 33 pupils at this school. The average attendance for the past year has been 30 pupils.\n\nThis school is under the auspices of the Presbyterian church, who have only two schools of the residential class in British Columbia, this and the school at Alberni. The grant allowed the latter school is for 50 pupils.\n\nMr. Inspector Ditchburn in his report of an inspection of this school gives the following particulars with regard to the air space in the dormitories:-\nBoys - No. 1 ..... 5660 cubic feet = 11 pupils\nNo. 2 ..... 3870 \" \" = 7 pupils\nNo. 3 ..... 2180 \" \" = 4 pupils\n\nGirls - No. 1 ..... 3570 cubic feet = 7 pupils\nNo. 2 ..... 2080 \" \" = 4 \"\nNo. 3 ..... 2080 \" \" = 4 \"\n\nThere is therefore sufficient dormitory and air space for 22 boys and 15 girls, or a total of 37 pupils.\n\nMr Ditchburn also says that the building is in a first class state of repair.\n\nAs there is sufficient accommodation and no difficulty in recruiting pupils, the grant for this school might be increased to provide for 35 pupils, at the per capita rate already allowed, viz., $100.00.\nOttawa, February 20, 1911.\n\nRev.

We have an application from Miss Lizzie Kelver, who is from Catalone, C.B. She has a teacher's certificate of Grade X, and has had over five years experience in teaching in the public school. Her application is accompanied by a very decisive testimonial from Rev. D. McLeod of Albert Bridge, C.B. He says \"I have known her for years. She is an admirable young lady, consistent, consecrated, and as devoted a Christian as I have had the pleasure of knowing. Her ambition for years has been to become a Foreign Missionary. She has not been able to find a way of preparing herself for that sphere so far. I am sure you will not be disappointed nor make a mistake if you appoint her to the position of teacher.\"\n\nAmongst a number of applications in our hands, this seems to be the most suitable. I shall be glad if it meets your approval, to be able to offer her the appointment at an early date. I wrote you the other day asking for your approval of Miss Grant's appointment to the Alberni School. I have not yet heard. The case is urgent, as they have been for some time waiting in Alberni.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRPM-ES.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

McLean\nSecretary of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI regret to report an accident which caused the death of a little girl in the school named Carrie George, age 8, eight years old. She was coming out of another little girl's tent to play near the school about one hundred yards away from the school at 5:45 p.m. She was away about twenty minutes when the little girl came running towards the school, her face half covered with the smoke of her clothes when she fell. A big boy named Donald was about two hundred feet away when he heard the call for help and rushed forward and quickly took off his clothing. He was able to save her life by removing her from the fire and giving part of her body. She was carried into the school and everything was done for her that was needed with the best treatment and fastest of burning. She lived about twenty hours.\n\nWe regret very much this sad affair as she was the youngest girl in school and a favorite with all. She had the matches from her own tent on her person and no harm can be attached to the school in any way. The carrying of matches by pupils is a bad habit. The school has always been strictly forbidden. No matches were allowed to be used except by the teacher. The teacher says she simply lost a match from her pocket and that the match ignited when washed and sudden hot water caught fire.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 8th of January last, in regard to certain charges made against Mr. Ross, Principal of the Ahousaht Boarding School, I beg to say that the Department is in receipt of a report from Mr. Inspector Ditchburn, who was instructed to make a thorough investigation into these charges, which exonerates Mr. Ross of all blame. Mr. Agent Cox has also reported that no blame attaches to Mr. Ross in connection with these charges.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Andrew S. Grant,\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of January 8, 1915, in which you inform me that complaints have been made against Mr. Ross, the principal of the Ahousaht Boarding School, by the Ahousaht Indians through Chief Benson Keatler and Billy August, and your request that I should visit Ahousaht to investigate these charges and report.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that I visited Ahousaht on the 3rd instant and met the Indians on the 4th, and while making my investigations my suspicions were confirmed that these complaints against Mr. Ross were framed up by the Indians as a result of his active assistance to the Indian Agent in stopping the potlatch.\n\nChief Benson Keatler informed me that although he had placed his signature to a letter to the Department complaining against Mr. Ross, there was no truth whatever in the statements made. At the time these letters were written the Indians were somewhat angry about the potlatch and he and Alexander Sutherland were induced to write to the Department. Sutherland was not to be found, he having left for Sidney Inlet immediately after my arrival at Ahousaht.\n\nOn November 26th the wife of Billy August and three Indians were taken to Clayoquot and tried before Magistrate Grice for potlatching. They were let off under suspended sentence.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nsentence after paying the costs of the Court. About this time Billy August wrote to me complaining about the matter, bewailing the fact that his wife had got into trouble. As I had a full knowledge of the case I replied to him that I considered the magistrate had dealt very leniently with the Indians, for he might very well have imposed the full penalty for potlatching provided under Section 149 of the Act.\n\nThat part of the letter of Billy August (of which I have received a copy) wherein he states that the Catholic missionary is better than the Presbyterian is the outcome of a visit made to Ahousaht by the Clayoquot priest, Rev. Father Schindler, which unfortunately took place at the time that Mr. Ross had gone to Clayoquot to attend the trial above referred to. At this time the Indians met the Catholic missionary and endeavored to enlist his sympathies in an effort to have the potlatch custom continued, or at least to allow potlatching to take place between the Ahousaht and Kelsomaht Indians. In an interview I had with Rev. Father Schindler I am convinced that this took place. The Reverend Father, however, claims that he gave them no promise that would lead them to believe he could do anything for them in the matter, except to say that he thought they should be allowed to potlatch locally amongst themselves.\n\nAs regards the complaint that Mr. Ross drove the Indians away from the Mission, the explanation of this is that on a certain Sunday Mr. Ross found the Indians playing baseball on the reserve, and he informed them that if they were going to desecrate the Sabbath by playing baseball he would not allow them the use of the school grounds upon which to play matches, and I consider that he was perfectly justified in taking this attitude.\nIn conclusion I may say that Mr. Ross has always taken a very keen interest in the spiritual and physical welfare of the Ahousaht Indians. At his school the children receive a splendid education and he himself devotes a great deal of time in giving the male pupils first-class instructions in carpentry and joining work and other useful employment. I am convinced that the Ahousaht Indians would be a long while before having another man as missionary to them who would look after their interests so well. I have no doubt that now the Department has started on an active campaign against the potlatch custom complaints, similar to those made against Mr. Ross, will be registered not only against missionaries but also officials of the Department, for the Indians will resent any action put forth by their best friends for the curtailment of some of their old tribal customs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Dittohun\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nWEST COAST INDIAN AGENCY,\n\nAlberni, B.C., Jan. 11, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to Dept.'s letter No.134628/1, of Dec. 15, 1914, I have the honour to submit the following report.\n\nI consider Rev. J. T. Ross, Principal of the Ahousaht Boarding School, one of the most conscientious missionaries, in this Agency. This school is conducted in a first class manner, as my reports on same always show.\n\nDuring the fifteen years of his missionary work among the Indians, he has on all occasions befriended them, except when in so-doing, it might prove detrimental to their welfare and advancement. Over seven years ago, his first wife died of consumption, contracted through visiting and attending to Indians suffering from this loathsome disease. Mr. Ross' life among the Indians has been one of self denial and self sacrifice. The greater part of the time, he has had his children with him, and in these out-of-way places such as Dodger's Cove and Ahousaht, where Mr. Ross has been stationed, there is absolutely no opportunity for them to attend a white school of any kind. Then again it is not at all beneficial to a child's health, to be brought up among Indians.\n\nWhile the Indians very frequently establish and circulate these fabulous stories about Mr. Ross' character and the manner in which he conducts the school, at the same time he commands a great deal of respect from them.\n\nReferring to the letter of complaint written by Billy\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nWEST COAST INDIAN AGENCY,\n\nAlberni, B.C.\n\nSir,\u2014 \n\nBilly August, his wife was one of those prosecuted for \"potlatching\". This fact explains his reason for writing. None of the Indians mentioned in his letter were in jail. They were taken from Ahousaht to Clayquot, a distance of nine miles, for trial, and were let out on suspended sentence, after paying the costs of prosecution. He also states that Mr. Ross sentenced an Indian by the name of Johnny John to two months in jail. In the first place Mr. Ross had nothing to do with this case. The local J. P. Mr. J. Grace, heard the case and imposed the sentence of two months in jail, in which he was quite justifiable. The Indian was accused and found guilty of beating his wife.\n\nWith reference to the other charge against Mr. Ross, in the letter written by A. Sutherland (an ordinary ex-pupil of the Ahousaht Mission, and not Reverend) that of turning the young men from church, it is absolute absurdity. These young men went over to the Mission to visit the girls and not to attend any church service. Mr. Ross emphasized the fact that he would not allow them around the school, when they had no special business and were there for no good purpose. They went away quietly and said no more about it. But, this is the instance, where they mention that they went back to their reserve, \"with weeping hearts for the 'Bread of Life' \". The remaining two paragraphs of this letter are quite as ridiculous as the first, if not more so.\n\nIt is needless for me to state that these foolish, meaningless letters have all been written since the prosecution of certain Indians of this Agency, for \"potlatching\".

Scott,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing a letter from Mr. Ross of Ahousaht, which is his answer to the charges that have been laid against him by the petition signed and forwarded to you.\n\nI will be glad, after you have read this letter, to have an expression of opinion from you, with a return of the letter.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\nAhousaht, B. C., Dec. 24, 1914.\n\nDear Dr. Grant,\n\nI received your letter of December 11th with enclosure of a letter you received from the Indian Department, Ottawa. On Dec. 22nd, I had an interview with the young man, Alex Sutherland, who wrote the letter for the Indians of Ahousaht. Before Mrs. Ross, Miss McIvor and myself he confessed that the charges laid against me in the letter are false.\n\nAlthough there is still some ill-feeling against me on the part of graduates of the Roman Catholic school and possibly a half a dozen of our own following, still almost all the Ahousahts are on friendly terms with us. Of course there has been trouble between myself and the Ahousaht Indians, but to be fair the Indians are not to be blamed so much when you know the whole truth.\n\nFor some time I have taken an active part in the suppression of intertribal potlatching. I was the first on the West Coast to lay information before the authorities of a breach of the Indian Act in regard to the custom. In spite of warning from the Indian Agent Cox and myself the Ahousaht Tribe gave a potlatch to the Kelsomaht Tribe Nov. 20th. As it was the first offense four Indians paid the cost, $7.25 each and were let out with a warning that if they were found guilty on a second offense they would be sent to jail. I may say here that I do not think our Indians will break the law again. One lesson will prove sufficient. The potlatch custom when confined to each individual tribe is a harmless custom and simply amounts to inexpensive feasting and dancing. An Indian will invite the whole tribe to feast in an chief's house. He may spend from\n$10.00 to $15.00 on sea biscuits or rice to feed the entire tribe, which after all is no more than the average cost of Christmas in the majority of white homes in Canada. But the intertribal potlatching custom is bad. So long as it continues there is no possibility of Indian advancement in British Columbia. Of course, naturally, the Indian feels pretty sore about the new law and they were angry because I was the first to take up a case of the kind on the West Coast.\n\nNow I wish to put the blame just where it belongs. The very day I was called away to give evidence on this particular case held in Clayoquot court, a Jesuit Priest landed here from Clayoquot. The Indians gathered together and the priest spoke to them in a body sympathizing with them and promised to help them. He told them that there was a law against intertribal potlatching but that he would use his influence to help them so that they could potlatch the Kelsomahts. Further I have Indian witnesses to prove that the letter written by Alex Sutherland to the Department was written in the presence of Father Joseph Schindler. Father Joseph did not write it with his own hand but he heard it discussed and was there while a rough draft of the letter was made. Only twice during 1913 was mass said in the Roman Catholic Chapel at Ahousaht, but every time a jesuit priest pays a visit to Ahousaht trouble is made for us. The following Sunday after Father Joseph had his meeting, he landed to say mass for graduates of the Catholic school. After mass he had the audacity to send one of our graduates over to the school to invite our boys over to a meeting which he wished to hold with all the young men on the reserve. The young man delivered his\nmessage but did not return. At this meeting Father Joseph promised to open a night school to teach the young men Latin. Last Sunday Father Joseph landed again but only a few of our following went to his service while we had the largest attendance since last winter. Let me say in closing that the real source of trouble here does not originate so much from any measure of discipline I may exercise in the school or on the reserve but from the mean underhand advantage taken by the Jesuit Priests to sow discord and enmity by showing pretended sympathy to those Indians who wilfully break the laws of the country. I have often said that an Indian's loyalty is worth about the price of a blanket but after all they have shown more loyalty recently than I expected considering what I felt it my duty to do in bringing some of them to task. \"As the end justifies the means\" with a Jesuit priest, they may eventually win out by their unjust, underhand policy but I shall always have the consolation of knowing that I tried to help the Indians along by an honest policy and my justice has always been tempered with mercy.\n\nI am yours sincerely\n\nSgd.

B.C.\n\n24/12/1915\n\nAll of the aboriginal peoples ask me to write you a letter again, to tell you about our missionary, Mr Ross who is always making a lot of trouble in here of Ahousat. We want if you help us get away that man from this mission, we want have new man at him police man because he want police man.\n\nOn the Saturday 19th of this month Mr Ross was trouble again with Jode. Mr Ross was not allow Jode's little girl going on the Saturday when all the girls and boys went home, and he was very angry to Jane. Jane was very sorry for his little girl was crying she want to go home with her father. The little girl was crying long time so she got sick she is 8 years of age, the man was very sorry because he have only one child.\nMr. Ross was trouble again with Chief George some day on the 19th of this month. He was very angry to Chief George. Chief George was reply to him he said why did you always angry to me, you know I give you three of my children. Mr. Ross replied he said he will put him into jail he will charge him $60 or $70 believe that man he is a bad man, Mr. Miller, and Mr. Butchart they was in the mission.

I have taken up the proposals submitted with the Hon. the Superintendent General, and most careful consideration has been given them.\n\nWhile the offer of the W.M.S. Board in the way of helping to finance the erection of a central boarding school building that would meet the requirements of the church in that district is appreciated, the undertaking is so large I regret that we cannot see our way clear to assume the obligation at the present time. I wish, however, to express my sympathy with the desire of the church to continue their work in these fields, and hope that they will be able to do so under temporary conditions.\n\nI am prepared to grant my approval of the appointment of Mr. Vandervoon as teacher of a day school at Ahoushat and will allow a salary of $750.00 per annum. As soon as you are ready to accommodate a field matron at this point too a fair salary for such service will be granted, the understanding being that a graduate nurse will be engaged.\n\nI think it would be well to continue the day school at Ucluelet as formerly. I note that the attendance\n\nRev. J. H. Edmison, B.A.,\nSecretary of the Board of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nthere has been very satisfactory, and, pending some arrangement to place the children in boarding schools, the day school should be kept in operation.\n\nThe most difficult situation to meet temporarily is that at Alberni. If Mr. Currie can make satisfactory arrangements to keep the children in residence there, the grant will be continued. It is realized of course that the accommodation cannot be up to the standard of the old school.\n\nWe shall grant the holidays as requested by Mr. Currie in a previous letter from the time of the fire till the end of July, by which time Mr. Currie hoped to be able to make temporary provision for the continuance of the school. I have not heard lately from him but I presume he has been able to carry out his plans.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory and hoping to hear from you at an early date, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

I trust this appointment will find your approval, and that the Government will provide the salary. I judge that you will not consider the appointment of a field matron until you have definitely decided on the policy in regard to the work on the Coast.\n\nHoping that we may hear from you soon,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/EB\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

As a substitute they are suggesting the name of H. W. Vanderveen, who is at present in charge at Ucluelet. At the meeting of our Sub-Executive yesterday, our Board approved of the appointment of Mr. Vanderveen, and I have been instructed to forward the name for the consideration of the Department. We suggest that Mr. Vanderveen take charge of Ahousaht not later than the 1st of October.

You state, \"On examination these are found to be satisfactory and meet the requirements for a Class C school with an enrolment of 25 pupils and staff.\" We do not understand just what you mean by \"Class C school\". We have never had any of that grade. It is possible that Mr. Scott did not explain, before leaving, the agreement we reached, when Mr. Turnbull and I conferred with him a few weeks ago. The understanding reached was to the effect, that our Church would get per capita grant usually given to Class B school. At the present time that would mean $110. per pupil.\n\nYou understand that the Church is putting up this building to help the Government out at a time of stress. A year ago, it was suggested that the Government put up one big Boarding School at the Coast. Mr. Scott found he could not go ahead with the building at the present time.\n\nMr. Currie has been doing the work at Alberni in temporary quarters, provided by the Church.\n\nWe thought we could solve the problem at Ahousaht, by a day-school. After a year's experiment, all parties are convinced that a day-school is not practicable at Ahousaht, as the parents of the children are not at home more than five months of the year.\n\nWe expect that the Government will put up a building at Alberni in the year 1919, but to tide over the present crisis, the W.M.S. consented to put up a small building at Ahousaht to accommodate 25 pupils. Our understanding with Mr. Scott was, that this building would be\nsmall and not too expensive. There will be no difficulty in putting an isolation sick room in the upper story. We will see that provision is made for this.\n\nKindly let us know by return mail, if the Department is prepared to allow us per capita grant given to schools in Grade B.\n\nWe could not undertake to maintain this school on a smaller grant. The school at this point was always expensive. There is no good farm land and the children will be young and unable to undertake manual labor of any kind. The price of everything to be purchased is very expensive and freight rates are high.\n\nWe are anxious to commence work at once. As soon as I get a reply, I will wire men at the Coast. Mr. Ross who is to put up the building is already on the ground and has some of the materials purchased.\n\nHoping to hear by return mail, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/LM.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Water for domestic purposes from two tanks at the top of the building. The laundry, with full equipment, is in the basement, as well as a bench for carpentering and plumbing operations. On the main floor, in addition to the ordinary rooms, there is a dispensary and post office, the last of which is run by the Principal. All four sides of the rooms in the building are finished in wood. Water for bathing purposes is heated by the kitchen range.\n\nA separate classroom will be needed soon, as the present one (separate building outside) is very small. The old classroom could be used for infirmary purposes in the event of a new one being provided. Mrs. Millar does excellent work in the classroom. Miss Chambers, the field matron, is an excellent officer.\n\nThe needs are as follows:\n\n1. Classroom,\n2. Small Barn,\n3. Equipment for heating water,\n4.

(RG 10, Volume 6430, file 876-1, part 1)\nToronto, October 18th, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nRe Ahousaht Indian Boarding School\n\nAt the Executive of our Board of Home Missions and Social Service held recently, we had before us a communication from the Women's Missionary Society, emphasizing the need for further accommodation at Ahousaht Indian Boarding School, British Columbia. After discussion, it was agreed, unanimously, to ask the Indian Department to provide for a pupilage of thirty-five at Ahousaht, rather than twenty-five as at present. I understand that the building can be made to accommodate thirty-five by using part of the attic, which can be fitted up at very little expense to the Church. As a matter of fact, we are now carrying five additional pupils, for which we are receiving no Government grant.\n\nAs Mr. Ferrier visited Ahousaht last summer, he will be in position to advise you in regard to the number of pupils that are available. Since the Department of Indian Affairs has made the attendance of Indian children compulsory, our Executive feel that provision should be made for them in the School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJH Edmonson\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of the Department's letter of 14th instant, re the appointment of the Rev. W.H. Wood, as Principal of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School, and note the instructions contained therein, and beg to advise the Department that those instructions will be complied with and every possible assistance rendered the Rev. Principal when he assumes his duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd. B. Frost.\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 8, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th ultimo, asking certain questions in connection with Indian schools on Vancouver Island. There are five residential schools and seven day schools for the Indian children of the Island. All are financed by grants from this Department; and all, with the exception of one day school, are managed by one or other of the churches that are co-operating with the Department in the education of Indian children. I am enclosing the Department's annual report for the year ended March 31st, 1927. You will find on page 43 a brief recapitulation of the educational activity, and on page 52 a table showing the Indian day and residential schools in the Dominion. I am also enclosing two numbers of the Government publication \"Natural Resources,\" in which you will find articles on Indian Education.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church manages the Kuper Island Indian Residential School, near Chemainus, on the east coast. This is a state owned institution, with a pupilage of 95 and a staff of 11. This Church also conducts the Christie Indian Residential School at Kakawis (Clayoquot Sound), on the west coast. This is a Church owned school, with a pupilage of 90 and a staff of 10. The United Church manages the Alberni Indian Residential School at Alert Bay\u2014a state owned institution, with a pupilage of 110 and a staff of 9. The United Church also conducts Ahousaht School, to which you have lately been appointed\u2014a Church owned school, with a pupilage of 40 and a staff of 4. The Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada manages the Alert Bay Indian Residential School at Alert Bay, at the northern end of the Island\u2014a state owned institution, with a pupilage of 60 and a staff of 10. I may say that the buildings at the last named school are being replaced this year, and the pupilage there will soon be over 100. Additional facts concerning these residential schools will be found on page 52 of the report.\n\nSix of the seven day schools are on, or near, the east coast of the Island, and from south to north are as follows: Songhees (R.C.), Kokailah (Undenom.), Cowichan (R.C.), Nanaimo (United), Cape Mudge (United), Alert Bay (Church of England). On the west coast there is the Uclulet Indian Day School (United). Concerning these day schools, please see page 58 of the report.\n\nYou ask for the regulations of the Department\n\nRev. W. R. Wood,\n44 Cobourg Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\n- concerning -\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6430, file 876-1, part 1)\nconcerning education. There is enclosed a copy of the Indian Act, and I would refer you to Sections 9, 10 and 11. There are no printed regulations in this connection, but I am enclosing several circulars which will indicate, in part, the Department's wishes and suggest to you the various activities.\n\nThe Indians of Vancouver Island, with the exception of those of the south eastern part, are of the Nootka branch of the Kwakiutl-Nootka family. The Ahousaht and Clayoquot tribes are Nootka. The Indians of the south eastern part of the Island are Cowichan of the Salish family. There are approximately 3850 Indians on Vancouver Island. The figures and those following are but approximate, as many of the groups of the north western part of the Island are also on the little islands in the channel and on the mainland. Our latest census shows the religions of the Vancouver Island Indians to be approximately as follows: Roman Catholic 1800, United 1250, Church of England 470, other Christian beliefs 230, aboriginal beliefs 100.\n\nYour enquiry regarding higher education among the Indians. I have to say that there have been few experiments with the Vancouver Island Indians and practically none in connection with the tribes served by the Ahousaht Indian Residential School. All Indian schools are inspected by Government officers, and, if they are not too far from the lines of communication, are inspected, also, at this Department's request, by officers of the Provincial Department of Education. The Indian Agent - in the case of the Ahousaht School Mr. E. E. Frost, Port Alberni, the Inspector of Indian Agencies and the Inspector of Indian Schools, all visit the Ahousaht Institution when possible.\n\nTo reach Ahousaht, it is necessary to take a Canadian Pacific Steamship at Victoria or Port Alberni. You might consult a C.P.R. time table. As far as this Department knows, there is no motor connection whatever with points any distance north west of Alberni. There is, of course, no use whatever for a motor car in the vicinity of Ahousaht.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

May pupils be discharged while they are still under sixteen years of age? May parents insist on discharge as soon as the age of sixteen is reached? May they insist on retention of a pupil up to eighteen years of age?\n\nSecond, in regard to children in homes which are judged to be unfit for the rearing of children through the parents drinking or being incompetent and neglectful, may a school principal refuse to permit pupils to go to such home simply on his own judgment or must he have official authority from the Agent or the Department? In the case of children under school age in such a home, what action is possible in order to secure proper care for them?\n\nThird, are there any regulations other than those of Sections 9-11a of the Indian Act governing the conduct of Indian Schools in British Columbia?\n\nFourth, is there legislation in effect constituting the principal of an Indian School, or the School itself the legal guardian of the pupils? If so just what powers are conferred and do they extend over the whole period in which the child is a pupil, including vacations?\n\nFifth, the 'Indian Act' which I have is entitled \"The Indian Act, 1906 as amended by 9-10 Ed. vii, 1910 -c.28 1-2 Geo. v, 1911 - c.14 4-5 Geo v. 1914 - c75, 5-9 Geo. v 1918 -c.20.\" Is there later legislation or regulation which should be in my hands?\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Wood, called at this office today, on his way to Ahousaht to take over his appointment, School matters were discussed at some length and it was arranged that my visit to the school should be deferred until later in the month when Mr. Wood had become accustomed to the school and would be able to make a report on same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd.

ARTHUR BARNER\n\nThe following extract, which is taken from the diary of a pioneer missionary and dated 1884, will reveal some of the conditions which existed in those days.

Thus far I had done it in the house of the chief, but it was a terrible place.\n\n\"The house of the chief was over one hundred feet in length, by sixty in width. The corner posts were immense pieces of cedar twenty feet high; they were met on top by long sticks three feet through. One monster beam was laid across the centre and served as crosspiece to support the roof planks. With a fall, for rain and water of only about two feet, the roof lay almost flat. This is now the form of all the Indians' houses on this coast\u2014immense places with almost flat roofs. The sides are cedar planks fastened by ropes of cedar bark below and above. The cedar roof planks are chiseled out so as to leave a groove for the rain. In fine weather one of these planks is raised and shoved above its neighbor to let in air and give a place of exit for the smoke.\n\n\"In this chief's house twelve different...\"\nfamilies had their home\u2014twelve different open fireplaces supplied the room with smoke and heat. There were no windows in the house, although the crevices between the wall planks permitted some light to enter. How could I instruct these people in such a horrible place of filth and smoke\u2014not mentioning the noise made by the quarrelling of the women, the crying of children, the growling and fighting of dogs? . . .\nAnd then the immodest bearing of the numerous inmates! Yes! I required a place to try and do something for the Ahousaht Indians, and now I rejoice that when I go there next season I will have a place of my own, no matter how poor and how undesirable it may look or be.\n\n\"During my stay at Ahousaht I was greatly amused to see a couple of young Indians taking their walk around the place with each a shoe on one foot only! The man wore a shirt with a blanket over his shoulder and the wife had also a blanket over her dress; both had their faces painted with red vermilion. I was told that the reason for this odd action was that they had recently become the parents of twins. By this time they had gone through a very hard experience, and they were still looked upon by all the people as outcasts and as to be shunned. No one will use the vessels they have used to drink or to eat. Those left to be starved dry fish, nothing fresh is to pass their lips. Now, and for a long time to come, they are not allowed to go on the sea in canoes either to fish or for pleasure. The man has to retire daily in the forest, and by shouting and bathing reconcile the 'spirits.' Their life is not a pleasant one, as every one avoids them, and being forbidden to go after food, they have before them the prospect of famine and endless miseries. The birth of twins is a source of great excitement with all the Indians on the coast. They have special songs for the occasion in which all the principal men of the tribe, \"in\" before the house where the twins are born.\n\n\"Another time unusual excitement was caused by one of our chiefs becoming crazy. The Indians soon bethought themselves of an old remedy. They took the crazy man up to the river in the boat. Half a dozen men had charge of him and carried in hands branches of brushwood. . . . given signal they began to flog him; then they took the man by the hair and forced his head under water. The bubbles indicated when to allow him up for breath. Then flogging recommenced . . . and the head under water again. . . . and the process continued till very little life was left in him. Their idea was to flog out the bad spirit who was supposed to be in the poor insane chief!\"\n\nTo visit Ahousaht today would certainly convince the most sceptical person of the uplifting and regenerating influences brought to bear on the Indians by the prosecution of Christian work in their midst. The village is a very different place; the domestic life is much improved. The number of gasoline launches owned by the Indians speaks of their progress in industry. The neat church building on the hill, filled each Sunday with a well-dressed congregation, and the Community House in the village where social service work is carried on, demonstrate the great advances which are taking place in a moral and spiritual way.\n\nOne of the greatest influences in bringing these changes can be traced to the work which is carried on at the Residential School nearby, under the auspices of the Department of Indian Affairs and The Woman's Missionary Society. Fifty bright and progressive girls and boys soon convince the visitor that there is a bright future for the Indian people, that old things are passing away and all things are becoming new, in the lives of the natives of Canada.\nPOTLATCH GOES INTO DISCARD\n\nWest Coast Indians Stage Modern Carnival of Sports on Holiday.\n\nSTEER COOKED WHOLE\n\nOld-time Indian potlatch has been tossed into the discard and tribes of the West Coast of Vancouver Island have adopted the white man's method of sporting events. This West Coast Indians inaugurated at Matilda Creek, near Port Alberni, a water and field carnival which promises to become an established provincial attraction.\n\nThese tribes celebrated Victoria Day last Thursday with great banquets and they made a great success of it. The enthusiasm and arrangements and success is due to work of the Aboush tribe.\n\nFour hundred Indians, representing tribes from Kyuquot Sound to head of Albemarle attended. In addition there were many white people, and the total attendance was 600. Three hundred dollars was distributed in prizes for various events, and cooked whole. All visitors were guests of the Aboush tribe.\n\nENJOYMENT\n\nJoseph Titian threw open his big house Saturday night for an Indian dance and white people preferring more than 100 were entertained by dance on SS. Princess Norah by Captain John Keithiah and Harold Little of Matilda Creek. The Indians also had a basketball game.\n\nThe Indians decided to observe Sunday as a day of rest, and did little else but barbecue and eat the steer. Monday was filled day with running races for a party of seventy-five Japans and Indians, and races between John Keithiah and Harold Little of Matilda Creek. There was also second money in running races, though the Indians won. The Indians also took the distance event and pole vault.\n\nGibson's Mill team defeated the Aboush school football team, 2 to 1. The tug-of-war, for a trophy presented by Mr. Gibson, was won by the Dehelet Indians and the Aboush tribe captured the relay race and basketball game.\n\nJ. Cohen, forest ranger, informed the writer that Captains Arthur Higginbotham of Vancouver handled the affair. The committee responsible for the affair comprised Captains John Keithiah of the Aboush tribe, and Charles Dixon and Gordon Gibson of Matilda Creek. Pauline Gibson, wife of Gordon Gibson, was present, accompanied by her son, who attended the old school.\n\nIn the latter evening Joseph Thomas of Christie's school gave a clever exhibition of canoe work and Herbert Peter and David McCallum romped away with the upset canoe race.\nopportunity to spread His Kingdom in this nation. It is really encouraging to see almost all the churches united in this campaign as never before. We increasingly feel that God has His own plan of Christianising this country.\"\n\nRecently, Dr. C.Y. Cheng, Moderator of the Church of Christ in China, and General Secretary of the National Christian Council in China, spoke at a conference on \"The Forward Looking Church.\" A call went out in consequence increased co-operative support from the home land, and for young men and women \"of large vision and spiritual power,\" who are willing to work with the Chinese as fellow workers in order that they may contribute to \"the greatest potential Christian adventure of today.\"\n\nChristian Literature in China\n\nTHE LITTLE Quarterly Link, sent by the Christian Literature Society of China, and written for the most part by Dr. Donald MacGillivray of Shanghai, is always full of interest. Dr. MacGillivray, who has done so much for the Society in the past, has resigned from the position of General Secretary, and there has been appointed an executive committee, consisting of all the members of the staff, whether Chinese or foreign, who have been set apart for the work of the Society.\n\nAmong the many books translated this year we see listed Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility. It is translated by a devout Chinese Christian lady, who said that she had to stop her work more than once to shed a sympathising tear! Some hours the reader of this book will sing, losing herself in the grim atmosphere of old time England, and entering into the joys and sorrows of girls of another country and another age, remains with us pleasantly.\n\nThere is another book published in Braille for the blind in Shanghai, this time a translation of The Other Wise Man. As copies of these will be distributed free to all who need them, it is hoped that the expense will be met by a special gift from some one interested. The books are all written now in the national language of China.\n\nDr. MacGillivray says: \"The man in the street has little idea how the books of the Society are produced. He has a vague notion that there are 'translator fellows' in there, but how vague an idea does that title express! They are not engaged, exactly, in translating books, but they are engaged in translating ideas in such a way that they can be put across to the Chinese. In travail of soul and sweat of brain, the work goes on, day in and day out.\"\n\nMr. J.G. Holland, who writes: \"The world has no ear for anything a man has to utter that has not been previously distilled in the alembic of his own life.\" One can imagine no challenge more striking for any of us, than that truth.\n\nThe Society began years ago with one missionary board. It has now representatives from ten principal boards, and is one of the best examples of successful cooperation in all China. May it continue to serve an ever increasing circle of people there!\n\nThe Fifth Annual Meeting\n\nAS WE hand the final copy of this issue of the magazine to the printer, the Fifth Annual Meeting of the Dominion Board of The Woman's Missionary Society of The United Church has become a thing of the past. Renewals of old friendships, new acquaintanceships and endless details in the branching organizations of our large Society, were all part of the day's happenings. Underneath one sensed the greater issues for which the Society stands\u2014that hope, which is more and more clearly defined as at the root of the real missionary enterprise, that Jesus Christ may be manifested in every department of human life.\n\nWe missed familiar faces\u2014particularly those of the President, Mrs. MacGillivray, and the General Secretary, Miss Effie A. Jamieson. Our thoughts were often with both\u2014Miss Jamieson in Africa and Mrs. MacGillivray in Wonsan, Korea, from which place she sent affectionate greetings.\n\nWe will give an account of the Board meetings in the August number of the magazine.\nLanding the New Music at Ahousat\n\nWILLIAM R. WOOD\n\nAHOUSAT? Just where in the world is that? Of old time the central rendezvous of the Ahousat Indians was on the western shore of Vargas Island which occupies the southern area of Clayoquot Sound. Being Canadians you are of course familiar with the general topography of the West Coast. But some three generations ago bitter enmity arose between the Ahousats and a group of Indians who occupied the little peninsula which juts out from the south-eastern corner of Flores Island. The Ahousats, who were a warlike and energetic group, annihilated the northern village, massacred its inhabitants almost to a man, and recognizing the advantages of a site with an interior harbor on one side and ready access to the outer waters on the other, settled down and gave their name to the new location. The name is now applied to the village, to the post office on the western shore of the creek, and to the Indian School which adjoins the reserve.\n\nThe new music? Yes, of course, there has been earlier music. From primeval times groups of men and women, seated on the grass on summer afternoons or on the floor of some big house on winter evenings, played the wild chimes of la-hal, the gaming device, which appears to have been universal among the Coast tribes, and accompanied it with the incessant tat-tat-tat of clashing sticks. But for a generation or more Christian hymns have been heard here and there by the music of a little portable organ and, in the little church and the Indian School, small house organs have helped in the service of praise. But time and the dampness of the British Columbia climate had long ago played havoc with their melody and there was dire need of something better.\n\nTwo of the workers at the school, recognizing not only the religious value of music but its general cultural importance and being convinced of the possibility of effecting a revival of the musical talents of some of the Ahousat youth, decided that the need was urgent and immediate. The facilities simply must be secured. Being above all things practical, and of the devoted spirit which has been so common a characteristic of our work among the Indians and never suspecting that even such semi-publicity as this would be given to their generous action, they took steps to have them purchased in Vancouver and shipped by the C.P.R. steamer up the coast.\n\nAnd now the day of their arrival, a piano for the school and an organ for the Village Community House, has come. All the children are on the tip-toe of expectancy and the grown-ups are wondering about the coming of such precious and ponderous pieces of furniture. As the day advances we hear by telephone of the steamer at Ucluelet, a name with many old-time associations in the Indian work of the Presbyterian Church, then at Tofino and finally at Clarks Point, and by this time it is dark and we are compelled to realize that the landing cannot be to-night. No piano could be landed by canoe and got up the rocks in the dark. So reluctantly we are compelled to decide that the music must be allowed to go to Macdonald Creek, where it may be placed on the wharf till the return of daylight. Going out in the big dug-out as the steamer passes we are able to assure ourselves that the music has really come, seeing the two big cases on the lower deck and the landing out of drums and other supplies, we pass the night with what patience we can.\n\nIn the morning our faithful man of all work meets us at the reserve float with the launch and landing scow and a group of us step on board. En route to Clarks Point we get the most news for our once-in-ten-days mail, and by that time it has begun to rain with every appearance of giving us a day of it. But after\na half-hour's downpour\u2014the genuine British Columbia article\u2014it slackens, and by the time we reach the Gibson wharf the sun is out again.\n\nWith the help of willing hands, strong ropes, heavy plank and convenient little rollers, the piano is soon placed on the scow and we set off for the school, leaving the organ for a second trip as its destination is the Community House in the village. Opposite the school we anchor the launch and with long pike poles work the scow toward the land. In a few minutes it is close ashore and planks and rollers are soon brought into requisition to place the piano on the beach. It is only a few feet and the slope is downward so there is no difficulty and we push the scow off again before the falling tide can leave it stranded. Anchoring it with the launch we face the task of negotiating the rocky slope, above which the school stands.\n\nAll the boys are on hand, and four or five brawny young Indians from the village. Planks are laid forward up the rocks and the heavy tow rope is brought on which twenty or more can pull. With a couple of cedar rollers under the piano it begins slowly to move up the rocks. With many an \"All together\" and \"Everybody on the tow\" it advances foot by foot. For much of the way it is heavy pulling and the relaying of the plank track is no child's play. But this is a school function, the sun is shining, the boys are in working humor and there is no delay. Soon the steepest and roughest part is passed. The pullers move their burden ten or twelve feet at each effort. Then comes the final stage, up the steep outer stairway to the front hall of the school. Then the planks are laid. The rope team stretches up the steps across the hall and into the dining-room. Here their efforts are rewarded by the ladies of the school and almost with a bound the heavy case is landed in the hall. Paul Sam, the biggest of our Indian helpers, is the first to voice our satisfaction in the triumphant exclamation, \"Home at last.\"\n\nThen it is not long ere the beautiful instrument, relieved of its heavy casing, is carried into the sitting-room and the school gather round, full of curiosity and wonder to see and hear it. Quite undesignedly and yet appropriately enough it happens that the first air picked out by Winona, one of our senior girls, was \"God Save the King,\" and as the shining keys under her touch gave out the sound so familiar and yet strangely sweet from this new instrument, the group sang the first and second stanza of the anthem.\n\nAnd what of the organ, you ask? Oh, we didn't forget it. As the scow and the launch were taken back to their haven in the inner creek, the mill workers lent a hand and it was placed on the scow, the\nplan being to cover it with a tarpaulin for the night and unload it at the village in the morning. The sky was clear and there was every indication of fine weather and a chance to finish our task in the morning sunshine. So we slept quite late but at nine o'clock in the morning\u2014what? Rain? Impossible! But we should have learned ere this that nothing, excepting perhaps forty below, is impossible in British Columbia in the way of weather. A heavy drizzle had begun, and soon it was a \"regular\" rain, and word came across that the organ was not to be damaged it must be got under cover very soon. There was no alternative.\n\nWith five boys rigged in every available rain coat, oilskin and rubber boot we set off over the plank walk to the village where the scow was to meet us at nine-thirty. Rain, rain, rain! We go on raining, raining, raining, on the muddy bank waiting, and we tramp off the long float as the scow arrives. Slats are nailed across the front and back ends of the crate, and under them, along its sides, poles are placed for carrying. Strong of arm and sure of our ability to carry it anywhere we lift the case and move along the float. But when we have gone fifty feet, it is convenient to pause for a minute, and by the time we reach the landward end of the float we realize that we have not the man-power needed to take it up the village slope and over to its destination in the Community House. But it is raining and there is nobody about. At last some one suggests Noah. He lives just at hand and we rouse him out of his \"ark\" to give us a lift. By the time he reaches us, Daniel, who in spite of the rain had ventured out of his \"den,\" came past and took thought for our need. With the assistance of these two Old Testament worthies we reach rather laboriously still, the steps of the Community House. Rain, rain, rain, as we fumble for the key and discover that the doorway is an inch narrower than the organ-case. Rain, rain, rain, while we hurriedly pry off the tarpaulin, holding the tarpaulin across to prevent its getting wet, slide the organ at last into the building. Then, wet as we are, we sit down to take breath and to congratulate ourselves that in spite of all obstacles we have got both instruments landed safely, and without the slightest injury, in the places for which they were designed.\n\nAnd now as the boys pass the village people and their friends from Kilsonat and Opitsat come in twos and threes to look at and admire the instruments. To most of them the piano is new, so large, so finely polished, so sweet-toned, so much better than the old organs. And we look forward into the years, see the children getting better musical training with one here and another there being taught to play the instruments themselves and gradually the procuring of instruments for their homes. We see better music in the services and a richer culture all around for the second succeeding generations as a result of the splendid devotion of two workers through which, as we have seen, the new music came to Ahousat.\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI am enclosing today a letter setting forth\nthe whole situation at Ahousat by Rev. William\nR. Wood who has just left this Indian School.\n\nWe appreciate very much indeed the ready\nassistance of the Department in putting the School\nin such fine order, and when all the intended\nrepairs and extensions are completed the whole prop-\nerty will be in a most satisfactory condition.\n\nWith every kind regard,\n\nYours most faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCCY:BJ\nHCL.\nAhousat, B.C., Nov. 5th, 1929.\n\nTo Mr. Clark, Dr. Young, and\nthe H. M. and W. M. S. Offices.\n\nMy term as principal of the Ahousat Indian School has come to an end, and I write to sum up the situation as it appears to me at this time.\n\nMay I say in the first place that the most gratifying feature is the fact that in the new principal you have secured a man with a record of long experience and successful service in Indian work. Mr. Jones needed no introduction to the work, and I feel that in his hands there is reason to expect the very fullest success of which the school is capable. Beside his knowledge of Indian character and conditions, his training as a carpenter and his practical experience in handling boats and canoes, will prove of the very highest value for the work here. I judge that he will fit admirably into the situation and that in his hands the future of the school will be well taken care of.\n\nMy success in getting the premises into good shape has been only partial. The structural changes contemplated are within sight of completion and I am sure will lessen the difficulties of the staff and make the care of the children much easier. Commodious playrooms for both boys and girls with new stairways at the ends instead of the middle of the building will help greatly. The heating plant (a hot water furnace with coal as the fuel) was got into operation a few days ago and heats the whole building comfortably and effectively. The new water and toilet systems, after the utmost driving I have been able to do is yet two weeks from completion. The men are now working on it and it should be in operation before the close of November. The delay has been due solely to the fact that the contractor did not get his men here till a few weeks ago. Their delay has also held up our getting the new kitchen range into operation, but that will be got going shortly when the water system is connected up. The department has declined for the present to supply a laundry washer which is urgently necessary. I am making one more effort before I leave to have them undertake it, but with little hope of securing immediate action. But with all slips and delays it can still be said that the school is a hundred per cent better adapted for its work than it was in January last. The Department in view of the increased dining room, dormitory and classroom accommodation increased the pupilage from October 1st to 45 and provided for a further increase to 50 in the spring.\n\nTwo or three things should be noted very particularly regarding the premises. First, certain further expenditures, not of very large amount, are rendered necessary by the work done during this season, and will be required in the near future. I have in mind first of all the lighting. The plant requires increased storage, and may need a new generator to carry the additional lights which must be put in. Some sixteen to twenty additional bulbs will be needed to light the new power building, the new playrooms, the class room and the dormitories. And this should be put in at the earliest possible moment. Considerable glass and wire screening for protection of the windows should be procured. The new playrooms ought to be given at least one coat of paint. We received\na donation of rails for the freight track, but it will be necessary to secure some cement and some timber, - not a large quantity - for rebuilding the track itself.\n\nIn accordance with directions from the office a winch has been got at a cost of $75, and a cable is being ordered which will cost approximately $25.\n\nAfter fairly full consideration and discussion with other workers I am taking the liberty of urging as my convinced opinion that the Church would be wise from every point of view to approach the Indian Department and offer to turn over to it the ownership of this whole school property, land and buildings. To do this would mean that the Department would come to feel a much more direct and immediate responsibility for maintaining the equipment and the church and Society would be relieved of certain financial obligations which sometimes are fairly heavy. At the same time the opportunities for real service to the Indians which the Church enjoys would not be in any degree circumscribed. I think that the present time, when the Department has just expended over $8000 on the property is 'the psychological moment' to make this approach. Experienced workers among the Indians here are of the same opinion, and I am glad to find the new principal holds the same view.\n\nI have to report, also, that Mrs. Payne, our kitchen matron here, who is over seventy-three years of age and has given some years of wonderfully effective service, has decided that she must give up her position. She will be glad to be relieved at an early date. I have communicated with Mrs. Wicken of Vancouver and she is endeavoring to secure someone to take the position. Mrs. Payne I know, is retiring with very limited means, and if the Committee in its wisdom could see its way to giving her an honorarium of, say, a month's salary, it would be a very Christian way of expressing appreciation of the unique service she has rendered, and the scores of nights when she has sacrificed her sleep to get refreshments for the Indian boys engaged in winter night landings and the other scores of nights when she has got up at 3:30 or 4:00 a.m. to set bread for next day's baking.\n\nNow as to the future of the work here, I am compelled to repeat what I have several times said, that until provision is made for the principal - or someone else - having time to give to the Christianizing of conditions in the Indian village, the school will be working under a fatal handicap. Moral and social conditions there, I am convinced are very definitely worse than they were fifteen or twenty years ago. Unless the principal is relieved of certain duties at the school so as to be able to give some time - a day and a half, or two days wash week, as a minimum - to intercourse and influence and teaching the people in their homes, the school will continue to send its pupils back to something no better than heathenism. I am not hopeless with regard to these people. I believe something can be done for them and that there would be response. BUT - with the exception of Miss Reid's work during recent months - NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE FOR THEM FOR MANY YEARS.\nIn closing, let me thank Dr. Young, Mrs. Clark and Miss Bennett for their patience and kindness to Mrs. Wood and myself. We have been very conscious of some of our mistakes and blunders and our very manifest lack of efficiency, but are glad to hope that in the hands of experienced and tested workers, the future of the School may be much brighter than its past.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(Signed) Wm. R. Wood.\nSeptember 28, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Wood:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 5th instant, I have to state I am sorry you have found it necessary to leave the Ahousaht Indian Residential School. I regret that there are no openings in our service suitable for you. In any case, additions to the Department's staff are made only with the authority of Council, after concurrence by the Civil Service Commission. Your suggestions concerning a bulletin are interesting, but I do not know of any funds that could be used for the purpose.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. W. R. Wood,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nAhousaht, B. C.\nAhousat Indian School, Ahousat, B.C.\nSeptember 5th, 1929.\n\nDr. D. C. Scott,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI trust you will pardon the liberty I take in writing you in a somewhat intimately personal way.\n\nAfter nine months here in charge of the Indian School I am compelled to seek service back in some part of Canada where the climate is not damp as we have it here on the west coast. Neither my wife nor myself seem able to accommodate ourselves to the climatic conditions here.\n\nWe have had an opportunity of becoming fairly well initiated into Indian work here and have been attracted by its problems and its opportunities. With the generous assistance of the Department we have been able to put this institution in very much better shape than it was, and have some satisfaction in believing that it will now be capable of very much better work than at any time in the past.\n\nI am wondering whether there may not be an opportunity of serving the Department of Indian Affairs in some capacity elsewhere. I have been impressed with the need for something that might help the Indian youth toward a quickened civic and public consciousness, something that would create in them some sense of unity both with others of their race and with the common life of Canada. The teaching in these schools is religious, an ideal which I have the fullest sympathy, but I fear that it often lacks the social and civic consciousness which is increasingly essential to real citizenship. That I would like to see done, and what I would like to have a hand in doing would be the sending into the hands of every pupil of the senior grades in these schools of a Canadian Life Bulletin issued twice a month and designed to bring these pupils into fresh and vital touch with the Canada of today, its interests, its events, its currents of thought and aspiration, the best things in its life for the quickening of the im-\nindividual's community and civic responsibility. I am convinced that such a service would be of the greatest value to the teachers and staffs of the schools as well broadening their outlook, giving them the much needed sense of unity with other educational workers, and affording them practical working material which many now lack.\n\nI am not carried away by the theory that the civic consciousness can be created in a day. My experience in Ontario and in Manitoba with rural organization work among our white people has taught me that it is a matter of very slow education, but my contact with our Indian youth here leaves no doubt in my mind that the process can be begun with the Indian pupils and that with the right effort there comes real response. With the type of Bulletin which I suggest I believe that response might be, at least, somewhat accelerated. If handled with reasonable ability, but above all with insight and sympathy, I think it could be made one of the major factors in the development of the minds of our Indian charges.\n\nI wonder if you will be good enough to tell me how the idea strikes you. Is it practicable? Is there any possibility that it might be worked into the policy of the Department? I should greatly appreciate an opportunity to try to work it out.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nSeptember 21, 1929.\n\nDear Dr. Young:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, announcing the resignation of the Reverend W.

Principal of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School has supplied this office with a copy of his letter of the 5th instant (which he submitted to the Department direct, which he explains was done through an oversight,) asking for an increase of 10 in the pupilage allotted to that school.\n\nIn comment on the Rev. Principal's application I respectfully beg to remark that on the completion of the improvements to and enlargement of the school building as now sanctioned and provided for by the Department, accommodation for the increase in pupilage applied for by the Rev.

Frost\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 15th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that, in view of the increased accommodation that is being provided at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School, the Department is approving of an increase in the pupilage for which the per capita grant will be allowed. The grant will be provided for 45 pupils as from October 1st, 1929, and this will be further increased to provide for 50 pupils as from April 1st, 1930. The Principal is being informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nOttawa, July 15th, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, requesting, in view of the changes now being carried out at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School, that the per capita grant be allowed for an increased pupilage. The Department will allow the per capita grant for 45 pupils as from October 1st, 1929, and a further increase to 50 pupils as from April 1st, 1930. Mr. Agent Frost is being informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. W. R. Wood,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nAhousaht, B.C.;\nAhousat Indian School,\nAHOUSAT... B.C.\nJuly 5th, 1929\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe changes now being made in the Ahousat School premises will add to the size of the Dining Room about 140 square feet of floor area, to the Kitchen about 72 square feet, to the girls Dormitory about 390 square feet and to the Class Room 270 square feet.\n\nThe changes which we are making in the grounds outside are designed to provide a play area for girls of approximately 1000 square yards.\n\nIn view of this additional accommodation I hereby apply for a ruling of the Department re the number of pupils who may be admitted. At present I understand it stands at 40. (Counting Margaret Williams, a girl who is here by special direction of the Department, we have 41) With the new accommodation we can adequately care for 50. In my own opinion the new conditions for fifty will be incomparably better than conditions have been for the past few years for the forty.\n\nI trust it will be possible in the near future to issue the matter, as the indications are that we may have during the coming fall applications for a number of additional admissions.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, July 3, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th ultimo, with general reference to the regulations governing the education of Indians in Canada. The compulsory clauses of the Indian Act call for the attendance of Indian children from 7 to 15 years inclusive. The Department urges all principals, Indian agents and parents to keep the children that are enrolled in residential schools until they reach the age of 18, if it is considered in the best interests of the individual child to do so. The principal of a residential school and the Indian agent may recommend the discharge of a child at any age, if there are adequate reasons for such action. If Indian parents insist on the discharge of their children before they are 18, the principal of the school should refer them to the Indian agent and the Indian agent, if necessary, to the Department. When it is considered in the best interests of a pupil to stay until he or she is 18, every effort is made to have them remain in the school.\n\nWith reference to the second question in your letter, if a school principal believes that a home is not suitable for a child, he should so report to the Indian agent before granting holidays or discharge. Where there are children under school age in such a home, the Indian agent's attention should be drawn to the circumstances. The Department then considers ways and means of having the children reared in proper surroundings.\n\nConcerning your third question, there was directed to you, under cover of January 8th, last, several circulars which indicate the Department's wishes. The principal of an Indian residential school is not considered the legal guardian of the pupils. The Department, however, is the legal guardian of all its Indian wards. I note that your copy of the Indian Act is not complete with amendments, and there is being forwarded to you, under separate cover, the latest copy.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. W. R. Wood,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nAhousaht, B. C.\nOttawa, July 23, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, relative to the request of the Principal of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School for an increase in the pupilage for which a per capita grant is paid from the present number of 50 to 60 pupils, and stating the measurements of the dormitories.\n\nIn reply I have to say that there is not sufficient air space in the dormitories to increase the pupilage at this school; also no funds have been provided for an increased grant. The measurements of the dormitories show air space for 41 pupils, and the enrolment should not exceed the number for which per capita grant is allowed, viz., 50 pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to advise the Department that the Rev. Principal of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School, has submitted an application to this office for an increase in pupilage for that school from its present number 50 to 60, he states that there no immediate discharges in view and that the pupils now in residence number 50, that 2 have already applied for admission when the school opens after the holidays and that a further 8 are of school age and will be seeking admission within the next few months.\n\nThe measurements of the dormitories are as under.\n\nBoys, large, 35 x 25 x 8'4\" high - 7437 cubic feet\n\n\" upper, 23'6\"x17\"x7'6\" \" - 2996\n\nGirls, large, 33\"x23\"x8'4\" \" - 6325\n\n\" upper, 28\"x17\"x7'6\" \" - 3570\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd.

Frost, Indian Agent, Port Alberni.\n\nThis letter is the reply to my request for beds, pillows and mattresses to provide for the increased pupilage. I am very much disappointed to learn \"that the Department has authorized no increase in pupilage at this school for the fiscal year beginning April 1st next.\" I sincerely hope that this decision is not final.\n\nMay I respectfully call your attention to your letter of September 14th 1931 No. 159-2-5 in which the following statement occurs \"I will arrange for a pupilage of 60 as from April 1st next.\" Upon this authority I have been accepting pupils; at present I have 55 in residence 3 more applications signed and 5 ready to come in after holidays.\n\nThe new dormitory is complete except for beds and bedding, the new classroom will (I hope) be completed within one month after I receive authority, and then we shall have ample room for 65 pupils.\n\nThese children of school age must be provided for in some way. The Indians are having great difficulty in providing for their families and are therefore willing to place in our care children of school age.\n\nThere will be only three pupils graduating in 1932.\n\nMay I therefore ask for authority to increase the pupilage of this school to 65, or at least to 60, for the next fiscal year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph Jones\nPrincipal\nEXTRACT FROM OFFICIAL LETTER DATED SEPTEMBER 14, 1931, TO REV.

In view of the fact that you will be proceeding with the carpenter shop, the upstairs of which will provide dormitory accommodation for approximately 10 boys, I will arrange for a pupilage of 60 as from April first, next.\n\"THE NEW OUTLOOK\"\n\nSeptember 2, 1931.\n\nCaring for the Indians in British Columbia\n\nThe work at the Indian Residential School at Ahousat, B.C., is progressing under the management of Rev. and Mrs. Joseph Jones and the members of a united and loyal staff. Though the building was erected two years ago it is now filled with happy healthy children and there is a waiting list. The Department of Indian Affairs has recently installed a new electric light system, and other improvements will be made when funds permit. The conditions in the village are very encouraging. Some of the leading men have taken charge of the finances. A prayer group was formed in the summer by the members of the staff which has proved a source of strength and inspiration.\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nApril 4th,\n1935.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nRe: Indian Residential School, Ahousaht\n\nAs I informed you in a letter some months ago, the Woman's Missionary Society, with the consent of the Department, are promoting Rev. Joseph Jones, of Ahousaht, to succeed Rev. W. A. Hendry as Principal of the Indian School at Portage la Prairie, Man. I now desire on their behalf to submit the name of Mr. A. E. Caldwell, of Poplar River, Man., as Principal at Ahousaht. I may say that this nomination carries with it my personal enthusiastic endorseration.\n\nMr. Caldwell is a well educated man who has spent over twenty years among the Indians, first, as a Factor of the Hudson's Bay Company, and now for nearly ten years as missionary-teacher of our day school at Poplar River. He is still under fifty years of age and has in my estimation a more intimate knowledge of Indian psychology and life than any man at present serving under the Board of Home Missions of the United Church. I trust that his nomination will appeal to the Department. It is proposed that he should take over the School at Ahousaht on July 1st, 1935.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MT\nIndian Youths Arrive in City\n\nHusky Athletes From Ahousat Please With Their Manner\n\nDescendants of the mighty Ahousat Indians, of the West Coast of Vancouver Island, ten boys from the Ahousat Indian residential school came here yesterday as a follock for a three-day holiday. Ranging from fifteen to eighteen years of age, the boys are of husky build with an average weight of 150 pounds.\n\nAlthough this is their first visit to a city, and the party is large, the boys are saying little and observing much, their leader, Mr. Jones, says. The boy is extremely keen, and Mr. Jones is hopeful that they may learn a great deal from this visit.\n\nIn a forty-foot motor launch, the boat which brought them here, the native youths left Ahousat on Monday. It was planned to take the boat across to Victoria but rough weather, caused by a southeast gale off Cape Mudge, forced the change of plans. The boat was moored at Port Alberni and the party finished the journey by train. During their stay they will be billeted at the YMCA, and will be the guests of various friendly societies in the city. A number of basketball games have been arranged for their pleasure.\n\nThe Party\n\nNames of the boys are: Allan George, Eugene Atleo, Ian Seymours, Francis Patrick, Joseph Billy, Thomas Paul, Simon Martin, Roy Alexander, and Norman Gordon. Accompanying Mr. Jones is Stanley Bailey, who is also with the party.\n\nMr. Jones is very pleased with his wards, whose manner and bearing has already drawn much attention in Victoria. The great achievement of Mr. Jones in influencing and educating these young men cannot be better appreciated when it is known that Ahousat and district are very primitive and isolated by the softening touch of civilization.\n\nAs Mr. Jones points out, many years ago massacres took place in the district. He also tells us that the Indians formerly lived at one time at the base of Gorge Mountain (now called Mount Albert). During the camping ground for the present war of Ahousat, the Indians attacked the camp of the settlers and killed all but one man. They adopted the women of the tribe and henceforth lived at Ahousat.\nKamloops, B.C., November 13th, 1936.\n\nWEST COAST AGENCY INSPECTION REPORT No.8.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI reached the headquarters of this agency on the 17th of October, and left it on Sunday October 18th. This is the first time I have inspected this agency since Mr. Ashbridge took over.\n\nI also met Mr. Caldwell, the Principal of the Ahousat Residential school. I had a long talk with him whilst returning on the boat from Nanaimo. In connection with this gentleman, I might say that he argues that the estimates for schools should be submitted to the Principal of the school before forwarding by the agent. I don't know the Department's attitude in the matter, but personally, I should think that this is not a very good thing to do, as probably it would only lead to endless argument with the agent if he wanted to leave out something that the Principal thinks should be included. I understand that the new residence for the Principal has been built at Ahousat. Here again, is a residential school awkwardly situated for transfer of freight, and this is one of the Residential schools that will have to be taken into consideration as to what should be done about it. Whilst not as bad as Christie school, the building is certainly not in first class shape for accommodation.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell\nInspector of Indian Agencies for\n\nIndian Affairs.

The letter explains itself. I have talked over what Mrs. Loveys says with my colleague, Dr. Dorey, and we both believe that our Woman's Missionary Society has good reason to feel that it has a reasonable claim against the Department for these extra expenditures which Mr. Pitts made after the fire.\n\nIt was impossible for the Woman's Missionary Society to dismiss the teachers at once. The store accounts had to be paid, and the children who went to school had to be clothed; nor could the cattle be disposed of immediately. Under these circumstances, we think that the Department ought to listen sympathetically to the claim which Mrs. Loveys makes. We hope, on consideration, you will agree with us.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnc.\nDecember 17, 1937.\n\nRev. R. B.

We have considered that the sum of $2,000 should practically cover this.\n\nFor your own benefit we shall itemize the account. Salaries were paid until the end of March - a sum of $600. The outstanding store accounts amounted to $650. The children who were taken to Ahousaht had to be clothed, at a cost of $250, and we have estimated that the food for the cattle would be approximately $300.\n\nMr. Pitts feels that no commercial organization would have taken the stand the Government did and he is very much grieved that after his years of service the Department should have used him in this way.\n\nWe shall be very glad to have you present this matter to the Department on our behalf.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSigned -- Isabel McIntosh Loveys\nHome Mission Executive Secretary.\nMr. F. B. Ashbridge,\n\nClifford Tate states that he opened the lid of the extractor while the machine was still running, with the belt released and the brake applied, and he put his hand in. He does not know what happened afterwards nor does he know why he did this. The vocational instructor, who is frequently in the laundry while the machinery is running, generally engaged in repair work, states that two weeks ago he expressly warned the boy Clifford Tate against opening the lid of the extractor before the machine had entirely ceased to revolve.\n\nThe injury consisted of a complete break above the right elbow, the muscles and tendons of the upper arm being almost completely severed and the bones of the elbow crushed. It is almost impossible to conceive how such a serious injury could have been sustained when the belt was off the machine. There can be no doubt that the belt was off, as, as I have said, the lid of the machine cannot be opened until the belt has been levered back on the idle pulley. There is no possibility of getting an arm between the revolving basin and the rim of the machine, neither is there any centre post in the revolving part around which an arm could have been wrapped. It can only be presumed that the boy must have caught his hand in some of the clothing and that the arm was carried around the machine.\n\nThe accident can only be put down to the carelessness and disobedience of the boy himself.\n\nThe boy's arm was treated and placed in a splint by the school nurse after a tourniquet had been applied. He was immediately taken in charge of the nurse to Dr. Robertson at Tofino. The doctor, after examination, telephoned me that amputation was necessary immediately. I had anticipated this from the nature of the injury and I gave my consent. Dr. Robertson will no doubt have reported on the operation. My information is that the boy is progressing satisfactorily.\n\nI telegraphed the boy's father and the grandfather at Sitinat as soon as possible after the operation. The grandfather, at my invitation, came to Tofino and is now with the boy.\n\nI shall be glad to give you any further information you require. I have covered the facts exactly as known, with an explanation of the working of the machinery and the routine followed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nIndian Residential School\nAhousaht, B.C.\nFebruary 24th 1938.\n\nMr. P.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPOAT ALBERNI, B.C.\nRe: Clifford Tate, accident.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFurther to my telegram to you of last Saturday, Feb. 19th, re the accident to Clifford Tate, age 14, of the Nitinat Reserve, a pupil at this school, the following is a complete report:\n\nThe accident occurred in the school laundry on Saturday morning. Washing is necessary on three days each week. The routine consists of having one matron in charge of the laundry, with a senior boy, experienced in the running of the machinery, in charge of the machinery. One or two senior boys or girls assist. During the current term, owing to the shortage of senior girls, the senior boys have been generally used in the laundry.\n\nWhile it is admitted that the laundry machinery generally is in poor condition, particularly the engine and the two washing machines, and the arrangement unsafe, as reported to the Department as long ago as August 17th 1935, since which time no appropriation has been made for renewal or repair, it cannot be said that the accident in question was due to the condition of the machinery.\n\nThe accident occurred with the extracting machine. This machine is run by a belt from the overhead shaft, running on a slack pulley when the machine is not in use. A lever pulls the belt over to the machine pulley to operate the machine. About a year ago I had this machine so fixed that when it is in operation the lid of the machine cannot be opened, and this arrangement is still good. A brake is operated by the foot at the base of the machine to stop the machine revolving after the belt has been released. This brake at present stops the machine entirely in exactly two minutes after the belt has been released. Instructions were positive that the lid must not be opened after the belt has been released and the brake applied until the machine has entirely stopped. Perforations in the lid makes it possible to see when the machine has stopped before the lid is opened.\n\nAt the time of the accident, the matron, Miss Hodgkinson, a boy, Edgar Benson, in charge of the machinery, and Clifford Tate as assistant, were in the laundry. The extractor had just been in operation and Benson had released the belt and applied the brake to stop the machine. He had then gone outside the laundry to get a tub to put the clothes in out of the extractor. The matron was sorting clothes in the laundry. She heard Clifford Tate shout that his arm was broken. She turned round and found him holding his right arm with his left hand. She did not notice at that time whether the extractor was stopped. She took the boy immediately to the nurse in the school. Edgar Benson states that he came into the laundry one or two minutes after the accident and found the machine entirely stopped and proceeded to remove the clothes.\nOttawa,\nMarch 12, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo enclosing report of the Principal of the Ahousaht Residential School. With reference to the accident to Clifford Tate the information contained in the Principal's letter has been carefully noted.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Alberni, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report a serious accident to a pupil of the Ahousaht Residential School, which occurred on February 19th, 1938.\n\nClifford Tate, Age 14, Nitinaht Band, was assisting in the school laundry when he got his right arm caught in the extractor, suffering a comminuted fracture of the ulna and radius, and fracture of the humerus, necessitating amputation at elbow joint.\n\nThe boy has been properly cared for and is making satisfactory progress. I attach full, detailed explanation, which I received from Mr. Caldwell at my request.\n\nThe boy was admitted to the Emergency Hospital at Tofino under the care of Dr. Robertson.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nPEA/AM.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nApril 28,\n1938\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Ahousaht Residential School\n\nI have just had a visit from Mrs. Loveys and Mrs. Large, of the Woman's Missionary Society, who have come to discuss two things:\n\nFirst.\u2014The general matter of adequate school accommodation for United Church children on the West Coast of Vancouver Island. I may have gone too far, but I have told them that I do not think that either in the ordinary estimates or in the supplementary list is there any chance of the Government making provision this year for the erection of a school. I wish, however, to say that I hope the matter will receive attention, and that, if at all possible, an amount will be inserted in the supplementary estimates to cover this item. There are about fifty children who have been out of school for a year and that is not a very healthy condition. I know the difficulties that face the Department and have tried to interpret them to the officials of the Woman's Missionary Society. However, the matter cannot be allowed to drag on indefinitely and I trust that the tangle will be straightened out soon.\n\nSecond.\u2014Under the circumstances, we have to carry on at Ahousaht. My understanding of the policy which you and your officials are recommending is that there be one residential school on the West Coast and that the educational needs at Ahousaht be met by turning the present residential school into an improved day school, but, in the meantime, certain repairs are absolutely necessary, and Mr. Caldwell has written, asking that provision be made for these. I think that Captain Barry has already written to your Department concerning this matter. Will you be good enough to see that provision is made in the supplementary estimates for whatever is absolutely essential to put the school building in such shape as will enable Mr. Caldwell to carry on until the matter of the residential school is disposed of.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6430, file 876A-1, part 1)\nOttawa, April 26, 1938.\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 22nd instant, in which you refer to an interview you have had with Mrs. Loveys and Mrs. Large, of the Women's Missionary Society, United Church.\n\nI may state that no funds have been provided in the estimates of this year for the construction of a residential school at Alberni, nor am I in a position to state when funds for this purpose will be made available by the Government.\n\nI have not yet received from our Indian Agent the list of repairs and improvements necessary at the Ahousaht Residential School this year. When this list reaches the Department, the claims of the school will be given very careful and very sympathetic consideration. We naturally hesitate, of course, to spend a large amount of money on repairs to a building that must of necessity be abandoned in the course of a year or two. It might be well if you discussed with the Minister the desirability of having provision made in next year's estimates for the building of a new residential school on the west coast of Vancouver Island.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

A copy of your communication will be handed to Mrs. Loveys, of the Woman's Missionary Society.\n\nWe will act on your suggestion and discuss with the Minister at the first opportunity the desirability of having provision made in next year's estimates for the erection of a new residential school on the west coast of Vancouver Island.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nJuly 18th, 1938.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nRe: Per Capita Grant, Indian Residential School, Ahousaht\n\nMr. A.E. Caldwell, the Principal of the Indian Residential School at Ahousaht, B.C., writes to say that the Department is holding down the payment of the per capita to a limit of sixty-five. In view of the extraordinary circumstances prevailing on Vancouver Island, following the destruction of the Alberni School, would it not be possible for your Department to allow the maximum pupilage for Ahousaht to be raised to seventy during the time when accommodation is provided in this School for these extra pupils?\n\nMr. Caldwell also points out that the parents of these Alberni pupils have to provide transportation for them; that they are not able to do this and that consequently if they are to go to school at all this extra cost falls on the Ahousaht School.\n\nWill you be good enough to take into your serious consideration the possibility of meeting in some way, either by increasing the pupilage or paying some of this transportation, the extra cost due to the fact that the Alberni School is not open? In any case, I point out that the Department is saving a very considerable sum of money. I realize, of course, that the children are not being educated as effectively as they were when the School was open at Alberni, but from the standpoint of dollars and cents the request for increase of pupilage at Ahousaht and for transportation means a lesser sum expended.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD:EWS\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJuly 23, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 18th instant with reference to the pupilage at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you are aware, a grant is allowed at the present time for a pupilage of $5, but in view of the representations contained in your letter, we will allow a supernumerary grant for the next year for a number not exceeding 5. In other words, this will mean that grant will be allowed the Ahousaht School for 70 pupils.\n\nI also might say for your information that we will allow an amount not exceeding $85 towards the transportation expenses of pupils going to and coming from the Ahousaht Residential School this summer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\n\nRev. Geo. Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ontario.\nJuly 9th, 1938\n\nCapt. Gerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Schools,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Per Capita Grant.\n\nIn a remittance just to hand from the W.M.S., Toronto, for the balance of the Per Capita grant for the quarter ending March of this year, I note that the Department appears to have limited the average attendance for which grant is paid to this school at 65 pupils. This denotes a loss on our revenues from this source for the March quarter of $56.43, and for the June quarter of $141.55. Our average for the March quarter was $66.32 and for the June quarter $68.31.\n\nWhen I provided accommodation for the pupils of the Alberni school after the destruction of that school by fire, I had not anticipated that the Department would put such limitation into effect. I have at present 20 late Alberni pupils on the roll, and anticipate some ten or twelve more next term. These pupils would probably not have been attending school had it not been for the accommodation provided for them at Ahousaht.\n\nFurther, the Department does not appropriate sufficient to fully cover the expense of transportation of the pupils lately attending the Alberni school, the parents of whom are now tributary to this school district, but, in most cases, are unable to convey their children to and from their homes. The additional expense must therefore be borne by the school, and this becomes an added burden if the pupilage is limited to 65.\n\nAs you know, we have accommodation without crowding for 70 pupils. It is desirable that as many children as possible from the reserves lately tributary to the Alberni school, who have not the school facilities available to them, should be accommodated to the capacity of this school. I have written to the Board of the W.M.S. in Toronto to make representation in this matter to the Department and I would be obliged if you would, under the circumstances, lend your support to the request that the limit of average attendance for which Per Capita Grant at this school is allowed be raised to 70.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"A. E. CALDWELL\".\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward copy of a letter received from A.E. Caldwell, Principal of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School, West Coast Agency, in which is requested an increase in the Per Capita Grant at that school.\n\nI also enclose copy of a letter from G.H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, upon the subject. This letter is self-explanatory and I therefore recommend that a Per Capita Grant for up to 70 pupils be made as from commencement of the current fiscal year.\n\nIt is perhaps not necessary for me to point out that owing to the burning down of the Alberni Residential School, extra pressure for taking pupils naturally falls on Ahousaht School. Further, there was a telegram dated the 22nd of February, 1937, from the Director, Dr. McGill, pointing out that Ahousaht could probably take 15 or 20 more pupils.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nfor D.M.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am forwarding herewith a copy of a letter received from Mr. A.E. Caldwell, Principal of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School, United Church, West Coast Agency, in which he requests an increase in Per Capita Grant at that school, a copy of my letter to the Indian Agent, Mr. Ashbridge, and a copy of his reply.\n\nUnder the circumstances, and particularly as the Department in a Night Letter dated February 22, 1937, authorized an increase in the number of pupils to be accommodated at Ahousaht, I would recommend that as from April 1st, 1938, the number authorized to draw Per Capita Grant at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School be increased to seventy pupils. There appear to have been almost this number in residence during the quarter ending June 30th, 1938, and I am of the opinion that it is quite easy to accommodate seventy children at Ahousaht even if the building is old.\n\nIt may be some time before the Department will have available funds for the erection of a new Residential School in the West Coast Agency, and in the meantime I am anxious that as many as possible of the children now without educational advantages of any sort be accommodated at either Ahousaht or Coqualeetza Indian Residential Schools.\n\nEven if no provision was made in the 1937-38 estimates for an increase of grant, as in my opinion there should have been made to take care of the authorized increase in pupilage, I would recommend that if it is in any way possible Per Capita Grant be authorized for up to seventy pupils as from the beginning of the present fiscal year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"Gerald H.

In other words this will mean that from July 1, 1938 grant will be allowed at the Ahousaht School for 70 pupils.\n\nI might add that the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada had written previously regarding this matter and they were given the same information as contained in this letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nC.

The laundry, also new bath, wash basins and toilets are now installed, and the school in a better sanitary condition.\n\nI regret, however, being unable to report favorably on general conditions. This is not entirely the fault of the principal, as the old buildings and other conditions are a very real handicap, and always present a very dilapidated and untidy appearance. The pupils, while being well cared for, well fed, and apparently healthy, have a very untidy appearance, and do not compare favorably in appearance or good manners even with the pupils of day schools. Fire drills are carried out regularly and a good watchman is employed, who conscientiously carried out his duties.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 21, 1939.\n\nReverend R. B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Mission,\nUnited Church of Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Cochrane:\n\nIt is my intention to discuss with my colleagues, when the supplementary estimates are under consideration, the desirability of including an appropriation for the rebuilding of the Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nIf funds are available, I should like to recommend the construction of a fully modern fireproof structure with accommodation for at least 200 pupils. The construction of this building would be undertaken on the understanding that the Ahousaht School, with an enrolment at this date of 65 pupils, would be closed. The Ahousaht school, I understand, is in a somewhat dilapidated condition and is rapidly becoming, if it has not already become, a great fire hazard.\n\nI have been informed that an Indian day school established at Ahousaht would provide instruction for the local Indians at that point. Provision could be made for the construction of this school in the estimates of next year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.A.

Our Committee prefers sending a builder from Ontario upon whom we can rely.

A typewritten under the gripe explains Chirography.\nOTTAWA, 1st February, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nRev. Dr Mackay of the Presbyterian Missionary Society forwards sketch plans for the new boarding school at Ahousaht. No specifications or estimates accompanied them but the cost of the building is placed at about $7000.00. Of this amount the Department is to contribute $1500.00 which is included in the Supplementary Estimates for this year. Dr Mackay states that it is the intention of the Missionary Society to send a builder from Ontario to superintend the erection of the new structure, and he asks that the plans be approved of with permission to make such changes as further experience may find necessary or desirable.\n\nIf detailed plans and specifications have to be submitted it would cause considerable delay in beginning the work. The plans sent in provide for a building which should be suitable to the locality and will have accommodation for fully 80 pupils. The Department at present only provides for 25.\n\nIn that climate there will be no difficulty about heating and ventilation, and a suitable site where good drainage can be had should be easily selected. I think the Department would be quite safe in giving the necessary permission to proceed with the work in the manner indicated in the plans.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The building appears to be one that should properly fill the requirements of a boarding school, and as far as the sketches show no reasonable exception can be taken thereto. The cost thereof cannot be less than the sum roughly estimated, namely $7,000.\n\nAs the Department only contributes $1,500 towards the cost of erection, it would appear that Mr. Mackey's request to have the plans generally approved and to allow latitude for such changes as further experience will be found necessary or desirable should receive favourable consideration.\n\nFor the further assurance of the Department, if it is considered desirable or necessary, the sum of $500 might be retained until the building is finally completed, and a report has been received thereon from the Indian Agent.\n\nChief Surveyor.\nOTTAWA, 2nd February, 1904\n\nRev.

The Department has noted your remark that the dormitories of the boys and girls on the second floor are joining. It was shown on the first plan that there was a solid wall between these rooms and no connection between them on this floor, it being necessary to go down to the next floor in order to pass from one dormitory to the other. This arrangement is satisfactory and should be adhered to, and it would be well, if possible to arrange for a small bed-room in each dormitory, in which one of the staff might sleep and have immediate supervision over the pupils.\n\nThe plans are returned, blue prints having been retained in the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.\nIndian Supt.\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6430, file S76-5, part 1)\nMemo.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 21st June, 1904.\n\nThe Deputy Supt. General,-\n\nReferring to Mr. Vowell's letter of the 31st ultimo, and enclosures, I beg to state that I think no exception should be taken to the amended plans submitted for the proposed new boarding school building at Ahousaht, B.C. The re-arrangement appears to be convenient in all particulars. It is to be especially noted that the new building is very much more elaborate, and consequently more expensive, than the one first proposed.\n\nAs noted in Mr. Green's memorandum, there is no new plan submitted for the third floor. Mr. Vowell draws attention to the fact that the boys' and girls' dormitories, which are situated on this floor, are close together. It is presumed that no radical change will be made on this floor. It is shown on the first plan submitted that there is a solid partition between the dormitories, and no connection between them on that floor. It is necessary to go down to the next floor, in order to pass from one dormitory to the other. This should be satisfactory.\n\nI may note it is desirable, if possible, to arrange for a small bed-room in each dormitory in which a grown person may sleep who can at the same time be in immediate attendance to preserve order.\n\nBlueprint copies of the plans have been made, and have been placed in the folder on file herewith.\n\nChief Surveyor.\nIndian Office Victoria B.C.\n\nMay 31st 1904.\n\nSir:\n\nIn connection with your letter of the 16th of Feb., last File No. 134,628, enclosing blue prints of sketch plans for the new boarding school building at Ahousaht, I have the honor to enclose herewith for the information of the Department a copy of a letter of the 14th instant No. 249-5, received from Mr. Agent Neill of the West Coast Agency together with plans referred to by him.\n\nAs will be perceived by Mr. Neill's letter the blue prints received from the Department on date quoted have been somewhat altered. As on the whole the changes suggested appear advantageous and as the building will cost much more than the grant allowed by Department, I would recommend the amendment made in the plan to the favorable consideration of the Department. It will be noted that the altered plans provide windows for the lighting of the basement.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B.C.\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWest Coast Indian Agency, Alberni, B.C.,\nMay 14th 1904.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to forward herewith plans of part of Ahousaht Boarding School shewing changes proposed by the man in charge. The changes can only be noted by comparing the plan forwarded with the original ones.\n\nThe style of roof has been altered and changes made in some of the rooms but the dimensions of the building itself are not changed.\n\nMr. Butchart asks that you would be good enough to hand the plan if it meets with your approval to Dr. Campbell of Victoria who wishes to show it to the tradesman supplying lumber and then he will return it to Mr. Butchart at Ahousaht where it is needed.\n\nIf any correspondence is necessary later than the overland mail leaving Victoria on the morning of 20th inst., I would request that it be done with Mr. Butchart direct as I am leaving on 31st instant for Kyuquot and it might delay the progress of building.\n\nI will not get letters which arrive by the same boat as two or three hours elapse before the mail is distributed.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour Obedient Servant,\n(sgd) A.W. Neill.\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.,\nVictoria B.C.\nNotes made by Mr. A.H. Green, Victoria, re altered plan of Ahousaht Boarding School building.\n\nIn the new plan the following alterations have been made.\n\n**BASEMENT.**\n\nBoth the Boys and Girls playrooms have been reduced in size by 6 feet in width.\n\nTwo additional rooms 9.8 x 34.6 and 9.6 x 31 called Boys' Hall and Girls' Hall have been made.\n\nBairry and Root and Wood room have been dispensed with and converted into Laundry and Drying room.\n\nThe flue for heater is placed inside the building instead of outside.\n\n**1st FLOOR.**\n\nThe verandah has been moved from front of the building to the back of it.\n\nThe kitchen, pantry, and store room though occupying the same space have been re-arranged.\n\nThe small class room has been enlarged by 4 ft. and the office reduced by that much.\n\nThe Private Dining room, Bed-room, and wash room and store room have been converted into a sitting and dining room.\n\nA flight of steps has been made to the front door.\n\n**2nd FLOOR.**\n\nIn both boys' and girls' bathrooms there are but two baths instead of four.\n\nSitting room has been converted into Private bath room and girls cloak room.\n\nBed room has been converted partly into Boys cloak room and part thrown into Teacher's room.\n\nPrivate bathroom and store room has been dispensed with and the re-arranged with the Matron's and Principal's room so as to make another bedroom.\n\nNo 3rd floor plan on new drawings.\n\nThe whole of the elevations have been changed so much that no comparison can be made. There appears, however, to be more light in the basement and less in the 3rd floor.\nNote made by Indian Superintendent.\n\nMr. Green thinks improvement has been effected. Not quite so much light in 3rd floor, and dormitory boys and girls together, etc.\n\nIndian Office,\nVictoria, B.C., May 31st 1904.\nA.W.

There have been some amounts paid for which we have not yet got receipts.\n\nThree acres have been slashed, and most of the brush burned out, and the logs cut into blocks, about half an acre has been stumped.

Daoust, Limited, St. Boniface, Man., for a bake-oven supplied to Ahousaht Indian Residential School, December 1928.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 159-2-5, dated Ottawa, November 30th, 1928.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nAhousat School Problems.\n\nI. Water Supply.\n\nThe water supply is obtained from a well situated about 150 yards from the School in a low-lying part of the ground, in close proximity to the cow barn; and the latter drains in the direction of the well. The whole water supply is surface water, and is naturally liable to contamination from barn seepage, and the well is not suitably lined to exclude surface water. The pipe from the well to the School is above ground and is liable to freeze in cold weather and cut off the supply entirely for hours at a time, when no water for domestic use or fire protection can be secured. Opinions have been expressed to the principal that the water supply under these conditions is a menace to the health of the children.\n\nSuggested Remedy.\n\nThat a well of sufficient capacity be dug on higher ground in a position clear of all possible School or barn seepage, and that the same be lined with concrete to a suitable depth to prevent cave-in and to exclude surface water.\n\nThe present tank capacity is insufficient. The tank is situated on the second floor and does not provide a water supply to the upper floor either for domestic use or fire protection. Suggested that two tanks of same capacity be installed on upper floor. The second tank should be of galvanized iron.\n\nThe water system through the School is not satisfactory, as it consists of half inch pipe with no provision for detecting obstructions, necessitating the disconnection of practically the whole system to remedy any obstruction, the water being at times shut off for hours while obstructions are being located and remedied. The half pipe inch pipe is not large enough as a main system.\n\nII. Toilet Systems.\n\nThe toilet system of the School is intended to be a flush system, for staff and girls' toilets, located outside the building. This system was devised and installed by an\namateur and has never given satisfactory service, and is now entirely useless, and should be reconstructed and properly installed.\n\nThe septic tank to which the present flush system leads is constructed of lumber and does not function as a septic tank, and has to be frequently cleared by hand. A new cement tank properly constructed is necessary.\n\nThe boys' toilets are earth closets, near the shore, and are unsanitary in warm weather and should be provided for in the flush system.\n\nIII. Heating Problems.\n\nThe heating apparatus of the school is hot air. The furnace is in the basement and is situated near the N. E. Corner, which necessitates long stretches of pipe from the furnace itself to where they enter the building, which wastes much of the heat before it is of use for heating the building. The heating plant itself is too small and in my opinion needs replacing by one of a suitable size placed in a suitable position to get the best results, and the distribution of the heat should be arranged by a qualified mechanic capable of getting the best results from any plant that may be installed in place of the present one, which is worn out and was never satisfactory.\n\nThe children's dormitories are never heated by the heating system as there is never enough heat generated to reach them. The same applies to the staff sleeping quarters.\n\nIV. Recreation Rooms.\n\nThe recreation rooms in the building are one for boys and one for girls, each of which is about 12 by 12 feet with no means of heating. Both rooms are too small for twenty children to play in.\n\nV. Drying Room.\n\nThe question of a drying room needs attention. Some old worn out stoves are being used in one corner of the building, but this method is not satisfactory.\n\nVI. Cooking apparatus\n\nThe present range is past repair and needs replacing. Its cooking surface 2 x 4 feet is not large enough.\nVII. Engine.\n\nThe engine at present in use is past being able to provide sufficient power for the extractor, and is constantly breaking down under that load, and has actually come to the condition where it cannot run the lighting plant. It is of obsolete pattern and would not be worth repairing.\n\nSolution.\n\nThe following appears to be a reasonable solution of some of the troubles.\n\n1. Water supply as recommended.\n\n2. Power. That when a suitable well has been located and constructed, that a power and pump house be built at the well but so arranged as to be free from any possible likelihood of contaminating the water. The power house to house the engine, pump, electric storage batteries, washing extractor, under one roof, clear of the School building and leaving the basement space available for recreation rooms for both girls and boys, and reducing the fire hazard of the School by it being free from the engine and gasoline.\n\n3. Sanitary system as suggested.\n\n4. The heating proposition to be looked into by a qualified mechanic and suggestions with estimates prepared by him.\nFebruary 14th, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Neill,\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, enclosing a communication from Rev. Mr. Wood, Principal of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School. I also have received a letter from him and I am asking Mr. Frost for a report as to what should be done to put the heating and plumbing in good condition. It is just possible that we will have to have a plumber go out to the school to determine what changes are required and what materials are needed. I should be glad to discuss this with you in the near future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nAs W. Neill, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOTTAWA.\nDr. Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nIndian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI enclose letter from the newly appointed Principal of the Ahousat school. Possibly it would be better to treat it as confidential, and not place it on your files.\n\nNo doubt you will be receiving a report from the Indian Agent, and I will call on you in a few days and discuss the matter.\n\nI was under the impression that there was a well and an engine and a pump house already on the property, and while my memory is treacherous now, I was certainly under the impression that there was a heating system in the shape of a furnace in the basement.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA. W. Neill.\nAhousat, B.C. February 5, 1929.\n\nA.W. Neill Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Neill,\n\nI appreciate very cordially indeed your courtesy and your kind interest in our work here.\n\nWe had a visit from Mr. Frost last week and he made a very thorough examination of the premises here, following which he will, I judge report conditions to the department. While in some respects good work was done here by Mr. Miller, he had allowed the equipment to run down to the very last degree during the last year or two, so that today there is scarcely a machine or utensil about the place that is not worn out and in need of replacement.\n\nThe same statement applies to the water system, the toilet system and the heating system. Each of these is in a state that requires constant tinkering, and even with that there are times when both staff and children have to endure a great deal of discomfort. This necessarily means a heavy handicap on efficiency. The results which are aimed at both by the Government and by the Church will never be fully attained while ordinary comfort cannot be obtained in the school.\n\nI am most concerned, however, with the fact that there is good reason to judge that these conditions are having a very serious effect on the health of the children. There have been during the last two years or so, an unusual number of deaths of pupils and ex-pupils of the school, an unusual number of discharges from the school on account of physical ailments, and at the present time I am assured by the Field Nurse that the proportion of really healthy children, especially among the girls, was abnormally low. When one recognizes that they sleep in dormitories from which the chill of the B.C. winter is never removed by artificial heat, that the water they drink is never ordinarily drinkable, and that the toilet system exhibits none of the features of ordinary decency, much less comfort, one cannot but have misgivings as to the cause of some of their troubles.\nAfter giving the situation a good deal of careful consideration, and trying to get it out for some five weeks, I have reached the conclusion that unless the health basis can be established on some such lines as they are in other schools, (that is with a heating system that will take some of the damp of the winter out of the rooms, that will give the children pure water to drink, and that will provide comfortable closets) I simply could not think of attempting to do the work. I am not thinking of luxuries but only of ordinary comfort.\n\nSo while we recognize that the cost will be very considerable, we are hoping that the Department can be led to see that we are seeking only a minimum, and that the need is absolutely vital, if the interests of the children are not to be sacrificed. I am putting it up to our own church people that they must undertake a part of the needed equipment, and I think they will. My hope is that they will put in the well, the engine and pump house and the kitchen range, which may run to $700.00 or $750.00. If they do, then we trust that the Department will see to the heating and the water and toilet systems.\n\nI judge that Mr. Frost who saw when he was here the other day the heating system utterly failing, the water system obstructed and frozen, and the toilets requiring to be cleared by the principal, will urge the instalment of the needed equipment, and if with your experience and acquaintance with the Indian work, you find it possible to add your influence, I feel sure that we may hope that our plea will be successful. With such equipment I am more than hopeful of what may be done for the young Indians of Ahousat.\n\nI am afraid I am getting out of touch with the world of politics since I came up here, but I shall be watching with interest the course of the Session. I know most of the Manitoba Members fairly well, and count some of them among my best friends.\n\nHoping for a chance to meet and get better acquainted with you sometime, and counting on your good offices in my present undertaking,\n\nI am, very truly yours,\n\n(Sgd.) Wm. R. Wood.\nFebruary 14, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Wood:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant concerning repairs at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School. I regret that you found conditions somewhat unsatisfactory, and the Department will assist the Church authorities in their effort to put the building in good condition. It will first be necessary to have a detailed report and an estimate from a competent heating and plumbing contractor, and I am corresponding with Mr. Indian Agent Frost in this connection. I am glad to learn that you have reason to hope the Church will provide the well, the engine and pump house, and perhaps a new kitchen range.\n\nWith best wishes for success in your new work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. Wm. R. Wood,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nAhousaht, B.C.\nAhousat, B. C. February 4th, 1929\n\nScott, Esq.\n\nIndian Department, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nTaking charge recently of the Indian School here, I find conditions that in my judgment demand attention by the Department. The Indian Agent, Mr. R. E. Frost of Alberni spent two days with us last week, and, I presume, will report on conditions as he found them.\n\nI may mention without going into unnecessary detail that, in my judgment, as in that of Mr. Frost, the School cannot do its work unless provision is made for heating the children's quarters, for giving them pure water and for decent toilet facilities. We have none of these at the present time. And in my judgment the work of the School has suffered inexcusably in recent years because of it.\n\nMy plea in seeking these provisions is simply that without them we have not the conditions which may be expected to produce healthy existence. Looking back over the record of the School during the past two or three years I find that there have been an unusual number of deaths among pupils and ex-pupils, and unusual number of discharges from the School on account of ill-health, and that at the present time the number of pupils, especially of girls, who are normally healthy is startlingly low. I am convinced that they suffer constantly from the lack of the elementary conditions of human comfort, and that the three things mentioned are the very minimum of requirement to give them an adequate health basis.\n\nThe cost will be very considerable, but without such improvement in conditions the School can never do the work expected of it. I may say that I am pressing upon the Women's Missionary Society of the United Church the necessity of their bearing the cost of some of the needed equipment. I think there is good reason to hope that they may undertake to provide the well, the engine and pump house and perhaps a new kitchen range. I am confident they will do all that they can to assist in putting the School in a position to function efficiently.\n\nI shall be glad to furnish any details of information needed and to assist in any way possible, and trust that we may hope to have work begun on the new utilities early in spring.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6430, file 876-5, part 2)\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit herewith a copy of a letter from the Rev Principal of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School, setting out certain conditions as they now exist at that school, and some suggestions for their improvement or remedy, for the information of the Department.\n\nIn bringing these matters to the Department's attention, I beg to state that I landed at Ahousaht School on Saturday January 26th at about 11.30 p.m., and found the electric lighting system out of order (no lights) due to a break down of the engine which supplies the power for the system; a mechanic, Mr. W. Bond, was then at work repairing the engine and some time in the early morning temporary repairs were effected and lights were available, but Mr. Bond stated that the repairs were only temporary and might give out at any time, further, that the engine is not now repairing and if repaired is too low powered to carry the load, which is the cause of the short life of the machine and the cause of the frequent trouble. On Sunday night the 27th the engine was again temporarily out of order for a time and no lights were available.\n\nOn the night of my arrival at Ahousaht School the weather was unusually cold for the West Coast area and during the night all water connections outside the school and some inside became frozen. The rest of Sunday 27th was spent by the Rev Principal, some of the staff and myself in thawing out the water system to obtain water which we succeeded in doing some time in the afternoon. On Sunday night 27th the weather became more severe with a considerable fall of snow and all water leads both fresh and waste inside and outside the school were frozen solid and thawing them out was impossible, all water for use in the school had to be carried by hand by the pupils and staff from the well which is some 200 yards from the school.\n\nThe heating system of the school, when new and in good order was quite inadequate for the school under such conditions of weather as have existed from the 26th ultimo to date and as the plant is badly worn and defectively installed, the result can be readily understood, the school building was uncomfortably cold, frost forming on the bedclothes of some of the staff during the night and was quite noticeable the next morning.\n\nOwing to the failure of the water system, the toilet system was also disorganized causing septic tank and other trouble, which were examined by me with a view to effecting their present remedy and future prevention.\n\nThe water supply for the school is obtained from a well, not lined, which is located about 200 yards from the school building and about a third of that distance from the cow barn with a natural slope from the barn to the well, the top of the well is flush with the ground surface, the greater portion of the water in the well is surface water and as is unlined, contamination from the barn is most probable, on my visit on 26th and 27th of January I found considerable ice round the well and on breaking it I found signs of barn seepage in it. The water is pumped from the well to the school by a small engine and the pipes leading to...\nSir,\u2014\nthe school are supported on posts and raised from 6 to 8 feet above ground and have no protection from frost, which makes water trouble a certainty during such weather as the present.\n\nThe attached list of defects in water supply, heating, sanitary arrangements, drying and recreation rooms with the suggested improvements was made on the ground and at the time of my visit to the school at the end of January and is a fair statement of the conditions at the school as they then were, and as the cold weather still continues I fear they have not improved to date.\n\nI respectfully recommend that this matter be examined by a fully qualified person and suggestions and estimates be prepared as to cost of their correction.\n\nI beg to point out that most of these defects are brought out by the present lengthy period of severe weather the like of which has not occurred on the West Coast during the past 20 years.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd. E. Host\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nAhousaht Indian Residential School,\nAhousaht, January 30th, 1929.\n\nE.E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Frost,\n\nFollowing your recent visit to and inspection of the Ahousaht Indian School premises, I am enclosing a copy of the statement then drawn up, setting out conditions and needs as they appear at this time, and proposing certain solutions.\n\nMay I say that I have conferred with the School Staff, all of whom have longer acquaintance than I with these conditions, and they are agreed that the statement is a fair and accurate representation of conditions as obtained, and that such reforms as are proposed are vitally and urgently necessary, if results are to be expected in the training of children here.\n\nIn facing the solution of these problems I recognize the factor of dual control; a church organization on the one hand and the Indian Department on the other. I may tell you that I am putting before the Women's Missionary Society and the Home Mission Board with which they are associated, the necessity of their undertaking a substantial share of the cost. To be specific, I am urging them to become responsible for the cost of the well, the engine and engine house\u2014the most immediately urgent of our needs\u2014and if possible also the kitchen range, which roughly might perhaps be estimated at $750.00.\n\nIf they can\u2014and I am somewhat hopeful they may\u2014undertake this, then I think it reasonable to hope that the Indian Department will undertake the installation of the water system, including toilets, and a heating plant for the building.\n\nRecognizing, as I am sure you do, that the school cannot do effective work until these basic conditions, not of luxury, but of elementary decency and comfort are met, I hope you will press upon the Department the urgency of the need. It is not only the measure of discomfort results to both Staff and children which is conducive to efficiency, the matter is far more serious than that. The nature of the present weather makes the so-called toilet system a positive menace to health. To house forty children in a damp building where they are often chilled and shivering is to make them fertile ground for disease. And it is not to be wondered at that there has been in recent years a very unusual number of deaths and discharges from school due to physical ailments, nor that at the present time the proportion of thoroughly healthy children in the school is alarmingly low. I am convinced that if we can give them pure water, clean toilets and housing in which the chill and dampness are removed we can change the health situation for the better in a single season.\n\nI am communicating also with the Commissioner and the Department, and earnestly hope that some action may be secured in the near future. With very cordial appreciation of your interest in the well being of the school.\n\nI am yours truly,\n\n(signed) Wm. R. Wood,\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nP.O. BOX 656\nVICTORIA, B.C., February 15, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe-Ahousaht Indian School,\nWest Coast Agency.\n\nYou will, no doubt, by now have received a report from Mr. Indian Agent Frost showing the conditions existing at the Ahousaht Indian School, West Coast Agency, and his recommendations as to what should be done to remedy the defects.\n\nIt appears to me that the improvements recommended by the Agent are of so varied a character that there would be little useful purpose served in asking the Dominion Water Power Branch to make a report. What apparently is needed is that a qualified architect or contractor should visit the School and make a report of what he deems to be required, giving an estimate of the cost of the same. Possibly A.W. Neill, Esq., M.P. may know of a fully qualified man in his district.\n\nThis School replaced the old one which was burned down some years ago and was built by funds provided by the Ladies' Missionary Society connected with the Presbyterian Church, notwithstanding the fact that it had been recommended by the heads of the Presbyterian Church that the School should not be re-built but that the Indian children of Ahousaht should be sent to the Alberni School. In view of this, possibly the Department may feel that while it is absolutely essential that the School should be brought up to the proper standard, the funds for the necessary improvements should be furnished by the body that built the School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6430, file 876-5, part 2)\nIndian Agent's Office,\nPort Alberni, B.C., West Coast Agency\nFebruary 19th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to my No. 662/28 of 12th instant, report on conditions at Ahousaht Indian Residential School, and suggestions for improvements.\n\nEnclosed please find a copy of a letter from the Rev. Principal, Mr. W.R. Wood, suggesting that oil be used as a substitute for wood as fuel for the heating apparatus at the school.\n\nIn regard to this suggestion I beg to state that in my opinion oil as fuel would be far cheaper than wood but I believe the hazard from fire would be increased and as the water supply of the school under the best conditions would be limited, this would have to be taken into consideration. With regard to using steam for heating purposes, in the event of a steam heating system being installed, an attendant with engineers certificate would be necessary.\n\nEnc\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd. E. Frost\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAhousat, B.C.\nFebruary 13th, 1929\n\nE.E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Frost:\n\nSince your visit I have been endeavouring to inform myself with regard to some of the possibilities of solving our school problems, and one line of my investigation I think is of sufficient importance to put before you.\n\nIt is in reference to fuel. As you know the fuel has been wood, burned in a furnace not designed for wood. Fir, which is the wood used, is increasingly difficult to get. The men who have been getting it in the past can do better by taking their logs to saw mills. There will be increasing demand for this material for lumber and at prices that will make it practically impossible to use it for fuel. One business man quotes $15.00 per cord as the price one might expect to pay for it in the very near future, if not now.\n\nFrom two entirely different quarters I have met men who assure me that oil as fuel is now practicable and once the plant is installed would reduce the cost by more than fifty percent. Simple, safe and easily controlled burners are now obtainable, and so many plants are now using oil on the Coast that there is no problem of getting supplies. I am convinced that a steam or hot water system with oil as fuel would in a period of five years prove more economical by one half than any hot air system that could be put into this institution.\n\nI hope the possibilities of this course will be investigated, before a decision is made as to the future heating of the building.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(signed) Wm. R. Wood, Principal.\n\nNotes on above.\n\n1. Heating costs undoubtedly much less with oil fuel.\n2. Believed fire hazards would be increased.\n3. With steam heating apparatus, an attendant with Engineers certificate would compulsory.\n\nEd. E. Frost,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 25, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 652/28 of the 12th instant, with enclosure, with reference to improvements at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School. The Department wishes to have a detailed report and quotation from a competent heating and plumbing contractor, and I have to authorize you to secure the services of such a contractor and have him proceed to the school without delay. When his report is to hand, you should forward it to the Department with your recommendation. Authority will then be directed to you to have this contractor undertake whatever work can be approved by the Department.\n\nThe Reverend Mr. Wood states that he has reason to hope the Church will provide the well, the engine and pump house and, perhaps, a new kitchen range. It might be advisable to have the contractor look into the question of the water supply and to give his recommendation and estimate for this improvement, also. Your early attention is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni,\nB. C.\nOttawa, March 6, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 21st ultimo, which has reference to the advisability of considering oil as a fuel for heating the Ahousaht Indian Residential School. On the 25th ultimo, Mr. Indian Agent Frost was authorized to engage a competent heating and plumbing contractor, who was to visit the school. I am satisfied that you will bring this question to his attention and that his comments in relation thereto will be included in his report and recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Macdonald,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Wm. R. Wood,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nAhousaht, B. C.\nAhousat Indian School,\nAhousat, B.C.,\nFebruary 21st, 1929\n\nD. R. Wood, Esq.,\nIndian Department,\nParliament Buildings, OTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMay I bring to your attention one more phase of the situation affecting the School here.\n\nSince writing you a few days ago, I have been making such investigations as were possible as to the best course to follow. It has been strongly impressed upon me that fir which has been the usual fuel here and which now costs anywhere from ten to fifteen dollars a cord is going to be increasingly hard to get and increasingly costly. Those who have been getting the logs for fuel are finding it more remunerative to sell them to the saw-mills, and there will be increasing opportunity for this as the West Coast develops. In fact the burning of the kind of timber we have been using must come to an end very soon.\n\nWhat is the alternative? There is no hardwood, and hemlock and the other woods available are poor fuel. A considerable number of mills, reduction plants, etc., along the coast are now using oil as their regular fuel and finding it more economical than anything else they can procure. Men from two different places in discussing the school problem have assured me that: (1) Oil is available; tankers make regular trips up the coast. (2) The cost of oil would be, in their opinion, very much less than half the cost of wood. (3) With a steam or hot water system installed, the cost of heating the School in this climate could be brought under a dollar a day.\n\nI have not yet been able to investigate the aspect of installment of the oil-burning plant, but would suggest that even if it should cost three or four hundred dollars more than the hot air system, the cost would be much more than offset by the first two or three years reduction of the cost of fuel. In view of this I would urge that consideration be given to the advisability of installing an oil-burning steam or hot-water system for heating the Ahousat School.\n\nI am, very truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, February 27, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15/15/13722 of the 15th instant, with reference to improvements at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School.\n\nOn the 25th instant, Mr. Indian Agent Frost was authorized to engage the services of a competent heating and plumbing contractor, who will visit the school and make a report and will give a quotation. It is true that the school is the property of the church; but, of late years, the Department has borne a share of the capital expenditure for Indian educational work. In the case of the Ahousaht School, it is proposed to ask the church to be responsible for the well, the pumping engine and pump house and the kitchen range. The Department contemplates making improvements in the heating and plumbing, provided they can be effected without heavy expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nOttawa, February 27, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 674/28 of the 19th instant, with reference to oil as fuel for heating the Ahousaht Indian Residential School. You might have the heating and plumbing contractor who goes to the school comment on this in his report. Authority to engage such a contractor was directed to you on the 25th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. E.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt., General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith further reference to the Ahousat School, may I say that I have definite word from the Church authorities in which they are committed to the expenditure of $750 toward putting the School in good condition, having particularly in mind the providing of a well, an engine and pump house, and a kitchen range. I am in a position to say also that some minor adjustments and repairs in the building will also be taken care of through Church funds.\n\nMy attention has been drawn to the fact that there was a difference of opinion some ten years ago or so when the present building was erected between the Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church and the Department as to the wisdom of building in this location. The Society favored building here and the Department opposed it, regarding the location as unsuitable. The Society went ahead and erected the building. It may be doubted whether their action was the best, for there are some things which may be argued in favor of other locations and against this one.\n\nIn my judgment the fact that there stands to the credit of the work generally a building which has done duty for ten years, and which can be put into fairly workable shape, is an unanswerable argument against locating elsewhere at this stage. I think that with a heating system and a water and toilet system of modern type installed the building can be made to do good service, and that to remove the children to any other place or to attempt to find room for them in any other school would in the long run entail very much heavier expenditures.\n\nI welcome very cordially the proposal of your letter of February 14th to secure a report from a competent heating and plumbing contractor on the building and its requirements, and trust that it may be possible to have such a report in the near future. It would, I judge, be very specially advantageous if the actual work of such replacements as may be decided upon could be done during the early summer. Our vacation period is from May 1st, and it would be well to have the work complete when the children return in June.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Frost, Esq.,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Mr Frost,\n\nSince examining Mr Nelson's estimates for the structural and other carpentry work in connection with the School I am impelled to write my opinion that several items in the list could be done for figures much lower than his.\n\nI have in mind items 2, 3, 4, & 5 in his list. These are pieces of straight carpentry work involving no very intricate problems and requiring only ordinary ability. His estimate for the four items totals $1825.00. After some figuring and consultation I am convinced that these four items can be done for $1250.00. It may be that my figuring involves the use of some of the material still present in use in the building while Mr Nelson may be counting on using all new material, and it may be that I have in mind a rate of wages lower than is paid in some places, but I am very confident that the material can be gotten and the work done within the sum I have mentioned, and that nothing will be sacrificed that is desirable for the building. The other items in Mr Nelson's list involve mechanical and technical problems and probably require the figures he associates with them, but these four I am sure can be done at the lower figure.\n\nSo confident am I of this possibility that I am willing to undertake it with local help, if given assurance that the Department will go forward with the other improvements somewhat along the lines indicated in the estimates which have been prepared. That is to say if the Department will install during the next two months heating and water systems, with the chimney, tank and fire-escapes, I will undertake during the same period for the sum of $1250.00 to complete the structural changes indicated in items 2, 3, 4, & 5 in Mr Nelson's list thus saving $575.00 on that part of the work.\n\nPlease note that this does not mean that I want the job but I felt it my duty to suggest to you that there might be substantial reduction in these items. I would much prefer others to do the work.\n\nVery truly yours,\nWm. R. Wood, Principal.\nJune 12, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Wood:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to improvements at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School. Several letters have been exchanged with Mr. Frost in connection with the improvements and concerning the best method for undertaking the work. I am pleased to inform you that, on the 7th instant, he was authorized to engage Mr. Hanna to proceed with the installation of a hot water heating system, on a day labour basis. It was decided to use equipment for coal. Further, Mr. Hanna is being instructed to install automatic closets, to enlarge the main drain under the building and to provide a large water tank on an outside trestle. Mr. Frost was also authorized to cooperate with you in the installation of a septic tank. In addition, a certain amount of carpentry work was authorized. It is understood that a new chimney will be provided and that fire escapes will be installed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. Wm. R. Wood,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nAhousaht, B. C.\nAhousat Indian School, AHOUSET, B.C.\n\nMay 28th, 1929.\n\nD. C. Scott, Esq.,\nIndian Department, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMay I take the liberty of placing before you some considerations regarding the School at this place.\n\nWhen I took charge at the opening of the year I found conditions that in my opinion militated fatally against efficiency. In particular there was no heating system for the building as a whole, and staff and children existed in conditions of constant discomfort especially in winter. The water system was pitifully inadequate and the water not wholesome. There were no inside toilets, and there were certain structural defects which made segregation of the sexes difficult.\n\nAfter taking time to size up the situation, I decided for myself two things, first, that I would on no account think of attempting permanent service here unless there could be devised some way of remedying these outstanding defects; second, that all things considered, the Building was worth improving, and could be made fairly adequate for its purpose. So I made up my mind to see immediately, this season, what could be done.\n\nEarly in the year I secured a pledge from the Home Mission Committee of the United Church that they would make a special grant of $750 with a view to providing a new well, an engine and pump and pump-house and if possible a kitchen range. At the same time I communicated with your Department and had a favorable reply promising cooperation. Later in pursuance of this promise Mr. Frost, the Agent, was authorized to secure the services of a competent heating and plumbing contractor to report on the needs of the School and the cost of meeting them. He came in due time, and I presume, made his report.\nThat appears to be as far as we have got. I had expected that his report would recommend quite definitely certain work, and that these recommendations would be considered by the Department, and if accepted contracts would be let and the work proceeded with. We were particularly anxious that the structural changes and the installation of heating and water systems be made during the vacation which runs from May 1st. If not done then we should almost be compelled to ask for an extension of the vacation period. So far no action has been taken and more than half the vacation period has passed.\n\nI may say that we are prepared to accept whatever recommendations Mr. Hanna (whom Mr. Frost engaged) may have made, and to cooperate to the utmost in expediting the work. We believe he is fully acquainted with the conditions and capable of judging what is most likely to serve the purpose. But we are getting very anxious indeed to have the work got under way.\n\nMay I say that from the Church side we are putting through improvements which represent much more than the $750 mentioned. If we can carry out the plans on which we are now working we will have of new equipment since last year the following:- A new well, cement cased and galvanized iron top, a six horse power engine, a laundry washer, a power pump capable of supplying a full house system, a building fifty feet by sixteen feet for housing the light plant the laundry, the pump, engine etc., and a fine new play lawn gradually being extended and ultimately to enclose 1000 square yards. In addition the changes we propose for the School Building and the class room, will provide ample room, in dormitory and elsewhere for at least ten additional children.\n\nOur objective, which we are pursuing as strenuously as we are able, is, first, a building so comfortable as to provide an adequate basis for health, and second, a chance to give the young Indians a thorough real preparation for life. It will help us greatly if action re the heating and water systems can be speeded up so as to be completed fairly early in the summer.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 7, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the heating system and water supply system at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School, you may engage Mr. A. S. Hanna to proceed with the installation of a hot water heating system, the system to be installed for the use of coal as fuel, the work to be carried out on a day labour basis and on completion, vouchers to be forwarded in duplicate covering the cost of material and labour. In the case of material, full particulars should be given of the materials supplied, and for the labour, certified time sheets should accompany the voucher. The cost of the work must not exceed $2950.00.\n\nYou may also instruct Mr. Hanna to install the automatic closets as recommended, the enlarging of the main drain under the building and the providing of a large water tank on a trestle outside of the building. If the Principal has not already arranged for the septic tank, this may be proceeded with, all work to be carried out on a day labour basis and accounts submitted as above for the heating system.\n\nWith reference to the estimates submitted by Mr. Carl Nelson for carpentry work etc., required at the school, the Department is prepared to allow a maximum expenditure of $1000.00 for this work, and it is considered that items No.1, No.6 and No.7 should be proceeded with. This work should also be carried out on a day labour basis and duplicate accounts submitted for labour and material.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Alberni, B.C.\nRe Heating System at Ahousaht Residential School.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to the Department's letter of 15th instant (no number) re the above matter, and beg to advise the Department that a copy of that letter was immediately passed to the Rev Principal of the school for his information and the supplying of the necessary information to the Department.\n\nThe Rev principal informed me by wire that he was writing the Department direct, and supplied this office with a copy of his letter to the Department, on 28th instant.\n\nI saw Mr. A.S. Hanna, in the mean time and enquired what the cost of heating system for the Ahousaht School would be, one for coal fuel, and Mr. Hanna advises me that the cost of installing a hot water system in the above school, one for the use of coal as fuel will be two thousand nine hundred fifty dollars ($2950.00) this F.O.B., steamer at Ahousaht.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd. E. Host\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAhousat Indian Residential School,\nAHOUSAT, B. C. May 25th, 1929.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have just had from Mr. E. E. Frost, Indian Agent of Port Alberni, B. C., a copy of your letter of May 15th to him in reference to the heating system to be installed in our school.\n\nIn response I have wired you today in the following terms,\n\nAhousat, B. C. May 25th, 1929.\nJ. D. McLean, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa. Re. Ahousat School. Willing to use any fuel Mr. Frost's expert recommends, but wood cannot be got. Urge early action re heating and water systems. School health and efficiency require them. Vacation already half over. May require vacation extended if work is not completed. Letter following.\n\nW. R. Wood, Principal.\n\nNow, to get this matter clear let me say that I have no plans or prejudices in this matter of heating. It is true I wrote the Department on February 21st advising consideration of oil as the fuel. This was done because, first, I had become aware of the increasing difficulty and cost of wood; second, because landing coal is something of a problem on this coast; and, third because two men with some experience had assured me that coal could be used very much more economically than either wood or coal. In response to my letter I had a communication signed by A. F. McKenzie intimating that Mr. Frost had been authorized to have a competent heating and plumbing contractor look into the situation and that he would probably report and recommend in the matter. To me this was entirely satisfactory and in due time Mr. Frost brought Mr. Hanna of Port Alberni to investigate and report.\nI discussed the matter with Mr. Hanna, and while I put no pressure on in the direction of having him recommend oil as the fuel, my recollection is that he agreed with the view that oil would heat the building more economically than any other fuel.\n\nBeing called in as an expert in the matter I think he is the man who should recommend, and I am quite ready to cooperate in working out whatever plan he recommends, if it is feasible at all. My one concern is to get a system installed which will enable us to make the school ordinarily comfortable both for the pupils and for the staff.\n\nSimilarly in the matter of the water and toilet system I had expected that Mr. Hanna would very definitely recommend a system which in his judgment would be the best for our building.\n\nIn passing may I remark that I find myself quite unable to get the point of your statement that \"it is not economical or satisfactory to operate an oil burner where the school is generating their own electric power.\" I do not understand why the lighting of a building by electricity should be any barrier to heating it with oil. If Mr. Hanna thinks coal is the fuel we should use, I am prepared to try it, but we would have to devise some better landing system than we yet have. I believe, however, that can be done.\n\nMay I add that through a special grant from the Home Mission Committee of the United Church we are going ahead with certain external improvements. Placing the light engine and batteries away from the main building we are securing room for two large playrooms in the basement. Replacing the old washers with an up-to-date laundry washer, we are providing room for all such machinery in a 50' by 16' building which will also house the pump. We have a new well ready with cement casing and galvanized iron top, and are in process of levelling a play lawn at the south side of the School which will by and by be extended to at least 1000 square yards. We are determined to put the School in shape to do creditable work, to provide adequate accommodation for at least ten more pupils, and to give to both staff and pupils what they have never had - ordinary comfortable and healthy quarters.\n\nBut everything depends on the Department putting in the water and heating systems. We earnestly hope it may be speeded up as much as possible. And we pledge our fullest cooperation to that end.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of the Department's letter of 7th instant authorizing the installing of a hot water heating system for coal fuel at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School, on day labour basis, by Mr. A.S. Hanna, at a cost that must not exceed $2950.00, for material and labour.\n\nAlso the installation of 2 automatic closets, the enlarging of the main drain under the building and the providing of a large water tank on a trestle outside the building and the construction of a suitable septic tank, by Mr. Hanna, on the same basis.\n\nFurther the authority for the expenditure of $1000.00 on items Nos. 1, 6, and 7, as detailed in the estimates submitted by Mr. Carl Nelson for carpentry work.\n\nI am enclosing herewith for the consideration of the Department, a letter from the Rev. Principal of that school stating that a reduction of $575.00 can be made in the cost of items Nos. 2, 3, 4, & 5, as detailed in Mr. Nelson's estimates.\n\nA decision is requested please as to whether the Department will consider the suggestion made by the Rev. Principal, as the rearrangement of the building as specified in items 2, 3, 4, and 5, have bearing on the installation of the heating system authorized and plans for installing same will have to be made accordingly.\n\nEnc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd.

Perhaps I owe you an explanation in regard to my letter. When your telegram reached me it read 'such' instead of 'church' by an error in transmission and of course I failed to get your meaning. I took it to mean that the Department would supply the machine.\n\nNow as regards the church here in the situation. Early in the year I put up to the Church committee its obligation to do something fairly substantial for the School if they were to expect the Department to take the heavier burden of the heating and water systems. In response they at once assumed the amount of $750 to cover the cost of a well, an engine and pump, a pump house and if possible a kitchen range. Now I can report that this obligation has been carried out. Instead of building a small pump house we built a structure 50' x 16' adapted to house the engine, the light plant, the laundry machinery and including a room for ironing and other laundry operations. Then going beyond their original undertaking money was provided from church funds for enlarging the classroom and fitting up a boys' playroom and finally for providing a winch and cable to help in meeting our landing difficulties. The simple fact is that the Church has expended during the season not merely $750 but considerably over a thousand dollars for helping make the premises here fit for effective work. But you will recognize that this makes it impossible to ask for a further extension just now.\n\nAnd yet the washer is immediately and urgently necessary. I will recall that the investigator appointed by the Department (Mr. Hanna) so reported in his first examination of the premises. The missionary committee has built the laundry house. I still hope the Department will put the washer in it. I am sure if you could see the physical toll required to operate the outworn hand washers here, there would be no hesitation.\n\nCompelled by health to give up the principalship I am leaving by the boat which carries this letter. A capable and experienced man, Rev. Joseph Jones, is taking my place. I trust it will be found possible to crown your very generous help by providing him yet before the end of the year with this very necessary piece of equipment.\n\nWith cordial appreciation of your goodness to me in my period of service here, I am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This matter should receive your prompt attention, and the certified vouchers or labour returns should be forwarded as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

The error in the matter seemingly resulted from the fact that the firm did not send in the second page of their account.

Principal of that school, with the estimated approximate cost of the same.\n\n1. One 12 horse power Marine gas engine for school launch.\n   Remarks: The Rev. Principal has re-planked and repaired the school launch hull and the same is now in good condition; the engine previously in boat declared by Machine Shop mechanic to be valueless and beyond repair. I recommend the supply of a 12 horse power Vivien engine at approximate cost of $550.00, factory at Vancouver; this price is subject to revision most probably downward. A launch is very necessary at this school for freight work.\n\n2. Two machine drive washing machines, shafting, and belting, at an approximate cost of $175.00.\n   Remarks: These machines are needed as all the hand washers except one are worn out and will have to be replaced as soon as possible; two machine drive washers will be able to care for all the laundry work of the school; they could be operated by the engine now installed in the laundry building. I respectfully recommend the favourable consideration of this request.\n\n3. Grant of $100.00 for digging test pits for improved water supply. This matter has been referred to the Department under letter No. 269/30, dated Port Alberni, 12.8.30.\n\n4. 5500 feet of 2\"x12\" Cedar planking, and 2000 feet of 4\"x4\" Cedar for posts and stringers, to improve girls play ground, approximate cost $150.00.\n   Remarks: I respectfully suggest that this be held in abeyance until an Inspector of schools has been appointed and his opinion obtained on the matter.\n\n5. $50.00 to clear cart road and put in culverts to enable fire wood to be hauled from bush.\n   Remarks: I respectfully recommend the favourable consideration of this item as wood is the fuel used for cooking and laundry purposes.\n\n6. $200.00 to clear present ditch system and improve and extend same.\n   Remarks: The present ditching system has been choked by erosion and need clearing out and improving as the failure of the system caused the flooding of the ground used for cultivation, and the entire loss of $90.00 worth of seeds sown this spring; but I consider the necessary work can be done at a cost not to exceed $150.00 which I respectfully recommend.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir;-\n\nI have the honour to submit herewith for the consideration of the Department Voucher No.136 amounting to $146.55, for painting material supplied to the Ahousaht Indian Residential School.\n\nThis account was submitted to this office by the Rev. Principal of that school for transmission to the Department for payment, and was returned to him for an explanation as to why the expenditure was incurred without the authority of the Department. The Rev. Principal replied informing me that his reason for carrying out the interior painting of the building before first asking authority from the Department for such expenditure, was that the school was greatly in need of interior painting for health and sanitary reasons and that it was necessary to have the work completed before the children returned from their summer holidays, and the time was short.\n\nThe Rev. Principal has been informed that no expenditure is to be incurred, which the Department will be called upon to defray, without first obtaining the Department's authority in writing.\n\nEnc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd.

(RG 10, Volume 6430, file 876-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\n[Stamp: Poor Copy]\nSir;-\n\nI have the honour to submit herewith Voucher No.187 amounting to $66.69 for window screening material supplied to the Ahousaht Indian Residential School.\n\nThis material was purchased by the work performed by the Rev. Principal of the Ahousaht school without authority having been asked of the Department.\n\nI may add that during the principalship of that school, by the Rev. Wm Wood, I had suggested to that gentlemen that the authority of the Department be asked for the screening of the windows but Mr. Wood was not in favour of screening the windows.\n\nIn my opinion the screening of the windows was advisable and I respectfully recommend the Department's favourable consideration of this account.\n\nEnc,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd. E. Scott\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 20, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 269/30 of the 12th instant, regarding the well at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School. You may authorize the Principal to expend $100 sinking test pits in search of water to augment the present supply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. MacInnes,\nFor Secretary.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni,\nB. C.\nI have the honour to bring the attention of the Department to the condition of the water supply at Ahousaht Indian Residential School.\n\nOn visiting that school on 5th and 6th instants I found the water supply, as provided by the recently constructed well, very low and quite inadequate for the domestic needs of the school; it had been necessary to shut off a portion of the sanitary arrangements of the school owing to the shortage of water. The old well had been brought into use for washing, bathing and other purposes of that kind.\n\nThe new well was pumped dry at about 10 a.m. on 5th instant and at 2 p.m. had regained 16 inches of water and at 5 p.m. the depth of water was 23 inches at which level the water became stationary; this amount of water is not quite sufficient to half fill the storage or pressure tank and with the compulsory constant use of water from it, the tank is suffering to some extent from drought; under these conditions there would be little or no water available for fire protection, even under the curtailed use of water the tank can not be brought to a satisfactory level.\n\nIn consequence of these conditions the Rev Principal has applied for an appropriation of $100.00, to sink test pits in search of water to augment the present supply.\n\nI am of the opinion that an increase in the supply can be obtained by going deeper (I take the flow of water in the present well to indicate this) but further depth cannot be got in the present well as the present bottom is on rock for a large part but I am of opinion that the rock can be avoided and greater depth attained in its immediate vicinity, and by constructing and addition to the present well of a greater depth would provide a more ample supply and a larger reservoir, but this can only be verified by sinking test pits, hence the Rev Principal's application for an appropriation for that purpose.\n\nI may add that the water shortage is general in West Coast settlements, as no moisture has fallen for the past five weeks.\n\nI am enclosing that portion of the Rev. Principal's letter dealing with the question of water supply, for the Department's information.\n\nEnc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This account will receive favourable consideration, provided it is supported by receipts showing the expenditure for the materials. In its present form, it is nothing more than a statement, certified by the Principal, concerning his expenditure.

(RG 10, Volume 6430, file 876-5, part 2)\nOttawa, December 16, 1930.\n\nDear Dr. Cochrane,\n\nI have delayed acknowledging your letter of the 4th instant, concerning the needs at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School until I knew more concerning the condition of the appropriation for Indian education for the current year. I find that absolutely no extras can be authorized - in fact in all probability there will be no funds in the vote at all for the month of March, which is the last of our fiscal year.\n\nThe Department is keeping in mind the needs at the Ahousaht School. On the 20th ultimo, we wrote to Mr. Beaton enclosing a copy of official letter to the Reverend Principal. This was preparatory to the estimates for the coming year. I have not yet received a reply.\n\nSo that there will be no delays when the lighting system at the school is nearing the end of its usefulness, I will now make inquiries for an Electrical Contractor to whom the work could be authorized. This man will be asked to go to the school and prepare specifications concerning what is required with an estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. R.B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street, West,\nToronto 2, ONT.\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nToronto,\nDec. 4th,\n1930.\n\nMy dear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nThere has just come to this office a letter from Rev. Joseph Jones, the Principal of the Shousaht Indian Residential School, B.C., and there are two paragraphs in the letter which I think should be sent on to you at once as they refer to pressing matters which Mr. Jones thinks should be attended to without delay. These are the paragraphs to which I refer:\n\n\"The road to the Matilda Creek is very necessary and now is a very opportune time to do the work. The Provincial Government has a gang of men working on a road from the Government dock where the steamer lands to the end of the Creek. If we could join on to this road we could take a truck from the school to the dock. Another proposition is to build a road directly to the creek. The present method of landing our supplies on the open beach is too destructive to goods, boats, and clothing to say nothing of our patience. The first trip of the month we were swamped, not through neglect or incompetence, but because men cannot successfully outmatch the sea in power. The road to the Creek or the road to the dock would avoid all this loss and worry.\n\n\"The lighting plant is only half the power we need and has been patched up and tinkered with to keep it going. I know it would not pass a Fire Insurance Inspector. Mr. Ferrier told me some time ago to wire him if it broke down, but I cannot allow it to collapse, we need the light so I watch it very carefully. We only have half the lights we need.\"\n\nMr. Beaton is absent from the office just now and I am sending this extract on to you at once to ask if there is any possibility of the Government helping with the building of the road to connect with the piece of road which the Provincial Government is building. It would seem from his letter almost essential that this road should be built so that there will be a direct connection from the school to the nearest doctor.\n\nEvidently according to the letter Mr. Jones has been in touch with you about the lighting system. Could not the Department help put this in shape as soon as possible?\n\nThanking you for your kindness and attention to both Mr. Beaton and myself during our recent visit to Ottawa, and also for the paper with the reference to the opening of the school at Brandon which I find I neglected to acknowledge before,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6430, file 876-5, part 2)\nOttawa, November 20th, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nRev. Mr. Beaton of the Missionary Society has informed the Department that you have written concerning the needs at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School. He states that you are asking for the following:\n\n1. Clearing land for garden purposes.\n2. The installation of an adequate lighting system.\n3. Construction of a cedar plank road to Matilda Creek, building of a floating dock there and a second hand truck for transporting goods to the school.\n4. A second classroom.\n5. Carpenter and boat-building shop.\n6. An infirmary for sick children.\n7. Additions to the plumbing system.\n8. Clearing, draining, fencing and culverts.\n\nI write now to inquire concerning the relative urgency of these improvements. The Department has already planned to ask for funds for the electric lighting system and for a marine engine. It is possible that one additional improvement could be allowed this coming year. Please list these improvements, with estimate of the cost in each case, in order of their relative importance to the institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Joseph Jones,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nAhousaht, B.C.\nOttawa, November 20th, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nPursuant to your conversation with Mr. Ferrier and to the papers left with him, I wish to enclose, for your information, a copy of my letter of today's date to the Reverend Principal of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B.A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, November 20th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your 461/30 of the 8th instant, with enclosure, concerning the electric lighting system at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School. I regret that there are no funds at the present time for this improvement but I have made a note for next year's Estimates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\nMay I outline the needs of Ahousaht and the method by which these needs can be met.\n\nFirst then is the question of clearing land for gardens. When the school was built the land between the lake and the seashore was cleared of standing timber but the stumps were left, the only area cleared was the building site. It is my purpose to clear the land of stumps and put in garden truck. This land between the old lake bottom and the sea is ideal in quality, is higher than the lake bottom (which is sometimes flooded to a depth of one foot or more) and is not subject to flooding. The sal-lal bush is growing in the spaces between the stumps and has to be cut down every two years. To take out these very large stumps is a heavy and laborious task. I would like to get this work done this spring so that a garden may be planted.\n\nThe other improvement contemplated will entail considerable expenditure. My suggestion is that the W.M.S. approach the Indian Dept. and offer to transfer this property to them on condition that they assume responsibility for the following improvements:\n\n1. The installation of an adequate lighting system. The present system is dangerous, poorly installed and always on the verge of collapse; we have only half the lights we ought to have. Our batteries will not allow additional lights.\n\n2. The construction of a cedar plank road from Matilda Creek to the School (approx. 1 mile). The difficulty of landing supplies here is very great, the only place is the open beach which is subject to the tide and swell of the open sea. The surf is so strong sometimes that it is impossible to land. I am told that when Mr. Miller was in charge they suffered loss and damage to goods on many occasions, one case in particular when two of the big heavy dug-out canoes were smashed and the contents spilled into the ocean, among them 35 sacks of flour, sugar and groceries, etc.; you can imagine the loss. Mr. Wood has expressed himself very clearly on this landing problem. Before coming here I have had considerable experience in canoes and would enjoy the sensation of riding the surf in an empty canoe and clad in a bathing suit, but I do not relish seeing our supplies damaged and destroyed. On two occasions we have had the canoe swamped and on the last occasion we were capsized. These are not accidents; they are inevitable when the ocean is in certain playful moods, and they may happen when our next shipment comes. The construction of this proposed road will avoid all this expense and worry.\n\nAt present the steamer goes into Matilda Creek and unloads at Gibson's Dock. This is only 1-1/2 miles from the school. The Proposed road will end on Matilda Creek; here the water is always calm and we can land our supplies in comfort and safety. From there to the school (a little less than a mile) I propose to carry the supplies by Ford truck over the proposed plank road. The reason it will have to be built of cedar plank is because there are no other materials available. There are limitless cedar trees and we can have them sawn at Gibson's mill. (Cedar will last 20 years or more). It is proposed to make the road eight feet wide but we shall clear a strip twenty feet wide in the bush. The total cost of clearing, constructing road, building floating dock and supplying second hand truck, will be about three thousand dollars. ($3,000.00)\n\n3. The erection of an additional class room. The task of teaching all grades up to grade 8 is too great for one teacher. We have now sufficient accommodation for sixty pupils in the main building, but we cannot put this number in class room. Approximate cost of class room, $2,000.00\n\n4. The erection of a carpenter shop and boat building shop combined. I am teaching the boys carpenter work and also boat building as far as possible.\nAt present we are using one end of the laundry for our Carpenter work; it is inadequate for this purpose and is certainly impossible for boat building. These West Coast Indians make their living from the sea. If we can teach these boys to build boats (and we can with proper equipment) we shall send them out fully prepared to earn their living in competition with White man or Jap. The building should be 24 ft. x 60 ft. and would cost $2,500.00.\n\n5. Improvements and addition to the Main Building. At present we do not have a separate room for sick children. We require a sick room and nurse's room adjoining. This can be done within the compass of the present building. We shall also require some additions to the plumbing system. My estimate for these improvements is $2,200.00.\n\n6. The Department should also be asked to grant $1000.00 each year for five years to clean out and keep clean the drainage ditches around the farm, clear additional land, build bridges and culverts on ditches, and erect fences.\n\nThe total amount asked for (about 17,000.00) is considerably less than the value of this property. I have found the Department willing to provide equipment for the education of the Indian children. We cannot expect them to spend large sums on property they do not own. This property is not an asset to the W.M.S., it is rather a liability. So long as the Title of the Property remains in our name it will be difficult to obtain grants from the Government. By handing it over to them on the above terms, the burden will be taken off our shoulders and placed where it rightly belongs.\"\nSir;-\n\nI have the honour to submit for the information of the Department, a report by Mr. W. C. Hamilton of Port Alberni on the electric lighting system at Ahousaht Indian Residential School. I am informed Mr. Hamilton installed the system now in use at that school. It will be noted that Mr. Hamilton does not make any estimate of what the cost would be to put the system in such shape as would comply with the present regulations governing same, but suggests that a qualified electrician be asked to examine it and supply estimates.\n\nI have no hesitation in stating that the present system does not comply with the present regulations and should damage from fire occur, would exonerate the Insurance Company from liability.\n\nBelow is appended a list of further lights needed at the school, as applied for by the Rev. Principal on my last inspection of the school on October 6th,\n\nGirls play room 4, Boys play room 4, Sullery basement 1, Furnace room 1, Coal bin 1, Dining room 2, Boys wash room 1, Boys bath room 1, Kitchen 1, Hall 1, Sewing room 1, Girls store room 1, Girls dormitory 1, Girls upper dormitory 2, Boys store rooms and Dormatory 1 each, Attic 1, Dormitory landing 1, Boys upper dormitory 2, General store rooms 2, Girls dormitory landing 1, Sick room 1, Class rooms 5, Barn 4, Exterior porch 1. Total 43.\n\nI beg to state that the present wiring is of the naked lead or uncovered type, the joints and passes through partitions are not properly protected.\n\nThe present regulations call for all wiring to be encased in conduits and all connections properly housed.\n\nThe Department's remarks and instructions regarding this matter are respectfully awaited, please.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6430, file 876-5, part 2)\nDear Mr. Jones;-\n\nAt your suggestion I am pleased to report upon your electric lighting system or installation.\n\nI might say that as it stands it is altogether inadequate to your present needs, there having been considerable additions to the building of late, and I noticed that these additions are not connected to the present wiring system and are therefore without light.\n\nIt would be unwise to increase the capacity of the present plant as the batteries have been in use now for over 4 years and are in a very weak condition. The installation of a new plant, preferably of the automatic type and of 110 instead of 32 volts is advisable. These automatic systems eliminate to a great extent the storage battery nuisance and from personal observation I must say that they are giving wonderful satisfaction and service.\n\nIn the matter of School wiring your present system was perhaps satisfactory several years ago. However according to the present wiring code it is now sub-standard, the building should be wired in conduit (piping) throughout. This is the only manner in which a building such as yours should be wired to ensure perfect safety, particularly where a direct current installation has to be used.\n\nThe foregoing is a true and disinterested report and I shall be glad if your Department should decide to have a qualified electrician call upon you to report. I have no hesitation in stating that he would agree with me as to the inadequacy of your present lighting system, and equipment.\n\nI remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(signed) W.C.

Hamilton, of Hamilton's Electric and Battery Shop, First Avenue, Port Alberni, to provide a detailed report, recommendation and quotation. He should examine the correspondence which is on your file in this connection and then, after securing your advice, should cooperate freely with the Reverend Principal when at the school. A copy of this letter is being directed to the Rev. Principal for his information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni,\nB.

C. Hamilton, of Hamilton's Electric and Battery Shop, First Avenue, Port Alberni, B.C., may be instructed to make the necessary examination and submit a quotation. Mr. Hamilton is recommended as being fully qualified to undertake the work required.\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\nIndian Residential School\nAhousaht, B.C.\n\nJanuary 6th 1931\n\nFurther to letter No.159-2-5 dated Nov.20th 1930\n\nA.F.Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honour to submit Estimates of the proposed improvements at Ahousaht.\n\nFirst. Twelve h.p. Marine engine for launch $875.00\n\nSecond. Automatic D.C. Lighting system 110 volts installed in the conduit system throughout the main building and to all outbuildings $2,100.00\n\nThird. The Construction of a plank road to connect the School with Matilda Creek and to the road to the dock where the steamers unload. Since my first communication with the Mission Board on this subject, the Provincial Government have begun work on a road from Gibsons Dock to Duncans at the head of Matilda Creek. (See the map of the district shewing proposed road and the different points mentioned.) Upon completion of our road we shall have a direct connection with Matilda Creek where we can always get our freight without danger or loss, and we shall also be connected with the provincial road which when completed will enable us to load a truck at the steamer and unload directly into our store house. I want to impress upon you the difficulties of the present way of landing our freight on the open beach which is exposed to the rolling surf of the Pacific. The Provincial Police attempted to land here in an empty yawl the seas turned them over and our boys had to go to their help. On the 13th of Dec., it was too rough to have the steamer stop here so our freight was taken around to Gibsons' dock, on the 17th the seas having gone down considerably Mr Gibson offered to bring around my freight in their big boat the Anchorite (We have no engine for our boat so I have to hire boats for all the work.) The boat was driven aground on our beach, I hired three other boats to attempt salvage but it was impossible to pull her off, the waves pounded her to pieces before the next high tide. This boat was valued at $5,000.00 they had insurance on her up until three months ago so it is a total loss to our Neighbour except the parts we salvaged from the wreck the next day, since then they have made three attempts to load the engine on a barge but the surf is too strong. Every Government and Church Official who has visited here agree that a road to the calm waters of the Creek is necessary.\nIndian Residential School\nAhousaht, B.C.\n\nThe proposed road will do this and in addition will eventually land us at the dock.\n\nThere is one other advantage in this road. We have here about 11 acres of level land (the bed of a lake drained by ditches). Samples of this soil have been sent to the Agricultural College and they tell us we need to put fertilizer into the soil and say that kelp is the best. Every year tons of kelp is deposited on Powel Beach. This beach is less than 200 yards from the proposed road at one point; here we propose to build a branch road out to the beach, where we can haul the kelp to the farm. At present the land is too impoverished to grow anything, but with ample fertilizer we can grow enough feed to keep cows as well as provide vegetables for the school. At present all these have to be purchased in Victoria or Vancouver.\n\nThis road will also provide an excellent walk for the children, at present we have only a narrow plank walk from school to village.\n\nIt is proposed to build the road where it is close to ground of cedar, where it is above ground of fir and spruce. The enclosed sketch shows method of construction. You will see that the car or truck will be running on four inch plank, the centre is filled in with two inch plank, the logs at the side are safety buffers. Part of the road is through heavy timber, this will supply us with fuel for some years to come. The school land adjoins Mr. Duncan's Land, he will be pleased to grant \"Right of way\" over his property.\n\nThe length of road will be a little less than 2000 yards including the branch to Powel Beach. The cost I have carefully calculated to be no more than $6500.00\n\nI hope you will give this item your best consideration.\n\nErection of Carpenter Shop and Boat building Shop combined 24 x 60 feet, we are using a corner of the laundry for carpenter shop, it is inadequate and very unsatisfactory. It is situated on the girls side of main building, the steam is destructive of tools.\n\nWe shall require a building for the new lighting system, my proposal is to partition off part of the new Carpenter Shop for this purpose. If the Department will provide the material for this building I and the boys will build and finish same to your satisfaction. Cost of Material $1100\n\nAdditional Classroom. The present room 23 ft. 6 in X 34 ft. 3 in x 8 ft. 6 in and a small room 10 ft. 6 in X 18 ft. 3 in, the latter was only intended for cloak room but we have to use it to accommodate the 49 pupils, we have as many as 46 pupils in the classrooms at one time. With an additional classroom we shall relieve the teacher of some of her heavy duty of teaching all the grades. Cost of material will be $850.00 I will build it with the aid of pupils.\n\nGrant for cleaning out ditches and deepening the main\nIndian Residential School\nAhousaht, B.C.\n\nSixth continued,\n\noutlet channel.\n\nThere are two other items which can be left over for the following year.\n\nI hope you will see the urgency of these improvements, especially the Road and the Lighting. If the money for the road could be supplied this winter it would relieve a situation of hardship among the Indians and White people here. Fishing was unprofitable to most of the people last Summer. Now the fishing has been opened nearer to Vancouver to relieve the distress there it has closed the market to the West Coast fisherman, there are no fish buyers here this winter.\n\nIf you require any further information I shall be glad to furnish same.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nMap forwarded under separate cover\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of the Department's letter of 9th instant directing that Mr. W.C. Hamilton of Port Alberni, B.C., be requested to prepare detailed estimates of work and cost on the improvement of the electric system at Ahousaht School.\n\nI beg to advise the Department that Mr. Hamilton has called at this office, been shown the Department's letter above mentioned and other correspondence regarding the matter, and has assured me that he will proceed to Ahousaht at the earliest possible opportunity and will prepare and submit recommendations and quotations on the project named.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Frost, Esq.,\nPort Alberni, V.I.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am sorry I was unable, for business reasons, to proceed to Alouette by the boat of January 23rd, as arranged, but instead I went by the boat of February 3rd.\n\nAttached are plans and particulars of what is required to list the Alouette school building and other buildings, adequately. I have gone thoroughly into the matter of these requirements with Mr. Jones, the principal, and the plans and particulars as submitted have his approval.\n\nWe discussed the matter of the location of the listing plant, and it is his wish to have it located, if possible, in a portion of the proposed new boat-house and workshop. This I consider a very good suggestion provided it is kept separate from the other part of the workshop by a partition, and that portion provided with a lock.\n\nIt is desirable from a safety standpoint to carry out the work throughout in rigid and flexible conduit. There are portions of the school building and class room where the work can be concealed and this is recommended wherever possible.\n\nIt is most practical to have the fuse panel located in the basement; conductors being run to the different floors to junction boxes by means of rigid conduit, thence to the different circuits by means of rigid or flexible conduit. Ten circuits are required to provide for the school building.\nThe sizes of wire needed are as follows:\n\nPlant to school building No. 6 weather proof.\nTrench to fuse panel in basement No. 6 strand R.C.\nBuilding to class room (P.P. entrance switch fused) No. IO R.C.\nBuilding to laundry (entrance switch fused) No. IO R.C.\nBuilding to barn No. 3 solid weather proof.\nFused entrance switch to be located in barn as in laundry\nand class room.\nFuse panel to junction box on each floor No. IO R.C.\nLight and switch circuits No. I4 R.C.\nConvenience outlets No. I2 R.C.\n\nIt is recommended that ceiling dome lights be used in the\nfollowing locations:\n\nPupils dining room -------------- 4.\nKitchen ------------------------ 6.\nStaff sitting room -------------- I.\nStaff dining room -------------- I.\nStaff bath-room --------------- I.\nOffice -------------------------- I.\nGirls sewing room -------------- 5.\nClass room --------------------- 4.\n\nAll dome lights to have pull-chain switches as a part of\nthe fixture.\nAll other lights in the building to be of the ordinary\ndrop type with tin shades. There are two lights in the class room\nas shown on sketch which require to be ceiling fixtures with angle\nreflector shades to throw light on the black-board.\n\nThere are three lights to be placed on outside of school\nbuilding. These can be of the ordinary bracket shaded type.\nFour poles will have to be provided and installed to carry\nthe light wires to the barn etc.\n\nIn the course of installation it might be necessary to make\nminor additions and alterations; this should be taken into account.\nThe plant I would recommend is of the automatic type, 110 volt. There are several of these on the market and two in particular that I have in mind are the Lister and Kohler.\n\nI have had considerable experience in the servicing of both makes, and apart from the fact that the Lister is a British product and very good and reliable; I feel inclined to recommend the Kohler because of its simplicity, fool proof features and good service, which to my knowledge I know they are rendering.\n\nThey are also at a price that does not make such an installation prohibitive. The reason for this being that storage batteries are almost eliminated, only a small 24 volt battery being used for starting purposes. This is a very desirable feature though perhaps it too has its shortcomings, but which are not to be compared with the full storage battery type, where expenditures and upkeep has to be taken into consideration.\n\nThe approximate full load - on average of 60 watt per light - is 4\u00bd K.W.\n\nIt is thought that a 3 K.W. machine would, with due care, be sufficient as only from one third to one half the maximum load would be carried at any period.\n\nIf a greater margin of safety would be desired a 3 or 5 K.W. unit would be advisable when taking into consideration also the possible additions to buildings in the near future.\n\nAn appropriation of $1100.00 will be required to cover the complete installation. This will adequately cover all material and work exclusive of plant.\n\nPrice of Kohler plants are as follows:\n\n- 2 K.W. automatic 110 volt ----- $950.00\n- 5 K.W. automatic 110 volt ----- $2000.00\n\nWith an additional $150.00 to cover unforeseen and incidental expenditures will bring the appropriation up to $1200.00 for a 2 K.W. and $2150.00 for a 5 K.W. plant.\nFebruary 10th, 1931.\n\nI am also in possession of particulars with reference to the Lister lighting plants.\n\nThey manufacture a 3\u00bd K.W. automatic, full battery, 52 cell type which would, I believe be quite adequate for the Ahouset installation. I have no hesitation in recommending this type of plant but as already stated they present a storage battery problem, which is undesirable in isolated locations.\n\nThis plant is not a one piece unit such as the Kohler, therefore presents an extra cost in installation.\n\nThere is one great advantage attached to the Lister plants in that they are slow speed, having a very long period of life when compared with the high speed type. This does to a great extent offset the storage battery problem, when cost of maintenance is considered.\n\nPrice of 3\u00bd K.W. Lister complete with switch board and cooling tanks ------------ $1150.00\n\n80 amp., 52 cell storage battery, glass cell type--$471.00\n\nCost of installation over Kohler $75.00.\n\nThis represents a net saving of $300.00 if a Lister 3\u00bd K.W. is desired in preference to a 5 K.W. Kohler.\n\nI consider that this covers all the information that will be required by your department as it furnishes the required data for plans and specifications, leaving your department to decide on the size and make of the plant to be installed.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.C.

It is our plan to place the generating plant in the proposed Carpenter & Boat-building shop. You will remember I asked for a grant to purchase material for this building, and I and the boys would build it. The only other out building we have is the laundry which is situated on the girls side, this is unsuitable for a lighting plant on account of moisture and steam, and the disadvantage of location.\n\nI have not yet heard anything about the engine for our boat or the other proposed improvements, which are urgently needed. The building of the road this summer would provide employment for our Indians. Only a very small proportion of the fish plants are operating this year and as a result our Indians do not know how they can make a living. They are coming to me constantly asking for work and I have given all that I can.\n\nWill you please give these items your best consideration and oblige yours sincerely\n\nJoseph Jones\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6430, file 876-5, part 2)\nOttawa, July 3, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have delayed somewhat with a reply to your letter of the 5th ultimo, with reference to improvements at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School. The Department wished to learn if a supplementary estimate could be secured for certain purposes, before writing. I regret to inform you that the only improvement that has been allowed at this school is the electric lighting. $2,500 is being voted for this purpose. The cost will be approximately $2,200, so this will leave but $300 for other urgent needs.\n\nI note it was your intention to place the generating plant in a proposed carpenter and boatbuilding shop. If the Department applied the $300 for materials for this building, do you believe you could get the Missionary Society to provide the balance of the lumber, etc.?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

MacKenzie, Esq.\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr Hamilton and his electrician arrived here early in June to install the new plant. We were compelled to provide some suitable place for the generator. Mr Frost, Indian Agent was here and he gave authority to purchase lumber to build a house for the plant, this I have done and completed the same at a cost of about $100.00. Our plant is installed and working satisfactorily.\n\nWe are still without the carpenter & boatbuilding shop. If we are to do our duty to the boys we need this equipment. Training in these crafts will be more useful to them than all other branches. I have had the training and experience and I want to pass it on to them. Is it possible to apportion part of the money granted to British Columbia Indians for Technical Education? I understand that ten thousand dollars was available for the purpose last year.\n\nI do not think the Missionary society can afford to spend much more this year. They contribute between four and five thousand every year to this school, besides special grants for emergencies.\n\nOur launch is on the ways yet, and I am having to hire a launch to do our work. I understood the Department were purchasing an engine for this launch this year.\n\nI shall be very grateful if you will take into further consideration our needs at Ahousaht.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJoseph Jones\nPrincipal\nOttawa, August 4, 1931.\n\n101.C.31\n\nSir,-\n\n(Incl.)\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 11th ultimo with which you submitted voucher No.158 amounting to $2200.00 in favour of Mr.W.C.Hamilton for the installation of a lighting plant for the Anousant Indian Residential School, and in reply I beg to say that, before payment of the voucher can be made, the Department requires details with respect to the charge of $150.00 for incidentals covering travelling expenses, and extra duty on plant, etc. The voucher is returned herewith for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nEd. B.Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nOttawa, July 23rd, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing vouchers in payment of the installation of the lighting plant in the school building, laundry, classroom and barn at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School. In reply I have to say that these accounts will be paid in due course.\n\nThe authority which you gave for the purchase of material for the erection of a small powerhouse at a cost of approximately $90 is approved. An itemized account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the material should be forwarded in the usual manner.\n\nIt is noted that the electric lighting equipment, including wiring, etc., was satisfactorily installed and that, upon a test being made, it was found to be working satisfactorily. It is hoped that the school authorities will see that this plant is kept in good condition and that the batteries are not overloaded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to the Department's letter dated Ottawa May 22nd, 1931 authorizing W.G. Hamilton of Port Alberni, B.C., to rewire the Ahousaht Indian Residential School for electric light according to estimates and plans submitted, and at a cost not to exceed $2200.00.\n\nI beg to advise the Department that the equipment has been installed according to approved plans, and has been in operation for about two weeks.\n\nOn the 9th instant in company with the School Principal I inspected the work and machine, and tested its operation under various loads from all parts of the buildings and found the wiring and attachments of good material and workmanship, the automatic plant responded instantly under any load from any part of the building and the lights were powerful and steady under full load.\n\nThe installation is according to plans approved by the Department, except that the Kohler Plant was to have been housed in the proposed Carpenter Shop, the erection of which was not, and to date has not, been authorized.\n\nOn June 16th, 1931 on visiting Ahousaht School I was asked to decide where the plant should be located, in the absence of the new Carpenter Shop and submitted the suggestion that a small house be erected as a permanent powerhouse, clear of all other buildings, this was agreeable to Mr. Hamilton and approved by the Reverend Principal.\n\nI authorized the purchase of building material for the powerhouse at an estimated approximate cost of $90.00, the Principal and the carpenter pupils of the school to supply the labour, this has been done and I found the engine house well constructed and finished.\n\nI respectfully ask the Department's endorsement of the action taken.\n\nEnc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOffice of the West Coast Indian Agency,\n\nJuly 11, 1931\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 158, amounting to $2,000.00 in favour of W.G.

The time occupied in the work should be shown, and details given regarding material, etc., in connection with which a charge of $15.00 has been made.\n\n(2) The account should show in detail expenditure re outlets, lights and fixtures for requirements of staff. The number of outlets and cost should be shown, also charges for lights and fixtures, respectively.\n\n(3) The Department requires the receipted board bill to the amount of $30.00.\n\n(4) Details of difference in price of lighting unit for which $65.00 is charged should be shown. The old rate and the new tariff rate should also be quoted.\n\nThere is a charge of $10.00 in this account for inspection of plant.

MacKenzie, Esq.\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 6th of August, No. 159-2-5 re-improvements at Ahousaht.\n\nWe have 52 pupils in residence and 7 more applications signed. To provide for these additional pupils we shall require more classroom and dormitory accommodation.\n\nI beg to submit the following proposals to supplement what I have already suggested to you.\n\nAt the present, lumber is remarkably cheap in B.C. I have before me prices of material required for our needs.\n\nFirst, classroom. For $412.00 I can build a classroom 20 feet x 24 feet, build brick chimney, and paint the building inside and out two coats, also wire the building and connect to our new plant. All we need to complete will be 25 desks and 176 sq.ft. of blackboard.\n\nSecond, Carpentershop and boat-building-shop\nTo provide the extra dormitory space to allow for the admission of the new pupils, I suggest the plan of putting up a building 22 ft. x 46 ft., the lower part for carpenters and boatbuilding, the upper a dormitory for boys, with one room for Assistant Principal. This arrangement will give us ample space and proper equipment for 60 pupils. The cost of material for this, including brick chimney and paint will not be more than $780.00.\n\nIf the Department provide for these very necessary additions, I shall take great pleasure in doing the work with the aid of our pupils.\n\nInspector Barry will be here the first week in September, he will have the opportunity of investigating our needs.\n\nTrusting you will give these items your best consideration I remain yours sincerely\n\nJoseph Jones\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6430, file 876-5, part 2)\nSeptember 9, 1931.\n\nMr. Burkard,\n\nPursuant to Mr. Ferrier's telephone call, I have to request that you will ascertain, by telegram, a suitable source of supply for approximately $600 worth of lumber, which is immediately required for a carpenter and boatbuilding shop at the Indian Residential School at Ahousaht, B.C., in the electoral district of Comox-Alberni. I find that, in the past, this school has purchased lumber from the Lemon-Jonasson Company, of Victoria - who appear on the patronage list - and from the Gibson Lumber and Shingle Mills, of Ahousaht.\n\nA.

The cost of the carpenter and boatbuilding shop, which you have estimated at $780 will be paid from B. C. Special Vote.

Principal will be responsible for all the labour. He has been instructed to purchase the lumber from the Gibson Lumber and Shingle Mills, of Ahousaht, and the hardware from Marshall-Wells, Limited.

F. MacKENZIE.\n\nChg. Dept. I. A.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6430, file 876-5, part 2)\nProtection:- There are five fire extinguishers and three extinguishers of the hose type. Inside the building there are two hydrants with hose. The water supply is through a tank at one end of the building. This tank is about on a level with the roof of the main building. I tested one of the hose pipes by having the water turned through it, and found the pressure sufficient for an attempt to fight a small fire in the building. The pressure was not sufficient to send the water over the roof, as the above mentioned tank is not raised enough for this.\n\nThe source of the water is a well near the school, from which the water is pumped into the tank. This new well is 12 feet deep and gives an excellent supply of water. The water was found to be in a sandy strata just above the bed rock. This water is slightly coloured. It has been analysed and found to be of good quality. There is a 6 H.P. Fairbanks gas engine, which drives a pump as well as the laundry machinery mentioned below.\n\nThere are two wooden fire escapes. Access to the escapes is by means of the dormitory windows. These have wire screens, which are taken off for fire drills, which are held each month. There is an axe in each dormitory. The children could use the axes to knock off the screens from the windows in case of a real fire. During the fire drill which I held the children were clear of the building in less than two minutes.\n\nI wish to recommend that four fire gongs and the necessary electric equipment to operate them be supplied to the school. This will probably cost in the neighbourhood of $100.00 which sum is being placed in the estimates for this school by the Indian Agent.\n\nLaundry:- There are two new washing machines. These were supplied by the Department to the school last year. The power to operate these machines is supplied by the above mentioned gas engine, through shafting. There are two laundry tubs. There is one extractor run off shafting. This is in good condition. The laundry stove, at present in use, is a discarded kitchen range. This range is in a hopeless condition. It is quite worn out. I wish to recommend the supply of a new laundry stove of modern design.\n\nUpper Landing:- About five hundred square feet of V. Joint sheeting and a dormer type skylight are required on the upper landing. This will complete the walls and ceiling of the staircase, and will provide for extra ventilation when necessary. The work in connection with this would be done by the boys.\n\nKitchen:- The kitchen is badly lighted. Part of the floor is badly worn and will need renewal in the near future. The bake oven is in good condition, but the oven in the kitchen range is wearing thin, and will soon need repair. The kitchen is kept perfectly clean.\n\nElectric Light:- In June a Kohler, direct current, automatic, 2 K.W. electric light machine was installed. This machine works on 110 volts. It cost installed $200.00 with $90.00 for the house in which it has been placed.

Further, an extension to the lighting system is required. So that the Department will be prepared in the event of an emergency, I should like to have the name of an Electrical Contractor who could proceed to the school now, determine just what is required and submit a quotation. The school is in the electoral district of Comox-Alberni and if a suitable contractor cannot be found in Alberni the next best centre is Victoria.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C. May 11, 1932.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI very recently had a call on me from Reverend Mr. Jones, Principal of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School, West Coast Agency, and he took up with me the question of the Department supplying lumber, desks and blackboards for a new classroom, at an approximate cost of $750.00. Captain Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, reported on the necessity of this additional classroom in a recent report of his inspection at the Ahousaht School. Mr. Jones informed me that he had received a letter from you stating the amount would be included in the 1932-33 estimates but probably there would be a further cut. Mr. Jones also wishes to have a launch built by his pupils under the supervision of a competent builder, the size being 9'6\" x 36', the estimated cost of the material to be $500.00 with an engine costing $300.00. Mr. Jones points out that the building of this boat by the pupils would be an excellent chance for them to acquire a knowledge of this profession as launches are the practical means of transportation on the West Coast.\n\nI would be obliged if you would kindly inform me as to whether or not money will be available this year for the purpose above mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6430, file 876-5, part 3)\nMay 20, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nThe Main Estimates provide funds for the lumber for a classroom and for a launch at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School. The estimated costs are $575 and $500 respectively, or a total of $1075. The school management, with the assistance of the manual training class, will be entirely responsible for the construction and the labour, without cost to the Department.\n\nThe Department proposes, with the Minister's concurrence, to ask for prices on the lumber from the Gibson Lumber and Shingle Mills, of Ahousaht, and from Lemon-Gommason, of Victoria. The first named firm is mentioned in your memorandum of September 11, 1931, when lumber was required at this school, and the Victoria firm is on the list and has supplied lumber to this institution in the past.\n\nThe school is at Ahousaht, on the west coast of Vancouver Island, in the federal district of Comox-Alberni.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nMinister's Office\n\nMay 23, 1932.\n\nMR. WILLIAMS,\n\nI have your memorandum of the 20th instant regarding a supply of lumber for the Ahousaht Indian Residential School. Prices for this material are to be obtained from the Gibson Lumber and Shingle Mills, of Ahousaht, and from the following lumber dealers of Victoria, B.C.:\n\nLemon, Connason Co. 2224 Government St.\nShawnigan Lake Lumber Co. 2022 \"\nMoore-Whittington Lumber Co. 2614 Bridge Street.\nDrysdale Sash & Door Co. 1083 North Park St.\nCameron Lumber Co. 755 Garbally Rd.\nCanadian Puget Sound Lumber Co 489 Discovery St.\nMcCarter Shingle Co., Ltd. 2418 Rock Bay Avenue.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, May 26, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15/15/24952 of the 11th instant, with reference to lumber for a classroom at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School and lumber and an engine for a launch at the same school. Funds are available for these purposes, and you may call for prices on the lumber necessary for both purposes from the following:\n\nGibson Lumber & Shingle Mills, Ahousaht, B. C.\nLemon, Gonnason Company, 2324 Government St., Victoria.\nShawnigan Lake Lumber Company, 2022 \" \"\nMoore-Whittington Lumber Co., 2614 Bridge Street, \" \"\nDrysdale Sash & Door Company, 1033 North Park St., \" \"\nCameron Lumber Company, 355 Garbally Rd., \" \"\nCanadian Puget Sound Lumber Co., 489 Discovery St., \" \"\nMcCarter Shingle Co., Ltd., 2418 Rock Bay Avenue, \" \"\n\nThe business may be awarded to the firm quoting the best price. The lumber for the classroom should be kept separate on the voucher from the lumber for the boat, as it is proposed to charge the classroom materials to Indian Education and the lumber for the boat to B. C. Special. At a later date, after corresponding with the Reverend Principal, you might let the Department know just what type of marine engine is required and intimate the suitable sources of supply that are on the list to receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In reply I beg to say I had written Rev. Mr. Jones, Principal, on October 20th, ultimo, asking him for particulars of the engine required for the boat in order that the Department might be furnished with this information.\n\nMr. Jones has today returned from Vancouver where he obtained prices and examined engines such as would meet the requirements of the boat under construction. He obtained prices on Easthope engines, of which type one suitable for the boat referred to would cost $1350.00. Another price obtained was for an engine of the Vivian marine type semi heavy duty two cylinder of 20 H.P. at $1150.00. The latter priced engine is the one desired by the Principal. A page from the catalogue of the Vivian Marine Works, 1090 West 6th Avenue, Vancouver, B.C., is sent herewith for the Department's examination and consideration. Rev. Principal Jones states that he will be quite satisfied to wait until after the close of the present fiscal year for delivery of this engine as the construction of the vessel has not yet reached the stage for the engine installation. He wishes me to thank the Department on his behalf for its kindly and generous treatment of his requisitions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEncl.\nP/AC\n\nG. C. Perry,\nAsst.

The total of the accounts received for the materials and fittings for this boat amounts to $903.74.\n\nI have also your No. 15/15/26640 of the 15th instant, regarding the account covering the cost of desks supplied for the new classroom. In letter referred to above from the former Commissioner, he states he took up with the Principal the question of the extra classroom and was informed that the cost, including lumber, desks and blackboards, would amount to a total of approximately $750. Accounts for the material and furnishings, including desks, have been received, and amount to a total of $844.43.\n\nI may say that the total sum provided in our Estimates for the current fiscal year for the boat and extra classroom was $1500, while the total expenditure for both purposes, as per accounts received, amounts to $1748.17. Accounts to this amount are being paid, but you will observe that no funds are left for the supplying of an engine for the boat. We are not aware when the boat will be completed and the engine required, but the purchase of the engine may have to remain over until after the beginning of the next fiscal year. In the meantime, however, you may, when the building of the boat is sufficiently advanced, forward an estimate of the cost of the engine, when consideration will be given as to whether funds for the purpose can be provided from our Estimates this year or not. If not possible to provide the funds this year, a note will be made to include the amount required in our Estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE\nP. O. BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., October 18, 1932.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter 159-2-5 of the 6th instant with reference to my voucher 86-A for $253.59 covering cost of Desks supplied for new Class Room at Ahousaht Indian School.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that these desks were bought for this School as soon as the new wing was ready. Instructions to this effect were left by Commissioner Ditchburn before he began his retiring leave.\n\nReferring to Mr. Ditchburn's letter 15/15/24952 of May 11th last, addressed to the Secretary it will be noted that he asked if money was available for \"Lumber, Desks and Blackboard\" for this building to an amount of $750.00 and although when the Authority to purchase was received (Your letter 159-2-5 of May 26, 1932) lumber only was mentioned it is presumed that Mr. Ditchburn understood that the Authority to purchase included all material asked for in his letter of May 11, 1932 and on that understanding left orders to purchase the desks from the Tait Pipe and Foundry Co. in Vancouver.\n\nThis same explanation also covers the purchase of Hardware and Blackboards as well as the hardware for the boat, voucher for which is being forwarded today.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAVH.\n\nC.C. Perry.\nAss't Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOctober 18, 1932\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith abstract of tender No. 67, from book No. 6, and Voucher No. 94-A in favor of McLennan, McFeely And Prior, Limited, Victoria, B.C., covering hardware for boat being built at Ahousaht Indian School, West Coast Agency, under authority of Departments Letter 159-2-5 of May 26th last. The delay in forwarding this Voucher was caused by the item \"l only #1498 Yacht Closet\" as this had to be brought from the East and the complete invoices were only received in this office today.\n\nThe tenders for the material for this boat were called for by Commissioner Ditchburn before he began his Retiring Leave and he left instructions that the orders were to be given to the firm quoting the lowest prices. This has been done and the voucher is attached hereto.\n\nWhen the building of this boat is sufficiently advanced the School Principal will be asked for a description of the engine required, and authority will be requested from the Department to call for tenders.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAVH.\n\nEnclosures.\n\nC.C.

The Inspector has drawn attention to the condition of the septic tank, which he states is broken and out of order. I have to request that you will forward a report regarding this matter. You should state whether it would be possible for the school authorities to have the septic tank placed in a good, serviceable condition. If not, you should state the work required to be done and the approximate cost.\n\nThe Inspector also recommends that treads be placed on the fire escapes to prevent slipping. He states that strips of hardwood would be satisfactory. It is considered that the school authorities could arrange to have these strips placed on the escapes without cost to the Department.\n\nHe further reported that the water pails which are used for fire protection purposes are empty. The Principal should see that these pails are kept full of water and ready for use when required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nVictoria, B.C., August 17, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith the report of Mr. Inspector Pragnell, dated July 30th, on his inspection of the West Coast Agency.\n\nSCHOOLS: AHOUSAHT.\n\nThe Inspector has made no recommendation as to the feasibility of a road to cost about $4000.00. He has not stated if the septic tank will be repaired by the school authorities; nor whether the fire escapes treads will be likewise provided.\n\nThe agent could be asked to obtain an estimate for the repair of the school floors, provided the Department desires to pay for such maintenance. The buildings are understood to be the property of the Women's Missionary Society of the United Church of Canada. In his last school inspection report, Inspector Barry pointed out that the buildings should be painted.\n\nC. C. Perry.\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nKamloops, B.C., July 30th, 1932.\n\nWEST COAST AGENCY INSPECTION REPORT.\n\nAHOUAHT RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL:\n\nI visited same in company with Mr. Agent Frost, and met the Reverend principal, Mr. Jones. This gentleman seems to be doing very good work under great difficulties. This is, to some extent, owing to the poor place originally chosen for the school site. In fact, as regards this, the best that can be said is that the view is good. Landing freight at this school is attended with considerable difficulty and I do not see how this can be rectified. The Principal suggests a road from the school to the reserve float, which would cost about $4000.00.\n\nThe Septic tank is broken and out of order. There is no lavatory accommodation in the boys' wing except outside. The fire extinguishers have been kept properly filled. The fire escapes should have treads put on the stairs to prevent slipping. Wood strips of hardwood would do. Water pails are empty.\n\nA playground is being drained by a deep cut. This was done in the form of relief work for the neighbouring village, and was welcome assistance. The floors in the whole building are going, and will soon need renewing. The manual training class room was in splendid order, this part of the children's work being particularly well done, and compares more than favorably with the larger schools. An outside class room was being enlarged.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell.\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nP. O. BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., November 7, 1932.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to forward herewith Voucher No. 109-A for $1.96 in favor of the Columbia Paper Company, Ltd., 996 Homer Street, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIn explanation of this account I would refer you to this office voucher No. 66-A of August 11th, 1932, for $124.53 covering blackboard, etc., forwarded for the Ahousaht Indian Residential School, Ahousaht, B.C., West Coast Agency. The attached Voucher is to cover the freight on this shipment as this amount was overlooked by the Columbia Paper Company when they submitted their account. Prepaid freight bills are attached hereto and if this account is found to be in order, I would ask that a cheque for the amount be sent to the Columbia Paper Company, Ltd., 996 Homer Street, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosures:\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to the Department's letter of September 10th, 1932, calling for a report on the notes made by Inspector Pragnell on his inspection of Ahousaht Indian Residential School.\n\nThe septic tank at Ahousaht school is still faulty, and in my opinion will never function properly, as the tank is located on too high a level to allow necessary fall for sewage solids these collect in the drains and cause stoppage. These drains have recently been taken up cleaned and relaid which will allow the present tank to function for a time, but a new tank will eventually have to be built on a lower level to allow proper fall for sewage. This could be done by relief labor under the Principal's supervision, necessitating only the cost of the material for tank construction and drains.\n\nThe bill of material needed for new septic tank is as follows:\n\n- Lumber for concrete forms. 1600 bd. feet. $32.00\n- Nails. 25 lb. $2.50\n- 32 sacks cement. (Landed at Ahousaht) $22.70\n- 100 feet 4\" Vitirified tile. $8.00\n- 1 4\" Y $0.50\n- 1 3 ft. 4\" iron soil pipe. $12.00\n- 2 4 ft. 4\" right angle elbows. $12.00\n\nTotal cost of materials. $147.70\n\nThe Rev. Principal calls for two Iron Manholes (frames and covers), but in my opinion cement Manhole covers will be satisfactory and will cost only a fraction of what iron covers would cost.\n\nThe stop strips for fire-escape treads have been put on.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 2, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, regarding the condition of the septic tank at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School. It is noted that, although the drains in connection with the present tank have recently been taken up, cleaned and relayed\u2014which will permit the tank to function for a time\u2014you consider it will be necessary to have a new tank built on a lower level, to allow a proper fall for sewage. The quantity of lumber, cement, etc., required in the construction of a new tank, together with the cost of same, has been noted.\n\nIf you can arrange for the purchase of the materials, as stated in your letter, in time to have the accounts covering the cost reach the Department before the end of the present fiscal year, March 31, next, approval is granted for you to make the purchase at the present time. The purchase should be made from a firm on the list to receive consideration and you should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost. These you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. It is noted that you estimate the cost of the materials required to be $147.70.\n\nThe labour in installing the new septic tank is to be carried out by the school authorities, without cost to the Department. It is considered that cement manhole covers will be satisfactory.\n\nIt is to be understood that, if the purchase of the materials cannot be made in time to have the accounts reach the Department for payment from our Appropriation for the present fiscal year, you are to refer the matter to the Department again. I may add that, as our Appropriation will likely be reduced for the coming fiscal year, it is doubtful if we would have funds to provide for the cost of the material. You should therefore give early attention to the purchase of the material referred to in your letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. E.

Simple in construction, and easy of operation all parts easy of access.\n\nLower Crank Case:\nRigid box type construction extended to carry reverse gear covers, which are removable. Entirely oil proof.\n\nUpper Crank Case:\nBox type construction, entirely closed with hand plates and gear covers, which are removable. Entirely oil proof.\n\nMain Bearings:\nBearings throughout are made of highest grade of nickel babbit. All bearings are of extreme long and large for the greatest possible bearing surface and minimum bearing pressure.\n\nThrust Bearings:\nThe thrust bearing is distributed between steel ball thrust collars on either side of the thrust bearing, which is bolted to the engine base. The entire thrust of the propeller on both ahead and astern motion is thus taken up by the engine casting.\n\nCrank Shafts:\nMade of best hammered steel, forged in one piece from special billets. Proportioned to Lloyd's rules for marine shafting.\n\nCylinders:\nHard, close grained cast iron, with ample metal provided for re-boring. The cylinder heads are cast separately, which gives complete accessibility whenever required. The cylinders and connecting rods can be easily lifted out of the engine. Ample water jackets, and large expansion spaces for accessibility. Interchangeable on engines of the same bore and stroke.\n\nExhaust Manifolds:\nCast iron. Water jacketed, and made in sections bolted together.\n\nIntake Pipe:\nCast iron.\n\nConnecting Rods:\nForged from Lloyd's test steel. Upper and lower bearings adjustable.\n\nPistons:\nCast iron, having four to six rings, according to the size of the engine, with lap joint. Rings are concentric shaped, and returned after cutting.\n\nFly Wheel:\nCast iron and spoked. Is of such weight and support so as to absorb all shocks of changing engine speeds.\n\nValves:\nMade of cast iron with high grade steel stems, and operate as noiselessly as possible, without over-heating. They are arranged so that they can be easily removed when necessary. The valve spring is of large diameter, so that it will maintain its strength indefinitely, and give a uniform opening.\n\nCam Shaft:\nCam shaft is driven from the crank shaft by spur gears through an intermediate gear, which revolves on an idle shaft rigidly fastened to the base. The intermediate gear is adjusted to allow for difference in the centre distances, caused by adjusting the crank shaft bearings.\n\nCams:\nAll cams are made of highest grade steel, case hardened. After hardened, the cams are tested and ground where needed for accuracy.\n\nCompression Release:\nThe compression is released by sliding the entire cam shaft by means of lever situated at aft end of engine.\n\nLubrication:\nThe oil system is by \"Manzill\" force feed oiler, feeding to all cylinders, and to the necessary main bearings, together with splash system in the base. The feed of oil is accomplished automatically, so that only the filling of the oil reservoir is necessary before a long trip.\nOur Guarantee\n\nAll goods of the Manufacturer shall be sold subject to the following guarantee, and none other:\n\nIf any part or parts, except as hereinafter specified, prove defective within one (1) year from date of purchase of engine FROM ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, and the purchaser shall forthwith communicate the facts to the VIVIAN GAS ENGINE WORKS, or any of its authorized Dealers, giving the name of the Dealer from whom the product was brought, the date of purchase, and shop number of the engine, and at the option of the Manufacturer, return part or parts for purpose of inspection, transportation charges prepaid to the Manufacturer at Vancouver, B. C., and if, upon examination by the Manufacturer, it shall appear that such alleged defect was not in fact due to misuse, negligence, accident, or natural wear and tear, the VIVIAN GAS ENGINE WORKS will furnish gratis, but not install, F.O.B. its factory, such new part or parts found defective.\n\nThis guarantee does not apply either directly or indirectly, to consequential damages of any nature whatsoever, nor to electrical or special equipment, not manufactured by the VIVIAN GAS ENGINE WORKS, as such equipment carries the direct guarantee of the respective Manufacturers of same.\nVIVIAN GAS ENGINE WORKS\nMANUFACTURERS OF\nMARINE ENGINES\n\nJanuary 1st, 1933\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Friends:\n\nI am now building two complete lines of Diesel Marine Engines.

A shed is needed for fuel storage, during the winter. I recommend consideration, if at all possible. Items Nos. 3 and 4 recommended. Re item No. 5, I recommend the supply of edge grain fir, as the value of the building does not, in my opinion, warrant expensive flooring.\n\nThis requisition was submitted to Mr. Assistant Commissioner Perry, in triplicate, and was returned to this office for further information and with instructions that it be submitted direct to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd. E. Frost\n\nEnc. 3.\nEEF/N.\n\nEd. E. Frost,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 7, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 267/34/A.2 of the 28th ultimo, relative to certain requests made by the Principal of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School for consideration when our Estimates for the next fiscal are being prepared.\n\nRegarding the request for 18 roller blinds, 30\" x 48\", I have to say that funds would be available at the present time to supply this equipment. It is noted that the cost will be approximately $22.00, and you may arrange for the purchase, from a firm on the approved list. The cost should be kept within your estimate. Please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, for payment.\n\nWith reference to the fire extinguishers and refills required, the Department would be prepared to provide the expenditure required in this connection. I would request that you state the number, condition, size and name of manufacturer of the extinguishers at present on hand and whether refills are required for each. You should also state the number and size of any new extinguishers which you would recommend be supplied. When this information is received, an order will be placed here.\n\nWhen the Estimates for the coming fiscal year are being prepared, consideration will be given to providing the funds required for supplying materials for a woodshed and for paint and varnish.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of the Department's letter of July 31st, 1934, re certain requests for expenditure made by the Rev. Principal of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School, and advising that the expenditures cannot be provided for out of the current year's Estimates and calling for a further report of such of the items as are considered necessary this year.\n\nI beg to advise the Department that I have discussed the matter with the Rev. Principal of that school and respectfully recommend items:-\n\n(1) Roller Blinds. $22.00\n(2) Material for wood shed. $200.00\n(3) Fire extinguishers and refills, cost unknown.\n(4) Paint and Varnish. $200.00.\n\nThe first three items are positively necessary and the fourth would save some expense in so far as it would cost more if allowed to stand over another year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd. E. Frost,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI should like to recommend that the Department provide a thick rope, at one end of which a large iron ring should be permanently fitted, so that in the event of fire the boys from the new dormitory would have a means of climbing out of one of the windows of their dormitory and reaching the rocks below in safety. The iron ring could be placed under one leg or a bed near one of the windows. At present the only means of escape from this new dormitory is by means of a light stairway on the outside of the building; and this staircase is nearest to the greatest fire hazard, the old brick down woodshed. Should the small boys have to jump from one of the windows they would be very seriously injured as the rocks are below the windows on the sea side of the building.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF G. H. BARRY,\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS, regarding his\nVISIT TO THE AHQUAHT Residential School,\non April 24th & 25th, 1934.\n\nOrig. on 159-2-6.\n\nUpper Landing: About five hundred square feet of\nV. joint sheeting and a dormer\ntype skylight are required to sheet in this upper\nlanding. The cost would be about $50.00 for material\nand the boys of the Manual Training Class could\neasily do the work. This dormer window would\ngreatly improve the ventilation of the main\nbuilding.\nBUILDINGS: The buildings are the property of the Women's Missionary Society of the United Church of Canada. Since my last report, the Manual Training Class, under supervision, has erected a second classroom, described on previous pages of this report, and a building consisting of a large Manual Training room on the ground floor and a Boys' Dormitory with accommodation for a supervisor's room on the first floor. This dormitory is 24 feet by 48 feet, with a 12 feet by 16 feet supervisor's room. The old woodshed which is falling down is only 12 feet from the wall of this new building. I consider this old woodshed more or less of a fire hazard, and should like to recommend its removal. A new woodshed could be erected by the Manual Training Class if they were provided with lumber for this purpose. This woodshed should be about 24 feet by 48 feet and should be erected at a little distance from the other buildings and not far from the sea. There is a perfectly suitable site available. The total cost of the lumber should be under $200.00; and I should only care to recommend this in the event of the Manual Training Class carrying out the work.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF G. H. BARRY, INSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS, re his inspection of the AHOUAHT RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, on April 24 & 25, 1934.\n\nOriginal on 159-2-6.\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nFire Protection: There are three soda type extinguishers. These ought to be refilled, and the Indian Agent has been communicated with in this matter by the Principal. There are also five small Fyrene extinguishers. Inside the building there are two hydrants with soda. The water supply is from a tank at one end of the building. This tank is on about the level of the roof of the main building and is about twelve feet in diameter and ten feet deep. There is not of course sufficient pressure to send water over the main roof of the school.\nOttawa, July 31, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, with reference to certain requests that you have received from the Principal of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department was unable to provide for these items in the current year's Estimates. However, you might let me have a further report, stating the items which you believe should receive consideration this year; and, when forwarding this information, you should give your reasons for recommending the expenditure. On receipt of your reply, the matter will be given further consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni,\nB.

There may be a further appropriation made by Parliament at the present session, under the Public Works Construction Act, but, at the present time, I am not aware what amount, if any, will be available to this Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMarch 12th,\n1935.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nAs you are aware, Rev. Joseph Jones, at present Principal of the Indian Residential School at Ahousaht, is being transferred on July 1st to Portage la Prairie. In the search for a new Principal, the Committee has found itself somewhat handicapped by the very limited accommodation provided for the Principal in the present school building. I am writing to request that the Department of Indian Affairs should consider the provision of a residence for the Principal at Ahousaht at the earliest possible date. If the money could be made available by the 1st April, while Mr. Jones is still there, as was done in the case of the host-house, the building could be put up for a comparatively small sum, perhaps, $5,000.\n\nI realize that it will be difficult to arrange this unless there is to be a Public Works Construction Act again this year and the Department of Indian Affairs is to share in it. The matter is of considerable urgency, if the high standard of work in the school is to be maintained.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MT\nOttawa, March 7, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing copy of a communication from the Principal of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School, regarding the repairs required to the engine of the lighting plant, necessitating an expenditure of approximately $200. It is noted that the Principal has ordered the repair parts.\n\nThe Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding $200.00, as stated above. I would request that you obtain an account, in triplicate, giving full details, from the firm which supplies the new parts. These accounts, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nIf possible, the account should reach the Department not later than April 10th, next, in order that payment can be made from our appropriation for the present fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to advise the Department that, the Kohler Lighting plant at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School, has broken down, necessitating an expenditure (estimated at $200.00 by the Rev. Principal Joseph Jones) for repairs and as the plant is urgently needed, the Rev. Principal has ordered the parts necessary and is hereby requesting authority from the Department for that amount, for the purpose stated.\n\nCopy of the Rev. Principal's letter is enclosed herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd. E.

Frost, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni.\n\nDear Sir-\n\nOne of the pistons in our engine of the Kohler lighting plant broke; this released the connecting rod, smashing the base and cylinder block.

These can be knocked out by means of the axes kept near the windows. I think these wire screens might well be removed, and the windows just fastened with string and wax seal.\n\n\"I would recommend that the fire escape on the boys' side of the school be continued by steps to the ground, a very simple thing for the manual training class to do if they had the material. On the girls' side the last flight of steps at least should be renewed and placed in a better position to give a more gradual slope and thus permit much wider steps. This escape should also be continued to the ground. The windows on the girls' side should also have the wire screens taken off and string and wax seal used.\n\n\"A wooden escape might well be constructed to a window in the new dormitory building. Iron escapes are not in my opinion necessary here. They are just as dangerous as wooden escapes though they look safer. If there is any fire near an escape, iron or wood, children will not come down it.\"\n\nPlease discuss the Inspector's suggestion with the Principal, and you might then supply an estimate of the cost of the material that would be needed. You will note from the above the Inspector considers that the manual training class can do the necessary work, without cost to the Department.\n\nI enclose, for your information, copy of departmental circular with reference to fire prevention and fire drill. Extra copies are being sent, which you should supply to the Principals of the Residential Schools in your agency. Upon the occasion of future visits to this school, you should see that our instructions are being carried out.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\nI went into the question of fire escapes and fire drills with great care. I noticed that my recommendation for a rope with an iron ring to fit under the leg of a bed had not been acted on in the new dormitory building. It is true that a second stairway has been constructed in that building, and the old wood shed removed.\n\nTo put it very bluntly, I AM NOT SATISFIED THAT PROPER FIRE DRILLS HAVE BEEN HELD AT THIS SCHOOL SINCE MY LAST INSPECTION. Fire drills have been held down the stairs, but I do not believe that the old wooden fire escapes have been used for a long time. There are two of these wooden fire escapes, one at each end of the main school building. Neither reaches to the ground. The steps on the girls' fire escape are so narrow that it is most dangerous for a child to come down. To make my inspection complete I managed to climb up this escape, but had difficulty in coming down and had in fact to face the escape and use it as a ladder. As the escapes do not reach within some eight feet of the ground I could not get down till a boy got a step ladder and helped me. Such a condition, I think, should be done away with for the sake of the children, even if the Department does not own the building. The exit from the dormitories to the escapes is by way of windows, which are covered with light wire screens. These can be knocked out by means of the axes kept near the windows. I think these wire screens might well be removed, and the windows just fastened with string and wax seal.\n\nI would recommend that the fire escape on the boys' side of the school be continued by steps to the ground, a very simple thing for the manual training class to do if they had the material. On the girls' side the last flight of steps at least should be renewed and placed in a better position to give a more gradual slope and thus permit much wider steps. This escape should also be continued to the ground. The windows on the girls' side should also have the wire screens taken off and string and wax seal used.\n\nI would ask the Department to provide the Principal with a copy of the regulations for fire drills, which the last Principal does not appear to have handed to Mr. Caldwell. I would also urge that when the fire escapes have been lengthened as suggested above and the one on the girls' side changed, regular drills be organized down the new escapes.\n\nA wooden escape might well be constructed to a window in the new dormitory building. Iron escapes are not in my opinion necessary here. They are just as dangerous as wooden escapes though they look safer. If there is any fire near an escape, iron or wood, children will not come down it.\n\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF MR. INSPECTOR BARRY, DATED MARCH 29th, 1936, ACCOMPANYING HIS REPORT.\n\nI held the usual fire drill and found that the children could only use the ordinary stairways from the dormitories, as they had not been trained to come down the wooden fire escapes. I made a thorough inspection of these fire escapes and my remarks are contained in the attached report. The expense of the usual iron escapes would be high and I feel that the wooden escapes here might easily be made safe and convenient to use. I believe that the Indian Agent might well be asked to make a report on this subject.\nOttawa, April 8, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 7th ultimo, with reference to your recent inspection of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School.\n\nWe are aware of the necessity for a new residence for the Principal, and this matter is now receiving consideration and you will be advised later.\n\nFor general repairs and improvements at this school there is slightly over $1,000 provided in the current year's Appropriation. Please let me have a detailed report stating in what manner you think this amount could be best expended. In making your estimate, you should not consider the Principal's residence, as this will be dealt with later.\n\nFor any improvement that you recommend, you should state the approximate cost of both the material and labour, and advise what tradesmen it will be necessary to engage.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nReport of Inspection of Ahousaht Indian Residential School, Feb. 17, 1936\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit the following observations on the Ahousaht School.\n\nFire Escapes and Protection:\nFire escapes are made of wood and attached to wooden building also a large water tank is suspended over the top of fire escape at rear of main building. This presents a very real danger to life and limb in addition to being of little or no value in case of fire.\n\nLaundry:\nSituated in a shaky outside building and consists of two antiquated washers and a worn out engine. These are constantly breaking down and are a source of annoyance and expense.\n\nMain Building:\nThe interior of the building needs complete renovation. Alterations are necessary in the kitchen and dining rooms, also the reception room and dormitories. The outside presents a pleasing appearance and is in good repair and is well painted.\n\nSanitation:\nSanitary arrangements leave much to be desired. There is only one bath tub, toilet and wash basin for the whole of the staff. No provision is made for the boys toilets upstairs which makes it necessary to provide pails for night use.\n\nGrounds:\nIn the vicinity of the school grounds are very well kept and clean. There is a large clearance which could, with the aid of a plough or small tractor be cultivated and would be sufficient to supply the school with vegetables, fruits and berries. There is also a very good and well constructed barn and stable where cows could be kept. The cultivation of this tract of land would be excellent training for the boys in addition to its value to the school.\nReport of Inspection of Ahousaht Residential School, Feb. 17, 1936.\n\n(Continued)\n\nPrincipal's Residence:\nOwing to school accommodation for use of the Principal being inadequate, he and his family have had to take up residence in temporary quarters above the workshops. It is understood that the Home Missions Board have the matter of a new residence before the Department and it is respectfully suggested that a residence be provided if possible.\n\nGeneral:\nIn submitting the foregoing report it is seen that the Principal, Mr. A. E. Caldwell is faced with a very real handicap. He is making heroic efforts to repair the buildings and has accomplished much in this direction. It must however be pointed out that any further expenditure on repair work would be a waste of money and it would, in the writer's opinion be advisable to have a very thorough inspection by a competent architect before making further expensive changes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nF.

The amount provided is $3,000 and this is the total that can be allowed for the purpose mentioned.\n\nPlease visit the Ahousaht School at an early date and discuss the matter with the Principal and report to the Department what action both of you consider should be taken in the erection of this building.\n\nYou should supply an estimate of the material required and, also, an estimate of the labour. In connection with the latter, do you consider that it would be possible to erect the residence by engaging a competent man as foreman and employ Indians? It is possible that this method would be cheaper than to build the residence by contract. Would it be necessary for the Department to forward a plan or would the Principal be in a position to assist in the supervision of the building? The Principal and yourself should consider this matter very carefully and you should report fully to the Department, keeping in mind, of course, that the amount mentioned in the first part of this letter must not be exceeded.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Plans and specifications have been prepared. The Agent estimates the cost of the building material and labour to be, approximately, $2,500; freight and hauling, $200; and miscellaneous items, $300.\n\nI should be pleased to receive your authority to incur the expenditure - the work to be carried out by day labour, in charge of a competent foreman. I would request, also, that you supply the name of the foreman-carpenter to be employed and the names of the firms at Port Alberni, the nearest source of supply, from whom the lumber and building materials should be purchased.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nApril 23, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of April 23, 1936, re the erection of a residence for the Principal of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School.\n\nIn obedience to your instructions I visited the school and went carefully into the matter with Mr. Caldwell.\n\nIt was decided that the best plan would be to engage a competent builder and employ Indian labor under the supervision of the Principal. Plans have been drawn up and specifications are herewith attached with estimated costs of material and labor. Lumber can be purchased locally which will be a saving on freight. Total estimated cost less freight charges would be $2501.50, leaving a balance of $488.50 for freight and haulage estimated at $200.00 and miscellaneous items $298.50.\n\nHoping this meets with the requirements of the Department and awaiting your further instruction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.B.

The woodwork as at present is very shabby and the room is very cold in winter.

I then consulted with Mr. A. W. Neill, M. P., and a list of dealers was drawn up which was agreeable to and recommended by him.\n\nAt the same time the matter of labor was taken up as instructed and the foreman was chosen by Mr. Neill.\n\nIn conversation with Mr. Neill today he informed me that he had inspected the work and was satisfied that it had been well carried out and that purchases had been made in the public interest.\n\nIn view of the excessive freight rates on the Coast it was found necessary to deal with the wholesale firms in order to keep the total cost within the appropriation.\n\nThe laundry building has not yet been commenced and I would respectfully request that authority be granted to purchase lumber from Knott Lumber Co. and sash and door from Lawrenson and Skipsey, these names having been approved by Mr. A. W. Neill.\n\nAll accounts to date in connection with the Principal's residence are being forwarded under separate cover. These almost complete the total which will not exceed $3000.00 inclusive of fire escapes.\n\nIt is regretted if any inconvenience has been caused unwittingly to the Department and I understand that Mr. Neill is writing to Ottawa in explanation of the change of dealers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 7, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOwing to certain fire hazard at the Ahousaht, Alberni and Christie Indian Residential Schools, it has been decided to make an allowance, at the rate of $40.00 per month, towards the salary of a night watchman at each school for the period from November first, next, to April 30, 1937. This is the same rate and for the same period as we provide grants for this purpose at a number of other schools, where there is fire hazard.\n\nYou should immediately request each Principal to obtain the services of a reliable man to carry out the duties as night watchman. He should make hourly visits during the night throughout the building and especially pay attention to the furnace room or where there is any danger of fire. Should it be necessary to pay a watchman more salary than the grant we allow, the school authorities will be responsible for payment of same, from per capita allowances or other receipts of the school.\n\nThe Department will rely on yourself and the Principals to see that this service begins as from November first, next. Payment of the allowance made by this Department towards salary of the watchman will be made at the end of each month, upon receipt of a voucher, in triplicate, from you. The voucher should be drawn, in the case of each school, as per the sample enclosed. Payment of the allowance will be made the Principals and not to the man employed, at each school.\n\nI would request that you communicate with the Department, stating the name and, briefly, the qualifications of the men who are engaged as night watchmen at each of the above named schools, and also the date they began duties. This matter should receive your immediate attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP. B. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\n\nEncl.\n\nR. J. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, October 7, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe attention of the Department has been called to the fire escape facilities at each of the Ahousaht, Alberni and Christie Indian Residential Schools.\n\nI would request that you furnish a report, in a separate communication, regarding each school, stating the fire escape facilities provided. You should state, also, if you would recommend that improvements be made in the present equipment or new escapes, of a different type, installed. Please give as full particulars as possible, after consulting the principals, regarding the fire escape facilities, and state if new escapes or improvements to the present ones are required. Full particulars should be given, regarding the type of any new escapes which you would recommend be installed, the approximate cost and the location on the building where they should be installed.\n\nOur funds are extremely limited, and it may not be possible to provide any new fire escapes this year; but, when we have your report, with an estimate of the cost, consideration will be given as to whether any improvements could be carried out at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP. B. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Alberni, B.C.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nOctober 7, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Neill:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, recommending the reconstruction of the main school building at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I would say the Department has no funds provided for any further work than has recently been carried out at this school. The Department is aware of the condition of the present building, but the matter of rebuilding will depend upon when funds for the purpose can be provided.\n\nRegarding fire hazard, I have to say that the local Indian Agent is being instructed to inform the Principal that the Department will provide him a grant, at the rate of $40 per month for the period from November first, next, to April 30, 1937, towards the salary of a night watchman. This is the same rate and the same period as we provide grants for this purpose at a number of other schools where there is fire hazard. This will cover the greater portion of the period during which the heating of the building is required.\n\nWith reference to your other communication of the same date, relative to the condition of the fire escapes at each of the Ahousaht, Alberni, Christie and Alert Bay Indian Residential Schools, I would say\n\nA. W. Neill, Esq., M.P.,\nAlberni,\nB. C.\nthat the local Indian Agents will be asked to furnish a report, together with an estimate of the cost of installing adequate fire escape facilities. The Department recognizes the importance of fire escape facilities of an adequate type at all Indian residential schools. However, owing to the many other urgent demands, it is difficult to obtain the funds necessary. When we have the report of the Agents, regarding the present equipment, every consideration will be given to carrying out improvements to the present fire escape facilities.\n\nI may add, also, that a grant will be provided towards the services of a night watchman at each of the Alberni and Christie Indian Residential Schools, for the same period and rate as will be allowed in the case of the Ahousaht School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nAlberni, B.C.,\nSeptember 28th, 1936,\n\nDr. H. McGill,\nDeputy Minister of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nI recommend that a report be obtained on the condition of the Ahouset Indian School.\n\nI think it should be rebuilt. It is out of date in every respect. The accommodation is insufficient, the sanitary arrangements poor. It is so constructed that the youngest children have to be housed in the third story dormitory. No night watchman and in case of a fire, the chances of getting the little ones out would be very poor.\n\nI would recommend that a carpenter should be asked to inspect it. There is a competent carpenter there now, W. Blinkemore, a building contractor. He is erecting the Principal's residence. If you wired on receipt of this letter, you would catch him before he left and save a lot of expense as compared sending a man up later on.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA.W. Hill.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nAlberni, B.C., September 28th, 1936.\n\nDr. H.W. McGill,\nDeputy Minister of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nMy attention has recently been called to the question of fire protection in the Indian schools in this District, more particularly as regards fire escapes.\n\nI would suggest that you ask for a full report from Mr. Ashbridge on the three boarding schools in his Agency and from Mr. Todd, on the one at Alert Bay. Have it recorded of what the fire escapes consist and what condition they are in.\n\nA wooden stairway attached at a steep angle to a wooden building and sure to be slippy if either wet or frosty is pretty poor protection. I think they should be furnished with chutes such as many hospitals are equipped with. They would lead away from the building and could therefore be used for a short time after the main building was on fire and being of metal, would not go on fire themselves, and would not be affected by the weather.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA.W.

We have also had discussions with the officials of the United Church of Canada, regarding the need of a new building. Besides, Mr. G. H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, in a report on his inspection of this school, dated March 29th, 1936, referred to the conditions existing in the building. His report was forwarded through the office of Mr. C. C. Perry, Assistant Indian Commissioner for British Columbia.\n\nThe Department, however, has no funds to consider the erection of a new building, and owing to the many demands for buildings and repairs at Indian residential schools where there is greater need, I am unable to state when it will be possible to provide the funds to erect a new building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nA.

That seems to me begging the question, not to say evading it. I never expected you to produce $20,000.00 to build a school this Fall, nor did I suggest it. What I suggested was that reports should be obtained from a competent carpenter, which might justify you including an item in your estimates for a new school next year, and I still think this should have been done, however, you state further that you are aware of the present condition of the building. Are you sure of that? If so, please send me copy of the report on which you base your knowledge, giving the name of the author and the date the inspection or report was made.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA. W. NEILL.\nOffice of the West Coast Indian Agency,\n\nOctober 14, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 498, amounting to $299.50 in favour of Lawrenson & Skipsey, Port Alberni, B.C., for materials for Ahousaht School, Ahousaht, B.C.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 159-2-5 dated June 15, 1936.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 518\nReport on condition of Fire Escapes and Fire Fighting Appliances at Ahousaht Residential School.\nOctober 20, 1936.\n\nFire Escapes.\nThe fire escapes at this school are of wood construction, and placed at either end of the building. Suspended over the top of one of these escapes is a large storage tank, supported by a wooden trestle. The steps of escape, being of wood, are slimy and dangerous. Orders have been given by myself to keep these sanded. Windows leading to these escapes, at a recent inspection, were found very difficult to open, especially in the small girls dormitory, which is located on the upper floor. These escapes, in the opinion of the writer, are not only worthless, but actually dangerous. Escapes have been recently overhauled and repaired, but are still unsatisfactory.\n\nPyrenes.\nThese are 4 large, and several small extinguishers, distributed about the main building. These are all in working order.\n\nFire Alarm.\nAlarm is sounded on a cook's triangle, which is also unsatisfactory, as the staff have not been properly trained in their respective duties.\n\nHose and Water Supply.\nBoth inadequate. In case of fire at this school, all efforts would have to be concentrated on the saving of life, as it is not considered that the building could be saved.\n\nRecommendations.\nIt is a very difficult matter for the writer to make recommendations involving any great expense. The school, which is not owned by the Department, does not warrant any outlay. The building is old and badly constructed. Stairways are narrow, and the rooms poorly laid out. In short, it is, in my opinion, nothing short of a fire trap. It is, of course, essential that the children be given every protection possible, and I would respectfully submit the following recommendations.\n\n1. That a wooden fire escape be placed leading from centre of building on the second floor approximately 5 feet to ground. Labor to be provided by school staff. Estimated Cost $100.00.\n\n2. That fire pails and axes be kept on each landing.\n\n3. That a gong be placed in lower hallway, with switch connection on each floor. Estimated Cost $50.00\n\nAs an additional protection to the children, it is further respectfully suggested that definite instructions be issued by the Department to myself, making me responsible for the training, and outlining of the duties of the watchmen at all schools.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nPEA/AM.\nOttawa, November 3, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st ultimo, reporting on the condition of the fire escapes and fire fighting appliances at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that the fire escapes located at the ends of the building are of wooden construction and become slimy and dangerous in wet weather. It is noted, also, that you have given the school authorities instructions to see that these escapes are kept sanded. You should have the Principal see that these instructions are carried out and also that the windows leading to these escapes are arranged so that they will open without difficulty.\n\nI have noted your recommendation, that a wooden fire escape be placed, leading from centre of building on the second floor - a distance of approximately 35 ft. to the ground. The Department will approve of you having this work carried out. It is to be understood that the labour in constructing the fire escape will be provided by the school staff. You may arrange for the purchase of the material, from firms on the approved list, at a cost not exceeding your estimate, viz.: $100.\n\nYou may arrange, also, to have a gong installed in the lower hallway, with a switch connection on each floor. The cost should not exceed your estimate of $50. Please arrange to have the above work carried out at an early date.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\nearly date, forwarding itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nThe school authorities should see that the fire extinguishers are kept in good working order and that fire pails and axes are kept on each landing.\n\nRegarding the services of a night watchman, you should, after consultation with the Principal of this school and with the Principals of the Alberni and Christie Schools, give definite instructions to the watchmen regarding the duties they should perform. They should be definitely informed of the regular periods at which they are to make their rounds of the buildings each night and they should be given any other instructions which the Principals and yourself consider necessary, in order that there will be a regular service maintained in patrolling the buildings. The Department will leave the matter of outlining the duties of the watchmen in the hands of yourself and the Principals.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

(RG 10, Volume 6430, file 876-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of Mr. Pratt's memorandum of February first and also letter received from Mr. A. W. Neill, M.P., attached thereto.\n\nMay I emphasize that the school at Ahousaht is the property, not of the Government, but of the United Church of Canada. We feel that, with the limited appropriations at our disposal, the government-owned institutions should have first claim for consideration. We feel that the criticism sent forward to Mr. Neill by the Principal of the Ahousaht School should have been directed to the church authorities. You may be interested to learn that when Dr. Dorsey and Dr. Cochrane, representing the United Church, visited the Department a few days ago, they expressed the view that, while a new building was needed at Ahousaht, they nevertheless were of the opinion that a new school building at Round Lake, Sask., was more urgently needed. Both these gentlemen were emphatic that, if a building programme was undertaken this year, the construction of a school at Round Lake should receive first consideration.\n\nWe feel that the information at our disposal in the Department is sufficient to convince us that a new school should be erected at Ahousaht, just as soon as funds are available for this purpose. Despite this fact, however, we can see no objection to the suggestion made by\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6430, file 876-5, part 3)\nmade by Mr. Neill, that an inspection of the school building, and particularly the fire escapes, be undertaken by a capable man, at an early date. As this is not a government-owned school, such inspection should be undertaken by the Church authorities. In the event of conditions being found serious enough to warrant the closing of the school, consideration would have to be given to the matter and the whole situation, in so far as educational facilities are concerned, carefully reviewed. The possibility of establishing a couple of day schools in the district could be carefully canvassed, or an attempt made to accommodate the pupils in other schools where space may be available. However, there are no funds for rebuilding available at the present time nor are any being provided.\n\nDirector.\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nFeb. 1, 1937\n\nDr. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs\n\nRUSH\n\nMr. A.W. Neill, M.P., is interested in the Indian Residential School at Ahousaht, and on January 25th I sent him a copy of the report made by Inspector Barry on March 28, 1936, also copy of the report of Mr. Phelan, Schools Division, on June 22, 1935.\n\nNote the letter attached now received from Mr. Neill, in which he again states that this building is unsanitary, improperly built and has insufficient accommodation, and in which he asks that a definite statement be obtained as to the present condition of the fire escape at the building, from every story.\n\nWill you please furnish a FULL REPORT.\n\nW.J.F.

(RG 10, Volume 6430, file 876-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, February 23, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your 1562/37/D of the 15th instant, with reference to the fire escapes at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection, I would refer you to the last paragraph of official letter of the 9th instant. The Department wishes to know definitely whether the fire escapes have been extended to reach the third floor in order that those occupying that floor may have reasonably easy means of egress. You should let me have a definite statement in this regard as soon as possible. If such provision has not been made, you will note that official letter of the 9th instant authorized you to immediately remedy this condition.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of February 9th, 1937, concerning condition of fire escapes at Ahousaht School.\n\nRegarding the old fire escapes, these did not reach to the ground, but have since been put in order. Since date of my report, the conditions complained about have been corrected, and the work on new escapes etc., authorized by the Department, will be proceeded with without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 9th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your report for the month of January and particular attention has been given to that section of the report which refers to the Ahousaht Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department approves the instructions you issued to the Principal in your letter of the 27th ultimo. Please communicate with him again, if you have not already done so, with a view to ascertaining if your instructions have been carried out. You should again point out to the Principal the necessity for keeping the basement clean and free of boxes and litter.\n\nIt has been brought to our attention that the fire escape only reaches to the second floor and, therefore, in the event of fire, it would be practically impossible for those on the third floor to evacuate the building. Please let me know if the information we have received is correct and, if so, you should instruct the Principal to immediately remedy this condition and, at the same time, report to the Department supplying a copy of your instructions to the Principal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\nWest Coast Agency,\nPort Alberni, B.C., Jan. 31, 1937\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit the regular monthly letter covering conditions within this agency for month ending January 31, 1937.\n\nRESPECTING AHOUZAHT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nAs stated on Form 217 attached, fire protection was not found to be satisfactory at this school. New escape, which was recommended, and approved by the Department, has not been commenced. No water pails, and the old escapes, while being sanded, were sanded over the ice on the steps. New gong has been installed in main building, but not in separate building used as a dormitory. Attention of the Principal has been directed to this condition, with instructions to have same corrected.\n\nSchool classrooms still badly in need of painting and renovation. Paint has been supplied, but not used. Grounds very untidy with litter and lumber; Basement very untidy, and dangerous as a fire hazard, owing to accumulation of boxes and litter.\n\nF. B. Ashbridge.\nIndian Agent.\nWest Coast Agency,\nPort Alberni, B.C.,\nJanuary 27, 1937.\n\nA. E. Caldwell, Esq.,\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School,\nAhousaht, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the instructions of the Department with respect to fire protection at Indian Residential Schools, and of a recent complaint regarding condition of fire escapes, the Department instructed me to make a survey and report resulting in authorization of new escapes, equipment, etc.\n\nI feel that I must direct your attention to the unsatisfactory condition of protection at your school, and request that new fire escape be installed immediately. Also that fire pails filled with water, also axes, be placed at vantage points. Gong should also be installed in the separate building, which is used as a dormitory. Furnace room must be kept clean, and free of boxes and litter. This latter should be the duty of the night watchman, who should also report to you any other fire hazard he may notice. Steps of old escapes must be kept free of ice, and sanded, and fire drills carried out at irregular hours without previous warning. I know that the weather has been unsuitable for the building of new escape, but must request that this work be proceeded with, to enable me to assure the Department that all possible protection is afforded to life, and property, at your school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP.

L. Barry, and survey of the Alberni school area was carried out also at this time. At both residential schools, the health of the pupils was good. Fire appliances were found to be in good order, and fire drills were carried out. Since date of the Inspector's visit, a new fire escape has been built at the Ahousaht School and new fire hose placed at Christie school.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit the regular monthly letter covering conditions within this agency for month ending June 30, 1937.\n\nThe Residential school at Ahousaht was thoroughly inspected, and it was agreed that the building is in bad condition and not worthy of further expenditure of Departmental funds. A special report on the school situation is being prepared, and it is understood that Mr. Inspector Pragnell will also report on this subject.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nWe visited and inspected this school. The new plank walk from the village (landing place) to the school, built by Indian labour is a big improvement. The dormitories and school in general were nice and clean and tidy. The fire escapes and fire fighting apparatus was in good order, though the former has no wooden stairs. It is greatly improved in this matter, but nothing that can be done prevents this old building from being a fire trap. Further, the water pressure is very poor and the well is getting very low. Again, here, there is no agricultural land available, that is to hand. To my mind it is not worth spending further money on this building, nor for that matter, rebuilding there at all. A day school would do here instead, buildings already ready. The old material could be given to Indians to improve their village.\n\nIf a new residential school is erected to replace the Alberni one, I think it should be built large enough to accommodate all the children of the United Church denomination. Of course, if a suitable site could be found, which I doubt, on the west coast itself, it might be preferential from the health point of view. However, no such good agricultural land all ready for use can be found as the old Alberni site, with water and electric light already available.

Geo. Dorey,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n250 Queen St. West,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose copy of a letter from Principal of the Ahousaht Residential School, Mr. A.E. Caldwell. This is, of course, in the West Coast Agency. This is, as you will see a request for additional grant towards the maintenance of that school. I enclose copy of an itemized estimate of what is required, and I wish to point out that I have reduced the original estimate by $700.00, having cut out $200.00 for paint and $500.00 for a stationary engine and barrel washer for the laundry. The estimate therefore, covers expenditure in plumbing, laundry, kitchen and chimney work.\n\nIndian Agent Asbridge points out that should the Department contemplate keeping this school open, extensive repairs must be carried out, and sanitary arrangements extensively altered, and states that under present conditions, the school is a menace to health and unfit to house children. You will note that the Principal of the school points out that it is a bad fire trap, although asking for this expenditure. It would appear to me if the Principal considers this condition so dangerous he should really ask that the school be closed, or at least ask his Church Superiors to inform the Department to this effect.\n\nPersonally I am of the opinion that the actual closing of this school should be very seriously considered by the Department. I have in view the fact, that should a bad fire occur there and if fatality take place, the Department and Government will undoubtedly have to bear the blame, anyhow in the eyes of the public, and that despite the fact that it might be presumed by us that the Principal of the School and\nand his Church authorities be thought to bear some responsibility in definite advice in the matter.\n\nMr. Ashbridge, the Indian Agent, too, in his communication to me states that it is in his opinion that the school should be entirely rebuilt or abandoned. I am inclined to concur in this myself. However, I have talked the matter over with School Inspector Barry to try to find out if there is any alternative should the Department incline to feel that they should not bear the responsibility of keeping this school open. The Inspector informs me that the children of Ahousaht Village could attend a day school at Ahousaht Residential school. By this I mean there is accommodation there that could be used as a day school. Further as the Principal has a good house it is probable that a day school teacher could reside there. This would take care of a considerable number of local children anyway. Some of the others from round about the canal belonging to the United Church now attending the Residential School at Ahousaht could be transferred to the United Church Residential School at Sardis. In this way I think there would be very few, if any children belonging to the United Church in this district who would not be accommodated in either the suggested day school at Ahousaht, the day school at Ucluelet, the day school at Alberni or the Residential school at Coqualeetza.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nfor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nGSP:MR\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nIndian Residential School,\nAhousaht, B.C.\nJune 25, 1938\n\nMr. P.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to my estimate of requirements for additions and repairs to the Ahousaht School, I am submitting an itemized approximate estimate of material and labour.\n\nMay I further emphasize that the enclosed estimate comprises expenditure which is absolutely necessary in order to carry on this school until arrangements are made for the proposed consolidation of educational facilities on the Coast. Any new machinery installed could be moved to a new location when necessary. At present, at the end of the term, our laundry equipment is completely out of commission and beyond repair.\n\nThe suggestion to build a laundry building away from the well, which is our source of water supply, and also draining into a ditch leading to the shore, thus removing the laundry waste from the septic tank system, would appear as the only solution in amending the present sanitary conditions, which Dr. McQuarrie, on his recent visit and inspection here, described as \"terrible\".\n\nWith the prospect of carrying on this school for possibly another two years, with the excessive fire hazard of old and poorly constructed older buildings, the condition of which, in regard to fire risk, has frequently been reported by all visiting officials, the responsibility of the Principal becomes a very heavy one. While every precaution is taken at all times, and extraordinary measures are taken to ensure safety, and these precautions will continue to be taken as long as the necessity exists, I would wish to have my protest regarding the conditions of fire hazard at this school placed on official record.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"A.E. Caldwell\"\n\nPrincipal.\n\nThe estimate of costs herein is approximate and perhaps low. May I request that allowance be made for this in the appropriation. Should anything require to be cut, the paint for the exterior of the unpainted buildings $60.0 could be eliminated.\n\nMay I request that, if possible, facilities be arranged for having much of the requested done before the opening of the school, Sept 1.\nPlumbing:\n2 Closets in boy's basement, complete 75.00\n1 \" in \" Dorm. @ $25.00\n5 Wash lavatories @ $12.00 60.00\nPlumbing fixtures and pipe estimated 50.00\nLabour, estimated 50.00\n\nLaundry:\n1 heater for water 50.00\nInstallation of shafting etc. in new bldg.

Caldwell\"\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit the regular agency letter covering conditions within this agency during month ending June 30th, 1938.\n\nAhousaht Residential School\n\nBake ovens are burnt out. Floors are worn, uneven and dirty. Foundations are rotten and dangerous. The building, which is of cedar, is dry and badly constructed. Bathing facilities are almost non-existent.\n\nThe principal, Mr. Caldwell, asks for expenditure of about $2000.00 for improvements but, as before reported, it is not felt that any expenditure would be warranted, as to put the school in satisfactory condition would mean completely rebuilding.\n\nThis also would not be warranted, as the present site is not suitable due to poor water, and close proximity to the reserve. A special report on this school is being forwarded to Major D.M. MacKay.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nWest Coast Agency,\nPort Alberni, B.C., June 30, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit the regular agency letter covering conditions within this agency during month ending June 30th, 1938.\n\nAhousaht Residential School\n\nThis school is now closed for summer vacation, and the children all away.\n\nInspection of this school reveals a very sorry state of affairs. As reported on several occasions, this building can only be described as a fire trap and a menace to health.\n\nSanitary arrangements are best described by Dr. McQuarrie, who accompanied me, as being \"terrible\". Laundry equipment is worn out and useless, as is the case with the motive power.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge.\nIndian Agent.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nIn the absence of Dr. Dorey on vacation, there has come to my desk your letter of August 6th, enclosing copy of communication to you from the Indian Commissioner in Vancouver in reference to the Ahousaht Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply, I think we must admit that the condition of the building at Ahousaht is far from what it ought to be, and the Principal has told us, also, that it is a bad fire-trap. Under these circumstances, I can quite understand that the Government hesitates to spend very much money on repairs. We are inclined to agree with the opinion of Mr. Ashbridge that the School should either be entirely rebuilt or abandoned.\n\nOn the other hand, the information we have about the situation on the West Coast makes it impossible for us to agree that the Ahousaht Residential School should be abandoned without the building of another residential school for the United Church on the West Coast at some other point. We do not think that all our children could be looked after by the residential schools now in existence, nor that it is reasonable to expect that children from the West Coast could all be accommodated at Coqualeetza. We hope that before the Government thinks of abandoning the present school at Ahousaht, it will decide that a new school should be built for the United Church at some suitable point on the West Coast.\n\nDr. Dorey and I will be glad to discuss this matter further the first time we are in Ottawa.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nR.B.C.M.T.\n\n(Dictated by Dr. Cochrane, but signed in his absence)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6430, file 876-5, part 4)\nPort Alberni, B.C., Sept. 30, 1938.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON WEST COAST AGENCY FOR SEPTEMBER 1938.\n\nAt Ahousaht Residential school much has been done to remedy the unfavorable conditions reported from time to time. In the main building the walls have been covered and decorated making the building warmer and more sanitary.\n\nThe laundry has been moved to another building, away from the well and drained to a ditch leading to the sea instead of to the septic tank, as formerly. New toilets are to be installed, also another bath for the boys and more lavatory basins are being provided.\n\nGrounds are being cleaned up and made more attractive. In brief, a complete transformation is being effected.\n\nFire drill was carried out at this inspection, and was satisfactory in so far as evacuation of building was concerned.\n\nWater pressure is too low to be of any value, but all appliances, escapes, etc. are in good order. Children are all healthy and well fed, and making good progress under the new teachers.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nEXD.\n\nAugust 11th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo enclosing correspondence from the Principal of the Ahousaht Residential School.\n\nWith reference to the suggestion contained in the last paragraph of your letter to the effect that this school be closed, the matter was taken up with the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada, and they reply in part as follows:\n\n\"On the other hand, the information we have about the situation on the West Coast makes it impossible for us to agree that the Ahousaht Residential School should be abandoned without the building of another residential school for the United Church on the West Coast at some other point.

(RG 10, Volume 6430, file 876-5, part 4)\nAhousaht Residential School.\n\nThis school has been much improved by lining the inner walls and the addition of much needed plumbing, but at best it cannot be considered a safe or sanitary building. Pupilage is at its safe limit and, while all precautions are taken to prevent fire, I cannot feel assured of the safety of the children, as the buildings in which they are housed are old, dry and decayed, with narrow dark stairways. Escapes are in good repair and all equipment is in good order. I am nevertheless convinced that, should fire occur in the night, very few would escape. A very conscientious and careful watchman is employed and on duty at all times, and fire drills are carried out.\n\nDuring the month there were 32 children confined to bed with Influenza and Tonsilitis, which appeared to be general throughout the school.\n\nKitchen, dormitories, classrooms and grounds were clean and tidy. Meals are ample, well cooked and varied.\n\nClass registers were not posted, and teachers were instructed to keep these up to date.\n\nMany pupils had the appearance of slovenliness in habits and dress, and two cases of scabies were noted. It is felt that a weekly lecture on personal hygiene would be helpful to Indian children, who are by nature untidy, and in many instances dirty in their habits.\n\nP.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nThe Board recommends payment of $34,575.00 from Vote 163, Main Estimates 1939-40, in the amounts detailed hereunder, for the purchase and maintenance of equipment, and repairs and improvements to the church-owned Indian Residential Schools named:\n\n| Schools                                      | Amount |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| **Quebec**                                   |        |\n| Fort George Roman Catholic Residential School | $300   |\n| Fort George Church of England Residential School | $300   |\n| **Ontario**                                  |        |\n| Spanish Roman Catholic Residential School    | $1,500 |\n| **Saskatchewan**                             |        |\n| Thunderchild Roman Catholic Residential School | $800   |\n| **Alberta**                                  |        |\n| Ermineskin Roman Catholic Residential School  | $2,950 |\n| Grouard Roman Catholic Residential School    | $3,200 |\n| Holy Angels Roman Catholic Residential School | $500   |\n| Joussard Roman Catholic Residential School   | $2,000 |\n| Sturgeon Lake Roman Catholic Residential School | $1,500 |\n| Vermilion Roman Catholic Residential School  | $500   |\n| Wabasca Roman Catholic Residential School    | $3,000 |\n| Wabasca Church of England Residential School | $1,000 |\n| Whitefish Lake Church of England Residential School | $900 |\n| Youville (St. Albert) Roman Catholic Residential School | $300 |\n| **Northwest Territories**                    |        |\n| Aklavit Roman Catholic Residential School    | $700   |\n| Aklavit Church of England Residential School | $500   |\n| Fort Resolution Roman Catholic Residential School | $700 |\n| Providence Mission Roman Catholic Residential School | $2,600 |\n| **British Columbia**                         |        |\n| Ahousaht United Church Residential School    | $500   |\n| Cariboo Roman Catholic Residential School    | $1,200 |\n| Christie Roman Catholic Residential School   | $1,100 |\n| Kitammat United Church Residential School    | $500   |\n| Port Simpson United Church Residential School | $500   |\n| St. Mary's Mission Roman Catholic Residential School | $2,525 |\n| Unallotted                                   | $5,000 |\n\n$34,575.\n\nE.

Meals were good, well cooked and varied.\n\nFire drills had not been carried out, and the principal was instructed to do so immediately and regularly. The pupilage at this school is 68, and it is strongly recommended that it be not permitted to exceed 70, as the overflow from the main residence are housed over the workshop in a frame building, not equipped with fire escapes, except ropes from the windows.

The Agent can be relied upon to provide this assistance only in cases where actual need exists.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have read with care the Indian Agent's report on the Ahousaht Indian Residential School fire. It is not necessary for me to make any remarks with regard to Mr Ashbridge's report, as far as this deals with the actual fire.\n\nOn the second last page of the Indian Agent's report under the heading of \"Day School\" Mr Ashbridge recommends the expenditure of some $90.00 for material and labour to place the existing classrooms in a fit state for carrying on of a day school at Ahousaht.\n\nIn a previous report I explained that the classroom building at Ahousaht consists of two small classrooms, about one half mile from the Indian village. I further explained that these old buildings were of little use and that a new day school should be erected on a site in front of the actual Indian village of Ahousaht.\n\nIt will however take some time to have the new school erected, and put into operation. I am therefore prepared to recommend the expenditure of the $90.00 suggested by the Indian Agent so that the local children may have academic instruction for the balance of the present school year, to June 30th 1940. The buildings are not however suitable for a permanent Indian day school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nAGENT'S REPORT ON FIRE\nAHOUAHT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nNotification of Agent.\nAt 6:30 p.m. on January 26th, 1940, I was notified by long distance telephone, relayed by the telegraph operator at Matilda Creek, that the Ahousaht Indian Residential School was on fire.\n\nAt my request, he phoned me again at 9 p.m., that the school was completely destroyed, but that no one was hurt.\n\nAt noon, January 27th, I received a wire (attached) from Mr. Caldwell, stating that some of the children were being sent down on the C.P.R. boat.\n\nNotification of Department.\nAt 9 a.m., January 27th, I phoned Major D.M. MacKay all available particulars of the fire, also wired the Department at Ottawa.\n\nDisposal of Evacuated children.\nOn arrival of C.P.R. boat at Port Alberni I met the children, in charge of Mrs. Preese, Kitchen Matron, and made arrangements for their care. Those going further south were put in charge of a responsible Indian, and proceeded to Port Renfrew, as the seas were too rough to permit of their landing at Clow-0858.\n\nAction taken by Agent.\nAt 11 p.m. January 29th, 1940, I left for Ahousaht on M.V. \"Duncan Scott\", arriving at noon, being met on arrival by the Principal, Mr. A.E. Caldwell.\n\nInspection of damage.\nInspection of the site showed complete destruction of the main building, nothing remaining but cement posts and one brick chimney, and nothing to indicate possible cause of origin of fire.\n\nConstruction of Main Building.\nThe destroyed building was of wood frame construction with shingle roof. Building was very old and dry, being partially built of cedar, and was considered to be a fire hazard. Heating was by furnace situated in the basement, and by stoves in the sitting room and kitchen.\n\nElectric light was supplied by school plant. Wiring was all protected to conform to requirements.\n\nProbable cause of fire.\nThe theory advanced by Mr. Caldwell as to cause of fire was that of spontaneous combustion caused by accumulation of cedar dust between walls. This, however, is doubtful, as the fire commenced in the upper dormitory on the girls' side of the building, where it would not be exposed to heat from the chimney, or to dampness.\nAgent's Report on fire at Ahousaht Residential School. (cont.)\n\nProbable cause of fire.\n\n(cont.)\n\nI would rather think that it was caused by exposed wiring, or a defect in wiring. My reason for this lies in the history of the fire, as given by Mr. Caldwell and other members of the staff.\n\nMr. Caldwell relates that, about 5:45 p.m. on date of the fire, he noticed that the lights were \"jumpy\" and subsided to a dull glow. Thinking that the wires may have become crossed, he immediately stopped the engine.\n\nMeantime, Mrs. Preece, the Kitchen Matron, noticed smoke issuing from the upper dormitory and turned in the alarm, and also notified the watchman.\n\nMr. Caldwell attempted to control the fire with an extinguisher without success.\n\nVillagers gave every assistance, but the supply of water was inadequate to cope with the situation, and the building was completely destroyed within the hour.\n\nIt will be noted that the fire did not start in proximity to the chimneys, and that no inflammable material was stored in or near the building.\n\nEvacuation of Children.\n\nFortunately there was only one child in the dormitories at the time, and she was taken out by Mrs. Sainsbury. The remaining seventy pupils were in the dining rooms on the ground floor, and filed out to a safe place.\n\nOwnership of Building.\n\nThe building was the property of the United Church Missions.\n\nInsurance.\n\nInsurance was carried on the building, amount unknown, as the policy was not in the possession of the school authorities.\n\nFire Loss.\n\nThe total loss due to the fire was:\n\nMain Building - value approx. $5000.00\n\" Equipment and stores $2000.00\nDamage to Class rooms $100.00\n\" Power House $10.00\n\nGovernment Property Loss.\n\nThe following is the loss of government property, as listed in the annual property return:\n\nPyrene extinguishers 5 value $60.00\nSewing Machines 1 \" $15.00\nManual Training Tools \" $30.00\nAgent's Report on fire at Ahousaht Residential School.

Of these, thirty were sent to their homes at various points on the Coast, and the remainder to their homes at Ahousaht. Children belonging to Ucluelet and Alberni have been entered at the day schools at these points, leaving forty at Ahousaht without a school, and approximately twenty at other points.\n\nSchool Staff.\n\nOf the school staff, the Kitchen Matron, one teacher and the watchman have left, the remainder having taken up residence in the Principal's house, pending instruction from the Women's Missionary Society Headquarters.\n\nSchool Accounts, Books and Records.\n\nBooks and accounts in connection with school revenue and disbursements were saved and available for audit.\n\nRecommendations.\n\nIn view of the number of children now without a school, it is respectfully recommended that a temporary day school be opened at Ahousaht to care for the forty pupils there.\n\nDay School.\n\nThe class rooms can be put in first class order for a very small sum. All that is required being 24 windows, 24 x 24, and a few bundles of shingles, approximately costing $90.00, including labour. The teacher remaining could occupy the residence, which is the property of the Department. All the desks were saved, but a supply of books and school supplies would be needed.\n\nAs before mentioned, some ten of the remainder are already in day school, and the balance, twenty in number, will be taken care of as soon as the new school at Alberni is completed.\nAgent's Report on fire at Ahousaht Residential School. (cont.)\n\nSchool Nurse.\n\nThe school nurse, Mrs. M.E. Griffin, is remaining, pending instructions, and I would recommend that she be retained at Ahousaht until the end of March, as she is doing valuable work in the village and can be of great assistance with the day school, if such is approved.\n\nRemarks.\n\nAs this school was the property of, and conducted by, the Church, care was taken to avoid too close inquiry except in so far as loss of Government property and care of pupils was concerned.\n\nToo much credence was not placed upon comments and theories advanced by different people, as all were more or less laboring under excitement and strain.\n\nIt is however my opinion that faulty wiring was the cause. It will be noted from my reports on this school that, due to its condition, I have at all times stressed the importance of fire drills and the upkeep of escapes.\n\nThanks to the discipline of the children, no one was lost or hurt.\n\nGreat credit is due to Mrs. Freece, Kitchen Matron, Mrs. Griffin, Nurse, and Mrs. Sainsbury, Sewing Matron, whom I am informed were instrumental in giving the alarm, evacuating the school, and mustering the pupils in a place of safety.\n\nIn conclusion I would respectfully request that authority be granted to expend up to the amount of $200.00, for the purpose of supplying clothing, bedding, etc. at discretion, in cases where hardship is being experienced due to influx of children in homes unprepared for them, and where parents are not in a position to supply necessities.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

Those going further south were put in charge of a responsible Indian, and proceeded to Port Renfrew, as the seas were too rough to permit of their landing at Clo-oose.\n\nAction taken by Agent.\nAt 11 p.m. January 29th, 1940, I left for Ahousaht on M.V. \"Duncan Scott\", arriving at noon, being met on arrival by the Principal, Mr. A.S. Caldwell.\n\nInspection of damage.\nInspection of the site showed complete destruction of the main building, nothing remaining but cement posts and one brick chimney, and nothing to indicate possible cause of origin of fire.\n\nConstruction of Main Building.\nThe destroyed building was of wood frame construction with shingle roof. Building was very old and dry, being partially built of cedar, and was considered to be a fire hazard. Heating was by furnace situated in the basement, and by stoves in the sitting room and kitchen.\n\nElectric light was supplied by school plant. Wiring was all protected to conform to requirements.\n\nProbable cause of fire.\nThe theory advanced by Mr. Caldwell as to cause of fire was that of spontaneous combustion caused by accumulation of cedar dust between walls. This, however, is doubtful, as the fire commenced in the upper dormitory on the girls' side of the building, where it would not be exposed to heat from the chimney, or to dampness.\nAgent's Report on fire at Ahousaht Residential School. (cont.)\n\nProbable cause of fire. (cont.)\n\nI would rather think that it was caused by exposed wiring, or a defect in wiring. My reason for this lies in the history of the fire, as given by Mr. Caldwell and other members of the staff.\n\nHistory of the fire.\n\nMr. Caldwell relates that, about 5:45 p.m. on date of the fire, he noticed that the lights were \"jumpy\" and subsided to a dull glow. Thinking that the wires may have become crossed, he immediately stopped the engine.\n\nMeantime, Mrs. Preese, the Kitchen Matron, noticed smoke issuing from the upper dormitory and turned in the alarm, and also notified the watchman.\n\nMr. Caldwell attempted to control the fire with an extinguisher without success.\n\nVillagers gave every assistance, but the supply of water was inadequate to cope with the situation, and the building was completely destroyed within the hour.\n\nIt will be noted that the fire did not start in proximity to the chimneys, and that no inflammable material was stored in or near the building.\n\nEvacuation of Children.\n\nFortunately there was only one child in the dormitories at the time, and she was taken out by Mrs. Sainsbury. The remaining seventy pupils were in the dining rooms on the ground floor, and filed out to a safe place.\n\nOwnership of Building.\n\nThe building was the property of the United Church Missions.\n\nInsurance.\n\nInsurance was carried on the building, amount unknown, as the policy was not in the possession of the school authorities.\n\nFire Loss.\n\nThe total loss due to the fire was:\n\nMain Building - value approx. $5000.00\n\" Equipment and stores $2000.00\nDamage to Class rooms $100.00\n\" Power House $10.00\n\nGovernment Property Loss.\n\nThe following is the loss of government property, as listed in the annual property return:\n\nPyrene extinguishers 5 value $60.00\nSewing Machines 1 \" $15.00\nManual Training Tools \" $30.00\nGovernment Property Not Destroyed.\n\n| Item                        | Value   |\n|-----------------------------|---------|\n| Residence Building          | 3000.00 |\n| 1 Light Plant Engine        | 200.00  |\n| 2 Pyrene Extinguishers      | 24.00   |\n| 200 ft.

Of these, thirty were sent to their homes at various points on the Coast, and the remainder to their homes at Ahousaht. Children belonging to Ucluelet and Alberni had been entered at the day schools at these points, leaving forty at Ahousaht without a school, and approximately twenty at other points.\n\nSchool Staff.\n\nOf the school staff, the Kitchen Matron, one teacher and the watchman have left, the remainder having taken up residence in the Principal's house, pending instruction from the Women's Missionary Society Headquarters.\n\nSchool Accounts, Books and Records.\n\nBooks and accounts in connection with school revenue and disbursements were saved and available for audit.\n\nRecommendations.\n\nIn view of the number of children now without a school, it is respectfully recommended that a temporary day school be opened at Ahousaht to care for the forty pupils there.\n\nDay School.\n\nThe class rooms can be put in first class order for a very small sum. All that is required being 24 windows, 24 x 24, and a few bundles of shingles, approximately costing $90.00, including labour. The teacher remaining could occupy the residence, which is the property of the Department. All the desks were saved, but a supply of books and school supplies would be needed.\n\nAs before mentioned, some ten of the remainder are already in day school, and the balance, twenty in number, will be taken care of as soon as the new school at Alberni is completed.\nAgent's Report on fire at Ahousaht Residential School. (cont.)\n\nSchool Nurse.\n\nThe school nurse, Mrs. M.B. Griffin, is remaining, pending instructions, and I would recommend that she be retained at Ahousaht until the end of March, as she is doing valuable work in the village and can be of great assistance with the day school, if such is approved.\n\nRemarks.\n\nAs this school was the property of, and conducted by, the Church, care was taken to avoid too close inquiry except in so far as loss of Government property and care of pupils was concerned.\n\nToo much credence was not placed upon comments and theories advanced by different people, as all were more or less laboring under excitement and strain.\n\nIt is however my opinion that faulty wiring was the cause. It will be noted from my reports on this school that, due to its condition, I have at all times stressed the importance of fire drills and the care of passages.\n\nThanks to the discipline of the children, no one was lost or hurt.\n\nGreat credit is due to Mrs. Preece, Kitchen Matron, Mrs. Griffin, Nurse, and Mrs. Sainsbury, Sewing Matron, whom I am informed were instrumental in giving the alarm, evacuating the school, and mustering the pupils in a place of safety.\n\nIn conclusion I would respectfully request that authority be granted to expend up to the amount of $400.00, for the purpose of supplying clothing, bedding, etc., at discretion, in cases where hardship is being experienced due to influx of children in homes unprepared for them, and where parents are not in a position to supply necessities.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

It is noted that these can be secured for a price of $26.79.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to supply the raincoats mentioned in your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith a request, dated the 11th instant, received from Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge to expend approximately $120 on gum boots and raincoats for twenty-seven pupils of the Ahousaht Indian Bay School, together with quotations from the following:\n\n|                | Boots   | Raincoats |\n|----------------|---------|-----------|\n| Jones Tent & Awning Co. | $47.05  | $92.15    |\n| Gutta Percha & Rubber Co. Ltd. | $8.79   |           |\n| J. Leckie Co. Ltd.       | $7.51   | $6.64     |\n\nIn this connection, I would refer to my letter of June 11, 1940, enclosing report of Mr. Inspector Barry and Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge stating that owing to the considerable distance from the Indian village of the building owned by the United Church and the almost constant rainfall in this locality, its use for this purpose could not be recommended. As the children's parents are unable to provide them with the necessary protection and the children are at present compelled to sit in wet clothing, which is likely to affect their general health, I would recommend favorable consideration of the application and purchase from the firms submitting the lowest tenders for the respective items.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWest Coast Agency,\nPort Alberni, B.C.,\nFebruary 11, 1941.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to our recent conversation re the supplying of rain clothing for Ahousaht school children, during which you thought this may be given consideration.\n\nIn view of the distance these children have to walk, the prevailing wet weather, and the uncomfortable condition of the school, I would respectfully recommend that a certain amount of rain clothing be supplied, the same to remain the property of the school for the use of children attending regularly.\n\nAttached please find a list of school pupils, with ages and sizes. I would suggest that knee gum-boots, slickers and sou'westers would be the most suitable, and these could be obtained in Vancouver at a very reasonable cost.\n\nWhile this may be establishing a precedent, it is thought that local conditions would warrant the expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPBA/AM\n\nF.

C. Perry, Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith my report on the Ahousaht Indian Residential School, West Coast Agency, which I inspected on April 24th and 25th last. As explained in previous correspondence the delay in forwarding this report was caused by my absence on inspection duties in the northern part of the Province.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Barry.\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nON\n\nAHOUAHT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n(West Coast Agency.)\n\nNumber of pupils in residence\nBoys..................31.\nGirls..................32.\n\nNumber of classrooms and number of desks in each...Two; with 26, and 40 Desks.\nNumber of classes and number of pupils in each class. Please see Classification.\n\nTHE STAFF\n\nPrincipal's name......Rev. Joseph Jones.\n\nClassroom Teachers (Name, age and qualifications of each should be separately stated)\n\nStanley Bailey...Age 21; Trained Vancouver Normal School.\nHolds B.C. Interim Second Class Certificate, and Provincial Summer School certificates for Rural & Indian Work, and for Music, 1932. Experience of two years here.\n\nMiss K. Hockin, B.A., Age 23; Trained in Teachers' Training Course U.B.C. and holds an Interim Academic B.C. Certificate. Experience of one year here.\n\nRemarks relative to the methods employed by teachers...\n\nThe general methods adopted by these teachers are very satisfactory.\nThe whole atmosphere of this school is in advance of our other B.C. Indian Schools.\nMr. S. Bailey is training into a very fine young teacher indeed.\nHe is adapting Summer School methods to work in this school.\nOf the five candidates for High School Entrance prepared by this teacher I may now report July 31st, 1934, that all five were successful in the Provincial Examination at the end of June. All received quite high marks; I have nothing to suggest at the present time having taught a number of short Demonstration Lessons while at the school.\n\nApril 24th & 25th, 1934.\n\nNOTE:-This form to be used for Indian Residential Schools only.\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nForm No. 141\nCLASSROOM\n\nCondition of Classrooms (Ventilation, light, etc.)\n\nA second classroom has been added to the original classroom building since my last report. This new classroom was entirely constructed by the boys under the supervision of the Principal and Mr. Bailey. It is a very fine little classroom indeed and reflects very great credit on all concerned.\n\nThe inside has been nicely finished in some sort of three ply material, and well made lockers constructed for materials and books. The new single desks are well arranged.\n\nThe classrooms are well ventilated, and electric light is available when required. Heating is by means of wood burning stoves.\n\nClassroom Register (Is a careful tally made morning and afternoon?)\n\nThe classroom Registers are kept with care.\n\nReport on School Work.\n\nJunior Room: Teacher Miss K. Hocking. 40 Desks.\n\nAll Day Class. Grade 5; Grade 4A; Grade 4B; Grade 3; Grade 2; Grade 1A; Grade 1B. Total: 28.\n\nReading: Grade 1B know about 50 words and are now at work on \"Two Little Indians.\" This is a very good little group and they certainly have been well taught from the Blackboard. Grade 1A are near the end of the Canadian Reader Book I. They had previously read \"Two Little Indians.\" Another good group who can read well. Grade 2 are doing very good work in the Second Canadian Reader, as are Grade 4A and Grade 5 in the Fourth and Fifth Canadian Readers.\n\n(Under this heading the Inspector should report upon the classroom activity generally and offer any suggestions for improvement.)\n\nArithmetic: Grade 1B can read and write numbers and can add. Grade 1A are \"Good\" at the Combinations and Separations up to 20. Grade 2 can add and subtract. These children have not followed the best method in learning this work; but the work is known. Grade 4B are at work on Multiplication by two and three figures, and should be able to complete Long Division by the end of the School Year. Grade 4A is reviewing Long Division, and Grade 5 is at Fractions. In the All Canada Test, Grade 4B made a Mid Score of 20, the Norm for the Grade being 18. Grade 4A made a Mid Score of 22, the Norm for the Grade being 21. Grade 5 made a Mid Score of 26, the Norm for that Grade being 27.\n\nAchievement: In the B.C. Achievement Test which covers all the school subjects Grade 5 made a Mid Score of 33, the Norm being 39.1. This is only a little below average.\n\nArt: Work is on display. The work seems to be very well done.\n\nGeneral: The Blackboards were full of suitable seat work. The teacher had a Time Table and knew just what she hoped to cover in the lessons taught. The Sand Table was in use.\n\nThe teacher's control of the class was \"Good\". I taught several short lessons to demonstrate points in method. It will be understood that Miss Hocking has received her training at the University of British Columbia and not at a Normal School. This makes it rather more difficult for her to appreciate the peculiar methods used in Primary Work.\nSenior Room: Teacher, Mr. S. Bailey. 26 Desks.\n\nHalf Day System. Morning Class:- Grade 8, 5; Grade 7, 8.\nAfternoon Class:- Grade 6 9.\n\nReading: Grades 7 and 8 are working on the prescribed course.\nThey are reading the Lady of the Lake, Voice of Canada, Etc.\nGrade 6 has nearly finished the Fifth Canadian Reader. All this work is \"Good\".\n\nLanguage: All the above Grades use the Work Books in English Usage and Composition.\n\nGeography: Grades 7 and 8 are using the Senior Geography by Cornish.\nThis is a book which is not suitable for the Indian Schools and in fact will be changed in the Provincial Schools in the very near future. Grade 6 is working from the B.C.Edition of the Junior Geography, a book which will cover the needs of our Senior Grades till such time as the senior volume of this work is off the press. I gave a test to these children in Geography, making use of the Stevenson South Africa Part I scale.\nGrade 8 made a Mid Score of 37, the June Norm being 35.\nGrade 6 made a Mid Score of 14, the June Norm being 22.\n\nArithmetic: Grade 8 are working on elementary Algebra as laid down in the prescribed course. Grade 7 are working on Percentage, and Grade 6 are starting Percentage. In the All Canada Test in the Fundamentals, the following scores were made:\nGrade 8 made a Mid Score of 40, the Norm being 39.\nGrade 7 made a Mid Score of 36, the Norm being 35,\nGrade 6 made a Mid Score of 34, the Norm being 31. These results are \"Very Good\" and reflect great credit on the teacher.\n\nSinging: No Singing is taught in this room.\n\nHistory: This is being taught in a systematic manner.\n\nGrammar: Very Good work is being done. The prescribed text is in use. I taught a short lesson in this subject.\n\nArt: The drawing from Nature is \"Good\".\n\nSpelling: Tested with the Buckingham Ayre's Scale,\nGrade 8 made a Mid Score of 100% the June Norm being 98%\nGrade 7 made a Mid Score of 96% the June Norm being 94%\n\nAchievement Test: The B.C.Achievement Test was given to these pupils with the following result:\nGrade 8 made a Mid Score of 87, the Norm for the Grade being 82.2\nGrade 7 made a Mid Score of 71, the Norm being 65.6\nGrade 6 made a Mid Score of 46, the Norm being 52.7 The Grade 7 and 8 scores are very good indeed, and well in advance of the averages made in the Provincial Day Schools.\n\nGeneral: The classroom is 24 feet by 24 feet. The Blackboards are 70 feet by 4 feet. The room is finished in three ply lamatco above the Blackboards. There are eight large windows. The heating is by a woodburning heater. Everything is well looked after. The teacher's control of the class is \"Very Good\".\nThis is probably one of the best classrooms in the B.C.Indian Residential Schools at the present time. As mentioned above the five children registered in Grade 8 all wrote the Provincial test for High School and all passed with high marks.\nLocation: The school is located on Flores Island off the West Coast of Vancouver Island. It is reached by C.P.R. Coast Service from Port Alberni three times a month.\n\nStaff:\n\nRev. Joseph Jones Principal $1360.00 per annum\nMr. Stanley Bailey Assistant Principal and Senior Teacher $610.00\nMiss K. Hockin Junior Teacher $510.00\nMrs. J. Jones Matron $510.00\nMrs. Clee Sewing Matron $459.00\nMrs. Mac Quarrie Kitchen Matron $459.00\n\nBuildings: The buildings are the property of the Women's Missionary Society of the United Church of Canada. Since my last report the Manual Training Class under supervision has erected a second classroom described on previous pages of this report, and a building consisting of a large Manual Training room on the ground floor and a Boys' Dormitory with accommodation for a supervisor's room on the first floor. This dormitory is 24 feet by 48 feet with an 12 feet by 16 feet supervisor's room. The old woodshed which is falling down is only 12 feet from the wall of this new building. I consider this old woodshed more or less of a fire hazard, and should like to recommend its removal. A new woodshed could be erected by the Manual Training Class if they were provided with lumber for this purpose. This woodshed should be about 24 feet by 48 feet and should be erected at a little distance from the other buildings and not far from the sea. There is a perfectly suitable site available. The total cost of the lumber should be under $200.00, and I should only care to recommend this in the event of the Manual Training Class carrying out the work.\n\nThere is a fine wooden playground made with cedar planks. This has been added to since my last visit. It is now about 90 feet by 50 feet. The girls play basket ball here.\n\nA new floor is rather urgently required in the Dining Room and adjoining Kitchen. The present floor is very much worn. New treads on the steps of the stairs to playrooms are required. Extensive painting of the outside of the buildings is now necessary.\n\nThe above remarks cover the main features noticed with regard to the actual buildings. I am not prepared to state just who should pay for the recommendations should these be sanctioned. No doubt the United Church who own the building would be approached in this matter.\n\nVocational Training: In addition to the usual house work, the girls learn to mend, darn, patch, make clothes, etc. They make the boys' shirts. They knit, crochet, embroider, and do bead work. There are three sewing machines here, one being used by the staff. I believe that one new Singer Sewing machine TAILOR MODEL and one ordinary Singer machine should be added to the equipment, and charged against appropriations for Vocational Training in B.C.\n### Number of pupils in each grade\n\n| Grade | Boys | Girls | Total |\n|-------|------|-------|-------|\n| Grade 8 | 3    | 2     | 5     |\n| 7     | 3    | 5     | 8     |\n| 6     | 6    | 4     | 10    |\n| 5     | 4    | 4     | 8     |\n| 4a    | 3    | 3     | 6     |\n| 4b    | 5    | 4     | 9     |\n| 2     | 2    | 2     | 4     |\n| 1a    | 3    | 4     | 7     |\n| 1b    | 2    | 4     | 6     |\n| Totals| 31   | 32    | 63    |\n\nKatherine Hoiley adopted daughter of Principal not on school roll taking grade 8.\n\n#167 Charlie Frank allowed out of school on recommendation of Doctor Schwartzman, child suffering from flu.\n\n#011 Lena Titian at home by consent of Principal not yet of school age, and arrangements made for her care at present.\nManual Training: The Principal teaches this subject, and I am glad to be able to report that the work done at this school during the past year has been very good. Much of it has been in the nature of construction work. The new addition to the classroom block, the new M.T. work shop with dormitory over it, and the addition to the wooden playground have all been erected in first class style. A detailed statement from the Principal is attached to this report.\n\nFire Protection: There are three soda type extinguishers. These ought to be refilled, and the Indian Agent has been communicated with in this matter by the Principal. There are also five small Pyrene extinguishers. Inside the building there are two hydrants with hose. The water supply is from a tank at one end of the building. This tank is on about the level of the roof of the main building, and is about twelve feet in diameter and ten feet deep. There is not of course sufficient pressure to send water over the main roof of the school.\n\nThe water supply is from a surface well which is 18 feet deep to rock. This water is always slightly coloured, and gets rather bitter in summer. It has been analysed and found to be of good quality. The colour is probably due to the fact that there is a cedar swamp quite near the well. The supply of water available in the above mentioned well is satisfactory for domestic purposes. The well is ten feet by twelve feet and eight feet deep, when the water is most abundant. The tank can be kept full from this well during the summer by pumping twice a day. The pumping is done by a 6 H.P. Fairbanks gas engine attached to a pump. This engine also supplies the power to run the laundry machinery mentioned below.\n\nRegular fire drills are held and that carried out during my visit was quite satisfactory.\n\nI should like to recommend that the Department provide a thick rope, at one end of which a large iron ring should be permanently fitted, so that in the event of fire the boys from the new dormitory could have a means of climbing out of one of the windows of their dormitory and reaching the rocks below in safety. The iron ring could be placed under one leg of a bed near one of the windows. At present the only means of escape from this new dormitory is by means of a light stairway on the outside of the building, and this staircase is nearest to the greatest fire hazard, the old broken down woodshed. Should the small boys have to jump from one of the windows they would be very seriously injured as the rocks are below the windows on the sea side of the building.\n\nDormitories: These are all kept in perfectly clean and neat condition. Six beds and matresses are required to complete the equipment of the new dormitory. At present the boys here use some very old ship's cots bought second hand by the Principal.\n\nUpper Landing: About five hundred square feet of V.joint sheeting and a dormer type skylight are required to shut in this upper landing. The cost would be about $50.00 for material and the boys of the Manual Training Class could easily do the work. This dormer window would greatly improve the ventilation of the main building.\nIndian Residential School,\nAhousaht, B.C.\n\nNo. (a) Statement with regard to work covered by Manual Training Class since the last inspection.\n\nThe erection of Carpenter and Boatbuilding shop 34 feet X 48 feet with dormitory and one staff bedroom above, in the attic storage for lumber.\nConstruction of work benches, mitre boxes, mallets, brooms, inferior saws, and power house.\nIn addition to the above, all repair work on buildings and engines has been done by the boys; painting and glazing making of furniture, tables, bookcases, chiffoniers, washstands, benches, 62 paddles painted in legendary Indian designs, 52 totem poles, 9 cedar chests of red cedar trimmed with yellow cedar, totem poles at each corner, carved canoes for handles, the lid and front in Indian designs.\nThe construction of the boat \"Dawn\" 40 feet length, 10 feet beam drawing 4\u00bd feet. Designed by the Principal and constructed by the boys; the material being supplied by the Department. This launch is a great asset to the school and a fine testimonial to the craftsmanship of the boys.\nThere are two small washing machines. These were supplied to the school a few years ago as previously reported. There are two laundry tubs, and an extractor.\n\nThe power to operate these machines is supplied from the 6 H.P. pumping engine mentioned above. The tank on the heater used for boiling water will need to be replaced. This old tank is galvanized and is feet by 1 feet by 3 feet. The engine mentioned above drives an old 1-125 K.W. General Electric generator.\n\nThere is a set of four year old batteries supplying 38 Volts in this system, which is the old lighting system of the school. The Principal asks for new batteries; but I pointed out to him that he has a new electric light system and does not need the old system. I could not recommend the supply of new batteries.\n\nLighting: The new Electric Light plant consists of a Kohler 110 Volt automatic 1500 Watt system, and the engine uses gas. This system is perfectly satisfactory. All new wires have been placed in pipes as a precaution against fire.\n\nDining Rooms: As I was staying at the school for several days I had a very good opportunity of seeing the food supplied to the children. I saw it cooked and served. A Diet Sheet is attached for the information of the Department. The quantity, quality, and variety of the food is very good.\n\nThe feeding of the Indian children is so nearly connected with the state of their health that it is not a surprise to find that the children have been very well during the past year. A statement with regard to their health is attached.\n\nKitchen: Part of the floor in the kitchen needs to be renewed. The kitchen range will need to be replaced in the near future, probably next year.\n\nFreight Boat: The boys of the Manual Training Class have constructed a very fine freight boat. This boat was placed at my disposal to visit Christie Indian Residential School, and later to take me part of the way to Ucluelet. The engine supplied by the Department for this boat appears to be working very well indeed.\n\nSanitary Conditions: All wash places, toilets, and other parts of the school, including the playrooms are kept in a perfectly sanitary condition.\n\nFarming: A statement from the Principal is attached. Farming is not being undertaken at this school. It is not even possible to keep a cow with profit. There are about eleven acres cleared but this is a swamp.\n\nBasement: The heating at this school is by means of an Ideal coal burning hot water system. The plant is by Crane Ltd. and is numbered W-25-7. Fifty tons of coal are used yearly. I do not consider that there is very great need for this hot water heating plant to be inspected by an engineer, and the particulars given here are the result of a thorough inspection of the exterior of the furnace and boiler, in the hope that this might save the Department any expense. There is an exposed smoke pipe leading from the fire box of the furnace to the brick chimney, and this exposed smoke pipe is EIGHT INCHES below a large wooden beam in the ceiling of the Basement. I consider this highly dangerous, and pointed out the fire risk to the Principal. I suggested then that some asbestos covered with tar should be placed on the lower sides of the wooden beam. If the chimney caught fire and the smoke pipe turned red there would be great danger of fire here. I should like this matter taken up with the Principal. I did mention it to Mr. Indian Agent Frost on my return to Port Alberni. Mr. Frost was not with me during this inspection tour.\nStatement of health and Diet sheet for one week.\n\nDuring the past year our pupils have maintained their reputation as strong healthy children. The factors that have made this possible are as follows:\n\n1. Ample supply of good food well prepared, every child is encouraged to eat until satisfied.\n2. The first indication of indisposition is noted and the child placed in the care of the Nurse at once for treatment.\n3. The children from families with a poor health record are given special care and food.\n4. Long hours of sleep, the Juniors have 11 hours and the Seniors 9\u00bd to 10 hours.\n5. Recreation when weather permits, For bad wet weather we need an enclosed recreation hall.\n6. Keeping the pupils interested in study work or play.\n\nBreakfast\n\nPorridge, Milk, Bread, Peanut-butter, amount unlimited. This is diet for breakfast throughout the week.\n\nDinner\n\nSunday\nRoast Beef, Gravy, Potatoes, Pie, Bread, Water.\n\nMonday\nBaked Fish, Potatoes, Bread, Rice pudding, Water.\n\nTuesday\nMeat stew, with vegetables, Potatoes, bread pudding, Bread, Water.\n\nWednesday\nRoast beef, Gravy, Potatoes, Tapioca pudding, raw carrots Bread, Water.\n\nThursday\nBaked fish, Potatoes, Batter pudding, with sauce, Bread, Vegetable stew, Cornmeal pudding with syrup, Bread.\n\nFriday\nMeat stew or Beans, raw cabbage, cornstarch chocolate pudding, Bread, Water.\n\nSaturday\n\nSupper\n\nSunday\nBread, Peanut butter, Cocoa, Prunes, Cake.\n\nMonday\nSoup, Bread, Peanut butter, Cocoa, Apricots.\n\nTuesday\nWarmed over Potatoes and onions, Bread, Peanut butter, Peaches, Cocoa.\n\nWednesday\nMacaroni & Cheese, Bread, Peanut butter, Cocoa, Pears, Apples.\n\nThursday\nWarmed over fish and potatoes, Bread, Butter, Cocoa, Apples.\n\nFriday\nSoup, Bread, Peanut butter, Cocoa, Apricots.\n\nSaturday\nBuns or Eggs, Potatoes, Bread, Peanut butter, Cocoa, Figs.\n\nIn addition the pupils receive codliver oil or Marinol during the winter months, and those who require it the year round.\n(3) The Ground in not suitable for farming, unless a liberal amount of money was spent on fertilizers.\n\n(4) No Farm Machinery.\n\n(5) 70 head of Rhode Island Hens.\nFinancial Statement:\n\nThe attached Financial Statement for the period January 1, 1932 to December 31, 1932 was prepared for me while I was at the school. The books appear to me to be well kept. The general business administration is excellent. This school costs the W.M.S. of the United Church a considerable sum yearly in excess of the Per Capita Grant made by the Department.\n\nGeneral:\n\nThere is no doubt whatever that this is one of the best administered Indian Residential Schools in British Columbia. The children are very happy, a condition which I do not find prevailing in all our schools, and they are in the best of health. There is little if any corporal punishment. The work done in the schoolrooms is superior to that in similar schoolrooms in other Indian Residential Schools, and far superior to that of the Provincial Day Schools as the passing of the entire Eighth Grade in the Provincial Entrance Examination in June proves.\n\nI have every reason to consider the Rev. Mr. Jones a highly efficient and successful principal, and I hope that he will remain here for a number of years. I know that he has lately refused a transfer to a school outside of this Province.\n(6) Financial Statement for 1933.\n\nReceipts\n\nBalance on hand Dec. 31st 1932 .................. 388.25\nAmount contributed by Government ................. 8,937.23\nAmount contributed by W.M.S.United Church ....... 3,740.00\nTotal Receipts .................. 13,065.48\n\nExpenditures\n\nSalaries .................................. 4,102.46\nExtra Labour .............................. 250.50\nFood ..................................... 3,266.64\nClothing .................................. 1,079.43\nFuel & Light ............................... 1,072.67\nBuildings & Repairs ......................... 1,052.64\nEquipment .................................. 858.57\nFarm & Garden .............................. 128.25\nTransport, travelling, freight ................. 348.71\nMiscellaneous .............................. 353.47\nBalance on hand Dec. 31st 1933 ................. 522.14\nTotal Expenditure .......................... 13,065.48\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to transmit herewith letter dated August 3rd, instant, covering a report by Captain G.H.

C. Perry, Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith my report on the Ahousaht Indian Residential School, West Coast Agency, which I inspected on March 23, & 24, 1936.\n\nDuring my inspection I was accompanied by Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge. It was possible to make a very thorough inspection of the school as we spent two nights there, before leaving for Christie Indian Residential School on the morning of the 25th of March.\n\nI held the usual Fire Drill and found that the children could only use the ordinary stairways from the dormitories, as they had not been trained to come down the wooden fire escapes. I made a thorough inspection of these fire escapes and my remarks are contained in the attached report. The expense of the usual iron escapes would be high and I feel that the wooden escapes here might easily be made safe and convenient to use. I believe that the Indian Agent might well be asked to make a report on this subject.\n\nThe most important item in my report is that to do with the extension of the Half Day System here, and the more extensive training in Vocational work, Manual Training, and Marine Engine Repairing, which will be possible with the extra time available. I certainly hope that the Officials of the Schools' Branch will agree with me that the appointment of a Manual Training Instructor here who could instruct in Marine Engine Work and take the old Vice Principal would be well worth the expenditure of the usual grant in aid of this from the B.C. Special Vote. I understand that the local Indians are very anxious for the extension of the Vocational Training along the lines I have suggested in my report, and that the Indian Agent is prepared to make a report on this matter in the near future.\n\nIt was a great pleasure to meet the new Principal, Mr. Caldwell, and to find him so well adapted for the special form of educational work that he is now called upon to undertake.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Perry\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

E. Caldwell.\n\nClassroom teachers: Miss K. Hockin, B.A., Age 25.\n\nTrained in U.R.C.Teachers' Training Course. At present holds an Interim Academic B.C.Certificate, which I am recommending to the Provincial Department of Education should be made permanent. Miss Hockin has been here since September 1935, and is thus in her third year of teaching. From her appointment in 1933 she has had charge of the Junior Room for two years and the Senior Room since September 1935.\n\nMiss Hockin is leaving the school at the end of June, I understand, to receive some extra training in Toronto before proceeding to China as a Missionary Teacher.\n\nMr. Roger G. Knipe, Age 20.\n\nPassed Senior Matriculation in Winnipeg in 1934. Trained at Vancouver Normal School 1934-35. Here in charge of Junior Room since September 1935. While Mr. Knipe does not hold any certificate at the moment, he will have a First Class Interim Certificate for B.C. as soon as he writes a successful paper in Trigonometry. He is working through the B.C.Correspondence Course at this subject and hopes to take the necessary Provincial Examination in September 1936.\n\nRemarks relative to methods employed by teachers:\n\nThe above teachers are doing very good work in the classrooms. Miss Hockin is better with the Seniors than with the Juniors whom she taught for two years. She has put into use suggestions made at a previous inspection and has greatly improved her teaching technique as a result. I have made further suggestions to her with regard to the teaching of the Senior Grades. Her attitude to her work has greatly improved.\n\nMr. Knipe is doing very well in the Junior Room though he of course has very little experience. He visited me in Victoria and took notes of a large number of suggestions made to him on that occasion. He has put my suggestions into practice. I have now taught lessons for him, and indicated the work that should be covered in each Sub Grade. Another year should see him develop into a successful teacher. It is likely that he will be moved into the Senior Room as the teacher of the Junior Grades should be a woman, and he ought to be able to teach the Seniors.\nReport on Ahousaht Indian Residential School: Page 2.\n\nRemarks relative to examination of pupils:\n\nSenior Room: Teacher Miss K. Hockin, B.A. 26 Single Desks.\n\nMorning Class: Grade 8 2; Grade 7, 6; Grade 5, 4; Total 16.\nAfternoon Class: Grade 8 as above; Grade 5 as above; Grade 6, 6:\nI am making a suggestion below as to the distribution of Grades in the Senior and Junior Rooms for next year.\n\nReading: All the work in this subject is \"Good\".\nGrade 8 have nearly finished The Lady of The Lake.\nGrade 7 are to start Treasure Island as they have finished the other selections prescribed in the Programme of Studies.\nGrade 6 are about half way through Highroads Reader Book 6 which they read very well indeed.\nGrade 5 are nearly finished Highroads Reader Book 5.\nThe Reading Exercise Work Books have been in use but more work should be done in these, at least two exercises a week. This has been suggested to the teacher.\n\nArithmetic: Grades 8 and 7 are working in an old Text Book.\nI have suggested that they work from the Canadian Problem and Practice Arithmetics, and that the teacher obtains a Manual for them.\nGrade 6 are at Per Centage, having finished the usual work in decimals.\nGrade 5 are finishing Fractions.\nThe work in Grade 5 is \"Good\" and that in the other Grades is \"Satisfactory\".\nThe All Canada Test in the Fundamentals was used.\nGrade 8 made a Mid Score of 36.5 the Norm being 39.4.\nGrade 7 made a Mid Score of 33.5 the Norm being 34.6.\nGrade 5 made a Mid Score of 31 which was good as the Norm is 26.\n\nWriting: This is taught by Mr. Knipe, as are some of the other subjects, while Miss Hockin takes Geography in the Junior Room.\nThe work in Writing is \"Satisfactory\".\n\nLanguage: The English Usage and Composition Work Books as well as the Nature and Language Work Books should be regularly used.\nI have explained to the teachers that at least one exercise per day in each Grade should be done from the English Usage and Composition Book, and two exercises per week done in each Grade from the Nature and Language Work Books suitable for the different Grades.\nThe above with two exercises from the Reading Exercise Work Books and some Grammar Exercises in Grades 6 through 8 make up a very satisfactory programme for seat work while the teacher gives ORAL LESSONS to the other Grades.\n\nArt: This is \"Satisfactory\" as far as it goes.\n\nGeography: Miss Hockin has arranged that the children work out very good Project Maps.\nGrades 3 and 4 are using The Book of Boys and Girls around the World, which with the Book of New Canadians should be used regularly (daily) to the combined Grades and the necessary teaching given in an informal manner.\nGrades 5 and 6 are using the B.C. Edition of Geography for Juniors and accompanying Work Pads, while Grades 7 and 8 are at present using an out of date text (Cornish's Geography(Senior)) The new Geography for Seniors (Dent's) should be requisitioned for next year.\nThe Geography work done in this school is above the average.\nI taught a Review Lesson on B.C. as a \"Type Lesson\" and had a very satisfactory response from the Grades 5 through 8.\n\nSpelling: This was tested with 20 words from Column 5s of the Buckingham Ayres Scale, the results were \"Very Good\".\nGrade 8 made a Mid Score of 37.5, the Norm being 64% in June.\nGrade 7 made a Mid Score of 32.5, the June Norm being 73.\nGrade 5 made a Mid Score of 30% the June Norm in this case being 42%.\n\nGeneral Achievement In Grades 8, 7, & 6, this was measured by the B.C. Achievement Test 1930; while in Grades 5 the B.C. Achievement Test for Juniors 1934 was used.\nGrade 8 made a Mid Score of 52, the Norm being 72.4.\nGrade 7 made a Mid Score of 36, the Norm being 60.4 (V. Poor).\nGrade 6 made a Mid Score of 36, the Norm being 47.3.\nGrade 5 made a Mid Score of 36.5 in the 1934 Test the Norm being 32.8.\n\nGeneral: Only one boy EUGENE ATLEO should attempt the High School Entrance Test in June.\nGood progress is being made by the above Grades; but more attention will have to be given to the Work Books Miss Hockin's control is \"Good\".\nRemarks relative to examination of pupils continued:\n\nJunior Room: Teacher Mr. Roger G. Knipe. 41 single desks.\n\nAll Day Class: Grade 4B: Grade 3E; Grade 7: Grade 2B; Grade 1A: Grade 0; Grade 1B: Grade 6; Grade 1C: Grade 4;\nTotal number of children in room: 26.\n\nReading: Grade 4B are starting the Highroads Reader Book 4.\nGrade 3E are at Page 40 of Highroads Reader Book 3.\nGrade 2 are at Page 55 of Highroads Reader Book 2. All the above Reading is \"Very Good\".\nGrade 1B who have been in the school since September 1935 only are at Page 86 of Friends, and are also working in My Primer book, while Grade 1C who have been in school since January of this year know some 60 Sight Words and are starting to read Two Little Indians, having reached the seventh of the Coloured Charts accompanying this Pre-Primer.\nThis work is certainly very good for the time the children have been in school. They all speak out well.\n\nArithmetic: Very good work indeed has been done in Arithmetic.\nGrade 4 are on Long Multiplication, having finished Short Multiplication and Short Division to times 12.\nGrade 3 are working Short Multiplication and Short Division as far as the times 12 table. Grade 2 can Add with and without a carry and are doing Subtraction without borrowing. Grade 1B have been taught the Combinations and Separations only as far as 3 or 4. They can read and write Numbers to 10 and recognize Groups to 2. Grade 1C can count to 10. Grade 1B must go on with the work in Combinations and Separations as they should be working these to 9 at this time of the year, and Grade 1C should start the work on Combinations and Separations as soon as they can read and write the numbers to 9.\n\nTested with the All Canada Test in the Fundamentals\nGrade 4B made a Mid Score of 22, the Norm being about 18, while Grade 3B made a Mid Score of 17, the Norm being about 7.\nThese results are very good indeed and show good teaching.\n\nNature: This has been done with Miss Rockin with some success.\n\nReading Exercises: Two a week are being done in Grades 3 & 4.\n\nLanguage: The English Usage and Composition Work Books have not been used. These should certainly be used at once in Grades above 2A. The Dominion Language Texts are not as good for the work that I have outlined for the teacher, but he has been using them up to this.\n\nWriting: Much more Blackboard Writing is needed with the Grade 1 classes and particularly with the Grade 1C or Beginners' Group. Pencil is used to Grade 2, but the latter should use ink.\n\nSpelling: Column \"J\" of the Buckingham Ayres Scale was used and 20 words dictated to Grades 2, 3, & 4. The results were a little better than average:\nGrade 4 made a Mid Score of 100% the June Norm being 94%\nGrade 3 made a Mid Score of 95% the June Norm being 84%\nGrade 2 made a Mid Score of 70% the June Norm being 66%\n\nGeneral Achievement: The general work done in Grades 3 and 4 was tested with the B.C. Achievement Test for Juniors, 1934 and the results show good teaching.\nGrade 3 made a Mid Score of 11, the Norm being 16.2.\nGrade 4 made a Mid Score of 21.5 the Norm being 26.2\n\nNorms are for Provincial Schools as tested by their Inspectors.\n\nMental Tests: The Otis Intermediate Test was used to test the Binet Intelligence Quotients of all the children in the school above Grade 3. I find that the average B.I.Q. of these Indian Children is between 85 and 90. Only two or three had B.I.Q.s of between 100 and 110. The children are therefore a little slow though by no means dull as the Language Factor must be taken into consideration.\n\nGeneral: Mr. Knipe's control is \"satisfactory\". The children are making very good progress indeed.\nReport on Ahousaht Indian Residential School:\n\nVocational Training:\n\nThere is no Manual Training Instructor at this school at the present time. As far as the Boys' work is concerned the Principal reports that they have since he took charge of the school in September done the following:\n\nRepairs to building. Renewing shingles.\nPainting entire outside of main school building, two colours, two coats.\nMaking Christmas toys for junior relatives in the Village, wagons, kiddie-cars, etc.\nClearing out ditching draining farm land, and deepening of ditch through rock. Work done with engine and winch.\nClearing and stumping of land at rear of school suitable for vegetable growing. Stumps pulled with engine and winch.\nPlanting of nursery of 100 loganberry plants, 100 blackcurrants, 50 gooseberry, 25 cherry and plum, and the permanent planting of 120 rhubarb roots.\nCarving of Indian work, totems, eagles, etc.\n\nThe above are the Principal's own words.\nI saw some of the work done by the Girls.\nThey are taught in turn the work of the house, cooking, bread making, etc. In addition they mend, patch, darn, crochet, knit, etc.\nSome very fine bead work has been done by a number of the girls.\nThis bead work is much ahead of any done in our other Indian schools.\n\nWhile at the school I was approached by three of the chief Indians who explained to me that they wished for some sort of training for their boys in the maintenance and repair of marine engines.\nThe Principal and the Indian Agent were also present at this meeting with the Indian Chiefs.\nI explained to the Indians that the Department was anxious to have the boys learn those things which would be of use to them after they left school, and that while I did not know just how far the Department might be willing to go, I should make a recommendation to cover their request. This of course satisfied the Indian Chiefs.\n\nI have talked the matter over with the Principal and the Indian Agent, who will no doubt report himself on this matter. I wish to recommend to the Department that the usual grant of some $450.00 per annum be given to this school to enable the Principal to employ a well trained Instructor who could teach the boys to take down and repair the ordinary gas engines, and if possible the newer types of engines now used in the larger fishing boats. This man should also be able to instruct in the more practical wood work, the making of those articles which will be required as the farming operations are enlarged here, and the construction of the simple furniture, tables, chairs, etc., used in Indian homes. I am convinced that the expenditure of say $450.00 from the B.C. Special Vote for this Vocational Work would be of the greatest possible advantage here.\n\nI have also to recommend that the Half Day System be extended here to allow for more outdoor exercise for the Girls and Boys. This will give better opportunity for Vocational Training. I have gone into the matter with very great care, and find that the following changes can easily be made in the Classroom Work, and I would recommend that they be so made as from the opening of school after the summer vacation.\n\nJunior Room An ALL DAY CLASS consisting of Grades 1, 2, and 3 only.\nSenior Room Half Day System: Grades 6, 7, and 4 should be taken together as either a Morning or Afternoon Class, while Grades 6 & 5 should form the other class for Afternoon or Morning. The classes so formed would rotate month by month from the Morning to the Afternoon. I understand that this suggestion has the approval of the Principal and the Indian Agent. It will do much for the school, and I would ask the Department to sanction it as soon as possible.\nReport on Ahousaht Indian Residential School\n\nPage 5.\n\nFire Protection:\n\nThere are three Soda Type extinguishers. In my last report I recommended that these be recharged. This was done on October 12, 1935. There are also five small Pyrene extinguishers. Inside the building there are two hydrants with the usual hose. The water supply is from a tank at one end of the building. This tank is about on the level of the roof of the main building. It is twelve feet in diameter and some ten feet deep. There is not of course sufficient pressure in the pipes to send water over the roof of the school.\n\nThe water supply is from a surface well, which is some twelve feet deep to rock. The water is always coloured, probably from a small pine leakage or vegetable matter, there being a cedar swamp near the school. This is being drained now. The well being ten feet by twelve feet and as above mentioned going to rock with about eight feet of water at the most abundant season, gives sufficient water for all domestic purposes. The tank can be filled by pumping twice a day in summer. This pumping is done by a 6 H.P. Fairbanks engine attached to the pump. The well did go dry for a time last summer but conditions were very unusual.\n\nI went into the question of Fire Escapes and Fire Drills with great care. I noticed that my recommendation for a rope with an iron ring to fit under the leg of a bed has not been acted on in the new dormitory building. It is true that a second stairway has been constructed in that building, and the old wood shed removed.\n\nTo put it very bluntly, I AM NOT SATISFIED THAT PROPER FIRE DRILLS HAVE BEEN HELD AT THIS SCHOOL SINCE MY LAST INSPECTION. Fire Drills have been held down the stairs, but I do not believe that the old wooden fire escapes have been used for a long time. There are two of these wooden fire escapes, one at each end of the main school building. Neither reaches to the ground. The steps on the Girls' Fire Escape are so narrow that it is most dangerous for a child to come down. To make my inspection complete I managed to climb up this escape, but had difficulty in coming down and had in fact to face the escape and use it as a ladder. As the escape does not reach within some eight feet to the ground I could not get down till a boy got a step ladder and helped me. Such a condition should I think be put away with for the sake of the children, even if the Department does not own the building. The exit from the dormitories to the escapes is by way of windows, which are covered with light wire screens. These can be knocked out by means of the axes kept near the windows. I think these wire screens might well be removed, and the windows just fastened with string and wax seal.\n\nI would recommend that the fire escape on the Boys' side of the school be continued by steps to the ground, a very simple thing for the Manual Training Class to do if they had the material. On the Girls' side the last flight of steps at least should be renewed and placed in a better position to give a more gradual slope and thus permit much wider steps. This escape should also be continued to the ground. The windows on the Girls' side should also have the wire screens taken off and string and wax used as a seal.\n\nI would ask the Department to provide the Principal with a copy of the regulations for Fire Drills, which the last Principal does not appear to have handed to Mr. Caldwell. I would also urge that when the Fire Escapes have been lengthened as suggested above and the one on the Girls' side changed, regular drills be organized down the new escapes.\n\nA wooden escape might well be constructed to a window in the new dormitory building. Iron escapes are not in my opinion necessary here. They are just as dangerous as wooden escapes though they look safer. If there is any fire near an escape, iron or wood children will not come down it.\nDormitories: The question of wire screens over the windows leading to the Fire Escapes has been taken up above.\n\nThe general condition of the dormitories is very good. There are plenty of extra covers available should they be required. There is no overcrowding. The Principal is renewing some of the work out mattresses.\n\nDining Rooms: The floors of the Dining Room and Kitchen are being renewed. I spent several days at this school and therefore had a very good opportunity to see the food supplied to the children cooked and served. I visited the children four times at least and am perfectly satisfied that the food supplied to the pupils here is of Excellent quality, quantity, and variety. It is far better than that supplied at the average Indian Residential School in British Columbia. In fact very great care is taken in the preparation of the meals. The Diet Sheet supplied to me at my request is given below:\n\nWeekly Menu - Children's Dining Room.\n\n| Monday | Breakfast | Rolled Oats Cereal with \"Pacific\" milk and sugar.

Fish (Salmon and Cod) used as a more regular diet during the fishing season.\n\nThe Dining Room is perfectly clean and the meals are well served.\nWater Supply: This is from a surface well. The quality of the water is satisfactory, though the colour is a distinct yellow. The water has been analysed lately and found to be fit to drink. The water is pumped into a tank located over the fire escape at the end of the main school building. The pressure in the fire mains is of course very low as the tank is only on a level with the roof of the main building.\n\nSanitary Conditions:\n\nWhile these are not satisfactory in certain directions it is certainly not the fault of the Principal or members of the Staff. The whole of the school is perfectly clean. Old floors however make it hard to keep in this condition and in several rooms the Principal is relaying the floors, the new material being now at the school. The work will be done as soon as the children are away on vacation.\n\nThere are only two wash basins and one wash tub downstairs for all the boys. There is no toilet upstairs for the use of the Boys at night. There are in fact only two toilets for the Boys downstairs. The toilet accommodation on the Girls' side of the school is more satisfactory, there being a bath, two wash basins, and a toilet upstairs, and one wash basin and two toilets downstairs. The children are given at least one warm and supervised bath per week. I have no doubt that the present Principal will do all in his power to add to the above mentioned sanitary conveniences as soon as possible. In the meantime he is reflooring some of the wash places and basement rooms.\n\nThe kitchens, dining rooms, etc., are kept quite clean.\n\nGeneral:\n\nI considered this school to be in a very satisfactory condition under the previous Principal, though as far as I can learn things were not quite so good towards the end of his time here. Mr. Caldwell has taken hold in a very efficient manner, and it is obvious that in a short time the school will be one of the very best in British Columbia even if it is not as large as some. I am glad to see that the Principal and Indian Agent are working in complete harmony for the good of the school. At least one new teacher will be required for the next school year, and if the Department will sanction it, a Manual Training Instructor who might also act as Vice Principal.\n\nThe available farm land, though I do not report on this matter as a rule, might well be put under cultivation now that it has been to a larger extent drained. I would recommend that the Agricultural Agent for British Columbia be asked to visit the school to help the Principal with his farming problems. If some cows could be kept here, and I believe they might be, the fresh milk would be a great help to the children. Vegetables of some sort could I think be grown with success. The Principal needs the advice of an expert in farming as to how he may best use the available land.\n\nThe children are well clothed, and appear to be very happy. I consider the general standing of the school to be \"Very Good\", and I wish to congratulate the Principal on the start he has made here.\n\nDuncan, B.C.\nMarch 29, 1936.\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B. C.\nReport on Inspection of Ahousaht Indian Residential School. February 26, 1927.\n\nIn main building a large gong has been installed, with key attached to each floor, and in basement. Gong is very loud, and plainly heard all over the building. Gong is also being installed in outside dormitory, where a few pupils are lodged.\n\nEscapes are placed at either end of building, and have been extended to reach from upper floor to the ground. These escapes are in good order, and were found satisfactory. A third escape is being built at centre of building, giving access to both ends of building.\n\nIt is recommended that ropes be placed at windows of this building, secured inside, to augment the existing means of escape, viz the outside stairways. This has been referred to the Principal for his action.\n\nEscape Windows.\n\nDormitory windows giving access to escapes are kept on inside latch, easily opened, and windows have been fitted to prevent difficulty in opening.\n\nElectric Wiring.\n\nAll electric wiring has been overhauled, and is insulated. Current is generated by small engine in outside building, and power is turned off after the school children retire.\n\nStorage of Gasoline.\n\nGasoline for power engine is stored in drums, and kept outside of building, with exception of feed supply for engine, and is considered safe.\n\nHeating.\n\nMain building is heated from coal furnace and steam boiler in basement. Furnace room is clean and free from rubbish. Pipes was thought to be too close to overhead wooden beams, and these have now been covered with asbestos.\nReport on Inspection of Ahousaht Indian Residential School, February 26, 1927.\n\nHearing (cont.)\n\nOne small heater is kept in sitting room. Walls and floor about it are protected with galvanized iron.\n\nKitchen Stove and Chimney.\n\nA lawes steamship stove is provided for the kitchen, with a separate chimney, apparently in good order. No fire is left in this stove overnight.\n\nFire Pails and Axes\n\nFire pails and axes are kept in each dormitory, and extinguishers are kept on the landings at head of stairs. Extinguishers are in good order, and pails are filled with water.\n\nFire Drill.\n\nFire drills are regularly carried out, and at this inspection the building was evacuated in less than 3 minutes. This, however, under ideal conditions.\n\nFire Hose.\n\n100 ft. of 2\" canvas hose, attached to hydrant, is kept at either end of building; but is considered useless except for use in basement or ground floor, as there is no water pressure.\n\nStore Room.\n\nStore rooms are kept clean and free of litter. Paint and oil was found stored in small room under main building, and the Principal is being advised to have this class of material stored away from building.\n\nWorkshop.\n\nWorkshop was found clean and clear of shavings and inflammable material. This room is kept locked when not occupied.\nSupply of water for fire fighting purposes is derived from a well, pumped to a storage tank suspended on a wooden trestle, over a wooden fire escape, about 3000 gallons capacity.\n\nPressure is by gravity from this tank, and was found insufficient to throw a stream of water to the second story. It is totally inadequate to be of any use in a fire.\n\nDiscipline.\n\nDiscipline is excellent, and children and staff are well posted as to their various stations, in case of fire.\n\nWatchman.\n\nThe nightwatchman is a very conscientious man, and very thorough and capable in the execution of his duties.\n\nBuildings.\n\nAs reported before, the main building can only be described as a fire trap and menace. I cannot but feel very apprehensive about the building, as I am fully convinced that nothing could save it in case of fire.\n\nFor this reason, I have advised the Principal to devote all his efforts to the saving of life, and the prevention of fire, by constant care and regular drills and inspections.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nCopy of this report received, and contents noted.\n\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honour to transmit herewith letter of the 29th instant received from Capt. G. H. Barry, District Inspector of Indian Schools, B. C., covering his report of inspection on the 23rd and 24th March, 1936, of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School, West Coast Agency, B. C.\n\nI am in agreement that a portion of the B. C. Special Vote for Technical Education might properly be used for the purposes suggested by Inspector Barry.\n\nArrangements can conveniently be made to have our Indian Agricultural Agent visit this School and discuss with the Principal at the School what means can best be employed in order to bring the cultivated land into use. I have no record, however, of the area of land owned by the United Church in the School region and would like to have information on this point before asking the Indian Agricultural Agent to discuss plans for agricultural developments at the School. Perhaps the Department can furnish this information and possibly a plan of the parcel for identification purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry.\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nP:H:N\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nSanitary Conditions:\n\nThe Principal and supervisors do all that they can, I believe, to keep the place clean. It is a very old building and can never again be strictly clean. I am satisfied that the whole of the school is cleaner than was the case when I last visited here in April 1937.\n\nIn several reports I have explained the lack of sufficient toilet and washroom accommodation.\n\nThere are only two wash basins and one wash tub downstairs for the thirty-eight boys. There is no toilet upstairs for the use of the boys at night. There are in fact only two downstairs toilets for the boys and these are in a dark partitioned off part of the basement.\n\nOn the girls' side the accommodation is a little better. Here there are a bath, two wash basins, and a toilet upstairs, and one wash basin and two toilets on the ground floor.\n\nThe children are clean, though I understand that in common with many Indian children at the West Coast schools they are rather troubled with fleas. These exist in large numbers in the Indian villages and are a trouble to members of the staff as well as to the children. The children have at least one warm supervised bath a week. Two boys no longer share a bath together as mentioned in my last report.\n\nThe general sanitary condition of the school might be improved as I said in my last report. This has been partly achieved but I wish to recommend the following changes even if the school buildings are only to be used for one more year.\n\nA single toilet should be placed in the boys' dormitory in the same way that this has been done on the girls' side of the school. This toilet can easily be connected to the present black iron plumbing, and water pipe also attached.\n\nThe present two toilets in the boys' basement should be taken right out of the school. The smell from these very old type toilets is bad. The actual toilets and tanks are of no further use. No new toilet bowls should be placed in the basement on the boys' side.\n\nA range of at least four new toilets should be constructed outside the school buildings and at the rear of the present schoolrooms for the use of the boys. These toilets would be placed over pits dug sufficiently deep. There would be no danger of the school well being contaminated as there is a deep ditch with water draining to the sea between the proposed site of the new toilets and the school.\n\nThis matter has been mentioned to the Indian Agent and I have asked the Principal to talk to the Agent about it as the matter is urgent.\n\nThe septic tanks overflowed since my last inspection. They were then emptied by buckets, but the fluid in the drain pipes backing up spread under the school. Lime was used freely I am told. Part of the trouble is the usual draining of soap and water from the laundry and kitchens into the septic tanks. The bacteria are thus killed and the tanks do not function. I doubt that much can be done except to lay a new drain for the laundry water which could be taken away to the low lying ground at the back of the school.\nGeneral:\n\nThe children are well clothed, and appear happy. The tone in the school is not as good as was the case on the occasion of my last inspection. This is due to two facts:-\n\n(a) Children have come here from Alberni Indian Residential School, where every member of the Staff carried a strap, I am now informed. These children have never learned how to work without punishments and have not helped the Ahousaht School.\n\n(b) The present Girls' Supervisor is from the Alberni Residential School Staff and though her ideas of constant punishment have been considerably curtailed by the Principal, her influence on staff and girls is distinctly poor in my opinion. She will be permitted to resign at the end of June and will I hope never be again employed in an Indian school.\n\nThe general administration of the school is no better than was the case last year. The Principal knows perfectly well the things that should be done, and should not be done in a school like this. I consider Mr. Caldwell a very fine Principal. He is allowing his nerves to get the better of him, and resorts on occasion, on his own statement, to the use of the drug called in popular language Luminal. I told him this was a poor practice, but he uses it he says on Sundays to help him to get through the many duties of that day.\n\nThe heating of the school is by means of hot water.\n\nI wish to recommend that the boiler expert, Mr Arnall, be sent to examine the boiler at this school, and to advise on what might be done to protect the laundry machinery or rather the children using it from accident. Only a very short time ago one boy had his arm smashed up in the extractor and has in consequence lost the arm.\n\nI suggested the erection of simple wooden guards which could be done by the Manual Training Class or the older boys in the case that there is no actual Manual Training Class. I told the Principal that I should recommend that the Boiler Inspector be sent to the school and that he would then no doubt examine the other machinery at the school and advise.\n\nThe wash rooms and kitchen, and other parts of the school, with exceptions noted above, were in reasonably clean condition.\n\nI believe that I have covered in general the more important items noted during the inspection.\n\nAn approved oil burner is being used in the kitchen range, and vitrified ware is being used on the children's dining tables in place of old enamelled plates and mugs.\n\nDuncan, B.C.\nMarch 20, 1938.\n\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nGerald H.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am forwarding herewith my report on the Ahousaht Indian Residential School, West Coast Agency, which I inspected on April 5th, though I was a guest of the school for several days.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Ashbridge was with me during the larger part of the inspection.\n\nMuch of the work done during my time at Ahousaht was in connection with my School Survey of the West Coast Agency. The report on this will have now been read, and I would ask you to consider the general rather poor condition of things at Ahousaht as but one feature of the general school situation on the coast.\n\nI do not recommend any great expenditure on the present Ahousaht School. The building is not the property of the Indian Affairs Branch, but is owned by the Women's Missionary Society of the United Church of Canada.\n\nThere is quite sufficient lumber now at the school to allow for the erection in the village of Ahousaht of a good one room Day School. This lumber was provided for the new laundry and gymnasium building, but I would recommend that all further building operations at the Ahousaht Residential School be delayed till a decision has been reached as to where a Residential School is to be located on the Coast.\n\nI believe that Ucluelet is the proper place for the Consolidated School, and that Ahousaht can be taken care of by a good one room Day School.\n\nThe present Principal's Residence here would serve as a home for the local Missionary and/or a boarding place for the teacher of the proposed Day School.\n\nThe present school building here will probably serve for another couple of years without much further outlay. It is not well designed as a school and there is distinct risk in case of fire. In many places there are openings where fire could rush up to the dormitories from the ground floor. In fact the sooner that the present Ahousaht School building is given up as a Residential School the better.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT ON AHOUSAHT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nUnited Church of Canada West Coast Agency.\n\nDate of Inspection: April 5, 1937.\nI was at the school from the 3rd of April to the 6th.\n\nNumber of pupils in residence: Boys 26\nGirls 28\nTotal: 54\n\nNumber of classrooms and number of desks in each:\nThere are two classrooms with 25 and 37 single desks.\n\nNumber of classes and number of pupils in each class:\n\n| Classification | Grade | Boys | Girls | Total |\n|----------------|-------|------|-------|-------|\n|                | 7A    | 0    | 3     | 3     |\n|                | 7B    | 3    | 3     | 6     |\n|                | 5     | 4    | 3     | 7     |\n|                | 4A    | 2    | 1     | 3     |\n|                | 4B    | 3    | 0     | 3     |\n|                | 3     | 4    | 5     | 9     |\n|                | 2     | 3    | 5     | 8     |\n|                | 1A    | 3    | 1     | 4     |\n|                | 1B    | 2    | 3     | 5     |\n| Kindergarten   |       | 2    | 4     | 6     |\n| Totals         |       | 26   | 28    | 54    |\n\nSo far the above mentioned Kindergarten children have not been in the classroom. I have asked that they be given some instruction in future, and this will now be done.\n\nPrincipal's Name: Mr. A. B. Caldwell.\n\nClassroom teachers: Mr. Walter Mathews: Age 21.\n\nMr. Mathews was trained in the Victoria Normal School, and holds a B.C. Second Class Interim Certificate. This is Mr. Mathews first year here, and he has had no previous experience.\n\nMiss Margaret Knott: Age 26.\n\nMiss Knott is a Graduate in Arts of the University of British Columbia (1931). She was trained in the U.B.C. Teachers' Training Course, and holds an Interim B.C Academic Certificate. While this is her first regular year of teaching, she has had some substitute work in the Victoria High School.\n\nRemarks relative to methods employed by teachers:\n\nMr. Mathews is very anxious to follow the most approved methods. He is a little inclined to think that the facts as given in a text book are the main thing to be taught, and has not yet had experience enough to teach a good oral lesson in which the atmosphere of a foreign country is brought into the classroom. He has however been most active in helping in every way in the general work of the school, and is likely to be quite a success as a teacher. He has a good manner with the children.\n\nMiss Knott B.A., has also helped in every possible way, and has a very nice manner in the classroom. She is anxious to take advice and will with time and further instruction train into a good teacher. It is her first year and I am not yet able to judge what Grades she will prove best with.\nReport on Ahousant Indian Residential School:\n\nRemarks relative to examination of pupils:\n\nSenior Room: Teacher Mr. W. Mathews: 25 single desks.\n\nMorning Class: Grades 7A, 3; 5, 7; and 4 A & B 6. Total 16.\nAfternoon Class: Grade 7B, 6; and Grades 4 A & B 6 Total 12.\n\nThe above work on the Half Day System, with the exception that as the Grade 4A and 4B classes are quite young they are at present in school all day.\nAfter a month the Morning Class becomes the Afternoon, and the latter are in school in the Morning.\nThis is all very satisfactory.\n\nReading: Grade 7A are reading the Canadian Book of Prose and Verse Book 2. In this they are doing good work and show some knowledge of the literature.\nGrade 7B are working at Treasure Island, having finished the Highroads Reader Book 6. I have suggested the Lady of the Lake as a suitable text for the rest of the year.\nReading Exercises Book 2 are also used here.\nGrade 5 have finished Highroads Reader Book 5 and are reading the old Canadian Reader Book 5. Grade 4 are reading the Highroads Reader Book 4 as outlined in the Course suggested.\nReading Exercise Work Books are used in Grades 5 and 4 with good success. The whole of the above Reading is above the average. The children speak out clearly and read with some expression. Just a little more work is needed in the Reading Exercise Books to make this almost a perfect class.\n\nArithmetic: Grade 7A are working Discount and Interest. Grade 7B are starting Simple Interest. The Canadian Problem and Practice Arithmetic Book 3 is used.\nGrade 5 have finished Fractions and are starting Decimals.\nThe Second Book of the Canadian Problem and Practice Arithmetics has been covered and problem work taken from Sheffield and Brown's Text Book 2. Grade 4 have about finished Book 1 of the Canadian Problem and Practice Series. They have finished Long Multiplication and Long Division and are to start Fractions.\nThe whole of the above is quite good. In the All Canada Test in the Fundamentals\n\nGrade 7A made a Mid Score of 89 the Norm being 35\nGrade 7B made a Mid Score of 86 the Norm being 33\nGrade 5 made a Mid Score of 82 the Norm being 27\nGrade 4 made a Mid Score of 80 the Norm being 21\n\nThe above scores are very satisfactory indeed.\n\nSpelling: This is taught from the Canadian Spellers.\nGrade 4 was the only Grade tested with the Buckingham Syllable Scale Columns \"L\" \"M\" and \"N\" 25 words.\nGrade 4 made a Mid Score of 94% the June 1927 Norm being 84%\nArt: This is not well taught at present. I have suggested that a copy of the B.C. Manual in Drawing and Design be requisitioned. No colour work appears to have been done.\n\nLanguage: At least one exercise a day from the English Usage and Composition Work Book must be done.\nIf necessary more Work Books should be requisitioned as this work in Language is most important.\n\nGeography and History: I indicate what type of work to be undertaken and taught the Senior Grades with the two teachers present an oral lesson outlining the British and European History for the past two thousand years, and leading up to the Canadian History which should be taught to the children.\n\nGeneral Achievement: This was measured with the B.C. Tests. In the 1928 B.C. Test Grade 7A made a Mid Score of 70 Norm being 62, while Grade 7B made 58 Norm being 58. Grade 5 made a Mid Score of 39 in the 1924 Test for Juniors, the Norm being 35, while Grade 4 made a Mid Score of 31 the Norm being 26. The teaching and control of the children is very satisfactory indeed, and Mr Mathews has made a very good start here.\nReport on Ahousaht Indian Residential School: Page 3.\n\nRemarks relative to the examination of the pupils: Continued:\n\nJunior Room: Teacher Miss M. Knott B.A., 27 Single Desks\n\nAll Day Class: Grade 2: Grade 2 8: Grade 1A 4:\nGrade 1B 5: Total 26.\n\nReading: Grade 1B have finished Two Little Indians.\nThey are about one third of the way through Friends.\nThey read well, and should work through Highroads Primer\nfrom the Blackboard. Grade 1A are about one third of the\nway through Highroads Reader Book 1. They have finished\nFriends, and the Highroads Reader Book from the Board. The above\nchildren read very well indeed for their Grades.\nGrade 2 are a B+ class and are working through Highroads Book 2\nin accordance with the suggested course handed to the teacher.\nThey stick up well and should go on with Grade 2 A course.\nAll but two of this Sub Grade will be ready for Grade 3 in\nSeptember. Grade 3 are working through Highroads Book 3\naccording to the suggested Course. They suffer from too many\neye fixations per line, and require practice in oral work\nfrom the Text and from the Board. Two exercises per week\nare done in Grade 3 from the Reading Exercise Work Book.\nThe whole of the above Reading is on the whole very satisfactory.\n\nArithmetic: Grade 1B know the Combinations to 5 and the\ncorresponding Separations. They should go on in\nthis Sub Grade till the end of June. Grade 1A know the\nCombinations and Separations to 10 very well but are backward\nfor the time of the year according to the standards of our\nIndian schools. The teacher has followed the New B.C. Course\ntoo closely. Grade 2B Add and Subtract without Borrowing and\nCarrying. They are quite good in the above, and should go\non with Grade 2A's work, Borrowing and Carrying etc.\nGrade 3 are doing average work. They can Add and Subtract,\nand work Short Multiplication and Short Division, to times 5.\nIn the All Canada Test Grade 3 made a Mid Score of 9 which\nis a little low as the Norm is 12.5 for this time of the year.\n\nGeography: The children are on a journey around the world,\nwith the help of the Book of Boys and Girls Round\nthe World.\n\nArt and Handwork: Still very elementary. Some paper folding\nhas been done.\n\nSinging: Teacher has been using a portable organ.\nI had her teach a lesson without organ and the\nresult was far better.\n\nGeneral: While the work is of course elementary in this\nroom, I consider that Miss Knott has done quite\nwell. She has not been trained for Primary Work, but more\nfor work in High School as all that pass through the Teacher\nTraining Class of the University are. Miss Knott will do\nwell to take a Summer School Course this year, and I shall\nhelp her later to choose suitable courses. Miss Knott's\ncontrol is good.\n\nWhile I was at the school there was heavy rain\nand about one quarter of the floor of this room was an inch\ndeep in water that came in under the door in a little river.\nNeither this nor the Senior Room are worth\npreservation if a Day School is established in the Ahousaht\nVillage later. Till then the accommodation here will have\nto be made the best of by teacher and children.\nVocational Training:\n\nThe Vocational Instruction of the Girls is that usual in the Indian Residential Schools in this Province. They learn to cook, and carry out the various cleaning operations in the house. They sew, mend, darn, patch, crochet, knit, etc. In the way of Arts and Crafts some very nice bead work is done by the older girls. There do not appear to be any special classes for the Girls in the Vocational Training. They simply learn by doing the various operations. One or two of the older girls help in the Principal's Residence and thus gain a knowledge of more advanced house work, cooking, etc.\n\nI should like to see far more definite instruction given in Arts and Crafts which would enable the Indian women to make a little money by work done in their own homes. Much of the mat work and weaving around articles done on the West Coast is very well carried out and in advance of the same sort of thing done in other parts of British Columbia.\n\nThe Half Day System has been extended here as recommended in my former report of March 1936 Page 4. Although Mr. R. F. Schuetze has been appointed as Manual Training Instructor, and the school receives the usual grant of some $480.00 per annum towards salary, little if any regular Manual Training has been done.\n\nIt will be remembered that the Indian parents approached me and asked that their boys be taught the maintenance and repair of marine engines. This is mentioned on Page 4 of my last report. Nothing has so far been done in this line of activity.\n\nThe Principal tells me that they have been much occupied in the following projects in which the boys helped. I shall give the Principal's own words:\n\n\"Work done by the boys during the year:\nCarpentry and building construction in building of a residence at the school, a porch in front of the school building, additions to fire escape, floor laying in school building, cement mixing. Gardening in planting and care of rhubarb and small fruits. General in clearing of land and pulling stumps by machinery. Various engine repairs and construction of stump pulling machinery. Occasional fishing by older boys.\"\n\nI doubt that the work done in pulling stumps has been worth while. The new Principal's Residence was no doubt needed if the school is to be carried on here. The additions to the Fire Escapes were necessary.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that the Vocational Training here is not anything more than just the ordinary everyday work of the school, and far below the standard that I expected when I recommended the extension of the Half Day System. In a small school with a small staff it is most difficult to arrange for the type of Manual Training and other Vocational Training which will be of use to the pupils on graduation. I still consider that there is room for a great advance in this sort of work at this school.\n\nFire Protection: This was covered in detail in my last report. Briefly I may say that the ropes recommended in the new dormitory building have been placed there. Rings have not been fitted. The ropes are tied to the beds. The screens over the windows through which exit is made from the dormitories to the fire escapes have been removed, and the windows are only fixed with small hooks which any child could open in a second.\n\nThe escapes have been continued to the ground as I recommended.\n\nThe Principal tells me that he has been provided with a copy of the regulations for Fire Drills. I am satisfied that Drills are carried out, the one I saw during my visit was \"Satisfactory\".\nFire Protection: Continued.\n\nThe following are the exact words of the Principal with regard to Fire Appliances as handed in a statement to me.\n\n\"Three fire gongs, one on second and third floor of main building, one in outside dormitory. Two automatic switches, one on main and one on second floor of main building. Two switches, one in basement furnace room, one in outside dormitory building. Any and all of these switches and automatic alarms will operate all gongs.\n\nTwo outside wooden fire escapes, one on each side of the building, opening out of all dormitories. Steps kept sanded. Windows affording egress to fire escapes sufficiently large for exit, approached in smaller children's dormitories by short steps from inside; all exit windows easily opened, two on hinges. Axes kept at each window. Three fire pails, kept full, in each dormitory. Two exits by stairs from outside dormitory, in which are also ropes affording exit from all windows.\n\nNight watchman patrolling building, inside and out, at night. Fire drills taken. Time for emptying school and checking children outside under daylight drill conditions, 1 minute.\n\nAll members of staff instructed in fire emergency duties. Seven fire extinguishers distributed throughout building and in lighting power house. Gasoline for engines kept well away from buildings.\n\nNo fires kept in any premises throughout the night.\"\n\nI am now satisfied that Fire Drills are being held in this school.\n\nDormitories: The general condition of the dormitories does not appear to me to be as good as on former visits. The rooms require more airing, and windows should be kept open even at night.\n\nWhen I visited one of the Boys' Dormitories the windows in the day time were all closed; there was a definitied smell in the room. I turned down ONE bed and found that the sheets and mattress had been wet by the boy under the bed beside on. This was of course pointed out to the Principal who tells me that the boy in question is one of those from Alberni Residential School, who does not as yet altogether know the rules of the school on this matter. I think the dormitories might be cleaner and the beds better made up.\n\nThere are plenty of covers for the children. Some of the mattresses have been renewed since my last visit.\n\nThere were no signs of overcrowding.\n\nDining Rooms: The floors of the Dining Room and Kitchen have been renewed since my last visit.\n\nAs I spent several days at the school, I had a good opportunity to observe the type of meals served to the children.\n\nThe Weekly Menu is the same as that copied into my last report, and it is not being repeated here for that reason. The Principal tells me that he is supplying rather more fish now.\n\nThe Kitchen and Dining Room are clean and the meal served in a satisfactory manner. The food is in my opinion of sufficient quantity, good quality, and fair variety.\nInspector's Report on Ahousaht School:\n\nWater Supply: This is as previously reported from a surface well. The quality of the water is satisfactory, though the colour is a distinct yellow.\n\nPumped from the well the water is stored in a small tank located over the Girls' Fire Escape at the end of the school building. The pressure in the hose pipes is very low, as the tank is on a level with the top of the building.\n\nThere is no possibility of successful attack on a fire which had any start. The proper thing to do here is to clear the building in case of fire and let the school burn. There is not sufficient water to fight fire in any case.\n\nSanitary Conditions:\n\nWhile I believe that the Principal and Staff do all they can to keep the place clean, the general impression received from a thorough examination of the whole school is one of lack of a high standard of cleanliness.\n\nIt is true that in such an old building as this the cleaning of floors etc. is difficult. I still believe that more could be done, and the children trained in dusting and polishing, at least to a greater extent than is being done at the moment. The dormitories need greater attention.\n\nI explained in my last report the lack of sufficient toilet and washroom accommodation.\n\nThere are only two wash basins and one wash tub downstairs for all the boys. There is no toilet upstairs for the use of the boys at night. There are in fact only two downstairs toilets for the boys.\n\nOn the Girls' side the toilet accommodation is a little better. Here there are a bath, two wash basins, and a toilet upstairs, and one wash basin and two toilets on the ground floor.\n\nThe children are clean. They receive at least one warm supervised bath per week. The Principal informs me that two boys have to share the bath together.\n\nThe kitchens and other parts of the school are clean. On the whole the school is not tidy.\n\nThe general sanitary condition of the school might I think be greatly improved even if the building is so old that its replacement within a few years in either Ahousaht or other coast village is a matter of necessity.\n\nGeneral:\n\nThe children are well clothed, and appear happy. There is a good tone in the school. The whole place is administered as a sort of large family.\n\nThe classroom work is one of the best features of the school. The lack of definite Manual Training has been noted, and I am sorry that more instruction in marine engine work has not been attempted. Too much time has been given to clearing land which I much doubt will ever be used.\n\nFar more supervised play is necessary.\n\nThe old Basket Ball court, made of a large wooden playground, has been allowed to fall into such a state of disrepair that it is impossible to use it. The new playroom or gymnasium will be held up till the Indian Affairs Branch decides just where a new Residential School will be placed.\n\nI doubt that the general administration is as good as it was on the occasion of my last inspection, and I would ask that the decision as to the location of any new school be made as soon as possible.\n\nDuncan B.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 8,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am forwarding herewith my report on the Ahousaht Indian Residential School, West Coast Agency, which I inspected on March 14th, though I was at the school from March 13th to the morning of the 15th.\n\nDuring my visit I had plenty of time to note the conditions of the school, and was glad to find that there had been some improvement in the sanitary state of the buildings since my previous report.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Ashbridge was not with me during any part of the inspection as he was delayed by the great storm we have had on the west coast this last week. He will however see the school on his present inspection trip up the coast, and I spoke to him of one or two matters when we met at Tofino the most important of which was the provision of outside toilet accommodation for the boys. I think that the school will be able to arrange this without expense or reference to the Department. Mr. Caldwell was informed by me that if he wished to use any part of the available lumber at the school he would have to get the sanction of the Department as this lumber was provided for a laundry, etc., at present held up till the Indian Affairs Branch decide on the location of a new Residential School on the West Coast.\n\nMrs Caldwell has been ill and had I am told an operation when in Victoria a few months ago. She is not taking any part in the management of the school now. She looked to me rather ill.\n\nI explained to Mr. Caldwell that what he called the Indian Agent's promise that a new Residential School would be built this year should never have been given as the Indian Agent has no knowledge of where or when the Department may decide to build a school. I told him that I did not know just what would be done, but that in any case he had better make arrangements to continue the Ahousaht Residential School for at least another year from September 1938. I explained that it would take time to build a new Residential School in any case and that I was not certain that the Department would have the funds necessary this year. His own letter from the Woman's Missionary Society indicates that Mr. Hoey considered that no funds were available in the 1938-39 estimates and that the use of the Ahousaht School must be continued for the present.\n\nI do not think that there is anything else of a confidential nature to which your attention should be drawn at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6431, File 876-6, part 1)\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT ON AHOUAHT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nUnited Church West Coast Agency\n\nDate of inspection: March 14th 1938.\nI was at the school from the 13th to the morning of the 15th, but the main part of the inspection was on the 14th.\n\nNumber of pupils in residence:\nBoys 38\nGirls 30\nTotal 68\n\nNumber of classrooms and number of desks in each:\nThere are two classrooms with 26 and 38 single desks.\n\nNumber of classes and number of pupils in each class:\n\n| Classification | Grade | Boys | Girls | Total |\n|----------------|-------|------|-------|-------|\n| Division 1     | 8A    | 0    | 2     | 2     |\n|                | 8B    | 2    | 2     | 4     |\n|                | 7     | 3    | 4     | 7     |\n|                | 6     | 6    | 2     | 8     |\n|                | 5     | 1    | 5     | 6     |\n|                | 4     | 0    | 0     | 0     |\n| Division 2     | 3     | 9    | 6     | 15    |\n|                | 2     | 5    | 1     | 6     |\n|                | IA    | 2    | 2     | 4     |\n|                | IB    | 1    | 1     | 2     |\n|                | IC    | 9    | 5     | 14    |\n\nTotals: 38 30 68\n\nPrincipal's name: Mr. A. E. Caldwell.\n\nClassroom teachers:\n\nMr. Walter Mathews: Age 22.\nThis teacher was trained at the Victoria Normal School, and holds a B.C. Interim Second Class Certificate. He attended the Provincial Summer School in Victoria in 1937 to take the necessary courses towards his permanent standing as a teacher in this Province. He will need to again attend the Provincial Summer School this year to satisfy the Provincial regulations, after which he will be an applicant for a Permanent Certificate. I shall recommend the granting of this as Mr. Mathews shows ability as a teacher, can follow suggestions and has a nice manner with the children in the classroom.\n\nMiss Katherine Scoats: Age 19\nThis girl is still very young in many ways. It is her first year teaching, and she has still much to learn. Miss Scoats was trained at the Victoria Normal School, and at present holds an Interim Second Class Certificate in B.C. She will have to attend the Provincial Summer School in Victoria this year to obtain credits towards her permanent standing as a teacher.\n\nRemarks relative to methods employed by teachers:\n\nThere is little to add to the above; these two young teachers are trying to carry out my suggestions. They were given definite instructions before first taking up their positions and have been given many suggestions during this present inspection. Mr. Mathews is a great success in the duties falling to him outside the actual classroom work.\nReport on Ahousaht Indian Residential School:\n\nRemarks relative to examination of the pupils:\n\nSenior Room Division 1: Teacher Mr. W. Mathews 26 desks.\n\nMorning Class: Grades 5, 6, 7B and 8A 16 pupils\nAfternoon Class: Grades 7A, 8A and 8B and 6 one Boy 14.\nThe children are working on the Half Day System but the Grade 8A class is in school all day as is one boy in Grade 6, who is unable to do much work outside.\nThese Morning and Afternoon classes change around monthly.\n\nIn general the children have been promoted to their present Grades on the opening of the Spring Term February 1st last.\nThe afternoon class is much brighter than the Morning group of pupils.\nThe Arithmetic is well up to standard. I have suggested a better grouping of Grades for this subject. Grades 5 and 6 can always be taught together in such schools as this, while Grades 7 and 8 should also work together in Arithmetic. One of the two girls in Grade 8A could write the Entrance Examination Test in June. None should however go on to actual High School work.\nReading is quite good. The Reading Exercise Work Books are being used properly and answers placed in the ordinary exercise books and not the actual Work Books thus saving these for another year. More Choral Reading is necessary to teach the proper reading of Phrases.\nIn all Grades the English Usage and Composition Work Books are used with success. At least one exercise is now done a day in each Grade.\nThe prescribed texts in Elementary Science are being used with some success.\nThe writing of the various Grades is now quite good.\nSinging is satisfactory.\nNot sufficient attention has been given to Art.\nI spent some time in talking to children and teacher with regard to this. The whole subject of the work to be sent to Vancouver for the forthcoming Arts and Crafts Exhibition was gone into with care after Evens Prayers when the Staff and older pupils were all together.\nI think rather advanced texts are being used in History in Grades 7 and 8. This is to prepare the pupils for the High School Entrance Test. I taught an outline lesson on British History to link this up with World and Canadian History, and suggested that the teacher would do well to just fill in the detail in the outline thus given.\nSpelling is good.\nGeography is perhaps just satisfactory. More work is necessary on the various parts of the British Empire.\n\nThough there has not been much change since the last inspection in the type of work done I do think that there has been some progress.\n\nStill more oral teaching is necessary. This is of course just where young teachers find the work so difficult. They rely far too much on texts which they have not themselves read in many cases. May I here again suggest that the Department while giving all the Work Books asked for cut down the supply of actual text books to a minimum. One of each of the new texts in History and Geography and Science is all that is necessary. I much dislike to see the dozens of beautiful texts in some cases the teacher does not know anything like enough of the subjects to make it possible for the children to make use of the books so freely given by the Department. Work Books are of course in a different class and these are as a rule not very expensive and might well be distributed freely to give all the pupils a chance to improve their English.\nReport on Ahousaht Indian Residential School: Page 3.\n\nRemarks relative to examination of pupils continued:\n\nJunior Room Division 2 Teacher Miss K. Sceats 38 desks.\n\nAll Day Class: Grades 3, 2, and 1. 38 pupils in all.\n\nThe children in these Grades were promoted to the various classes and Sub Grades in September.\n\nIn general the Reading is quite good. Grade 1C know some 60 Sight Words and are about halfway through Two Little Indians. With an experienced teacher this would now be finished. Grade 1B are at the end of Friends, and should now read the Highroads Primer from the Board and do other reading work in any texts available. Grades 1A, 2, and 3 are reading the Highroads Reader and Grade 3 works the exercises in the Reading Exercise Work Book. Grades 3 and 2 are doing very good work in Arithmetic. Grade 3 knows Short Multiplication and Short Division to times 8, while Grade 2 can add and subtract when there is carrying and borrowing. The various Sub Grades of Grade 1 are far too slow in the Combinations and Separations. They must work quick drills daily and this has of course been explained to the teacher.\n\nThe Writing is very satisfactory. Art Work has improved since my last inspection.\n\nThe teacher has some very good work on the Boards. She has been given many suggestions.\n\nIt must be understood that this young teacher has as yet very little idea of the real methods which bring success in the classroom. Many old fashioned ideas of control and punishment will have to be eliminated, and she will need to understand the psychology of education better before she can be classified as a successful teacher.\n\nSome distinct progress has been made since my last inspection however, and the general standing of the Grades is satisfactory.\n\nLooking on the work of the two Divisions as a whole I may say that the duration given in this school is at much the same level as that of last year. Individual pupils have made progress, and Mr. Mathews has improved a little in his oral teaching. Much remains to be done still.\n\nSuggestions of all sorts have been made to improve the work in the various Grades. I have taught lessons myself and obtained very good response from the pupils.\n\nThe children coming on from the late Alberni Indian Residential School have upset the work here, just as they have at the Ucluelet Indian Day School.\n\nThe Alberni Indian Residential School was so badly managed that its effects are now being felt in the other schools to which pupils have been transferred.\n\nWith kind treatment and good teaching technique Mr. Mathews and Miss Sceats may again bring these Divisions to the standard achieved before the arrival of the Alberni children.\nVocational Training:\n\nThe whole of my remarks under this heading on Page 4 of my report of April 14th 1937 might with truth be copied here.\n\nI am attaching as Page 5 of this report the statement of Manual and Vocational Training prepared for me at Ahousaht.\n\nI am inclined to think that the girls get a good training in the usual work of a house. They learn to cook, sew, mend, darn, crochet, knit, and bake. A few of the older children help in the Principal's House and probably gain more from this than from the ordinary instruction in the school kitchens etc.\n\nMore instruction would be of advantage in Indian Arts and Crafts. My evening talk to staff and senior pupils will I believe lead to the employment of a Mrs. Nellie Jacobson (Indian) who could well instruct in basket making and weaving and bead work. The school will exhibit in Vancouver in the forthcoming Arts and Crafts Exhibition which has here already given incentive to greater effort in those arts which might bring in a little income to children on graduation.\n\nThe Mr. R.F. Schuetze mentioned in my last report as having been appointed a Manual Training Instructor is no longer here. It appears that any well trained man can easily get more than $480.00 a year in the new gold mines starting near here.\n\nThough the Principal make quite a lot of the work done in Practical Engineering as stated on Page 5. I am not satisfied that in fact very much real training has been given. The work he speaks of is just that usual around a Residential School. It has been carried out under the supervision of his own son in part at least.\n\nMay I suggest that the grant of $480.00 made for Manual Training be withdrawn till a fairly well qualified man is appointed to the staff for this work. I am very much dissatisfied with the present Manual Training and Engineering, and find that the tools are not being in my opinion properly cared for. I could only find some of these, as they appear to be distributed in the boat, the Manual Training Shop, and other places.\n\nFire Protection:\n\nThis has been covered in detail in my previous reports on the school. Windows leading to fire escapes are fixed with string and seals, and small hooks which can be opened in a moment.\n\nThe Fire Drill carried out at my request was very satisfactory.\n\nNo fires are kept in any of the buildings through the night. This has made conditions rather hard on the staff and children in the cold weather.\n\nA night watchman is employed for the six months November to April inclusive.\n\nThe Principal's report on the Fire Protection at the school is given as Page 6 of this report.\n\nThe fire hazard at this school is much greater than that in most of the other Indian Residential Schools in British Columbia.\nMANUAL and VOCATIONAL TRAINING.

March 1938.\n\nFIRE PREVENTION.\n\nHEATING. Hot water heating system from furnace in basement.\nOil-burning range in Kitchen.\nWood heaters in staff sitting-room, two class-rooms, one outside dormitory, and in laundry.\n\nESCAPES. 1. Girls side. One three-stair zig-zag wooden escape built in frame work under water storage tank. Opening through window to escape from junior girls' dormitory on third floor, and senior girls' dormitory on second floor.\n2. Boys side. One three-stair zig-zag wooden escape with opening through window from junior girls' dormitory on third floor, and senior boys' dormitory on second floor.\n3. Rear of main building. One three-stair zig-zag wooden escape, erected in 1937, with opening from window of staff bed-room on third floor, affording additional escape from third floor dormitories, and opening from window of nurse's bed-room and hospital balconies, affording additional escape from senior boys and senior girls dormitories on second floor.\n\nOutside junior boys' dormitory over workshop. Stairs leading to ground outside at front and back of building. Ropes attached at each window. Night watchman's quarters at rear of this dormitory.\n\nFIRE FIGHTING EQUIPMENT.\n\nExtinguishers. 4 Pyrene, 3 Guardene, all recharged in January 1938.\n2 Fire axes.\nThree water filled fire buckets on wall brackets near doorways in each dormitory, 15 in all. Two large buckets on landings.\nTwo-100 ft. lengths 2\" fabric hose with nozzles (in only fair condition) attached to pipes leading from water tank, one at each side ground floor of main building, and capable of being attached to pump machinery in laundry.\nThree large alarm bells, one each on first and second storey of main building and one in outside junior dormitory, all operating simultaneously from two alarm boxes, one on main floor and one on second floor, and from two switches, one in furnace room of school and one in watchman's quarters in outside junior dormitory.\n\nWATER SUPPLY. Pumped from shallow well at rear of laundry, via pump machinery in laundry to 4800 gallon storage tank on level with peak of roof of school building. Pressure from tank through fire hose scarcely sufficient to throw jet to second storey of school building.\n\nFire Drills. Weekly fire drills during term, using fire escapes from dormitories. All pupils can be evacuated from dormitories to assembly platform adjoining classrooms in slightly less than one minute.\nFire escapes are kept sanded. Senior pupils are stationed at windows opening on escapes to assist pupils. Senior boys are stationed at hose and pump engines.\nAll windows to escapes are kept on hook and eye fasteners and are easy to open. A member of the staff is in charge of each dormitory. The watchman is on duty from 7 p.m. until 7 a.m., making half-hourly patrols.\n\nOwing to recognised excessive fire hazard due to poor construction and old cedar building, furnace fires have only been kept when absolutely necessary, and seldom all night.\nDormitories:\n\nThe general condition of the dormitories is much better than that noted on the occasion of my last visit.\n\nThe beds were better cared for than has been the case in the past. I understand that one of the lady members of the staff now has charge of the dormitories.\n\nSeveral new mattresses have been purchased since my last visit. The children have plenty of covers. On each bed I found a mattress, these vary in condition, a pillow, pillow slip and pair of flannel sheets, two quilts and a blanket.\n\nThere were no signs of overcrowding.\n\nDining Rooms:\n\nI spent almost two days at the school from the 13th to the 15th of March, and had an opportunity to see several meals served to the children.\n\nI have included the Diet Sheet prepared for me at the school as Page 8 of this report.\n\nThe kitchen and dining room are clean though the building is so old that tableware is properly served. I think that fresh white linoleum or heavy oil cloth might be placed on the tables this summer, and would suggest that the Indian Agent take this into consideration as I have not mentioned it to the Principal.\n\nThe food is good and of sufficient variety. The children have plenty to eat.\n\nWater Supply:\n\nThis is from a surface well. The quality of the water is satisfactory I believe though the colour is a distinct yellow.\n\nI understand that when the septic tank overflowed and sewage backed up under the school some might possibly have drained into the well through the surface soil. The water being tested for bacteria I understand.\n\nPumped from the well, which is located well to the rear of and below the level of the school the water is stored in a small tank over the Girls' Fire Escape. The pressure in the fire hose is of course very low as the tank is level with the top of the school building.\n\nThere is no possibility of fighting a fire here if it once took hold of the old building.\n\nThe septic tanks are well down towards the sea in front of the school and on the opposite side to the well. Between the tanks and the well there is a ridge of rock on which the actual school is built. I do not think that the well water has been contaminated in any dangerous manner.\n**AHOUAHT RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL**\n\n**March 1938**\n\n**DIET LIST FOR ONE WEEK**\n\n| Day       | Breakfast                                      | Dinner                                      | Supper                                      |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| **SUNDAY**| Rolled Oats Porridge, Peanut-butter Sandwiches | Brown Beans, Bread, Apple Pie or Jelly     | Bread & Peanut B., Molasses Cookies, Cocoa, Preserved Fruit |\n|           | Milk                                           | Water                                      |                                             |\n| **MONDAY**| Oatmeal Porridge, Bread and Peanut B.          | Fresh or salted Salmon, Barley Soup         | Stewed Prunes, Peanut B.

G.H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C., together with his covering letter of the 7th instant, with respect to his inspection on April 4th of the Ahousaht Indian Day School, West Coast Agency, B.C.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSomass Hotel,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nApril 7, 1940.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am forwarding herewith my report on the Ahousaht Indian Day School, United Church, West Coast Agency, which I inspected on April 4th.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Ashbridge was with me for the greater part of this inspection.\n\nThis school is being conducted in the two old classrooms formerly part of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School. The school in its present location is on United Church property. The buildings are of little value and would not be worth moving, though possibly some of the windows might be made use of in a new day school should the Department decide to build one in the Ahousaht village as I have recommended. Blackboards in the Primary Room are not of much use for a new school while those in the Senior Room might be used in conjunction with new boards in the proposed new school. Desks could of course be used if they were mounted on the usual strips of wood.\n\nThe work done this last year in the Senior Division has been very poor in my opinion. Mr. Bain has not proved a success with Indian children, whatever he might be able to do with other pupils.\n\nThe work done by Miss Mackie in the Primary Room has been splendid. The children have made excellent progress, and we should be fortunate to retain the services of Miss Mackie in some Indian school.\n\nThe teachers were again warned that the work of the present school would come to an end on June 30th, the close of the present Academic Year. They had been previously informed of this of course.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Ashbridge and I again inspected possible sites for an Indian day school in the Ahousaht village, and I may say that we are in complete agreement that the best possible site is one just to the North of the rock outcrop near the centre of the village but located between two large open spaces on the sea front. He will write to you again about this site. It is mentioned in my previous letters on this subject.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nDivision 1\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nAhousaht (Day) Indian School Date of visit April 4th 1940\n\nPost Office address of school Indian Day School, Ahousaht, B.C.\n\nGrades 3 to 9 I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX\nBoys 10 2 5 7 0 4 0 1\nEnrolled Girls 9\n\nPresent Boys 10 Girls 9 (There are 19 desks)\n\nTeacher Archibald John James Bain Age 28\n(Name in full)\nLicence (or certificate) First Class B.C.\nValid to Permanent 19\nTaught last term in this school and Division.\nTotal teaching experience eight years\nService in Indian school two years\n\nConventions attended: Mr. Bain was trained at the Victoria Normal School. He has attended three Easter Conventions in B.C. and the Provincial Summer School in Victoria 1937. He is in third year at the University of British Columbia.\n\nThe school became a day school on February 26th 1940 and is being conducted till the end of June 1940 as a two room school. It was in the past part of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School.\n\nGeneral comment: The average quarterly attendance for Divisions 1 and 2 has been kept together by mistake and was for the quarter ending May 31st 1940 53.67. Only one register has been kept, and this will be continued till the end of June when the school will no doubt cease to exist in the present location, provided the new Ahousaht Indian Day School is erected in the Ahousaht village as is, I understand, the intention of the Department.\n\nThe general work done during the past year leaves much to be desired. Tested with B.C. Achievement Standard Tests that for Juniors 1934 in Grades 3, 4, and 5, and that for 1928 in Grade 7 the following poor results were recorded:\n\nGrade 3 Mid Score 3 Norm 17 Grade 7 Mid Score 41\nGrade 4 Mid Score 15 Norm 27\nGrade 5 Mid Score 22 Norm 34\n\nHealth and Singing have been taught with some success. Little or no work had been placed on the boards for the children. All Grades are now about a year below average.\n\nTeacher is negative, and though satisfactory control has been maintained I can see little sign of vigorous teaching. Teacher has not adapted his work to the needs of Indian children, and has been asked for the remaining time he is here to teach practical Arithmetic, Language, Health, and such subjects as will be of use to the pupils when they leave school. He has been warned that the present school will not be carried on after the end of the academic year, and that he should look out for other work.\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM.\n\nInspector of Schools.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nDivision 2\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nAhousaht (Day) Indian School Date of visit April 4th 1940.\n\nPost Office address of school Indian Day School, Ahousaht, B.C.\n\nGrades 1 and 2 I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX\nBoys 12 16 9\nGirls 13 16 9\n\nEnrolled Present Boys 8 Girls 12\n\nThere are some 40 single desks but this number includes 3 broken and a few which are very old.\n\nTeacher Miss Mary Helen Mackie Age 46\n(Name in full)\n\nLicence (or certificate) Alberta Second Class\nValid to Permanent 19\n\nTaught last term in Substitute teacher in Lethbridge City schools.\n\nTotal teaching experience 12 years\n\nService in Indian school 1 years\n\nConventions attended Provincial Summer School Edmonton - British teachers' course and part of Primary course.\n\nMiss Mackie taught for some five years in Scotland and for between five and six years in Peace River, Alberta.\n\nA full hot luncheon is served to the children daily.

Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C., with respect to his inspection on the 3rd and 4th of this month of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School, West Coast Agency. A copy of the Inspector's covering letter is also attached.\n\nThe water supply for fire fighting purposes appears to be inadequate. It is not expected, however, that the Department would favorably consider the expenditure involved on improving the system or wish to make any changes necessitating important expenditures in view of the likelihood of the Ahousaht School being discontinued once a new residential school replacing the one destroyed by fire at Alberni is provided.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

The Principal has a nearly new house adjoining the school buildings. The Department of course does not own this school.\n\nThe actual academic work is satisfactory, and the children appear well clothed and fairly clean. I hope that they receive the weekly warm bath which I was told they had.\n\nThe Indian Agent is active and has visited this school regularly. I do not believe that he is very well satisfied with the administration. As no doubt the Ahousaht Residential School will soon be absorbed in a new Indian Residential School at Alberni or other point I am not prepared to make any recommendation as to a change of Principals. I do not believe that the Department should spend much on this old building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

He was given help along a number of lines, lessons being taught for him where necessary. More definite oral work is needed by these Grades. The main difficulty is that the teacher is not experienced with Indian children yet, though he has had satisfactory experience with the children in the Provincial Day Schools.\n\nHis work is almost certain to improve during the next year. Two pupils of Grade 6, Viola George age 17 and John Jobson Age 16 were recommended for a Provincial High School Entrance Certificate.

No technical manual training, as this is understood in Provincial schools, has been attempted. In fact there has not, as far as I can learn, been a qualified Manual Training Instructor here since this matter was last reported on by me in March 1928.\n\nEngineering has received some attention in that the Principal's son has given instruction on several old engines, and in the working of the school launch.\n\nThe training of the girls appears to me to be far better than that of the boys. They are taught to cook, sew, mend, darn, crochet, knit and bake. The older girls in turn help in the Principal's house.\n\nIn the fourth paragraph of Page 4 of my report on this school dated March 20th 1928 I mentioned that I had spoken on the subject of Arts and Crafts to the staff and older pupils. The practical result has been that the Indian mentioned in that paragraph, Mrs Belle Jacobson, was employed for some months to teach the girls to work etc. The bead work belts shown to me at the school and made since my last inspection were of the very highest quality. One in particular is the best bead work belt I have seen in B.C. It will be exhibited in the Canada Pacific Exhibition this year in Vancouver.\n\n(b) Fire Protection:\n\nOn Page 4 of this report will be found the complete statement furnished to me by the Principal with regard to Fire Protection. The Fire Drill carried out for me at the school was quite satisfactory.\n\nThere is a definite fire hazard at this school. A night watchman is employed during the winter months. I noticed that the asbestos protection between the smoke pipe of the furnace and the wooden beams of the basement ceiling had been damaged in some way. I asked that this protection be repaired. No cost is involved, and I mention it here so that the Indian Agent who will read this report may satisfy himself on his next visit to the school that there is in fact satisfactory protection between this smoke pipe and the wooden ceiling of the basement. The air space I refer to is less than a foot at the point referred to above.\n\n(c) Dining Room:\n\nOn Page 5 will be found a Diet Sheet prepared for me at the school. Meals were visited on several occasions. They were well served. The food is of good quality and variety, and the children have plenty to eat. Fresh white oil cloth has been placed on the dining tables.\nAHOUSAHT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nNumber of Pupils by Grade, as at April 4th 1939.\n\n| Grade | Boys | Girls | Total |\n|-------|------|-------|-------|\n| 1     | (a) 2 | 2     |       |\n|       | (b) 6 | 5     |       |\n|       | (c) 2 | 6     |       |\n|       | (d) 1 | 4     |       |\n|       | **11** | **17** | **28** |\n| 2     | 3    | 3     | 6     |\n| 3     | 5    | 2     | 7     |\n| 4     | 9    | 5     | 14    |\n| 5     | 1    | 4     | 5     |\n| 6     | 5    | 2     | 7     |\n| 7     | 1    | 3     | 4     |\n| 8     | 1    | 1     | 2     |\n|       | **36** | **37** | **73** |\n\nAbsent Pupils.\n\nTwo girls are absent with active T.B. on instructions of the medical Officer.

A second-hand 8 H.P. Fairbanks-Morse gas marine engine was purchased, repaired and set up, and successively overhauled by boys until fully acquainted with this type. Then this engine was traded for a 5 H.P. Vulcan gas marine engine of different type, on which the boys are now receiving instruction.\n2. Instruction in operating of a Fairbanks-Morse 6 H.P. gas stationary engine in laundry, a 2 H.P. gas engine used daily for pumping water, and a 110 Volt D.C. lighting engine.\n3. Repairing, renovation and gearing down of a winch used to haul fire-wood and freight from the beach, and also to clear land by stump-pulling, powered by a 3 H.P. gas engine.\n4. Engine operation and navigation of school launch used in landing of all school freight.\n5. Operation of laundry machinery.\n\nGeneral:- Cupboards, benches, sick-room trays etc have been made in the workshop.\nGround has been filled in in front of school to set out lawns and gardens, and shell paved walks have been laid.\nSpare time has been devoted to Indian handicrafts, eagles, totems, etc.\n\nGirls:\n1. Laundering, both by machine and hand. Ironing by hand.\n2. Cookery in kitchen, preparation of meals and baking of bread.\n3. General housekeeping in residence.\n4. Sewing, in classes.

Beds were properly cared for and there were sufficient covers. Sheets were clean.\n\nThere were no signs of overcrowding in any of the dormitories.\n\n(e) Water Supply:\n\nThe water is obtained from a surface well. This well is located to the rear of the school and at a lower level than the school, though care has been taken to protect it from sewage contamination.\n\nThe colour of the water is a light yellow but it has been tested again and again and found good for domestic use.\n\nWater is pumped from this well to a small tank located over the girls' fire escape. This tank is about the level of the roof of the school. No great pressure exists in the fire mains and it would not be possible to fight a fire at this school should it have taken any sort of hold on the old buildings.\n\n(f) General Conditions:\n\nThe children are well clothed and appear to be quite happy.\n\nThe toilets and wash places are clean. The staff in general appears to have been better selected than was the case some years ago. Mrs Caldwell is now much improved in health and her influence is for the good of the school.\n\nThe Principal put forward a number of plans by which the Indians would be helped in fishing if his statements may be believed. I should suggest to the Department that great care be exercised in considering Mr Caldwell's plans. The fact is that last year he informed me that he was making use of the drug called in popular language \"Luminol\". At the time I warned him against the use of such drugs, but I am not satisfied that he took my advice.\n\nThere has not perhaps been any very great change in the administration of the school since my last visit. The Principal again and again mentioned to me his wide experience with Indians in the past in other parts of Canada.\n\nThe Indian Agent keeps a very close eye on this school, and I am very glad that this is so. At times I doubt that conditions between inspections are up to the level found by me on my yearly visits. I have been informed that the children have a weekly warm bath supervised by one of the members of the staff, but the Indian Agent could know better from his examination of the children when he visits the school if this is so. The general standing of the school is \"Fair\".\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith report of Capt. G. H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for B. C., together with his letter of March 20th, covering his inspection on the 14th ultimo of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School, in the West Coast Agency.\n\nI agree with the suggestion made by Inspector Barry on page 4, paragraph 7, that the Manual Training grant of $480.00 be discontinued until a successor is appointed to Mr. R. F. Schuetze.\n\nThe Inspector's recommendations with respect to improving the toilet arrangements on the boys' side (See page 9) are concurred in.\n\nThe District Resident Architect is being asked to arrange to have Mr. Arnall, Engineer, inspect the boiler at this School and also examine the laundry machinery, and submit suggestions as to how more protection could be given to the children engaged in operating the laundry equipment.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

CAIRNS ON THE APPOUSAY BOARDING SCHOOL.\n\nFARMING\u2014\n\nImmediately behind where the school buildings are situated there was a lagoon. Its greatest depth was three feet in the winter. A channel was cut and this water all drained into the sea. This 15 acre area is now used by the school for agricultural purposes.\n\nThe soil is leached out and lacking in some of the elements necessary to produce vegetables and grain. Grass does not do well. Therefore, the agricultural effort has not been a success.\n\nIt is a fine level area of land. Underdrainage would doubtless help it. I advised the Principal to box up some of the soil and send it to the Department of Agriculture for analysis.\n\nI am quite certain this land can be made productive with proper treatment.\n\nReport dated\u2014June 24th, 1915.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit herewith for the consideration of the Department, Voucher No. 168, amounting to \u00a3136.32. This account was rendered by the Rev. Principal of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School for fencing material supplied to the above school.\n\nI have to state that no authority was asked for this expenditure.\n\nThe material was used to replace an old fence that had become past repair, and part of which had to be removed during the recent installation of the new plumbing and sewer system at that school.\n\nWhen asked why the Department was not asked for authority for this expenditure before the work was undertaken, the Rev. Principal informed me that he had been informed that there were no funds available at the time and it was necessary to have the work completed before the pupils returned to school after their summer holidays.\n\nThe renewal of the wornout fence was necessary, and I respectfully recommend favourable consideration of this account.\n\nEnc.,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd.

JOSEPH JONES, PRINCIPAL,\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, AHOUAHT, B. C., Jan. 6, 1931.\n\nThe construction of a plank road to connect\nthe school with Matilda Creek and to the road to the dock\nwhere the steamers unload. Since my first communication\nwith the Mission Board on this subject, the Provincial\nGovernment have begun work on a road from Gibsons Dock to\nDuncans at the head of Matilda Creek. (See the map of the\ndistrict showing proposed road and the different points\nmentioned). Upon completion of our road, we shall have a\ndirect connection with Matilda Creek where we can always\nget our freight without danger or loss, and we shall also\nbe connected with the provincial road which when completed\nwill enable us to load a truck at the steamer and unload\ndirectly into our store house. I want to impress upon\nyou the difficulties of the present way of landing our\nfreight on the open beach which is exposed to the rolling\nsurf of the Pacific. The Provincial Police attempted to\nland here in an empty yawl. The seas turned them over and\nour boys had to go to their help. On the 13th of Dec. it\nwas too rough to have the steamer stop here so our freight\nwas taken around to Gibson's dock, on the 17th the seas\nhaving gone down considerably Mr. Gibson offered to bring\naround my freight in their big boat the \"Anchorite\". (We\nhave no engine for our boat so I have to hire boats for\nall the work). The boat was driven aground on our beach.\nI hired three other boats to attempt salvage but it was\nimpossible to pull her off. The waves pounded her to\npieces before the next high tide. This boat was valued\nat $5,000.00. They had insurance on her up until three\nmonths ago, so it is a total loss to our neighbour\nexcept the parts we salvaged from the wreck the next\nday. Since then they have made three attempts to load the engine on a barge but the surf is too strong. Every Government and Church official who has visited here agree that a road to the calm waters of the Creek is necessary.\n\nThe proposed road will do this and in addition will eventually land us at the dock.\n\nThere is one other advantage in this road. We have here about 11 acres of level land (the bed of a lake drained by ditches) samples of this soil have been sent to the Agricultural College and they tell us we need to put fertilizer into the soil and say that kelp is the best. Every year tons of kelp is deposited on Powel Beach. This beach is less than 200 yards from the proposed road at one point. Here we propose to build a branch road out to the beach. Here we can haul the kelp to the farm, at present the land is too impoverished to grow anything, but with ample fertilizer we can grow enough feed to keep cows as well as provide vegetables for the school. At present all these have to be purchased in Victoria or Vancouver.\n\nThis road will also provide an excellent walk for the children. At present we have only a narrow plank walk from school to village.\n\nIt is proposed to build the road where it is close to ground of cedar, where it is above ground of fir and spruce. The enclosed sketch shows method of construction. You will see that the car or truck will be running on four inch plank. The centre is filled in with two inch plank. The logs at the side are safety buffers. Part of the road is through heavy timber. This will supply us with fuel for some years to come. The school land adjoins Mr. Duncan's land. He will we pleased to grant \"Right of way\" over his property.\n\nThe length of road will be a little less than 2000 yards including the branch to Powel Beach the cost I have carefully calculated to be no more than $6500.00.\n\nI hope you will give this item your best consideration.\nOttawa, January 21, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to improvements at the Ahousaht Indian Residential School. I write to enquire concerning your proposal to construct a plank road to connect the school with Matilda Creek and to the road to the dock. Please intimate what materials would have to be purchased and if any expert labour would be necessary. I presume that you would like authority to do this work on a day labour basis, under your own supervision - Indians to be employed as far as possible. If there is any large item for lumber, please indicate some of the local sources of supply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Joseph Jones,\nPrincipal Residential School,\nAhousaht, B. C.\nIndian Residential School\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nFebruary 6th 1931\n\nA.F. MacKenzie Esq.,\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honour to forward the information asked for in your letter of Jan 21st.\n\nThe Gibson Lumber Mill is situated on Matilda Creek about 2\u00bd miles from the school. They are in a position to supply the lumber at a cheap rate; they also have all the necessary equipment for the work. I have secured from them prices on lumber and also the rental for equipment. I shall be pleased to supervise this work and will employ Indian labour as far as possible.\n\nRental of Donkey Engine and Equipment $1.00 per hour\nRental of pile driver .50\nWages of Foreman .80\nWages of Donkey Engineer .60\nPrice of lumber delivered at road $19.00 per M.\nWages of labourers 40\u00a2 per hour .50 per hour\n\nThe piles for road will be cut by day labour. The amount of lumber for road and cross ties will be about 160 thousand feet; drift bolts and spikes will cost about $300.00.\n\nIf any other information is required I shall be glad to furnish the same.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph Jones\nPrincipal\n\nReplying to No. 159-2-9\nJan. 21st 1931\n\nIndian Affairs.

INSPECTOR BARRY\nDATED MARCH 29, 1936, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE\nAHOUAHT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\n- Original on No. 159-2-6. -\n\nThe available farm land, though I do not report on this matter as a rule, might well be put under cultivation now that it has been to a large extent drained. I would recommend that the Agricultural Agent for British Columbia be asked to visit the school to help the Principal with his farming problems.

The Principal needs the advice of an expert in farming as to how he may best use the available land.\n\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF MR. C. C. PERRY, ASST.\nINDIAN COMMISSIONER, DATED MARCH 31, 1936;\nFORWARDING MR. BARRY'S REPORT OF MARCH 29, 1936,\nTO THE DEPARTMENT.\n\nArrangements can conveniently be made to have our Indian Agricultural Agent visit this school and discuss with the Principal at the School what means can best be employed in order to bring the cultivable land into use. I have no record, however, of the area of land owned by the United Church in the school region and would like to have information on this point before asking the Indian Agricultural Agent to discuss plans for agricultural developments at the school. Perhaps the Department can furnish this information and possibly a plan of the parcel for identification purposes.\nOttawa, April 9, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe following is an extract from the report of Inspector Barry, regarding his visit to the Ahousaht Indian Residential School on the 29th ultimo:-\n\n\"The available farm land, though I do not report on this matter as a rule, might well be put under cultivation now that it has been to a large extent drained.

The Principal needs the advice of an expert in farming as to how he may best use the available land.\"\n\nPlease let me know if you agree that it will be possible to take any action along the lines suggested by the Inspector. From information before the Department at the present time, it is doubtful if the Inspector's suggestions could be put into effect.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of April 9, 1926, re farm land at Ahousat Indian Residential School and to report that I inspected the land in question and feel confident that much can be done in the matter of raising vegetables and small fruits. The land has been successfully drained and only needs fertilizer which can be obtained without cost as there is an abundance of kelp on the shore.\n\nThere is also a very well constructed barn in which cows can be kept, but would like the opinion of the Agricultural Agent on this matter, as I have some doubt regarding amount and quality of available feed.\n\nIt is respectfully recommended that in view of the nature of the soil and the recent drainage that for the present year only experimental work be carried out with a view to more extensive planting if successful.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, May 5th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of March 31st, last, enclosing copy of Inspector Barry's report, dated March 29th, regarding the Ahousaht Indian Residential School, the Department wrote Mr. Agent Ashbridge. He has replied stating that he considers something can be done in the raising of vegetables and small fruits, as the land available has been recently drained and only needs fertilizer, which can be obtained without cost. The Agent further states that, in view of the nature of the soil and the recent drainage, he considers it advisable to carry out experimental work only during the present year.\n\nMr. Ashbridge would, however, appreciate having the Indian Agricultural Agent visit the school and look over the farm with a view to making any suggestions he considers advisable. No doubt, you can arrange to have him do this, but it should be kept in mind that the Department is not in a position to incur any expenditure in connection with cultivating land at the Ahousaht Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.

You will notice that at present we are functioning without a Group Committee. We have had no camps and also, which may seem strange, no disbursements.\n\nAs this is an Indian Residential School and the people are here at all times and as there is nobody in the village who would be suitable on a Group Committee, Mr. Jones and I decided that it was not worth while bothering about such a group, yet. If it is desirable to have one in order to conform with the regulations, we can make one with the members of the staff. Things are entirely different up here from conditions in town and we have to \"wink the eye\" at a number of things, yet it is the Scout Law and Promise that have done a lot to make the situation as well as it is.\n\nWe are also handicapped in that we have no place which we can call our own. We use the dining room for our meetings; for the weather forbids any outside work and the room is certainly not conducive to good Scouting.\n\nA number of the boys at the village, ages between twenty and twenty five, wish to become Rovers. I have never had anything to do with Rover Scouts myself but I am sure that none of them, at present, could live up to the Rover standard. I have given them the books \"Rover Scouts, What They Are\" and am hoping that they will wish to take it up. It will be very difficult for them in the village and I am afraid many points will have to be overlooked but if a fellow is honestly doing his best, why stop him.\n\nMy plan is to have them on a different night to Scouts, but I am very handicapped when I attempt anything. First they have only the scholastic mentality of a teen-aged boy yet their sexual knowledge is worthy of Solomon. Secondly, it is impossible to get away to camp and their social activities are far from proper, while thirdly it is necessary to attend church in a body and even then there is not much devotion evident.\nThen again, I am the only person who could take the position of Rover Leader and I am only twenty-one, a stranger in this district and still slightly acquainted with these boys, or really young men, who wish to become Rovers. Added to that list comes a far greater technical fault. I have not received nor even applied for a Scoutmaster's warrant so that according to the letter of the law we are in a pretty sad mess.\n\nBut a Scout always whistles and smiles so I go smiling along with the knowledge that the boys themselves don't know what a hole they are in and keep whistling to buoy up my spirits if things ever appear to fall.\n\nMy Cubs are my greatest joy. I have a wonderful time with them, eleven all told, three of whom can only talk a little English, but for want of more definite information I have filled in the census to read \"eleven Cubs\". If I am out of order please let me know but meanwhile we are having great fun.\n\nAs you surmised, Mr. Dent has left and is now at Columbia College, New Westminster, while I have taken his place at the school. Mr. Dent very kindly left all his Scout books here so I will not require the books I ordered before I left Victoria.\n\nIf you could give me some \"fatherly advice\" about the way I should carry on the work here I should be only too pleased for it is rather difficult to come out from Varsity, from a highly artificial and pseudo-sophisticated society into a raw native atmosphere, where the sexual life seems to be the one goal and aim of most of the adults.\n\nLooking over what I have written it appears that the \"decks are cleared\" for some real first class action and before long I hope that I shall be able to give a much better account of myself and the Troop. \"Tuum Est\" is my college motto and I guess that it is up to me so here goes.\n\nYours for good Scouting\n\nR. Ward\n\nP.S. What is our official name? The notice board, the charter and our record book all have different designations.\nNovember 17th, 1931\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI thought you would be interested in the attached copy of a letter from Mr. R. Ward at the Indian School at Ahousaht. Our Executive Commissioner in British Columbia has passed it on to me and says that it is very difficult to get to Ahousaht because boats can only land on fine days.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJAS/TP\nChief Executive Commissioner\n\nMr. R.T. Ferrier,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\nAgricultural lands of the Ahousaht School were at the request of the Principal, Mr. A. E. Caldwell, anxious to do a little farming in connection with the School. The School has approximately 20 acres of land which is capable of growing sufficient vegetables for the School and pasturage for four or five head of stock, if properly worked. This land has been ditched and fenced and some 5 acres of it has been under cultivation at some time. Why this land was abandoned I do not know, for I was told that good crops were grown on it several years ago. Mr. Caldwell thinks that it was on account of lack of interest in farming, and possibly, because it was not properly drained. Since Mr. Caldwell took over the School, he has cleaned out and deepened the ditches around the land, and at the time of my visit the land was well drained and the ditches were in good shape. Mr. Caldwell informed me that there was a meadow nearby where sufficient wild hay could be cut for all the stock that the farm could pasture. Before any attempt is made towards keeping stock, I would suggest that the land be thoroughly worked for a few years in the way of growing root crops and vegetables and thoroughly fertilized with kelp before seeding down to tame grasses. I would also suggest that the School Principal have a sample of the soil analyzed for it is possible that as the land has not been kept thoroughly drained for the past few years it may be sour and inclined to be acid and might require a dressing of lime.\n\nAs the farming land that the School owns is limited to approximately 20 acres, the area which may be used for grazing is consequently small and would not possibly raise more than four or five head of stock. If it is the intention of the School to keep dairy cows, it might be advisable to do the farming with a small tractor, thus saving the pasture for cows.\n\nSo far as farming at Ahousaht for the purpose of teaching agriculture in the School is concerned, I beg to say that I fear this would be only a waste of time, as the West Coast Indians situated as they are naturally have to depend on fishing for a livelihood and will never do any farming of any account. If the Ahousaht School wishes to go to the expense of buying farm machinery and equipment, I see no reason why they should not be able to grow sufficient vegetables for the School and keep a limited number of dairy cows as well.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mr. McKay and yourself yesterday with regard to Schools in British Columbia, I may say that since I saw you I have had an opportunity of discussing the matter with Mr. Sifton and he has consented to a grant being made for the Presbyterian Boarding School at Alberni. The grant will be sufficient for 25 children at the usual rate, which I understand is $72 each.\n\nAs to the day school at Ahousait, I am inclined to think that it will hardly be possible to do anything this year in this connection. The matter will have to be looked into in order that it may be fully ascertained as to whether this will clash with the other schools in the neighbourhood, but in the meantime it will not be overlooked.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Revd. Wm. Moore, D.D.,\nO'Connor Street,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 19th January, 1900.\n\nDear Dr. Moore,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo, forwarding a communication from the Reverend Mr. Mackay, Secretary of the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, applying for a grant for the Girls' Home at Alberni, B.C., I beg to say that this school sends in no returns to the Department, and previous to the appointment of Mr. Watson as Principal, it had very little knowledge of the work that was being carried on. I regret, therefore, that the Department cannot see its way to making an increased expenditure by a grant to this school, at all events during the present year.\n\nI am sorry that the impression should prevail in certain quarters, as gathered from the papers sent in to the Department, that the Presbyterian Church is being discriminated against in the matter of grants for Indian Schools in British Columbia. I am satisfied, from personal enquiry, that this impression is hardly justified by the facts, and you can rest assured that there is no disposition on the part of the Department to decide the matter of grants on any but a fair basis.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Revd.

In that memo. you will see that the Presbyterians form a very small proportion of the Indian population, and, it would appear, have not been long conducting mission work in that Province.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nPUBLICATIONS.\n\nLeaflets 3 cents each.\n99.

TORONTO, JANUARY, 1900. No. 9\n\nI ASKED THE NEW YEAR.\n\n\"I asked the New Year for some motto sweet. Some word of cheer by which to guide my feet; I asked and paused. It answered soft and low: 'God's will to know.'\n\n\"'Will knowledge then suffice, New Year,\" I cried, 'But e'er the question into silence died, The answer came: \"Nay, this remember, too\u2014God's will to do.\"\n\nOnce more I asked: \"Is there still more to tell?\" And once again the answer softly fell: \"Yes, this one thing, all things above\u2014God's will is love.\"\n\nSUBJECT FOR PRAYER.\n\nThat the Holy Spirit may deeply impress upon the hearts of all ministers and members of the church a sense of their obligation in the evangelization of the world; that the hearts of the heathen may be prepared for the reception of the truth; that a rich blessing may rest upon all efforts to deepen missionary interest, and that the Church may awake to more earnest prayer and increased liberality for the extension of Christ's Kingdom.\n\n\"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.\"\u2014Mal. 3:10.\n\n\"And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:\"\u20142 Cor. 9:8.\nGO FORWARD.\n\nThe season of gifts and kind wishes is again at hand, and to the readers of the \"Tidings\" and members of our Woman's Foreign Missionary Society we send our cordial greetings and message of love for the New Year.\n\nThe year 1900 marks upon us with a peculiar significance, as it marks the close of one century and heralds the advent of another. It comes as a link between the experiences of the past and the greater possibilities of the future, and is a fitting viewpoint from which to make preparation for a true grasp of the new opportunities. The closing century is a notable one in the world's history for great advances in science, commerce, life's industries, and interests. Rapid strides have been made in science, literature, education, and in man's power to utilize to practical purposes the great forces of nature; but even greater than the progress in these has been the development and success of missionary efforts. May the energies now in motion for the evangelization of the world be given increased power as the years advance, and may God's children everywhere be inspired with holy ambitions and earnest effort to speedily win the world for Christ!\n\nAs we look back over the closing year regrets crowd in upon us because of opportunities unimproved or gone forever by, but to linger on the regrets is vain unless it serves to spur us on to better use of the New Year's opportunities and to a brave acceptance of its responsibilities. We cannot, if we would, change the records of the past, they are written for evermore, but we may so profit by our former experiences, successes or failures, as to make them stepping-stones to truer service. Forgetting, then, \"those things which are behind,\" and reaching forth unto those things which are before, let us press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Sacred trusts have been placed in our charge, and it is required of us that we be faithful in responding to our obligations. The blessings of the Gospel have been freely bestowed on us, and it is expected that they shall be sent on to others, and while we bring cheer and joy to our own lives, are we doing this? Are we seeking in loving sympathy to bring the lost to Christ? Are we self-denyingly seeking to win souls? If not, we are neglecting our mission, and as the Lord's Master says: \"Not to be ministered unto, but to minister.\" The call to Christian women to-day to do service for Christ has in it no uncertain sound, and opportunities to hold out the helping hand to burdened ones, to touch with sympathy hearts of the greatest need are offered all over everywhere. To many of us these pressing demands for help come as a temptation to undue activity. More is undertaken than the strength permits to overtake, and best results are not obtained. Responsibilities are assumed without due consideration, and our days are filled with what we believe to be legitimate Christian work\u2014so filled that we weary and worn, cannot take time to renew our strength by waiting upon Him who gives the grace to true service, and who undeservedly grants His favor. We must search ourselves to know what motive prompts us to engage in these activities, to be sure that what we do is done from love to Christ, and as an outcome of His great love to us. It is only when His love permeates and penetrates that we will have power and ability to bring blessing to others. May we in this New Year yield our wills so fully to our Lord that He will through us do great things in the building up of His Kingdom! May we have the fulness of compassion and the freedom from the cares that trouble the hearts of those for whom we work, and be constrained to believing, importunate prayer on their behalf. Power in prayer is the privilege of God's children, and power makes responsibilities not only for what we are trying to do, but for what God has promised and prepared us. Missionaries are needed at present to strengthen our staff in the foreign field, more workers are needed in our Society, especially such as are fitted to lead in the work of our Mission Bands. There are many among our members who are Presbyterian Church well fitted, physically and intellectually, to do service as missionaries. There are many women of culture and influence who profess the name of Christ, but have no interest or share in His great work of missions. Why is it that where there are so many who are in a position in which calling should be drawn that there is still the unanswered cry for more workers at home and abroad? The command is, \"Pray ye, therefore, the Lord of the harvest that He will send forth labourers into His harvest.\" Can it be that He could offer because His servants have failed to use the power at their command to provide for its requirements? If we could realize in some measure as our Saviour did the needs of the multitudes \"as sheep having no shepherd,\" we would pour out our hearts in ardent desire for labourers to glean the fields of our Lord's vineyard while the harvest Moon is in it. New Year rise to the height of our privilege and be a medium of rich blessing to the world. Let us no longer trifle in the Master's work. The King's business requires haste and energetic action. Let us not only cry unto the Lord for guidance and help, but hearken to His Word, as given to His servant Moses in the distant past, \"Wherefore criest thou unto Me?\" Speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward.\"\n\nS.\nINCREASE.\n\nPresbyterial Society\u2014\nOwen Sound........

Our pastors are praying for it; from our Board there have gone up earnest petitions that the members of all our Auxiliaries and Boards may feel it. \"Povved the Spirit's request, and then the Christian element of our church may feel a personal obligation in our motto, 'The World for Christ.' Personal responsibility cannot be transferred to a church or a society; each one of us has an individual relationship to God and to the coming of His Kingdom.\n\n\"If all the lamps that are lighted,\nShould steadily blaze in a line,\nOver all the wide earth and the ocean,\nWhat a girdle of glory would shine!\"\n\nA few Words of Cheer were given by Mrs. Board by Mrs. McKeown President of the Huron Presbyterial, while visiting in Toronto last month. Her words were kindly and encouraging as the Board on that day were deliberating on the question of resting our missionaries when on furlough. Glenboro' is one of our brightest Propaganda. It lies away out in the prairie district west of the city of Winnipeg. It is Provincial in its reach, but the nine Auxiliaries comprising it are entirely dependent on their own activities. The thought of seeing a live missionary is quite unheard of. \"But,\" added Mrs. McKeown, \"we are content and glad to read the letters from some mission is kept near to its heart, and the information we are able to circulate concerning the mission fields. Not that we would not gladly hear a real live missionary, but we are too far from a centre to expect one and therefore have been educated in self-support.\" We felt the force of her words, and commended them along. To Auxiliaries over large centres where the opportunities are varied and great, these prairie Auxiliaries are fine examples of activity and whole-souled interest in their church and its missionary spirit.\n\nMrs. Wilkie and Miss Chase of Indore C.I. were present at the Board meeting. Miss Chase was highly commended by the members. Several questions were asked Miss Chase with reference to work outside the College, and for which she had taken no credit in her annual report. Through her work in the College the young men had been led to put women's sphere on a higher stand, and had opened up the way for more faithful Bible-gate women in the zenanas. After the first two years when college work had become familiar she had found time to take up outside work. With the assistance of one of the Bible-women an interesting tour had been made through\nneighbouring villages, in some of which the people were urgent that schools should be opened up. She had also been asked from time to time, to assist both at the dispensary and school to the patients and at the housework and cooking classes for Scripture lessons. In many cases, it was found, Miss Chase had made herself invaluable to the mission and we trust at the end of this period of rest she may be permitted to return in renewed strength to this needy field.\n\nPresbyterial Meetings\u2014Miss Chase expects to be at the Annual meeting of Lindsay P.S. in Cunnington on January 18th; also at the Lanark and Renfrew P.S. in Arnprior, January 23rd and 24th. Miss Prolemy is to be at the Hamilton P.S., January 16th; Miss Duncan at Chatham P.S., December 24th.\n\nIn the Programme for the Day of Prayer we call attention to a note which has been added asking for very special reference in prayer to the sad conditions of want in India. Pray, too, that the hearts of the native Christians may be opened to do what they can for the needy and that our missionaries may be able to bear the burden of poverty. \"True faith makes riches written.\" One foal into the coming months with trembling and were it not that we knew the burden will be one of day by day and the promise is 'as thy day so shall thy strength be,' it would overpower one. Poor India, the Lord is visiting her in wrath. Will she heed and turn to the Light?\n\nIf You Read Nothing Else in this number read Dr. Margaret McKellar's graphic and pathetic account of the famine in Central India. Think of the distress! Added to the food famine six months more must pass before they can look for rain and many of the wells are already dry. Speak of it to your friends that prayerful sympathy may be far outreaching. The need is immediate and urgent.\n\nDuring the Last Famine over 800,000 souls died from starvation within a few months.\n\nThe Maharaja Scindia has given 10,000 rupees for relief work. Employment has been given to three thousand men in the building of a new roadway near the Jubilee gate. It is small, only equal to four cents, but cannot be sufficient for more than one person. A month ago the price of wheat was 11-1-2 sas for the rupee, that is if the pay baba did not take off a percentage (which is doubtful) and if the bania gave correct weight (which is more doubted) the wages earner could but a small portion of the wheat. The prices have risen considerably so you see how little one grown man can earn at road-making to support a family.\n\nPlague Rages fiercer than ever in many districts. The way in which it persistently clings to certain cities in certain sections seems to indicate that there may be truth in a theory now being advanced, which is, that where there is much malaria the plague will not come. We hope the theory may prove true and that Central India will be free from it.\n\nA Terrible Land Slide took place lately in Darjeeling, Calcutta's Hill Station. The side of the hill fell 3,000 feet, killing between seventy and eighty people. Two years ago this station was badly wrecked by an earthquake. Our readers will remember that Miss Grier was there at the time and received a severe nervous shock.\n\nIn News from Honan we learn that Mrs. Goforth has found it her duty to return inland from the coast. She traced her horses, more than two months after, but they still lingered. The many hopes for her recovery by their stay at Pei-Tai-Ho have not been realized. Our sympathies are very deep for the poor mother in this trial.\n\nMrs. Mackenzie has also returned inland and we gladly report that her health has been completely restored.\n\nThe opening of the New Chapel at Chang Te was to take place October 8th. Rev. Mr. Mackenzie was to preside in the morning, Rev. W. H. Grant in the afternoon, and Rev. Donald MacGillivray in the evening. The invitation was sent out far and wide to native Christians, and together with all the missionaries a great gathering was expected. It is the largest and finest chapel in Honan, has an iron roof, real church windows with double Gothic tops.\n\n\"Progress\" Sends the Following\u2014We are more deeply indebted than ever to the Ladies' Foreign Missionary Society for their active and most valuable co-operation with us in our work. In no former years have we received such liberal assistance from the ladies of the East. From the London Presbyterian Society, through Miss Bruce, and also the Lanark and Renfrew Societies we have received very many boxes containing lots of first-class clothing. The splendid overcoats, jackets, quilts, underclothing, warm caps, boots, night dresses, felt socks, dresses, sweaters, etc., filled the carts with feelings of the most profound gratitude. The ladies sorrowed to send us any surplus, unserviceable goods. Our present assortment of warm, hand-made mitts, socks and stockings we never saw equaled. For warmth and durability they have surpassed anything purchased by the average merchant. One of our native teachers said that while supporting his wife and five long Metro Doxology was continually in her heart. We rejoice to see so many pupils (considerably over 100), who are our own by adoption, so warmly clad and so com-\nFOREIGN MISSIONARY TIDINGS.\n\npletely prepared for the keen frost of winter. But the uppermost feeling in our hearts is gratitude to the ladies of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society, and a determination to do our utmost on behalf of the cause to which they devote such sympathetic and helpful attention.\n\nAn Unfair Distribution. An attempt from the Presidency of Victoria to the last General Assembly urged that representation be made to the Dominion Government to secure a fair share of Government support for the work of education carried on by our Church on the West Coast. Rev. Dr. Campbell, of Victoria, supported this move, and stated that for all the splendid work done by our Church the grants amounted to only $600 annually, while the Roman Catholic Church received $1,000; the Church of England, $15,050, and the Methodist Church $800 for work in the same Territory.\n\nPRESBYTERIAL MEETINGS.\n\nSARNIA.\u2014Held its twelfth annual meeting in the Presbyterian Church, Petrolia, on November 1st and 2nd, the members of Petrolia Auxiliary sparing no pains to make the meeting a success. Mrs. Urquhart, President, presided at the three sessions. The afternoon session opened at 2.30. Words of welcome and the delegates were given by Miss McNaughton, of Petrolia, responded to by Mrs. Ironside, of Thorold.\n\nAll the reports presented showed increased growth and interest during the past year. There have been six Auxiliaries and one Mission Band during the year. Sarnia Presbytery now comprises twenty-two Auxiliaries and thirteen Mission Bands. 579 copies of \"Tidings\" are in circulation; total amount contributed for 1899 being $1,270.00. The musical programme was offered by Mrs. J. Sturges of Brantford, and after the singing of a solo by Miss Walker, of Petrolia, Miss Duncan, of India, occupied the remaining time most profitably and pleasantly by her address on her work in the foreign field, accompanying it with an exhibition of the dress she had once made, carried with her from India, adding much to the interest awakened by her remarks.\n\nThe public meeting in the evening was well attended. Rev. A. Graham, of Petrolia, presiding. Profuse addresses were given by Rev. C. Murray, of Alexandria; Rev. R. Haddow, of Watford, and Rev. C. Daly, of Oil Springs.\n\nAt the Thursday morning meeting Mrs. Fortune, of Alvinston, read an excellent paper on \"Why Are We Here?\" and another from Mrs. McNaughton, of Petrolia, on \"How to Interest Others in Missions,\" lent additional pleasure and inspiration to the meeting. Mrs.\n\nBell, of Napier, conducted a very profitable conference on \"Difficulties and Encouragements.\"\n\nThe election of officers resulted as follows: President, Mrs. Urquhart, Corunna; Vice-Presidents, Mrs. Teller, Thedford; Mrs. Walker, Petrolia, and Mrs. A. McDonald, of Mandanquin; Corresponding Secretary, Miss J. J. Bremer, of Alexandria; Miss Nellie Geddes, Strathroy; Misses Basil Secretary, Mrs. Stirrett, Petrolia; Leaflet Secretary, Mrs. D. Alexander, Watford.\n\nPARIS.\u2014The fifteenth annual meeting was held in St. Paul's Church, Ingersoll, on November 9th. The following officers were elected for the ensuing year: President, Mrs. Kitchen, St. George; Vice-Presidents, Mrs. Shearer, Drumbo; Mrs. Thompson, Ayr; Mrs. Cockburn, Paris; and Mrs. McKay, Woodstock; Treasurer, Mrs. Johnston, Paris; Secretary, Mrs. J. Robertson.\n\nThere are in connection with this society at the present time twenty Auxiliaries and sixteen Mission Bands.\n\nThe value of the goods sent to the mission stations, $900.\n\nThe receipts for the year amounted to $13,482.22, a smaller sum than last year, but the deficit is accounted for by the date of the annual meeting being changed from February 10, 1899, to November 9, 1899.\n\nAn address of welcome was given by Mrs. R. J. Robertson, Ingersoll.\n\nMiss Duncan, of Central India, addressed the meetings in the afternoon and evening.\n\nAt the evening meeting Rev. Neil McPherson delivered a very interesting address, and Rev. E. W. J. Ingersoll, addressed the society on behalf of the Presidency of Paris.\n\nOn the whole this is the most successful meeting the society has ever held. The work is prospering, and the finances are on a substantial basis.\n\nPROGRAMME FOR DAY OF PRAYER, Jan. 12th, 1900.\n\nI.

If he worked day and night for a year he might possibly talk to each one of his parish for five minutes.\n\nWhat are we doing in AFRICA?\n\nMethodists support 916 stations, Presbyterians 555, Friends 157, Congregationalists 146, and Baptists 42, with many others in smaller numbers, but there are vast millions who have as yet never heard the name of Christ.\n\nWhat is our work in India?\n\nThe Episcopalians (English) support 2,118 stations, the Baptists 1,270, the Presbyterians 1,109, the Congregationalists 1,062, the Methodists 508, Reformed Dutch 140, Lutherans 201, in all 19,695 missionaries and native helpers. Although there are only about three hundred thousand actual communicant members there are many who are secret believers but are kept back by fear of losing caste. If that barrier were removed there would be a great ingathering. Let us pray for this.\n\nWhat are these two nations doing in Japan?\n\nThe Congregationalists support 207 stations, The Dutch Reformed 103, the Baptists 102, the Presbyterians 99, the Episcopalians 42\u20141,500 workers in all.\nWhat is the record for SOUTH AMERICA?\n\nThe Presbyterians support 34 stations, the Methodists 11, and English Episcopalians and Congregationalists a number more.\n\nWho are working for Mexico and Guatemala?\n\nOnly Americans\u2014Presbyterians 201 Stations, Methodists 200, Congregationalists 60, and Moravians 15\u2014597 workers.\n\nWhat is the work in PERSIA?\n\nAmerican Presbyterians 12 stations, 336 workers, and English Episcopalians 5 stations and 34 workers.\n\nWhat is being done for Siam and Laos?\n\nOur own Presbyterian Church has 41 stations and 155 workers, and the Baptists 1 station and 3 workers.\n\nWho are the workers in SYRIA?\n\nThe Presbyterians support 129 stations, Episcopalians 17, Baptists 12; in all 474 workers and about 3,350 communicants, of whom 2,247 are of our own church.\n\nDoes it not greatly confuse the natives to have all these different denominations?\n\nThere is something of this, of course, but as a rule we all work in true harmony and Christian fellowship, not occupying a place already receiving the gospel, but pushing on into the regions beyond. There are one or two exceptions among the narrower denominations\u2014notably in Persia and Syria\u2014but our field motto is\n\nALL ONE IN CHRIST.\n\n\u2014W.F.M.S., Philadelphia.\n\nLETTERS FROM OUR MISSIONARIES.\n\nIndia.\n\nTHE FAMINE IN ITS BEGINNING.\n\nDR. MARGARET McKELLAR.\n\nNeemuch, Central India, October 26th, 1899.\n\nOur part of India has been called a garden, as it seldom suffers from famine and the like of its present condition has not been known for one hundred years. The gladness is to see the joy out of the plentiful fields and in the woods there shall be no singing, the grasshopper shall there be no green thing.\u201d Six weeks ago the famine sufferers from the surrounding districts began crowding into Central India in the hope of getting food for themselves and fodder for their cattle; but alas! it was too late to save them. For weeks there have been thousands of people passing each other in Neemuch; the one that came early and passed through the land, finding out the poverty for itself, and was turned back at Rutland, and the other that will not believe except it sees for itself, and goes forward.\n\nThe scenes that are presented to us from day to day are very pathetic: grey-bearded men and women, the strong youths and little ones on the march, with their earthly all tied up in bundles or in baskets on their heads or on the backs of their cattle, their faces much marked by the carcases of the animals which have died by the way.\n\nThe need of supplying these people with food has been very urgent. A relief work in the shape of a new road was started some weeks ago, on which a few thousand have found employment, but there are those passing to and fro, and for whom nothing has been made as yet, so we have been trying to do what we could from private funds. Up to date of writing we have given food to 0.8t on our own compound. This we could not have done, if it had not been for the help of the children in the Orphanage. They came from their recent exercises, and as they came they said, \u201cIt is the sufferer of hunger, it is beautiful and touching to see their willingness and readiness to prepare the food for the hundreds who come. It means a very great deal of hard work for them, for they must be fed, and even baby Mary has helped in the work. The grain that she cleaned yesterday she stood in triumph with the remark that she does not leave even a wee bit of gravel or earth amongst it. They have had to have a little help with the grinding, as it took too much time away from their lessons, but the kneading and baking of the chapatis they do themselves, rising at four o'clock in the morning to do the\nwork, and when an extra one hundred have to be prepared every morning it is no small task, thus God so long as two years ago began to make provision for the need of today.\n\nOf the hundreds who come only from 250 to 300 are children and most of them are very much the charge. It is such a little and yet it means so much to the wee ones. While we turn to get another piece, the bread is hid by the child and if we did not look sharp, many a one would get a second piece. They hide their mother and if they do not get a stitch or cloth on in which to hide the bread, they slip it between the thigh and body. Bugiza, the little invalid of the Orphanage, has been much interested in this work. She began of her own accord to give \"a cup of cold water\" to a few at first just outside the Home gate. She would go down to the well and said it was not in Miss Sahli's order. This she reported to us in such a broken hearted way that it was agreed she should always hand the bread to the little ones. Her days of service on earth are almost over, as she suffers from incurable disease, but there are days when she is able to be fertile to walk around to give the bread, but she comes to help break it. Several times there was not enough for all the children and she slipped away without saying a word and brought some of the bread that had been prepared for the day's meal. Is she not exemplarily beautiful, the love of the Saviour, who has become precious to her during her stay in the Home? At first we gave the grown-ups parched corn, but now they get a mixture of peas and wheat. The grain is soaked in water for a day and mixed with water and a little salt sprinkled on it and this is given to them and they are able to eat it at once. Do I hear some of you say \"what about their caste?\" Only three or four out of all the thousands who have come have said \"we are Brahmins,\" give us dry flour instead of this. Others, however, who state they belong to, say \"We belong to the hungry caste.\" Not only do they take the food that has been prepared by the Christians, but they drink water from their hands or from the hands of other Hindoos whom they know to be of a lower caste. This gives us a glorious opportunity of giving them the Gospel. Since Miss Campbell's return from the hills, she has undertaken to give them the \"Bread of Life,\" with the help of our Christian cook. She takes four of the girls daily, from nine o'clock until noon, helps them to sing, and in this way the girls although not able to preach the Gospel are able to sing it to the people and who dare say that it shall not be blessed?\n\nThe people come, of course, for the \"loaves\" just as people did in our Saviour's time, but they are able in His name to tell them of \"that meat which endureth unto everlasting life.\"\n\nAt all times, the sore burdens fall upon the mothers. We have had several with their little babes four and five days old, come to beg a portion with the crowd. I need not draw a picture to speak upon your feelings, of what these mothers have suffered, having left their homes a month or so ago and kept up with the rest on their weary line of march, sleeping by the roadside and in the open air. All the mothers with babies in their arms carried their bread as well as some grain. A day or two ago a woman kept calling out for bread, and she had been crying saying that she had a baby under her chaddar. Some how I felt that she was telling a lie and although I had given her the bread and had passed her I went back to satisfy my doubt and if there was no baby how can we be hard on them when they are suffering so much hunger?\n\nFor some days a young man has been coming with a seven month old baby, tied up in a sort of sling suspended from his neck. The child's mother is dead and it is touching to see the father's efforts at taking care of the child. We give him a cup of milk every day that he has come and in a most ingenious fashion he makes a funnel out of a green leaf and the small end is put into the child's mouth, and through it he pours the milk. We have made vain endeavours to get him to give the child if only to take care of it during the day while he works, but he won't part with it.\n\nOne evening when returning from the city dispensary I came across a family living behind a cactus hedge. One of the young men of eighteen or twenty, had been ill with dysentery and was apparently in a very critical condition. I pleaded for some one to come with me to the bungalow for medicine, but no one seemed willing to come. Just then a man passing who knew who I was, told them not to be afraid that I was doing this work for the sake of \"merit.\" The mother answered me in a shigram with me. The poor woman had never been in the like before, and as we drove on and on, and the darkness closed swiftly around us, she settled down in silent silence, and apparently made up her mind that whatever was going to befall her she would endure it a stone. How different was the look on her face when, after giving her food and medicine for her boy, I drove her back and left her safe and sound with her family. In a week or so I had the satisfaction of seeing the same woman come with her mother and ask me to get food with the others. Last night I went again to see how they were getting on, but there was nothing to be seen but the little pile of stones and the heap of ashes, where they had cooked their food, so they have passed on their march beyond our reach.\n\nOnce when we had some bread left over, after giving to all who were present, so in the evening I tied it up and fastened it on the handle-bar of my bicycle and started off to distribute it to the poor ones. I had not thought to go by myself; my difficulty was to get a group small enough, so that each might get a piece. At last I met some, who had\nFOREIGN MISSIONARY TIDINGS.\n\nI came in from Marwar, and they did look so weary and hopeless. I don't suppose Ellith was as surprised when the ravens brought him his bread, for God had promised to send them, as these people were when I swooped down on them on my bike, and began giving them bread from such an unlooked-for source.\n\nA day or two after Moti's arrival, a young man, Samarthi by name, of the Hindu people, presented himself, saying that he wanted to become a Christian. We set him to cutting the grass on the compound, and began at once teaching him the way of salvation. He gives every indication of being in earnest, and we have all been favorably impressed with his conduct. I could write a long letter about the interesting conversations we have had with him, but must refrain until another time.\n\nAbout three weeks ago there came, after dark, a Brahmin woman (Channu) with her baby, who met me at the gate. She had been a widow for four years; has been living with a Brahmin here who is not her husband, and, while she has been faithful to him, he has beaten and treated her shamefully. For some time one of our Bible women has been helping her, and yesterday she asked about Christ so as to be willing to leave the man. I sent her on at once to the Home in Indore, as we have no place here to protect such as she. The Home in Indore is very much overcrowded, and we must have one in Neemuch for the sufferers. One other thing\u2014there is great supply to mention\u2014that is Nimoo, a little girl of seven or eight, who was given by her mother, a Brahmin, to Miss Campbell yesterday, and who is to all appearance very happy with her new surroundings. I want all the readers of \"Missionary Tidings\" to pray especially for the conversion of these five souls whom God has so providentially brought to us during the past five weeks. Let their names\u2014Moti, Channu and her baby, Samarthi and Nimoo\u2014become household words, as they will if you remember them daily at the throne of grace.\n\nSince starting my letter small gifts have come in from some of the English officers in the station, and from other places to help get food for the orphanage. While writing, she has heard a donation of two rupees came in from Amy James, the teacher in the Orphanage. She receives only rupees eight per month. Who in the home-land will follow her example and give the same amount as their month's salary or income to feed God's children in Central India?\n\nRebecca\u2014but, the head of the Home, was the very first person to give a donation, and a few days ago she was over helping us to distribute the food, when she saw that we were not going to have enough, for we had only prepared for 500 and 745 had come. She turned with tears to her eye and said, \"Oh, Miss Sahib, we must send for more. I have a rupee by me; I'll send to the bazaar for more grain.\" Permission being given, she sent, and all received something. Yesterday, when giving her money to buy the usual quantity of grain, I was surprised that she did not ask for the rupee that she had spent, and I mentioned it. Her whispered answer was, \"That was from myself.\" I felt the God's Spirit move mightily in the Orphanage, and outside of it, too; yet none of our other Indian Christians have given anything. The children are praying that money may come in, and it is since their prayers have been ascending that all the outside gifts have come. Praise the Lord! How true it often is, \"A little child shall lead them.\" One of the girls dreamed that the Miss Sahib had received \u00a31,500. Let us pray that her dream may come true.\n\nHOW WE HIRED A WELL.\n\nFROM MISS K. CAMPBELL.\n\nNeemuch, C.I., Nov. 2.\n\nIn the home land a cup of cold water is so easily obtained at any wayside well that one does not understand what the lack of it means, nor how difficult it sometimes is to get in Eastern countries.\n\nWhen the officer commanding the fort wrote about two weeks ago politely intimating that it would be impossible to allow us to get water from the fort well for the Marwaris, we cast about to find some way of continuing to give \"the cup of cold water,\" which is so precious to these unfortunate people who come out to our door.\n\nTwice a policeman had stopped and spoken to Dr. MacKellar about a very good well at Jammutia, a village some three or four miles out of Neemuch, but at the time she had passed it by without thought. Now she recalled his words, and we went that very evening to see if we could make a bargain for the water. We drove to the jail, but found, after a great deal of trouble, as no one seemed to know much about him, that he had gone to his village. If then we would have water for our thirsty ones we must go out there. We returned to town, hired a tonga, and set off under the stars to hang up a man whose name we did not know, and about whom we only knew that he was a policeman and owned a well. When we reached the village we asked for the Jammutia owner of the well. \"There are three wells,\" was the answer. \"Well, where is the owner of the best well?\" we returned. \"In Jiran,\" was the reply. Now Jiran is twelve miles off our hearts sank. \"When did he go?\" \"To-day.\" \"And return?\" \"We do not know.\" So our efforts had been for nothing. \"Hold!\" cried the driver; \"I'll go and ask.\" So we took our seats, and he ran off into the darkness, leaving us outside the gate, just close to the well, the waters from which we\nwere so anxious to bargain for. In a few minutes he returned, and with him the very man we were enquiring about, and who, we thought, had gone to Jiran. We must go down to see what a fine well it is, and how good the water. So carrying a dishpan, we went down two flights of steps to the well's edge. We declined testing it to test its sanctity, but we had before observed that in such wells it is no uncommon thing for a man to bathe, wash his clothes, then carry away a vesselful for drinking without seeming to notice it as an unusual proceeding. The pigmies who were sleeping disturbing in their homes on the side of the well with our light and our bargaining, fluttered noisily about against the walls, so we left them to their dreams and returned to the top, where we consulted the nearest at one another (two or three days' journey) and bullocks to draw the water, and seven annas (thirteen cents) for the man, oxen and cart to bring it into our bungalow, to provide the tanks. One tank we got from the Orphanage, another was rented from the bazaar. The Jamadar insisted upon paying for the \"pity\" he received of good works, which we commended by providing water for the thirsty which \"pity\" would stand us in good stead in the next world by providing a way in at heaven's gate. He will not believe that the \"way\" has been opened, and that the remedy will be the blessed Saviour's commendation, \"I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink.\"\n\nStill the hundreds flock to our compound to be fed. Since the relief work was closed ten days ago we have had as many as in one day. We hope new work will be started soon which will take some off our hands. Among those who come are some who perhaps are not yet suffering a great deal, but many more are truly in distress, especially among the children. We sometimes see them tie up their food to take it away. On inquiry, we find that they have been told that they are not to eat it, or they may bring it to their parents. Needless to say we insist upon their eating it on the spot.\n\nHow famine kills human instincts! A week ago to-day Soma, the Chamar teacher, found two bodies, of children, and seven months respectively, near the Chamar school. Some people close by said that the parents were just moving off, so he gave chase down the road. At first they denied knowing anything of them, but finally confessed that, as they could not provide for them, they would let the children, they had left them to die. He told them to return and he would take them next morning to a lady who would care for the children. He gave them some food, and they promised to stay. At eleven that night he strolled across to see how they were faring, but there were all gone. The same thing another way out on the common behind the school, and found the two children in a ditch. The jackals and crows had already begun their hateful work on the little bodies. Whether the parents had deliberately thrown them away or had deserted them, and they had been carried off by jackals, of course we could not determine.\n\nDr. MacKellar mentioned little Nimo in her last letter. She was very happy with us, but the mother, finding we would not undertake to feed her, too, took the child away. She was without hearts we stripped the clothes from the poor little girl, and sent her away just as she came, minus the dirt, while we continued in prayer that God would send her again if it be His good will.\n\nA few days later a man came to the door and said, \"I have six daughters. I cannot provide for them unless you take this child she will die.\" And I said in heart, \"Surely, and I fear she will die sooner anyway.\" The poor, little head was the biggest part of her. The limbs were just like dry, brown sticks. She was bathed, dressed, fed, and put to sleep with a clean, warm, well-nourished baby. For days she continued to refuse refused food, and was very miserable. By request of the matron she was called Champa, which is a beautiful, white, wax-like flower.\n\nA day or two later, among the hundreds that were sitting waiting to receive their dole of food, came an old man with a tiny scrap of a child screaming in front of him. He called me, and said, \"I am dying. Save my child; her mother is dead, and there is no one to care for her.\" Calling the matron, I took her and take the baby and give her some milk. She stretched out her arms and said, \"Come.\" The poor little thing without the slightest hesitation lifted her hands eagerly to be taken up, as if she thought she'd found her mother. Happily she has found as tender hearts and ready hands to care for her. The orphan girls are now much interested in the work, and whenever they see a baby being handed over they crowd to the gate, and dozens of hands are stretched out to receive the little wail. A name had to be chosen for this little one. I much liked the names Christians have of giving babies, such as their children, such as Tabitha, Rebecca, Ruth, Victoria-bai, Evangeline-bai. Many of their own names are very pretty. So as this was a good opportunity of teaching a lesson we discussed names fully, and decided that Chameli, a white flower, would be best.\n\nOn Monday a little Bihl girl of three years was given over. She cried loudly at sight of me. I, therefore, called one of the girls (Premi), to whom the children all cling, and said, \"If you are willing, take her into the Home.\" When I returned the girls had her washed, dressed and named. Sundari (beautiful) was the name they had aptly chosen, for she's a pretty little thing.\nThe Bright and the Dark Side.\n\nFROM DR. MARION OLIVER.\n\nMission Hospital, Indore, Nov. 2, 1899.\n\nThis is house-cleaning time among the Hindus, and because of that we have had for some days only about half the number of women at the dispensaries. Once they get their houses set in order, and their bathing and peoga over, they will begin again to think of their bodily ailments, and we will have more of the old chronic cases, and find that the nights have become cold. Poor rheumatic patients. Poor old bodies, no wonder they often are so ready to say: \"It would be good for me to die.\" I have just come upstairs from a long and tiresome interview with some very friendly purists, who always hang about the hospital here. They are Borahs (a sect of Mohammedans), and the husband has brought his old grandmother, his wife, his sister and two children and I had patiently to listen to an account of all their varied ailments. The grandmother is blind from cataract, but she feels that I ought to have a very hopeless case for operation, did not press it. The wife, a pretty young woman, is very lame from a form of muscular rheumatism peculiar to young women in this country, who become more or less stiff mere children. For such they can hardly me, but during the last two or three years I have had much success in treating them, so I was able to encourage the husband about his wife. The sister and children are suffering from malaria, so they also should be made to hope that the Dr. Mac Sahib may succeed in doing them good.\n\nIt is always exceedingly difficult to get a woman or her friends to believe I am telling them the truth, when I say: \"I cannot do anything for you,\" they generally think I want to get something out of them, and begin to try to make me feel poor. I learned long since to take even little sums of money offered by poor people, because to decline is to make them think you want them to give more. So I take even an anna or an egg when offered, though I may slip it into the hand of one of the children afterwards.\n\nYesterday I went to one of the cleanest and best houses I have seen in India. The house was built after the usual plan\u2014a quadrangle enclosing a fine large courtyard\u2014wide, two-storied verandahs ran round the four sides, and in the centre of the compound was a good well. Near the well was a tall tube plant growing beside it, and also several pretty plants in pots. In a room off one of the lower verandahs I saw several women preparing food, and on an upper verandah, sitting on bright new deckes (cane rugs) was a group of eight or nine women, all looking very contented and chatting away among themselves while some of them sewed, and others played with their babies. They made a pretty picture, and I thought it is from seeing scenes like this that people write of the beautiful simplicity of Hindoo home life. I had been in an inner room, where a poor suffering child wife lay, and looked upon the picture with opened eyes, and said, \"Alas! the lights and the shadows resting upon it. The women who belong to the better classes and live in the huts (zenanas) are, as a rule, not only contented to live within the four walls which bound their world, but are given to putting on very superior airs, and heart aches for them, because they are so satisfied to be as they are.\n\nOwing to scarcity of water, we have had to let our garden go unwatered except in one corner, where we have had still the rose bushes and other plants we were anxious to preserve transplanted. We still have several feet of water in the well, but, with no prospect of rain before June, we are in great danger of a water famine as well as a food famine. The Marwaris, driven out of their homes by reason of lack of water, have come streaming hundreds into Central India, and though they have nothing like so many of them here as in the Neemuch district, yet one cannot go through the streets without seeing crowds of them. A relief camp has been opened just beyond the city. The men earn five cents daily, the women three or four cents. Just enough to keep body and soul together. For the men it is not too bad but for the poor women, with little children pulling at their mothers' skirts, and for the helpless infants it is a pitiable sight to look upon.\n\nCONDITIONS WE MUST FACE.\n\nFROM MISS O'HARA, DIHAR.\n\nDhar, Oct. 16th.\n\nWe here in Central India are face to face with a condition never before experienced in this area\u2014a big famine. True we are not yet at the worst but it is bad enough and the prospect of what it will be when the cold weather sets in makes one really alarmed. We receive your prayers and sympathy as never before, and in order to relieve suffering we need practical help. Many of the wells are quite dry, and those that have water are in cases of many a suicide. Last Tuesday a woman came in this city had no food and the wife and mother was pleading with her husband to bring them food, but he told her he could not get food, so she sat till he went out took her youngest child in her arms and the next youngest walked by her side to the well; the mother then said: \"We three will jump into the water and drown together.\" The oldest child refused to do so and his mother left him standing and jumped in with her baby. The oldest child waited for a while expecting that his mother would...\nChina.\n\nTHE HONAN EXCHANGE.\n\nFROM A NATIVE TEACHER.\n\nNot many years ago I was blind, but thanks to the foreign doctor who restored my sight. When I first picked up a book, however, I found that I was blind again. I could not read. The characters looked strange and distorted, and very much alike to me; but by hard and faithful study, I was at last able to read, when to my dismay I was told that I was still as one blind, for my heart's eye had yet to be opened. I found in The Book that this was so, and that I was living in darkness. But by God's grace the Great Physician also opened my heart's eye, so that now I can see, and am able to read my title clear to the mansions above.\n\nCHANG TE FU.\n\nTo the west of us about fifteen miles there is a silver mine, which hitherto seems to have escaped the attention of the syndicates. Chinese scholars tell us that even with crude native methods, it yielded fair amounts of the white metal. It has been an interesting coincidence that the present closing of the mine, affirming that a mighty python was seen to bar the way to the Treasure Cave with his folds, leaving however, a few chinks, through which the awe-stricken, but disappointed beholders saw the cave all white with the precious ore.\n\nThe attraction of the compound is Dr. Menzie's new pump and closed-in-well. Dr. says they drink cold spring water now without\n\nbeholding it. What a luxury! To the natives, its chief charm (or drawback) seems to be that it is impossible to commit suicide by jumping into it.\n\nRev. A. Hoddie, on his way down from Shansi, reports that the condition of the people of that province, on account of the opium habit, is most deplorable, rendering it almost impossible to get work of any kind done. From seven to nine tenths of children, and from four to five tenths of the heads of the family, Boys of thirteen have the craving, and it is known to be a fact, that in certain cases, infants at the breast require to have opium smoke puffed in their faces, in order to pass the craving and enable them to nurse.\n\nWhile this people are trying to live out a miserable existence, in the midst of the greatest poverty and opium, all the while they are unconsciously treading under their feet untold wealth, for it is definitely stated that running through Shansi Province Hoddie is a vein of coal of the first quality, eight feet feet thick, and over three hundred yards long. Prof. Drake states that the supply is practically inexhaustible, and although the native methods of mining are very slow yet in some of the coal yards near Hwai Ch'ing may be seen heaps of coal worth 300,000 taels.\n\nIndians in the North-West and British Columbia.\n\nTHE MISSION IN ALBERTA, B.C.\n\nFROM MRS. CAMERON.\n\nNOV. 12.\n\nWe are having exceptional weather now. B.C. weather is generally so I think\u2014it has rained almost continually since about the first of October, and not a Scotch mist or drizzle either. The real downpour nearly every day and night. The settlers say there has not been so much rain at this time of the year since eleven years ago. Still we have very little mud and the water soon runs away.\n\nHarry and another have their new house now finished, and three others have started to build in the Shehshu village. Several new sets of furniture have arrived; Norah's father and his wife went both scaling, and each brought home a bedstead, dresser, commode and stand, all very nice indeed and very suitable. Their house looks something like a fine old shop. Another little Shehshu girl has been put in the school about seven weeks, and five Howchucklesht children applied for admission about a month ago; one was too scruffy but the other three boys and a girl are with us, and they are very interesting children. All the school and they are well enough except two Opichuck are attending the day school. These two have been promised me several times but their promise often means very little.\nHattie's father and grandfather are to \"potlach\" about $400 next week, and five trifles are being invited. We hope some of the visitors may \"potlach\" children to the mission; we have seventeen now, and there are twenty-six attending the day school.\n\nMr. Motion has had a very busy week, painting in the boys' dormitory and dressing rooms, the playground and two lower halls, and painted the floors and walls of first two, and mended and whitewashed the plaster, and he has fixed up the front of the old house for a play-room for the boys. He sold the young horse and colt to one of our ex-pupils, son of Chief Swatset, and he went to Nanaimo last week and bought a covered carriage.\n\nTO OTTAWA PRESBYTERIAL.\n\nFROM MR. MOTION.\n\nWe feel deeply grateful to the ladies of Ottawa Presbyterial Society for the nice supply of clothing sent to our Mission. We have opened all the bales, and were highly pleased with the nice clothes. Mrs. Motion desires me to express her grateful thanks to the ladies for the way she quoted them to her. The parcel from the Orphans' Home Mission Band, Ottawa, was simply perfect. They completely outfitted one boy and one girl; in a nice letter they tell me how gladly accomplished it. It is a lesson to show us what we could do for the cause of Christ if we would use the opportunities that lie at our hands. We were in great need of some of the things that were sent, and the nice quantity of flannellette and cloth that was sent will come in very handy.\n\nOur work is progressing slowly. All our Indians are home from the sealing on Behring sea, except two, whom I am afraid, we will not see again. Sometimes the woman goes with her husband sealing, and it was so in this case. It meant that in a storm their boat was capsized and the poor man and his wife were drowned. Before leaving here he had built a splendid frame house at the Opitchesault village (the best there), and with his sealing money intended to finish and furnish it. The canoe was afterwards found upside down. The house will now be the property of one of our ex-pupils, Dan Watts by name. All our children are enjoying good health at present.\n\nTO TORONTO PRESBYTERIAL SOCIETY.\n\nFROM MISS ARBOR.\n\nUchucket, B.C., Nov. 14, 1899.\n\nThe bale of clothing and Christmas things for our school children and the old people arrived today from Toronto Presbyterial, and I have just finished unpacking and arranging the things. Everything is in good order and perfectly suited to our needs. I am especially thankful for the boots for the old women. They appreciate considerably, and highly that I can readily anticipate their pleasure and gratitude, and in their behalf I thank the ladies who have supplied those gifts for their kindness. The gift of blankets for Miss Armstrong is very nice, and though very much, I am sorry that almost all our people are away from Uchucket just now, but I think the greater number of them will return before Christmas. School has been closed for the last month, and the prospect is good for the people to return with their children for another month is to me very dear. However, I am turning this \"waiting time\" to advantage by studying the native language. I feel that I shall be very much more useful in the work by being able to speak the Indian language. The few people who have remained on the island have been very faithful in attending the Sunday service. Last Sunday, of the thirteen here, nine were at the service. Of the other three, one old man has been bedridden for the last two and a half years one was sick, and the young man, poor fellow, stayed at home doing winter work in his house. The Indians say that sickness prevented him, for when we passed his house on our return he laid away his hammer and saw. May he soon see that it is God who is taking account of their thoughts and to whom he must answer, not the missionary. The Indian men returned in good time from the Behring sea. They experienced a very rough season. The weather was bad almost continuously, with sudden high winds and very high sea. One canoe, containing David, one of our boys, was lost from the sea coast, but was picked up by another canoe which has since returned to Uchucket. Another canoe was destroyed and both occupants, a man and his wife, were lost. It was very sad to see the grief of the old parents when they got the news of their daughter's death. They were very present in their sorrow that hurts so. If they could only know the \"Resurrection\" and the Life it brings, this despair would give place to a holy joy! Thank God for His great gift!\n\nThe last month has been a very happy one, though we have had only an occasional glimpse of sunshine. My father has been visiting me twice out of going home to see him. He has enjoyed the trip very much, and I feel quite strengthened for work again. He leaves today. After that I shall be alone until Mrs. Swartout comes, which, I think, will be about the middle of December.\n\nOUR NEW MISSION AT LONG PLAIN and SWAN LAKE.\n\nFROM MR. R. MCKAY.\n\nSwan Lake, Nov. 22, 1899.\n\nI was very sorry indeed not to have met you on your way home.\nI was pleased to hear of the flourishing condition in which you found the different missions during your visits, especially the Mistawasis Mission, in which I take a deep interest.\n\nWith regard to my mission at Long Plain is fifty-five miles from Swan Lake, the way I have to travel in summer time. Having to visit a small band of Indians at Indian Ford, about five miles east of the ferry over the Assiniboine river, increases the distance between Long Plain and Indian Ford twenty miles. In winter time the distance will be lessened, as I will not have to go around by the ferry. Following the wishes of the committee, I have visited Long Plain and Indian Ford twice every month, remaining at each place from one to three days.\n\nAt Long Plain I have had only one meeting, and have tried again and again to get them together for service, but without success, although I often go right in on them while they are holding some heathen festival, and succeed in getting a hearing for a few minutes. The course which I now follow is house-to-house visiting, which, I believe, will, with God's help, develop into large and attentive gatherings.\n\nThe situation is somewhat the same at Indian Ford. The Indians at this place are a branch of the Swan Lake band, and are few in number. I sometimes find only two or three families on this small reserve.\n\nThe Swan Lake band are the most promising, and I am able to give more of my time there than when residing at Okanese. I hold service on this Reserve twice and sometimes once Sabbath in the month. I also visit them during the week, taking care not to impose too much. The average attendance at service is about ten\u2014very small, indeed, but very encouraging when we have the privilege of God's presence where His people are gathered together in His name. There is a great deal of sickness among the Indians, and I fear this winter is going to be one of privation. I have been trying so far to give my personal attention to the sick, dressing their sores, etc. The majority are suffering from consumption, fever, rheumatism, and various diseases. Dr. Macklin is the medical attendant for the Swan Lake Reserve. He says there is not much use treating them where they have not the proper nourishment, so necessary for the building up of the tissues. The question arises what is to be done?\n\nThe band sick seem to be nearly all almost altogether, and I am sure will suffer for the want of clothing as well as food this winter.\n\nI am now living in Swan Lake village, about five miles from the reserve, in a fairly comfortable room.\n\nThere is one poor soul here on his death-bed. I visited him yesterday. It is wonderful how patiently he suffers\u2014not a word or sound from him except the dreary breathing. His face brightens when I enter his hut and take a seat by his bed. He seems to drink in every word as I read to him a portion of Genesis. This is the first case of serious sickness among the reds of the Indians would allow me to speak to or even approach the sick. It is a great relief to me to accomplish this much, although it is far from being satisfactory. I believe that this soul will be saved. Although he cannot speak, I believe that God will reveal to us whether he has been brought to a knowledge of the Truth as it is in Jesus or not. I know it is not necessary for me to request your earnest co-operation in the \"Throne of Grace.\"\n\nTO BROCKVILLE PRESBYTERIAL.\n\nFROM MR. R. C. MACKLIN.\n\nOkanese Mission, Nov. 18, 1899.\n\nI am, indeed, very glad to tell you that I am much better. Recovery has been very slow, and it will be some days yet before I am able to resume my duties. I hope and think that by Monday, 27th inst., I will be able to resume school again.\n\nDuring my illness, Mr. Roger, at my request, assembled in church on Sabbath to worship God. Mr. Roger called on me before service for any message I had. It is very encouraging to us to see our people assembling themselves to worship God without a missionary.\n\nAlso, we are very thankful to you that during my illness our people have shown deep anxiety about me, and I am sure they are anxious to see me well again, judging by the way those receive me that I have met the few short times I have been here.\n\nEnclosed please find receipt for the clothes received from the Brockville Presbytery Society. We received an excellent supply of good clothing, for which we thank the Brockville Presbyterial. We are always very much pleased to know and think that we are remembered by the different Presbyterials who are waking up the people to the need. We have had many beautiful and useful gifts from individual members, the way of household nicknacks, which we highly appreciate, but the kindness of the Brockville Presbyterial has far exceeded this.\n\nTHEIR FIRST FREE-WILL OFFERING.\n\nFROM REV. H. MCKAY.\n\nNov. 28, 1899.\n\nI am very glad to be able to tell you that I have so far recovered\nTO TORONTO PRESBYTERIAL\n\nFROM MR. W. S. MOORE\n\nMistawasis, Sask., Nov. 20, 1890.\n\nThe bale of clothing from the Toronto Presbyterial Society came to hand last week, and has been distributed by the managers. There were several Indians here, my men have received the shipments, and were extremely well pleased with the gifts; more so, perhaps, from the fact that others were not receiving. There was amply sufficient for all the requirements of the people here. I send you the sincere thanks of the Indians here for this help.\n\nI most thank the kindness of Mrs. Moore, myself and children for \"some things for the children,\" sent in the bale of clothing; We thoroughly appreciate this most useful gift as a practical token of your thoughtful kindness.\n\nTO TORONTO PRESBYTERIAL\n\nRound Lake, Nov. 24, 1890.\n\nWe were much pleased in receiving this supply of goods for Round Lake, as we would have been in such need without it. I trust now we shall be able to make the most of each poor helper who comes, adding during the winter. The clothing is good, and much of the things sent will assist us in our school. The made-up garments will save Mrs. McKay many an hour with the sewing machine. The dishes, knives and forks, etc., are all useful. May the blessing of the God of Jacob abide upon all those who give us such assistance in our work.\n\nAll the children attending school are well except Grace, who has never been strong. Angela, Augustus and Napoleon have been working out this summer but I shall allow them to have another winter at school. After that they can be well able to make a living for themselves. There are four or five little ones who are waiting until the river and lake are frozen over.\n\nPUBLICATIONS.\n\nFree Literature.\n\n78 Duties of Officers of Auxiliaries and Mission Bands.\n77 Hints to M.

This grant was given on the understanding that it would not be called upon to make any further contribution towards the building.\n\nNo application was made for a per capita grant until November 1896, when the Rev. R.F. Mackay asked that the usual boarding school grant be allowed them for 35 children. Mr. Mackay was informed that no funds were available from which a grant in addition to the amount contributed in payment of the salary of a teacher at the day school at that place, could be made. He was informed, however, that his application would be considered when the next year's estimates were being framed. No amount has been provided and no further application has been received until now.\n\nThe Department receives no returns from the Home although the last day school return shows that about 16 or 20 are in attendance, and it is presumed that this number includes the boarders as both classes of pupils are referred to by the Agent in his report.\nSince September last the school has been in charge of Mr and Mrs Morton, who were formerly on the staff of the Regina Industrial school and who seem to be anxious to improve the standing of this school (which was first established for girls only) and is now taking in boys, application having been made for a set of carpenter's tools.\n\nThe Rev. Mr Mackay is apparently under the impression that the Presbyterians are being discriminated against in British Columbia in regard to the distribution of the Government grant for schools, which is not the case, as they have only lately started mission work in that Province and have only two day schools in operation in addition to this Home.\n\nThe total Indian population of British Columbia is shown by the last census to be 24,973, made up of 12,000 Roman Catholics; 4,257 Anglicans; 2,836 Methodists; 269 Presbyterians; other Christian beliefs 302; and 2,267 pagans; and bands not visited 2,500 whose religion is unknown.\n\nThe present application is made for a grant for 30 pupils at $70 and although there is accommodation for 65 children, they have never had any list like that number, and it is not usual for the Department to make a grant in first instance for all the pupils that could be accommodated. Sixty dollars is the boarding school rate at present allowed in British Columbia and if any grant were made to this school it should be at the same rate.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Moore\n\nClerk.\nToronto, 27th Dec. 1899.\n\nTo the Deputy Sect. General of Indian Affairs,\n\nSir,\n\nI am instructed by the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church, to make application for the usual Boarding School Grant, to the school at Altona. The following are the facts bearing upon this application which I beg to submit:\n\n1. The building was erected in 1896, at a cost of \u00a33731/3s., of which amount \u00a3150 was paid by the Government.\n\n2. The building is an excellent one capable of accommodating from 40 to 50 children.\n\n3. It has, until this year, been called the \"Altona Girls' Home,\" which name did not properly describe it, inasmuch as boys have been received into it, which are found as needy as any number of girls in that region; the name has accordingly been changed, and it is henceforth to be known as the \"Altona Industrial Home.\"\n\n4. There is a Day School along side of the Home, on which the children are taught according to curriculum.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6431, File 877-1, part 1)\nToronto,\n\nregulations or by a competent teacher.\n\n5. It was expected when the Boarding School was built with government approval, financial aid, that the usual Boarding School rent would be given. But that has been declined from year to year, only a day school rent made of $3.00 per annum.\n\nIt is submitted upon in the west that the Roman Catholic Church receive grants for four Industrial Schools, one Boarding School or two Day schools\u2014in all $31,100; the Church of England for two Industrial Schools, three Boarding Schools or eight Day schools\u2014$15,050; the Methodist Church one Industrial School or Boarding School or nine Day schools\u2014$14,700.\n\nYet the Presbyterian Church has for years after year been denied even one Boarding School, erected according to plans submitted to or approved by the Government. The Board is unable to understand the principle of the Government action in this apparent discrimination.\n\n6. The Committee asks that a Boarding School rent of $72. per pupil be given for 20 pupils.\nToronto,\n\nAfter Miss Johnston, the former Matron left\nAlbion, many of the children were withdrawn, so\nthat the attendance fell below the former average.\nMr. & Mrs. Watson who are now in charge have\nshown even the confidence of the parents, and are\nnot only getting back again the children formerly in\nthe Home, but others also from those in the\nBarclay Band. The school is thus likely to\nfulfil better than ever before its original purpose.\nThe attendance has now again reached 25,\nand it is expected will rise to 35 or 40.\n\nI trust this application will receive the\nfavourable attention of the Government.\n\nI am your very truly\n\nR.

P.F. MacKay B.A.\nSecretary Foreign Mission Committee\n63 Confederation Life Bldg:\nToronto\nToronto, 2 Feb. 1876\n\nMr. Hugh & Reed,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that I have received, in acknowledgment of an urgent request for the school grant given to Boarding School in behalf of Miss Anna Palmer, receipt of the same for the assurance that the request will be remembered when estimates are again being prepared.\n\nIn the same letter of the 2nd instant I asked whether in order to give more prominence to industrial work would it be allowed to shorten the hours of attendance in the day school without forfeiting our claim to the day school grant. We then need a teacher who is able to be of service to the boys in that respect, but do not like to make the new departure without the approval of the Department. An early reply will oblige.\n\nI am Yours very respectfully,\n\nW.M. MacKay\nOTTAWA 20th November 1896\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, applying on behalf of the Alberni school for the usual grant given to Boarding schools in B.C.; and in reply I regret to say that at present the Department has no available funds from which an additional grant to this school could be made. This being the first application received for that purpose no provision has been made in the Estimates for the current year beyond the payment of a teacher's salary for this school.\n\nYour application will, however, be considered when next year's Estimates are being framed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. H.F. Macdonald, B.A.\nConfederation Life Bldg:\nToronto\n\nDeputy Superintendent:\nof Indian Affairs\nMr. Taylor,\n\nI am instructed by the Foreign Mission Committee to make application in behalf of the Albino School for the usual gift-money to Boarding Schools for Indian Children. With reference to the amount granted to Day Schools, viz., $25 per annum.\n\nIt will be remembered that a building was erected costing $3721.75, of which $1500 was paid by the Government. The building is an excellent one capable of accommodating from 40 to 60 children.\n\nThe attendance is gradually increasing having reached about 30 pupils. We hope in due time to utilize the building to its full capacity. Would it be too much to ask that the Boarding School allowance be granted up to\nToronto,\n\nThe number of 35 children is considerably less than the capacity of the building\u2014plans of which were approved by the Department.\n\nThe day school for children living in the Home has hitherto been kept open for six hours a day. We would like however to give more prominence to industrial work and for that reason have appointed a young man who is able to instruct in Carpentry also. In order to do that however it will be necessary to shorten the day school hours. I am accordingly instructed to seek the permission of the Department to reduce the number of hours attendance at the day school so may be found desirable\u2014not however less than three hours a day. That is, I understand the practice in other schools in which industrial arts are taught.\n\nHoping these requests will receive your favorable consideration I am your most faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The present grant for 30 children is quite insufficient for the maintenance of the 43 children present, according to the last annual report. We are this year expending $600.00 on the building, increasing the accommodation.\n\nThere is a considerable number of children in the villages that are not cared for, and would have been in the school had the accommodation been sufficient.\n\nI intended to make this application in person, but as there is delay in going to Ottawa in connection with the Regina affairs, and lest delay should be to our disadvantage I beg to submit this application now.\n\nHoping the Department will find it possible to grant this request,\n\nI am\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6431, File 877-1, part 1)\nRalph Smith Esq., M.P.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Smith:\n\nI am greatly concerned about the Gov. Grant to this School, and as the estimates are now down in the House you will be able to see whether the Department have made provision for an increase for the ensuing year.\n\nAt present we have a Boarding School grant of $1800 per annum (30 pupils at $60 per capita per annum.) We have had an average attendance of 30 to 40 pupils and with the present extension new building costing $1700, we will be able to accommodate sixty pupils.\n\nThe Foreign Mission Committee of our Church per Rev. R. P. MacKay D.D., Toronto have no doubt by this time have a strong appeal to the Department to raise the status of this School to an Industrial School so that we might get a grant for sixty pupils at $120 per annum.\n\nIf no provision has been made in the main estimates for this increase, I trust you will use your best endeavours to secure it so that it will appear in the supplementary estimates.\n\nThe Department found no difficulty in raising the status of the Roman Catholic Boarding School at Clayoquot to an Industrial School and I therefor trust they will show their appreciation of our Church's work in B.C. by according us the same privilege. Trusting you will use your best endeavour on our behalf.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours Very Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nP.S. It is impossible to finance properly under present conditions.\n\nJ.M.\nOTTAWA, 24th March, 1904:\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nIn reply to your enquiry of the 21st inst.\n\nI beg to say that an application was made by Mr. Norton, Principal of the Presbyterian Boarding school at Alberni, B.C., in January last for a set of carpenter's tools, which was not entertained for the reason that the Department's contributions to schools of this class are limited to the per capita grant and such material as is required in the class-room. Mr. Norton is doing everything in his power to have this school recognized as an industrial school, and in his application above referred to he states that they were building, and later on intended putting up a large addition costing $1500.00. The Presbyterians have no industrial school in B.C., and they naturally wish to have one. This school has only been recognized as a boarding school for the past five years and is provided for at the rate of $60.00 per capita for 30 pupils. The Presbyterians, who number 346 as shown by the last Census, out of a total of a total Indian population of 28,882 in B.C., have two day schools and two boarding schools under their control and considering the number of their followers, I think they are amply provided for.\n\nThe Roman Catholics number 11,408 with two six day, three boarding and five industrial schools, including Clayoquot, which has lately been raised to this\nclass. The only grant made to the latter school was a sum of $722.00 for the purpose of providing a water supply.\n\nThe records show that the Department has contributed $1500.00 towards the erection of a new building for the Girls Home at Alberni. This forms part of the Alberni Boarding school. I may add that this grant was given on the understanding that the Department would not be called upon to make any further contribution towards the building.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Had the Department been more generous by acceding an increased per capita grant, this School would be doing more work than we are capable of doing at present owing to the financial stringency.\n\nI sincerely trust that this matter will be no longer delayed, but that the Department will grant the application made by the Rev.

Dr Mackay, General Secretary of the Presbyterian Church, in his letter of the 10th instant says that his Society is somewhat disappointed in finding no mention of an enlarged per capita grant for Alberni. He says that this school is carrying 46 pupils with a grant for only 30. They applied to have it raised to 50, but the increase was not granted. It is this desire of the Presbyterian Church and other religious denominations to extend their work beyond their means which finds them in financial straits and sends them to the Department for assistance.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6431, File 877-1, part 1)\nEXTRACT from a letter addressed to the Deputy Superintendent General by Rev.R.P.Mackay,D.D., of the 10th Nov.1903.\n\nWe were somewhat disappointed in not finding mention of enlarged per capita grant for Alberni. You will remember that in conference it was stated that we have forty-six children in that school, and only a grant for thirty. It means of course that our funds must provide additional maintenance from year to year, and it also means that the standard of living is always in danger of being cut too low in the interests of the children and the work.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.P.Mackay.\nOTTAWA, 7th October, 1903\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nThe deputation from the Presbyterian Church which waited on you on the 22nd ultimo asked inter alia for a grant for 50 pupils for the Alberni boarding school, being an increase of 20 over the present number. A similar application was received through Mr. Supt. Vowell from the Principal in March last, which was endorsed by Mr. A.G. Guilloch. Mr. Vowell was informed that an application of this kind should have come from the Secretary of the Foreign Mission Society of the Presbyterian Church.\n\nThis school is getting along very well under the charge of Mr. Motion, the Principal, and if the Department decides to extend the boarding schools in British Columbia it would be as much entitled to consideration as any of the others. The Presbyterians have, however, been very liberally treated in B.C., and it is a question whether it would be wise to bring all the children of their faith up in a boarding school where they would be unfitted to follow fishing and sealing which would be their principle means of livelihood after they leave school.\n\nAs I pointed out nearly three years ago when an application was made for a grant to this school, Mr. Motion is steadily working in the direction of having it recognized as an industrial school so as to secure the grant of $130 per capita.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Dr Mackay, Secretary of the Foreign Missionary Society, as the Presbyterian Church is called upon to make large contributions towards the maintenance of this school, having last year given $2229.00. If the number of pupils increases it will make a corresponding drain on their funds.\n\nMr Agent Guillod states that if the Department entertains the application, the management will make alterations or additions so as to accommodate the extra number; 40 being about all the school has room for at present.

(RG 10, Volume 6431, File 877-1, part 1)\nThe Secretary:\n\nRe application for increased grant to Alberni Boarding School.\n\nThis school is conducted under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church and for a number of years was carried on without any assistance from the Department which contributed in 1895 $1500.00 to aid in the erection of a new building on the understanding that it would not be called upon to make any further contributions towards the building. No application was made for a per capita grant until November 1926 when Rev. Mr Mackay Secretary of the Foreign Mission Committee asked that the usual boarding school grant be allowed up to 35 children. As no funds were available nothing was done in this direction until the Supplementary estimates for the current year were being prepared, when provision was made for 25 pupils, and that number have been paid for since the last July last. The last return (30th September) showed that there were 41 pupils on the roll and the Principal in his annual report claims to have an average attendance of 29. For some years previous to receiving Government aid the school had been carrying over 30.\n30 pupils and it is a question whether the school ought not to be content to wait a while before asking for an increase.\n\nThe census of the West Coast Agency shows that the Presbyterians claim about 320 members out of a total population of about 2,500, while the four bands from which this school is drawing its pupils have a total Presbyterian population of about 180, which would give only about 40 pupils of school age. The buildings are large enough to accommodate 45 pupils in addition to the staff, but I think that it is question whether it would be wise to bring up all the children in a boarding school where they would be unfitted to follow the avocations which they will be called upon to pursue in after life, fishing and sealing being the principle means of livelihood within their reach.\n\nMr. Motion, the Principal of this school, and his wife, who is acting matron, are both old employees of the Regina Industrial school, and it is Mr. Motion's very laudable ambition to have this school recognized as an Industrial school, which if acceded to would entail an industrial school grant of $130 per capita thus doubling the cost of the institution to the Department, without any corresponding benefit to the Indians.\nI understand there are 35 pupils at the Alberni Boarding School in British Columbia, but that the Church gets a grant for only 25. I think it might be arranged for next year to give them a grant for 30 pupils. I do not think it will make any difference in the estimates,\u2014possibly the cutting off of the grant to the Comox School would about balance this.\n\nDeputy Supt. General.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th ultimo asking permission to change the name of the school under your charge from the \"Indian Girls' Home\" to \"Industrial Home, Alberni\"; and in reply I beg to say that the latter designation would be a misnomer, as the institution is only recognized by the Department as belonging to the boarding school class. You are, however, at liberty to make any change in the name that you desire so long as you refrain from calling it an Industrial school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nJan.

In this letter it will be observed that Mr. Motion maintains that a grant of $25 per Capita per annum for twenty-five pupils for the current fiscal year had been made by the Department for this school; he has however been informed that the grant as ordered in aid was received at this Office is $60 per Capita per annum for twenty-five pupils. The detention of his letter here has been caused by the correspondence incidental to altering his report and obtaining to have the facts above stated. In regard to pupil Andrew No. 31 Mr. Motion has been requested to inquire and to report under what circumstances a scrofulous subject such as Andrew was admitted into the school and he is directed to exercise the strictest discrimination respecting the health of pupils admitted thereto and to allow only healthy children to be entered on the Rolls of the School.\n\nAttached to Mr. Motion's letter is a Requisition for Supplies and School Material submitted for your approval if it be found in order.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs.

I feel grateful to the Indian Department for thus helping us in our work.\n\nDuring this Quarter the Annual six weeks school holidays were given, starting on July 10th, and school beginning again on Aug. 27th. The boys and girls of the Home worked in their different departments one half day, and the other half they were free to enjoy themselves.\n\nThe health of the children has been very good. Andrew 31 who left on sick-leave, is not improving as I had hoped, I feel that an operation in hospital is the only remedy; his glands are badly swollen from ear to ear. I regret this very much as Andrew is a nice lad, doing well in school, and when down at his home at Newmicklesham while speaking to him, his regret was that he was not strong enough to return with me.\n\nOur school work is getting along nicely, the children taking good interest in their studies.\n\nI regret that Willie Roberts had to go home to assist his mother, it was necessary as the poor woman was utterly unable to help herself also having two young children under four years of age depending on her. I am pleased to say that the mother is now able to walk around, but is not strong enough to do any work yet.\n\nWe had a splendid crop of fruit in our garden this summer, and our potato crop promises well. We are busy at present securing our winter's supply of wood (fire), and building a wagon road whereby it will be easier for us to take anything to or from the garden.\n\nWe were pleased also to have you visit our Home on Aug. 1st, and trust that everything was satisfactory to you.\nMr. Agent Guilled also visited us on Sept. 27th. on his monthly visit.\n\nI have made a requisition for forty iron spring beds (single) for our Home. I sincerely hope they will be granted to us. The beds that are in use are all wooden beds and double, necessitating two boys in each bed, they are not now in good repair, and they are certainly not the best kind of a bed in an Institution like this where it is preferable for children to have single beds. I enclose cut of bed asked for in requisition, as for asking for forty beds I feel certain that our attendance will reach that figure before next spring.

Motion, our missionary agent at Alberni, and also two letters from Mr A. W. Vowell, regarding the Government grant for the Alberni School. Mr Vowell is under the impression that the grant allowed is $300.00 per pupil for twenty-five pupils. In the letter received from you on the 7th February 1900, it is stated that the grant is to be $72.00 per pupil for twenty-five pupils. There is some misunderstanding which I refer to you.\n\nI enclose the letters referred to, which you will kindly return after perusal. I hope the original announcement, namely, $72.00 per pupil is the right one, but should it appear that there was some mistake, I hope the department will find it possible to allow the grant for thirty pupils instead of twenty-five. The school is gradually growing, as you see from Mr Motion's letters there are at present thirty-five pupils in attendance. The building will accommodate forty-five, and it is desirable that as many as possible should be brought under the influence of the institution. We are glad to find Mr Motion taking hold of the work very heartily, and with manifest success.\n\nTrusting to receive an early and favorable reply,\n\nI am,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We were always the best of Friends\u2014my Wife was a Native (Chamet) which we were married & all of our children have been baptised by a Priest\u2014in later years (1875) I started a trading post for S & D on the Red Reserve (Chamet) the Catholic Church & School was there, but no Priest was teaching there a long time\u2014it was then intended to build a larger school out off the Reserve, same as the new house, 3 Miles by Water from here it was finished in 1900\u2014 = in 1895 a Presbyterian by name Mr. Rigell came here & after a time, when he got his school built & started teaching, I left request let two of my oldest children attend his school\u2014it was a public school & I could not educate my own children in 1900. I quit S & D Employee & started building a fire of my own out off the Reserve\u2014will you allow me to pass remarks about trading stores on Red Reserves, no white man ought to be allowed by Ind. Department, to have trading stores on Red Reserves\u2014 it always causes trouble with the Inds, also it makes the Inds lazy\u2014 the hang around (loafing) the stores, instead of working for their own good, etc.\u2014my children also quit the Presbyterian school, in 1901 my wife, sudden diet, poisoned by eating the small muscled, when the Principal Rev. Fathers D Macneil, heard of this, he came (Mr. Come) to see me about my children, a daughter Willie 12 year\u2014Boy Andrew 10\u2014William & John 5 years & a Baby Boy age 14 months, if I was not able to make case of them, he would take all of them to his large school (Christie Bros Boarding school)\u2014I could not part with any of them just then, but after a time, the officers would go to his school because they were Catholics, and it was my duty also my wish to keep them brought up (taught) in the Catholic Faith\u2014this Mr. Come knew all about the Priest, etc., so I suppose he thought it was his duty to prevent me from sending my children (Especially Chamet) to a Catholic school.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Thornberg of Ahousaht, in which he complains that two of his children were taken back to the Alberni Boarding School by the Principal, Mr. Morton, contrary to his wishes. Thornberg is apparently a white man living off the reserve, who was married to an Indian woman now deceased. He admits having given his consent to their admission in the first instance, but now that his other children are being brought up Roman Catholics, he did not wish them to return to the Alberni school.\n\nFrom his statements he would appear to be entitled to the education and control of his children and the choice of their place of residence, and being a white man, he could legally claim their custody, but as the necessary proceedings would be expensive and inconvenient for him, he asks the intervention of the Department to secure their discharge.\n\nThis is Thornberg's side of the case and the Department would like you to cause enquiry to be made regarding these statements, which if found to be correct, would justify you in ordering the discharge of the children unless the Principal of the school\n\nA. W. Vowell, Esq.\nIndian Supt.\nVictoria, B.C.\ncan furnish explanations which would render such a course inadvisable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK REDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA, 19th April, 1904:\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith regard to the complaint of Mr Fred Thornburg that two of his children were taken back to the Alberni boarding school contrary to his wishes, I beg to say that if Mr Thornburg's statements are correct, Mr Motion, the Principal of the school, was not justified in removing the children without their father's consent. Thornburg is a white man who was married to an Indian and as he is a trader, living off the reserve, his children should be considered as whites, not half-breeds and not eligible for admission to an industrial or boarding school under the regulations. In this case, however, the father had given his consent in writing to have them placed in the Alberni school where they remained for two years. The school never drew any grant for these children as they were in excess of the number authorized, and under the existing arrangements I know of no reason why the school could not take them in so long as the Department was not called upon to pay for them and their residence did not interfere with the proper maintenance and education of the Indian children.\n\nThe father having changed his mind about their remaining there on religious grounds, had a right to their control and is entitled to their discharge. The father does not claim to be a Roman Catholic although he was married by a priest and his children were baptized by one, but without entering...\ninto the religious side of the question, he is entitled to the education and control of his children and the choice of their place of residence. As a white man he could legally claim their custody but as legal proceedings would be expensive and inconvenient for him, he asks the intervention of the Department to secure their discharge.\n\nOf course we have heard only one side of the case and the Principal of the school may have explanations to offer but unless they are sufficient to overcome the father's statements the Department would be justified in ordering the children's release, and I would suggest that Mr. Sup. Vowell be advised of the statements made and instructed to obtain a report on the case. Authority might be given him to decide this matter on its merits.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Thornberg, in which he complains that two of his children were taken back to the Alberni boarding school by the Principal, Mr. Moton, contrary to his wishes. Mr. Thornberg is a white man who was married to an Indian woman now deceased. He admits having given his consent to the admission of his children to the school in the first instance but for private reasons he objects to their remaining there. From his statements he would appear to be entitled to the control of his children and the choice of their place of residence and could legally claim their custody, but as the necessary proceedings would be expensive and inconvenient for him, he has asked the intervention of the Department to secure their discharge. This is Mr. Thornberg's version of the case.\n\nThe Department wrote to the Indian Superintendent at Victoria and directed him to cause enquiry to be made regarding these statements. A reply has been received from that officer from which it would appear that Mr. Moton positively refuses to give the children up unless ordered to do so by a Court and although\n\nRev. R. P.

(RG 10, Volume 6431, File 877-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nThe Department does not feel that it would be justified in directing the discharge of these pupils, who are not grant earners; it thinks that it would be unfortunate if the case should have to be ventilated in a Court of law. It therefore suggests that you should communicate with the Principal and ascertain his reasons for objecting to the placing of these children under their father's control.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA, 6th June, 1904:\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMr Superintendent Vowell has reported on the complaint of Mr F. Thornberg respecting two of his children who were taken back to the Alberni boarding school by the Principal contrary to their father's wishes. He also encloses a letter from Mr Agent Neill, who states that he has been unable to obtain a report from the Principal but from what he can learn the children were placed in the school by their father and the Principal claims they were to remain there for such term as Mr Russell (the former missionary there), the father and Mr Motion may deem proper.\n\nThese children are not Indians and Mr Motion has positively refused to give them up unless ordered to do so by a Court; and the Superintendent says he does not see that the matter of the release of these children is one with which the Department is concerned, as the question of their discharge is apparently one between the school authorities and their father. This may be quite correct from Mr Motion's standpoint but it seems hard that a parent should have to go to the expense of taking legal proceedings to obtain possession of his children from a school, which, to all intents and purposes, is an Indian boarding school, and it seems to me that the...\nDepartment would be quite justified in interfering and ordering their discharge, especially as Mr. Motien has been applying for an increased grant for Indian pupils at this school, which would indicate that it is not in a position to carry non-grant earners.\n\nIf the Department does not wish to go as far as ordering the discharge of these children, it might represent the matter to the Missionary Committee of the Presbyterian Church.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Maclean,\nSoc'y Department Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYours of 11th August, respecting Mr. Thornberg's complaint as to the detention of his children in the Alberni School, came to hand during my absence to the Lakes. I received an explanatory letter from Mr. Motion, a copy of which I inclose. I also received from him a sheaf of correspondence that passed between them during negotiations for reception of children into the school. If you so desire, I shall be glad to send you all the correspondence I have received.\n\nOur Executive is to meet Friday, when I propose to submit the entire case. They will I am sure be pleased to receive advice in the matter from the Department. It would be unfortunate if there were any litigation in connection with the matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. P. Mackay\nThe following is a copy of the letter dated from Mr\n\nMotion on the 27th June 1904:\n\n\"I received your letter of the 14th instant by last mail re Mr Thornberg and his two children.\n\nI inclose correspondence, which, after you peruse, you will better understand the statement I now make. I have not inclosed all the correspondence, but enough, so that you may understand the situation. The Indian Department granted leave of residence for the children in the school by letter Nov. 29th, 1901.\n\nThe foundation of the whole trouble is that Mr Russell did not deal with Mr Thornberg, and he became embittered against him. Mr Thornberg states that Mr Russell promised him his trade if he sent Hilda and Andy to Alberni. Mr Russell, I am certain, made no such promise. Mr Russell kept and cared for the five children during the mother's illness, beside nursing the mother all at his own expense, and Mr Thornberg, I believe, would have been willing at the time, for all the children to come to Alberni, but I asked that only the two eldest be sent.\n\nMr Thornberg states he never read the admission papers, but it was at his suggestion the words, \"Indian Dept,\" were struck out. See Mr Russell's letter of August 9th 1901.\n\nMr Thornberg had perfect confidence in Mr Russell at that time, and did not wish the word \"parent\" inserted, but Mr Russell thought it best that it should. When one of the members of the Alberni staff visited Ahousaht shortly afterwards, Mr Thornberg said \"That whatever Mr Russell did regarding the children, would be all right.\"\n\nOn Mr Thornberg refusing to return Hilda and Andy last year at the expiration of their leave of absence, and especially as he refused to return then suggesting that immoral relations had existed between Hilda and one of the school boys during my absence at Regina. Knowing this to be utterly false I went to Ahousaht, and the following morning went over to Mr Thornberg's in company of Mr Russell to seek an explanation of the statements made, also to get the children if possible.\n\nThe tide was high, and we landed practically at his door. Mr Thornberg came out just as we were landing, saw us, and immediately returned into the house. The door of the house was open and I walked in, introducing myself, and stating my reasons for coming. Hilda and Andy were not to be seen. He said Hilda did not want to see me, and that she would not speak to me. I told him I thought she would if I could see her. I asked him were the children were, and he said Andy had taken to the bush, and that Hilda was in there, pointing to a recess.\n\nMr Thornberg told Mr Russell and I that Rev. P.Maurus, Principal of the R.C. Boarding school, Clayoquot had been there two days before, and that he (Mr Thornberg) had promised that Hilda should go to the Roman Catholic school as soon as she received her discharge.\"\nfrom Alberni. I turned to the recess and asked Hilda to come out. She came out and sat down on a trunk beside me. I was speaking to her having her hand in mine, when he seized hold of it, saying, \"That's mine, not yours.\" With that he immediately gave Hilda a turn, saying something to her, and she fled out the front door.\n\nMr Thornberg following her, yelling, \"Take to the bush, Hilda, take to the bush!\" I went after Hilda and caught her. She was panting. She said, \"I am afraid of my father. He will kill me, he will kill me!\" This she repeated several times, and seemed to be in great fear of him. I told her not to fear, that it would be all right. I brought Hilda back, and told Mr Thornberg that it was no use talking further, that I had decided to take Hilda back with me. I tried to find Andy in the bush, but could not. Mr Thornberg asked Hilda if she would like to go back to Alberni, and she said at once, \"Yes\". Mr Thornberg wished me to leave her till next day promising he would bring her over to Mr Russell's, but I could not trust him. Hilda came over to Mr Russell's with us, and her father came and visited her there before leaving for Alberni. Mr Russell was an eye witness of all that happened between Mr Thornberg and myself.\n\nAs to its legal aspect, I asked a prominent lawyer here as to my course, and he said it was all right, and that I could send for Andy at any time. This I did, sending a constable, but unfortunately the expense in connection was $25.00.\n\nNow that I have the custody of the children, Mr Thornberg wishes the Department to intervene on his behalf to save him expense, something he never considered either in the maintenance, care, or travel of his children. I do not think that Mr Thornberg is legally entitled to the control, choice of place of residence, or custody of his children until they are discharged from this school. The Presbyterian Church has borne the full expense of their education, and it would be sad indeed if we had so little control that the father could withdraw them at any time, and transfer them to a R.C. School, especially after the slanderous reasons put forward by Mr Thornberg.\n\nIf he wishes to withdraw his children, and should there be some legal way whereby he can obtain the custody of his children before the regular time of discharge; he should be granted the privilege by the Court that before obtaining their discharge he should pay for their maintenance while resident.\n\nIn my letter to the Department, I miswrote my letter, it should have read; \"We do not intend to recommend the discharge etc.\" It was written hurriedly.\n\nI am sorry that you have been troubled over this. It was my intention to place the matter before Mr Thornton Bell as soon as he returned from the East, for his legal opinion. I shall be glad if you will return the correspondence as soon as you have finished with it.\n\nI may say in closing, that I do not think Mr Thornberg is a fit and proper person to have the care and further training of\nhis children who are here. He is an old man of sixty-three years of age, has lived over thirty years amongst the Indians, and is not any better than one now himself. The Captain of the \"Queen City\" mentioned to me that it was a blessing they were here, as the father seems to be growing worse mentally all the time.\n\nTrusting the Committee will carefully consider this matter, and hoping they will not sacrifice the interests of the School for the sake of expedience,\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) Jas R. Motion\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nYour note received re Mr Thornberg, and my own feeling has been in the direction which you indicate; that is, to discharge the children in order to allay agitation that must be hurtful to the work.\n\nI have written to Mr Motion acquainting him with your judgment, and suggesting that he might negotiate with Mr Thornberg on the basis of a refund of maintenance to a small amount. I suggest this not because of the money value, but in the hope that it will prevent any others from thinking that they can by creating an agitation pursue a similar course with success. The question of discipline is the principle one involved, and possibly some such demand would prevent harm in that direction.\n\nThe Committee will meet on the 20th instant, and pronounce upon it, but I have in the meantime taken the responsibility of making this suggestion.

Miss Hilda's mother was one of our\npeople, and the Father has never answered her properly.\nMiss Hilda since she was born, also Miss Hilda's\nmother was a Catholic & so is the daughters, so\nplease don't forbid the Father the privilege\nto send Miss Hilda to the Catholic school.\nRev.

A petition has been received from them asking for her immediate discharge and the authorities of the Presbyterian Church have been written to on this subject. Accompanying the petition were letters from Mr. Thornberg and his son (who was lately a pupil at this school) reflecting on the management. While the Department does not place much reliance on the charges, it considers that it would be well to have the school inspected at the earliest possible date by Mr. Inspector Green, and you will be good enough to instruct that officer accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.\nIndian Supt.\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA, 6th February, 1905\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Department had hoped that the question of the disposal of the Thornberg children, who were pupils at the Alberni boarding school, was finally settled as in your letter of the 4th Oct. last on regard to them you stated that the Committee endorsed the recommendation of the Department advising Mr. Motion to surrender the children, but also suggesting that a small claim should be made for maintenance during their term in the school. At the same time should it be found impossible to secure anything the recommendation was that the children should not be detained. You said further that you were glad to have received from Mr. Motion a letter in which he acquiesces in the decision and had come to feel that it was better to act upon the recommendation of the Department.\n\nA petition has just been received from the Ahousaht Indians asking for the removal of Hilda Thornberg, one of the children referred to, from the Alberni school, where she still appears to be retained, contrary to the terms of your letter above quoted.\n\nThe Department considers that Mr. Motion should be directed by you to carry out the understanding arrived at in regard to both these children.\n\nRev. R. P. MacKay, D.D.\n\nConfederation Life Building\n\nToronto\nThe boy was returned but the girl is retained pending the payment of $100.00 claimed by Mr. Motion as compensation for their maintenance, so the petition states. Whatever the cause, Mr. Motion has failed to carry out your instructions, and the Department must now insist upon the girl's being discharged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 6th February, 1905\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General\n\nWith reference to the petition from the Ahousaht Indians and the accompanying correspondence regarding the retention of Hilda Thornberg at the Alberni boarding school by Mr. Motion, the Principal, I beg to say that the Principal has no right to retain the girl at the school. On the 4th Oct. last Rev. Dr. Mackay wrote the Department stating that the Foreign Mission Committee had endorsed this Department's recommendation advising Mr. Motion to surrender Thornberg's children. He also stated that he had received a letter from Mr. Motion in which he acquiesces in this decision. The boy was returned but the girl is held as collateral security for $100.00, which Mr. Motion claims as compensation for her board.\n\nMr. Motion has clearly no right to retain the girl and I think that Rev. Dr. Mackay should be asked to instruct him to discharge her at once. The letters from Thornberg and his son seem to reflect on the management of the school, and I think it would be well if Mr. Inspector Green were sent to this school at the earliest possible moment.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6431, File 877-1, part 1)\nI wrote & received a letter to you for last mail dated Oct 14th 1904. I wrote & received another about the 16th January 1905. You may not believe what I wrote then, so I explain the Agent's letter to me, same in the reply to my previous refusal of my consent to my daughter Miss Hilda marry Mr. Craig. She is living here in Alberton - too old for to get married at her age and to date 15 years & 4 months old - was it for that purpose that those Presbyterian Missionaries made a cowardly & unlawful attack on me on Sept 28th 1903 and was it for the same reason that your appointed Agent Mr. Wells fouled & made a statement to me on Oct 4th 1904 - saying that the Rev. Father P. Maurice would have nothing to do about teaching my daughter Hilda in the Faith that she was baptised - also that the said Agent wanted not alone for me as Miss Hilda Maurice to do to of course I knew that my daughter would leave now that coward Mr. Maurice control & power - but is these acts lawful - I know they are not lawful - but those people know, that it would ruin me here in my business has to leave & go to the East about this matter - I had a letter for their last mail in which the Rev. Father P. Maurice invited me for to go up to Victoria for an reply to the law for justice.

He has begun to do some clearing. I did not know about the other matter but we were young men ourselves once & he might be a good husband notwithstanding. However I have no desire to press you, only I thought she might get tied up with a good deal worse man than Charlie.\n\nIf that is correct what Andy tells you about men or lads sleeping with the girls in the Mission it is a disgrace to the management. I have spoken to Mr. Motion several times about exercising more supervision over the girls at night. If that were known it would do harm to the school. I hear today that there was a fire in the building this morning but it was put out before any harm was done.\n\nBy the way what about that dollar that you sent Hilda.

This surprises me because I thought the matter had been settled long ago. In a letter received from Mr Motion dated 24 September is the following sentence;-\"I feel that it is best to carry out Mr Pedley's suggestion. I will arrange for the children's return. It might be well to let Andy go home first, and Hilda a little later.\" I assumed that the matter had been adjusted long ago. Mr Motion adds;-\"There is no excitement amongst the Indians at Ahousaht over this matter.\" He also stated in a letter about the same date that there was no use in negotiating with Mr Thornberg as to the payment of money, so that your statement that Hilda was retained pending the payment of $100.00 as compensation for maintenance, only increases the perplexity. I shall write to Mr Motion, and hope you will hear no more of it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

To that I could answer \"Yes\" and \"no\". It must of course if no better is provided, be made to do, but the work will be done with less efficiency. In the summer time when the doors and windows are open, it is less objectionable. But you can understand how a very small building, full of such children lacks breathing space.\n\nMay I suggest that if this is not granted, it may be the more possible to raise the grant for Ahousaht. They have already 35 pupils and the grant is only for 25. Mr Butchart says they can reach 50 by July 1st.

The Fire Extinguishers (2) asked for would cost $38.00 landed at Alberni and would have with each extinguisher two charges, while the bell is estimated by the Principal to cost $30.00, making a total of $68.00. I may add that the Bell is quite as necessary as the Extinguishers for the reason that often on an outbreak of fire the pupils may be at some little distance of the buildings and not be aware of the necessity of their presence at the school until perhaps too late to be of service in extinguishing the flames.

In sending you the correspondence I did not wish to make the Department a party to any dispute between two schools. If you have so interpreted my action you have misunderstood my motive. On the other hand it is less than justice to allow the whole blame to rest on Mr Motion, although as you say, it might have been better had he obeyed instructions. He however entered into what he deemed an honorable contract with Mr Thornberg which was disturbed by dishonorable interference. I have no doubt Hilda has been sent home before now.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6431, File 877-1, part 1)\nWest Coast Agency, B.C.\nReport of A.W. Neill Indian Agent, for month of January, 1905.\n\nDuring the month an outbreak of fire occurred at the Alberni Boarding School & the it was speedily noticed and extinguished by one of the boys, it is made more serious by the, I think, undoubted fact, that it was of incendiary origin, Circumstances point to it being the work of some one of the pupils.

Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo enclosing a budget of correspondence consisting of several letters and one extract relating to the Thornberg children, pupils at the Alberni boarding school, and in reply I beg to say that, as requested, this correspondence is returned herewith.\n\nThis Department has no intention of being made a party to any dispute between the Clayoquot and the Alberni schools.\n\nThe question under discussion, the discharge of Hilda Thornberg from the Alberni school and if Mr. Motion, the Principal of this school, had carried out your directions as outlined in your letter of the 4th Oct. last, a copy of which is enclosed, the subsequent unpleasantness, which has arisen would have been avoided. The XIX Department trusts that the girl will be sent home on the first boat as suggested by Mr. Motion and that the difficulty will then be settled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. R. P.

Mr Motion to Dr MacKay 11 Oct.,\n7. Mr Butchart to Mr Motion 24 Jan'y.\n8. Extract letter from Miss Armstrong.\n\nIt seems partially confidential, and yet I think you should see it. It reveals a much more serious state of affairs than the mere retention of Hilda in the Alberni School. If Father Manus is thus manipulating the Indians for the purpose of securing children for the Clayoquot School, then I fear the whole mission enterprise is greatly impaired if not absolutely defeated. This is not a solitary case. Complaints have come again and again about this poaching at Ahousaht. I do not know that the Department can do anything, but this correspondence will show at least that Mr Motion acted honorably according to agreement with Mr Thornberg in retaining Hilda, to which contract Mr Neill was an party.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Peeley Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received a letter today from Rev. Dr. MacKay, Foreign Mission Secretary concerning Mr. Thornberg's daughter Hilda, a pupil from Ahousaht.\n\nHilda is not retained pending payment of $100.00 claimed by me for Maintenance.\n\nShe is here with Mr. Thornberg's full consent as contained in agreement entered into with Mr. Indian Agent Neill, particulars of which are contained in letter to me dated Oct. 8th, which I agree to and carried out at once.\n\nThe correspondence I am forwarding to Dr. MacKay and am asking him to forward it to you.\n\nIn your letter to Dr. MacKay you say, \"Whatever the cause, Mr. Norton has failed to carry out your instructions, and the Department must now insist upon the girl being discharged.\"\n\nI have no desire to disobey the instructions of either the Church or Department, but it would have been well, had you had later information before condemning, or insisting on the girl's discharge. Hilda will return home by first steamer. As Principal Mahrus is behind Mr. Thornberg in all this I must protest against the Department allowing her to enter the Catholic Industrial School at Clayoquot.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nIndian Office Victoria B.C.\n\nFeb. 16th 1905.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant No. 112,220, in reference to complaints made by the Indians of Ahousaht touching the detention of Hilda Thornberg in the Alberni Boarding School from which it was decided that her discharge should take place, etc.\n\nTouching this question I would refer the Department to my letter of the 26th of May, 1904 No. L-4-750, wherein it is clearly demonstrated that the Thornberg children were not Indian children. I might also remark in this connection that Hilda Thornberg was retained at the school with the consent of her father as will be seen by inclosed copy of a letter from the Indian Agent, dated October 19th, 1904, No. 694-5. This arrangement was agreed upon by him in consideration of the boy, Andy, being allowed to join his father and on account of the girl's disinclination to leave the school, as reported by Mr. Agent Neill.\n\nThe Revd. Dr. Campbell who took an interest in the matter and was opposed to the children being held at the school against the will of their father approved of this arrangement. On the 9th, 10th & 11th ultimo, Mr. Inspector Green visited the school; his report, dated last instant has been duly forwarded to the Department.\n\nFrank Pedley Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nIt will be noticed that in his general remarks he speaks favorably of the management, under which circumstances I have not mentioned the matter to him; but should it be deemed desirable that Mr. Inspector Green should make a special visit to investigate further in the matter, upon receipt of instructions to that end, I will so advise him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSupt. of Indian Affairs B.C.\nWest Coast Indian Agency, Alberni B.C.\n\n694-5.

The Department has no funds available for the purchase of a bell and considers that, if Mr. Neill carries out the instructions sent him in May, last, regarding fire drill and provides the triangle called for by these instructions, it will answer the purpose.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Vowell Esq.\n\nVictoria, B.C.\nWest Coast Indian Agency,\n\nALBERNI, B.C\u2014July 8th, 1909.\n\nLETTER NO. 566-12\n\n346176\n\nSIR\u2014\n\nI have the honor to report that I learn, casually and non-officially, that Mr. J.R. Norton has resigned as Principal of the Alberni Boarding school and that his successor has already been appointed.\n\nSome years ago (in March 1900 I believe) the Dept. issued certain rules in connection with the establishment of these schools, one of which was to the effect that no member of the school staff should be changed or employed without the sanction of the Dept.\n\nIt would be an excellent thing to enforce this rule. So far as this Agency is concerned it is a dead letter. The various churches appoint principals and teachers without any reference to the Dept., and after the men are actually on the ground I report the fact to the Dept., which sends a formal approval.\n\nI would suggest that in each case the name of the party proposed to be appointed should be submitted to the Dept., together with a statement showing his educational qualifications and experience and no appointment made until the sanction of the Dept. had been obtained. As it is done today the man or woman is actually on the field and the Dept. is really not consulted at all, merely notified and it would extremely difficult for the Dept. to object to a man after he had brought his family, perhaps a couple of thousand miles and was actually installed. But if the consent had been obtained first, the Dept. could veto an impossible appointment without trouble and the very fact of its having to be done would make the various churches more careful of who they choose.\n\nAs regards day school teachers I would suggest that there be appointments that teachers must hold a teaching certificate or its equivalent as a guarantee of their own educational qualifications.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6431, File 877-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES OF CANADA\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES DU CANADA\nAs to the principals of Industrial & Boarding schools, I would suggest that some college training should be an essential, not entirely for the book learning thereby acquired but because a man who has attended college for several years is more likely at least to have rubbed shoulders with the world and gained some experience of dealing with men and to have acquired tact, self-control and common sense\u2014all qualities much needed in dealing with the Indian parents. All principals should at least possess the equivalent of a first-class teacher's certificate and to have had some previous experience among Indians.\n\nIf what I hear is correct the gentleman who has been appointed as Mr. Norton's successor is a B.A., and has been for a number of years in similar work so that there would be no trouble over this appointment and for that very reason I consider the present moment a favourable one for the Dept. to announce that its rule must in future be adhered to. If one or two of the applicants of whom I have heard, had had sufficient \"pull\" to secure the office, the school and the Dept. would have been saddled with a dead weight which would have caused no end of trouble for many years to come.\n\nSo much of the success of these schools depends on the men at the head of them that it seems only just that the Dept., who contributes such a large portion of the cost, should be able to exercise an actual instead of merely a nominal supervision over their selection.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOn Sept 23, 1905, Mr. Russell and his motion came right here to our house and took my sister Hilda off by force. I was in hiding under the house and heard all that was said. I heard my sister say \"don't\" and then I heard her screaming and running right past me out of the house and up the high and rocky cliffs. I also heard my father running and hallooing out \"help! help!\" and calling on the Indians that live across the water on the curve but none came. All the men were off sealing after a time. I heard them leave taking my sister with them so I came out of my hiding. Father showed me a very high and steep cliff where my motion gave him a heavy push and if Father had not grabbed a little underbrush just at his hand he would surely have tumbled to the bottom and that would have killed him; it is a wonder that my sister saved herself from having a tumble down this rocky cliff when that big long-legged man Mr. Motion was in full chase. He heard her screaming the whole time. I was taken away from home by an order from Inspector Russell. I feel very much because I did not want to leave school but Father told me there was no help for it just then but that he would consult the lawyer in Victoria from whom I was taken back to Alberni until the day that his motion was completed to get me out of prison. Better me and my sister was not allowed to read over Father's letter. Mr. Motion would read part of it (not all) to us. Father was very very sick last winter and I knew now that we did not know anything about the first letter he wrote to us telling us how sick and helpless he was, and all alone with our little Brother only 4 years old. My sister has changed very much since that awful day Sept 23, 1905 in Alberni when she took her case to our statement she did not tell the whole truth about it but I did so therefore when we tried to pack again to the mission it is nearly 3 miles to Mr. Bob's house.\nDepartment would likely not allow me to send my daughter to the Rev. Father Marquis' school.\n\nWill dear P., what caused I say to that\u2014are we going back to the time when it was right to lie, far to say that my children are Catholics? Is there no justice now for a poor man, since the Presbyterian Missionaries have come out this West? It seems to me that Mr. Macdonald did not return to me, my boy Andrews for next fall to Alberni. I would then have all rights (claim to myself an account of heavy expenses to East etc. in Victoria) and give up to Victoria and have the case disposed of by law in court\u2014the Rev. James home for next fall, and promised letter, I received your letter written on Oct 14th 1904\u2014my son James Macdonald into my boy Andrews, will go to Father Marquis school\u2014but I want him to write to you here in this P.C. what he does himself about how the first went to Alberni School & later trouble.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTreat Marbury\n\n---\n\nThe Hon. Clifford Wilson\n\nDear Sir\u2014\n\nI was not so very young when I first went to Alberni School and I told the truth when I say that my father never asked at any time for any of the Presbyterian Missionaries to take charge of us\u2014but Father was nearly out of his head account of our mother's sudden death by poison and Mr. Russell took advantage of this and fooled and lied to Father until he got the best of it & Father consented for to let 2 of us go to Alberni School, but when we came home in the month of August 1903\u2014Father then made arrangement with the Rev. P. Marquis for all of us to be that but by him\u2014he also appointed some to be our lawful guardian because our mother was a Catholic\u2014and was lawful major and all of us 6 children are baptized by same church\u2014my sister Hilda was quite willing for it to be so and she said so\u2014when Father Marquis came to see us and arrangements were made for her to go to his school when the Rev. Father came back from Victoria (in about 10 days) but a few days after...\nOttawa, March 26, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 16th inst., with inclosures, I beg to say that the Principal of the Alberni Boarding School, Rev. J.R. Motion, may be granted leave of absence for the months of April and May, provided arrangements are made for efficiently carrying on the work during the time he will be away.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria, B.C.\nBritish Columbia.\n\nIndian Office,\n\nVictoria, July 14th, 1909.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith, for the information and consideration of the Department, a letter, dated the 8th instant, No. 566/12, received from Mr. Agent Neill, of the West Coast Agency, B. C., reporting that he has learnt casually and non-officially that Mr. J. R. Motion has resigned the office of principal of the Alberni Boarding School, and that his successor has already been appointed.\n\nIn instances in which a grant is made by the Department to a school in the superintendency, I concur in the remark of the Agent that, where possible to do so, no member of the school staff should be changed or one employed without the sanction of the Department.\n\nConcerning Mr. Neill's remarks as to the advisability of the Department's requiring teachers of Indian day schools to hold a teachers certificate, or its equivalent, as a guarantee of educational ability, it may be stated that for various reasons the suggestion is considered to be impracticable at the present time and under existing conditions. Much difficulty has\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nAs, it is said, for some time past been experienced by the various religious denominations under whose auspices the several schools are conducted throughout the superintendency in filling vacancies in such schools, not to mention the endeavors made to procure the services of efficient teachers for new Indian day schools as occasion demands from time to time. Even as matters stand at present, it is, as affects the agencies in general, difficult to make much progress at the day schools owing for one reason to the tendency of teachers to change so frequently, with its concomitant loss of time in many instances to the pupils concerned, as may be observed by a perusal of Mr. School Inspector Green's letter to the Victoria office of the 21st of last month, a duplicate of which was transmitted to the Department on the 23rd ultimo under cover of letter No. 445. P. 5.\n\nMany of the teachers of Indian day schools in the province of British Columbia are far removed from the centres of civilization, and with the cost of living materially in excess of that of a few years ago\u2014which, even then, was a matter of surprise to the new-comer\u2014it is, under the circumstances, but reasonable to expect changes in the personnel of the teaching staff throughout the superintendency, especially when consideration is given to the salaries obtaining in provincial and urban localities throughout British Columbia, which range from about $80 per month in the provincial schools to $125.00 in the larger cities of the province.\n\nTo require teachers of Indian day schools in British Columbia to possess certificates of competency would, under present departmental\ndepartmental salary grants, it is thought, tend to the closing of many of these schools throughout the superintendency.\n\nTo give effect to the Agent's suggestion respecting the qualification and training to be required of principals of boarding and industrial schools\u2014which, I take it, he intends should apply throughout the superintendency\u2014it may be remarked that while the suggestion is an excellent one as intended to better the standing of the institutions affected, it is considered that the outcome would likely be to still further increase the difficulty said to be experienced in securing suitable teachers on the part of the various religious denominations conducting the several institutions of the province and, in all likelihood the Department would be applied to, after a shorter or longer lapse of time, for larger grants as an offset to the additional cost of maintaining these establishments by reason of the stricter requirements imposed upon the management in each instance; and from the tenor of the Department's letters on the subject from time to time received of late years it is understood that it is not at present disposed to entertain requests for increased grants to Indian boarding and industrial schools.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

He was brought up in Owen Sound, his educational course covering the ground necessary for a teacher's certificate, but having entered the Post Office service, he did not try for a certificate. He seems a very likeable young man and is highly commended by Mr. Wilson, the minister of Walkerton where he has been in service for a considerable number of years. He has been active in Young People's and Sabbath School work, and in every way seems to be the kind of man we are after.\n\nYou will be glad to hear that reports from Alberni and from Ahousaht are very satisfactory as to the new appointments. Miss Norrice is proving not only an efficient teacher but a good disciplinarian. Mr. Ross has reported that both Miss Whiting and Miss Hall are satisfactory. With this we are very much pleased.\n\nI shall be glad to have your approval of Mr. Currie's appointment as early as possible if it commends itself to you, in order that he may go west almost immediately to get his hand upon the work before Mr. Hendry leaves the mission.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6431, File 877-1, part 1)\nOttawa, January 3rd, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of your letter of the 20th ultimo in which you recommend the appointment of Miss Lillie Morrice as teacher of the Alberni school I beg to say that the Department approves of this appointment and trusts that Miss Morrice will meet with success in the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. R. P. MacKay, D.D.,\n\nSecretary,\n\nForeign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\n\nToronto, Ont.\nExtract from Agent Neill's report on the West Coast Agency for the month of March, 1910.\n\nI regret to report that Mr. and Mrs. W. A. Hendry, principal and matron, of the Alberni Boarding School have resigned. Mr. Hendry was in charge of this school about 6 months and had he stayed I am sure he would have worked a great improvement. A very able man, of high education, long experience in school management, and possessing in a marked degree the tact and judgment so essential to success in handling the Indians. I am pleased to know that the Department recognised his abilities and offered him a position soon after he severed his connection with the Church. Their successors have arrived, Mr. and Mrs. H. B. Currie. They appear to be very nice people and well intentioned, but they have absolutely no experience in this work, have no knowledge of school management, or of nursing, or of handling Indians; they do not appear to have even been fully informed of the conditions under which they will have to work. I repeat that, personally, I think they are people of fine character, but it is not fair to them, it is not fair to the school, it is not fair to the Department for the Church to send out people so entirely inexperienced in the work. However any assistance I can render will be heartily given and in time Mr. Currie may overcome the handicap under which he enters on his position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n(Signed) A. W. Neill.\nChristie Industrial School\nClayquot, B.C.,\nJuly 20th 1910\n\nMy dear Papa,\n\nI trust that the past nice weather made you feel a whole lot better. Last Tuesday we had a picnic in Highland. We were picking some gooseberries and some crab apples. The boys were playing baseball. I was there also. The boys have lots of fun swimming. I know how to swim now.\n\nRev. Father Charles is building a church out in Highland. Some boys are working there. Mr. Turner and another man from Nesquiat are working there.\n\nYesterday we had washday but I was not washing. I was doing in the garden. Fred is well the same as you will close my letter.\n\nGod by my dear Papa\n\nYour loving son Johnnie P.\nThis kind of letter come p. & at the end of every month 22nd please read them & am I only fill for a moderate price this has said now 3 different times and to show his best for a complete deal my please at a game dept of sale etc. you very truly.\n\nFred Thompson\n\nDear Fred,\n\nYou did well not to bother with the bunch back by. Let them go to three people for help who aid them fighting you.\n\nBut my dear friend, by your writing I see you are going down and breaking up and you better begin to think how to prepare for a happy end. Years ago I gave you a book \"The Faith of Our Fathers,\" read a portion everyday, and pray for light and grace. It will not be very long you will be standing before the judgment seat of God. I am very much afraid so, judging by your shaking in writing. It is evident physically failing health. Take the warning in time. Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6431, File 877-1, part 1)\nI was pretty bad, often in bed, and there was a charge for it, and then letters to me at Thornberg.\n\nChristie Industrial School,\nClayoquot B.C.\nApril 15th 1918\n\nMy dear Papa,\n\nAt Easter we had a very nice time, lots of eggs and many good things.\n\nThis week it is my charge to sweep the hallways stairs.\n\nEvery day some boys are playing football on the beach. Except when it's raining we cannot play on the beach. The day before yesterday Freddie got a little mouse. I lost my trap that's why I can't get any more rats. I lost my trap in the woodshed. The boy and the girls are all happy at school.\n\nNow I will close my letter.\n\nGoodbye my dear Papa,\n\nYour loving son,\n\nJohnnie Thornberg.\nMy dear Friend,\n\nIt gives me pleasure to write you that John and Fred have again been doing good satisfaction the last month. In Freddie there is a marked change. He is no more the self-willed baby he was when you put him here. He is developing a manly boy, full of fun, get-up and cheerfulness. He is besides getting as smart as a book.\n\nHow is your garden doing? Have you kept any chickens? If not would you not be willing to keep some. If we have good success with hatching, I will give you some here. I am going to introduce a system of poultry keeping that will appeal to Indians and serve of utility.\n\nTruly,\n\n[Signature]\nThis is how I got that letter and it started first when we came to camp in June 1909 with Hilda for to get her baggage from the boat and I got some antelope from my store but we had to land Hilda first at the reserve antelope and then go north 3 miles around a point into Malakota Creek and to my store that is quite close by water to the inside of the reserve before leaving Nakawis I wrote a letter to Mr. Goddard stating that his blackguarding of me was a lie and Hilda signed her name to it. The Rev. Father Marcus attested it. I sent the letter and then by an idiot carrying back again from my store we got angry and F. Marcus & Willie went all there I said in camp with Freddie now this is an affidavit by Willie & Willie certify an Aboriginal Reserve Goddard come to us and he said over that my father F. Marcus was a liar and that he could easily slap his face because he was an old man now. The Rev. Father Marcus did not reply to this man. Copy signed and delivered before me to be true at Clagaynat B.C. May 31st day of March 1910 John Gage J.P. Willie Threading when I came back to my house I took Willie from school & F. Marcus advice not fight for me here alone I wrote out copy you seen I shall clear my character and then copy of mine Victoria B.C. June 22nd 1909 I hereby certify that to my knowledge my father never carried a gun or a pistol of any kind on the reserve for to shoot any Indians.\n\nHe threatened that if he catches any Indi-Boys on his own land and home unlawfully over\nI was forbidden by his Capt. Will to go on the reserve - he let go the mile Baby - I gave him this 4 caps to read - I left him too to go to Willie a short distance from me - when his angry talk stop me - he said - Willie written up, he said I'd be well shot me (on the night of 31st Oct 1898 when that same J. Gordon had threatened her in his bedroom and I offered and she sworn to if my Capt. Will's Willie become Willie herself content to them that she was in his bedroom and he took her by the hands and he said don't be afraid of your Father and then said I don't know what I'm doing here - I'm not sure of them here to me and (only that night when will him) xx and Miss Mrs. Neill has got a paper written by Willie and that will just for you (questioning) I just went off home and would not reply to him after - well he is worse than a Blackguard but he is your Capt. Will's friend - I will write in another sheet about Willie reply to me about this letter to Miss Mrs. Neill now this hour and that proves that the Justice Willis was right in this company - I left letter (it should be addressed in the boss field) take there. Then Andy came back from taking and heard about P. G. Raybin, my face my two boys head to see their Bullies - he was not an angry old man's face then but he told - if your Father don't murder you will get a religion - x x x (from Congregate Mr. Daniel) at that place (he is the owner of Alcanal) has a large house there and Hotel & Whisky Bar - the court house and a small jail in there and a house for the constable & live in and is shown rented by (Court house) Jail by the government and Mr. W. Bailey is also a J. D. it was the constable from there that this bully was to have for me - do you understand a little better now if not you will be able to hang yourself if ever more\nIf you don't believe me I will get a policeman and put\nhim off on him. Why Miller replied our Father went\nup, we were there. Some months later there came\nI got again mad at my Boy (me) and I was sick of home\nand he said he would not go (with) and your Father in the same\ntears. Will you make notice this come? He said to me\nWill that Miss my Hall now this. Not hold meetings from\nHilda that would do that (questioning).\nLook up.\nShower and depart before me to be here then 30 days of\nMay at Calgary and B.C. 1862 John G. Smith\nSigned by Miller Thomas\n\nWhen Mr. Frank Reddy was in Victoria and had\nmeetings with those that claimed his right on\nthese Mother side to the Victoria reserve\u2014my Grand\nfather's older wrote to me often and told me all\nwhat what was said by Mr. Frank Reddy and the\nowners of that reserve\u2014her Father is the husband of\nmy Daughter Mr. Andrews and as she was 43 years old\non the 18th April well you can see it too that\nwe have very much to look to you when I first had\nher Mother a middle aged old Woman. I was quite\na young man employed by the old Chief Justice Cameron\nhe just wanted what I was a good servant. So Mr. A.B.\nhe was the owner of a large part of the good timber\nland on the other side of the reserve below.\n\nbut it would take too much writing now for me to give you\nthe proper\u2014see this\u2014my writing will prove itself to be true\nwithout any other proof also as I was a young doctor\nin 1862 in Feb 22nd when I first put feet at U.S.\nyou can see there could be many other men that knew\neverything about old Chief Justice Cameron etc. There\nwas very few white children around & that Legion etc.\nSo in those days of peace there was certainly young\nChildren I seen them\u2014these Mothers when the came\nvisiting the old place but that was by a Road from Esquimalt\nand as the first held meeting a Willie on the way to town\nDouglas Hotel and a Danister was there some together\nYoung Wife\u2014she was held and daughters by name Willie\nThe had married an Officer in the way but was in\nEngland and the Young Wife had died before I came to\nwork for him in April 1862 and that Legion there was\njust the place for the native to come\u2014& I can only make\nthese point very limited but if I live I will write\nwhat will be her interesting history for you to know.\nI can learn the old Indians the same as I done on the\nU.S. but all is nearly forgotten now so much talked of\nlate years\u2014I seen in that Legion the chief head Chief\na finals millionaire but\u2014will my Wife Father went to\nhim at Chief into a very old man but in his younger\ndays must have been a very powerful Chief\u2014Chief\nTrivie was the name of the real Chief and had several\nsons & I seen 3 of them but no daughters more than once\nTrivie always bothered me about A.B & men and I never\nwould allow him or tell the chief to any nation and keep\nvery little for H.B.C. men my self and that was one reason why the old man wanted me as he did one day I was at work with 2 horses at one of the water farms to the mill and the fire was getting nothing to me and so former Taylor came riding on a fine horse down in the road & the next from the main road from Victoria around the hollows against Portion bridge he saw the fire and got off the horse tied it and came over to speak a chat with the old man I have written about that incident to me & when it was a wilderness almost here & H.B.C. would talk true to me the Indians the same or the fire could not be Victoria (I was nothing there) I told him & he said that head chief always wanted H.B.C. men & so he said I have wasted his time that he don't stop drinking and get drunk so often the well never be chief of the Victoria & when three fathers die & he will come back as he said that was not very long after this father died and a mother aged wife with a child had a springing and smart well & name fires (Shamrock) was springing itself and he held that for many years and got very rich but how it would be interesting to know when he died I got this letter from my great daughter after my son in law Louis returned the letter but he can not write so it was written by the man he worked for I think it was Miller in Johnson Street that bought him two cows in some place near river but first time before I say that letter my wife father by the side door should then have been chief but he was very old & nearly blind and he died in 1869 and I was still with the fire but a month had come and it would have been a complete ruin for him and his legacy had been all we were told he had he still kept his position the man his wife & family met he sat in 1844 or 45 forget exact year for to make charge of his residence and the Indians servant that he had there (my own) in his residence was sent up north along with also that his young daughter had the Indians tell me that she went like prisoners of war the pot them at the time of the uprising were the Indians that he had & that several times & they kept the fires very fine pure spring water in the house (40 tons when full) called Shamrock spring water was also given to was the 6 thousand 4 & my self & I was told that she was wanted for water but I will write more about that when I become what I seem then in that side beyond the fine long huge double post holes on each side & enter into the big Shamrock and there I will not say anything about what happen here in the year 1859 & I seen the very first the Lefligh that was here in that year in front of the Minaret and outside of time they I feel lonely a very cold day I seen there and looked to a little bird that and the belonged to Shamrock but went to England that was in the month of May 1861 & she told me good luck to me but I did not hear any thing about her afterwards\nbut more strange still is this my Father had $200 before\nand I know both well not here (opposed) and he found\nmoney and have one baby by a girl from father Thomas\nwhich is already first cousin to my own children here\nand then freely the Plat on Howard side for some\nmoney & your life. It puzzled me but in records of\nsomeone selling an add in the paper came to me. I\nthink it was in 1878 forget exact and he told me\nthat Capt. Mr. W. V. Smith did not like that add in\nthe paper to send the list to me and I was told that\n$500 would do well build a house for forty because\nI could not take care of the old but that everyone\nand the next hotel owner etc. well I build a house with\na few days help from an other but paid him and it\nwas only $200 or so from the house I paid my wife\nlived at the time from the store I had never would\nhave been there an obvious excuse and for me & my\nwife & the old Chief Benjamin the same was it then\nnow & I'm the Blackwood man it for W. Danby & the\nhouse we lived in from 1886 until 1889 then had\nhope of that place we lived & worked on a house belonging\nto the Indians Reserve and that was newly all build\n& no when for the first time I went back to Howard\nin 1825 but then back again to my old Indian Ojibway\nin Oct. 1834\n\nbut I'll send to your dept the duplicate about this\n$500 for a house for that Mr. I believe when I was over\nhere & Mr. H. Guellad put me $150 for the coffin for him\nI did not wish for it. That was Mr. Russell doing what he\nfilled of it. This is very limited funds of all which I\ncan obtain to be known to be from here but will\ntry to if I don't dictate an unclear you get weary and\ndon't love to know what is really interesting & not lies\nand the truth, now to go back to the Chief etc of Ojibway\nVend. the Chief Michel Rogers was and a small boy then\nand always could be of no use as a Chief then\nso that was reason also why he former Ojibway made\nthat bad Jim (Huron) Chief here is the copy\nof that Letter but as it is very long so I will cut out\nthe chief parts \u2014 Victoria 28th Oct. 1872\nMy dear Fred,\nI was very pleased to receive\na letter from you about a few times ago at O was at that\ntime living and paying a claim in Bowden Bq. & Miller off stand\nthe first in this letter is about that bad Fred Thomas'\nDick Shackle and he was not a policeman then and Mr. H.\nGuellad knew that he was a drunk (or a Drunk)\n& about a week ago an old came from the W. & who\nclaims to be the husband of your sister. He demanded\nmany and bailings and bail, in case he should be\nlocked up by the Police for drunkenness, he then told me\nthat he is in the habit of drinking very much whiskey\nbut as I don't know the India, I will not suspect him in\nanyway, except you give me full particulars about this\nquestion in your next letter.\n\nPOOR COPY\nand also let me know if he is the husband of your Wife Luter\nand whether he is in any need of help or not.\n\nAbout three months ago Chief Jim died, and had a\nvery large funeral.

I could see and I was left alone with my little Boy Fredrick and about 3\u00bd years old\u2014well I took sick (not disease) and for 2 full nights nearly 3 days I was completely gone almost in a shelter in bed and knew very little what was going on in my house, the only thing I can call to mind was I knew that my little Boy would sometimes be by my side and his head on my breast\u2014no kid\u2014had come over here, but I felt someone waking me roughly and looking up I seen my dead Wife Mother standing over me\u2014my little Boy just able to put his head up over the bed sheet\u2014looking me in the Eyes\u2014That brought me out of this stupor and the Kid made a face and hot Water & tea & condensed Cream set me all right and I believe the little Boy wanted it as badly as myself\u2014but that little thing managed to live\u2014not allow burn the House down as well as him self\u2014me trying to light a Lamp or for to make a fire in those etc.\u2014well\u2014there surely is someone wherever that may be that helps those that needs that help\u2014well since that time something has been wrong with my heart and it did not make much noise for to tell me especially if it is every trouble they about my children\u2014I attest was advised by a former Att.-General for to write to the Hon. Clifford Sifton etc.\u2014well that started it O.K. and after a time Oct 14th 1904. I recant a Letter from you that Mr. Morton had got orders for to discharge my children\u2014be patience refused and on the 1st of Oct 1904 he wrote that the Church wanted them before he would let them an Andy go. I then wrote and a statement of facts for publication in the Colonist but the Editor was afraid of libel but he started the mill soon and a Constable Mr. McDaniel was sent to me by Mr. Harris\u2014well he had a look\nThis Court asked me where Mr. Russell had been? I told him I did not know. Oh we will find him all right, and he left. Then when I came Mr. Neill was there and I wrote my letter. Freda went on board after I got my things on shore and I talked with him in his bedroom until nearly midnight. We began to be interested with the notion of going. I wrote letters with Mr. Motien. Andy came for next A and I paid $5. Mr. Neill had said to me that Motien would pay the boys fare to A. Then a letter came from Mr. Motien\u2014well that was not what I agreed to pay them and told me that affairs were taken in hand to etc. That his sister Freda tried her best for to help Mr. Motien well that was enough. I could see straight why some of Neill fooled me\u2014but then this came for next A. Please do not forget your letters also\u2014capy. Alberni Ind. Feb. 1st 1905 Mr. T.

To Nona\u2014and O.K.\u2014Your Letter came then to me on the 16th of Feb 1905\u2014No. 116.620\u2014and I was pleased and really very thankful to you for going after Miss Hypoerite as you did\u2014and Freda came home all right\u2014And she was treated there in Alberni to help me her Father\u2014Mr. Thompson\u2014& Nona was allowed back to\u2014\none day before Andy came back from Alberton and Mr. Motson met before you. Mr. Motson got that grant in cash from your Dept so that he could start building their Boarding School here. He took little Fiddler with me (gallet) on Mr. Neill's horse and was in the kitchen of former Mr. Russell's dwelling house and this Devil of a liar was there. Mr. Police Man Fred Thomas (Dick Uncle) I asked Mr. Neill why Mr. Motson would not let Hilda and Andy return to me? He got angry and said that Mr. Motson was stubborn and would not do it, then you get concerned at me. What do you mean by frighten the kids and the want sign the school papers, and now the can't start building the boarding school and all is ready for to do it. I told Mr. Neill that I had said nothing to this kid about Mr. Motson how he treated Hilda (etc. etc.) I have written. Hilda was right here in these very house when you now stand! Mr. Neill forgets a time with Mr. Motson & Russell and all the kids know all about it without me saying anything to them about it. Neill replied - Fred Thomas told me if you treat frightend the kids - I turned on those Fred Thomas - said - when did I tell you? you lies - he replied - another kids told me - I got angry and called him a liar & he went up - but I got it then except from that bull; your kid that is the other Blackhead & liar & bully, then good honest friend - Mr. Neill clapped his hand together and he said - turn over\nMr. Thorpeberg I warn you not to interfere in this, I am \nsign this.

I don't expect to last much longer than last night in my own house by Mr. Ross' that other Indians may be able to get more to sleep that I could. When Brother would have left my house back to reserve in to some place he could hear got him there, but I understand there was no attempt as well for to come to it and blame me for making trouble for these school hiding in following unmarked school boys. But I know them all and to do this Mr. Sanderson was not going to be a bigger or more foul minded blockhead than him often when here I and my Boy Jack heard him blockheading all in their schools and then he would get out there without the point. You off Mr. Wells was his friend but my enemy and he hated me and here in the past a year you forgot that I wrote to you about him on the 23rd of April 1903 Mr. Cantrell (signed) and that Mr. Molteni came over here my Boy Angeline Mr. Molteni knew him the man and hid it under his house he told me later on and he could not all but not see it) man fairly why did I refuse to let little go back to Illinois when I signed a school Paper etc. I really did not know anything about it at all Mr. Cantrell just said Oh that's all right if you want to enter them in that school to sign my name through that I knew them signed off complete all rights I myself to my children till the where 18 years old when then the other had wrote my dear lack of prove of it since then by Mr. Miller you find it well as well I must not go on the Reserve and speak or see my daughter Stella but I must not concern with a letter & her they both must not defend it - addressed to him first -\nOn that date Mr. Mather was here in my own house (the old house) came out pushing & pulling his dear Hilda and would not go back with him to Albert & his school. No she would not. I then heard her screaming and cried and I went back running up and across a ugly rocky lot of rock brush etc on the top, it just hides my house and from reserve the con just see the top of my roof at the other end of this ugly rocky steep bluff in several places. I got out of my head, so I commenced yelling and help & what not & climbed up a starting place on this Bluff with the intention for to check this big Brute & Gordon from chasing that girl like a wild beast over these dangerous places, and she was also barefooted at that time. She had run first around the Bluff on the top, then was coming down from the other side towards the rock Brush. Mather was making back tracks for to catch her before she got down to her pond & my small garden patch. I looked myself as well I could on these slope and high rocky place for to check these big brutes but he gave me plenty a push & blew in air and I would have gone to the Butten amongst a lot of large rocks but she hand got a small bit of a burnt stump & some stones. Hilda made a leap over a perpendicular rock and landed in a lot of tall Brush but bounded up again & ran to my garden patch and there she fell face down in a heavy tall Brush. Mather stood over her & pulled her own. Well I won't repeat here again what I wrote to you, but of V had found them my large colt's tail in such feet for a halter on a saddle an horsebag good for Wilcox and even a Bear in the Brush. Well I would have used it on this 2 Brutes & Cowards but I had hidden it back in town. Russell & I on our Evening Walk.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Currie, Esq.,\nPrincipal Alberni Indian Boarding School,\nAlberni, B.C.\nToronto January 5th, 1911.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott;\n\nI wrote you yesterday submitting the name of Miss Grace Cox for the school at Alberni and giving you the substance of testimonials from Mr. Currie, Mr. Neil and Dr. Carruthers. I have received this morning a letter from Mr. Currie in which is the following paragraph:\n\n\"Miss Cox, whom I temporarily engaged is not a qualified teacher. She is rather a clever girl and fairly good in the class room but useless in the Home. Besides her influence with the children is not specially desirable. She has been raised in too close proximity to them and has imbibed very much of their nature. She would make a fair teacher for a day school but not for a Boarding school. I will get along in some way until a new teacher comes.\"\n\nThis is rather embarrassing insomuch as the testimonials were favorable of Mr. Neil and Dr. Carruthers who recommended her appointment. I notice that Mr. Currie's own testimonial is non-committal. It is as follows:\n\n\"This is to certify that Miss Grace Cox has been teaching in this School since 14th November 1910 and appears to be a capable teacher. I have no hesitation in recommending her to any school looking for a good teacher.\"\n\nThat seems to be definite enough and yet I can imagine that he could shield himself under the indefiniteness of not having specially recommended her appointment to their own school. I suppose it would be better, wouldn't it not, to delay confirmation until there is further correspondence? If we could get one in the West it would save the great expense of sending from Ontario. For that reason I was gratified when her name appeared.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6431, File 877-1, part 1)\nToronto January 5th, 1910.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott;\n\nWe are in search of a teacher for the Alberni School. Miss Grace J. Cox was supplying for a season and she now makes application for appointment. She encloses three certificates, one from Mr. Neil, the Indian Agent, who says\u2014\n\"I have much pleasure in recommending her for the position. She has had experience in teaching white children and from what I have seen of her discipline and work during the last few months while filling the position of teacher at the Indian School temporarily, I feel sure she is quite competent for the work. She has the additional qualification of having lived in this neighborhood, understands the temperament, character and disposition of these Indians and the best way of handling them.\"\n\nRev. Mr. Caruthers, of the Alberni Village, writes:\n\"From what I know of her personally and have heard about her work I believe her well fitted for the position. The Indian Agent tells me that he is highly pleased with what he has seen and believes her well fitted for the duties. As to her character, it is of the highest and if an appointment has not already been made I think you can do no better than confirm her in the position.\"\n\nThe Principal of the School, Mr. H.B. Currie writes:\n\"Miss Grace Cox has been teacher in this School since 14th November 1910 and appears to be a capable teacher. I have no hesitation in recommending her to any school looking for a good teacher.\"\n\nThis seems to be satisfactory and if it meets your approval it would be well to accept her application and give her the appointment.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.P.

The boy for whom you are asking admission to the school is not, therefore, an Indian and the Department cannot allow his admission as a grant earning pupil. If conditions were favourable there would be no objection to his being admitted as a non-grant earner, but under existing conditions the dormitories in the Alberni Boarding School are already overcrowded. In the boys' dormitories there is only air space at the most for 15 pupils and the last return shows an enrolment of 22. For these reasons the Department cannot comply with your request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. B. Currie, Esq.,\nPrincipal\nAlberni Boarding School,\nAlberni, B.C.\nAlberni, British Columbia, 18 July 1911\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nHon. Sirs,\n\nYour letter of 11 July No. 116620/1 re Half Breed Children to hand,\nwhile I have no alternative but submit to your ruling\u2014which to my\nmind is an injustice\u2014and I doubt not, in the very near future will\ncause much dissatisfaction among the Indians, and will seriously affect\nour schools on the west coast of B.C.\nTo my mind here is the injustice\u2014a\npure Indian man marries a half breed woman\u2014their child is \u00bc Indian, and the child is eligible\nas a pupil of a Boarding School because its\nfather was an Indian. Now a pure\nIndian woman marries a Half Breed man\ntheir child also is \u00bc Indian but is barred\n(having the same proportion of Indian blood in its veins)\nsimply because the father is half breed.\nTo be fair, as I see it, both children\nshould be admitted or both should be barred.\nAgain, your new regulations are not clear and should be revised. Your regulations are \"half breed children can not be admitted without special authority and then as non grant earners.\" My interpretation of this would be that a child with 50% or more of white blood would be barred while a child with less than 50% of white blood would be classed as \"Indian\" and eligible as a pupil of a Boarding School. If the Department require only \"Pure Indian\" children admitted as grant earners, I think it should be so stated in the regulations.\n\nFor my own personal information, I will be pleased if you will state just what I may accept as \"grant earning pupils.\" Also in view of the points I have drawn your attention to in this letter, will you kindly reconsider my application of the instant? And if you still cannot comply with my application, will you authorize my keeping this boy as a non-grant earner?\n\nThis boy is the brightest I have come in contact with since I came to O.B., and would much like to have him as a pupil.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.B. Currie\nOttawa, July 11, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, and in reply I beg to say that the children of a half-breed father are not eligible for admission to an Indian boarding school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

This I understand.\n\nBut what I desire to know is am I at liberty to accept children as pupils of this school as \"grant Earners\" whose mother is a full Indian and whose father is a half breed? In other words the child is three quarters Indian. An early reply will be obliged.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.B.

Fire broke out in one of the store rooms on the third floor of the school, and was first noticed by one of the Indians on the Reserve, the pupils and staff being at Sunday School, in the dining room, the other side of the building. It was very soon brought under control by the older pupils with the help of the Indians from the Reserve. Mr. Principal Currie informed after, that all the fire-fighting apparatus worked most satisfactorily. As soon as the alarm was given in town (nearly three miles distant) the Volunteer Fire Brigade turned out and I proceeded as quickly as possible by automobile. In looking over the scene of the fire afterward with Mr. Principal Currie, I estimated the damages to be roughly speaking $200, not including clothing for the pupils, which is supplied by the Mission Societies. It is thought that a spark from a nearby chimney dropped into a bundle of clothes, which were on a high shelf, thus causing the fire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas. A.

CURRIE, Principal and Missionary.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Can.\n\nIn reply to your letter of 15 Jan., No. 116620-1, I beg to say that the three pupils referred to in the first clause of your letter, Nos. 038, 666 and 72, were not discharged until the 31 July 1910 (kindly refer to my application for the discharge of these pupils), and if they were pupils of the school I do not see how I am not entitled to holidays for them the same as the rest of the pupils. True they did not return to school after holidays, but my contention is this that I had maintained these pupils in the school eleven months and am now entitled to 1 month holiday grant for them as per the agreement between the church and government.\n\nIn the first place these pupils entered the school on 2 Nov., 11 Nov., and 14 Dec., and by the 1 July of the following year, the school was practically entitled to pay for the holiday period, and each year since the school has practically earned the grant for July because of having maintained these pupils the previous eleven months, the same rules should apply this year, and as I did not apply for the discharge of\nthese pupils until 31 July 1918; And you granted discharge as per application, it necessarily follows the above three were pupils till that date.\n\nIn the case of pupil 674 by Watts, possibly I am not entitled for grant for this pupil for the past holidays. However she was signed in July and was a pupil of the school from that date, but not in attendance for other reason than that the school was not in session, on account of holidays.\n\nBusting the above explanation is satisfactory and that you will see that no deduction is made from the current quarters grant, on their accounts.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.B. Currie\n\nP.S. Will you kindly state just how long a child should be in school before holiday grant is paid or same. Taking it for granted holidays are in July, and a child comes to the school in say April, May, or June or even the middle or toward the end of the month should holiday grant be claimed in July, I do not want anything I am not entitled to. But so\nfor I have failed to see any special guidance in the matter, in the past from the time a pupil was signed into the school until the said pupil was discharged, and holiday period in the interval claim was made for said pupil, regardless of the time said pupil had been in attendance, I know other schools where this rule is followed, but it may be wrong, this is the first time in my six years here my action has been questioned and I would like the matter made clear.\n\nH.B.C.\nOttawa, December 15, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, in which you inform the Department that the Principal of the Alberni Boarding School, when preparing his return of attendance for the September quarter last, applied for the grant, for the summer holidays, for three pupils who had received their discharge and left the school on June 30th.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department paid the grant for the one month's summer holidays for these three pupils, as your letter was not before the clerk at the time when the payment of the quarterly grant was being made. When a pupil is discharged, and leaves the school before the summer holidays, the school is not entitled to be paid the grant for such pupil for summer holidays, and the amount paid for these purposes will be deducted from the current quarter's grant to this school. The Principal should not have included their names on his return for the September quarter.\n\nIn the case of pupil No. 94, Ivy Watts, who did not become a resident pupil until the re-opening of the school after the summer holidays, the school is not entitled to receive any grant for summer holidays.\n\nYou should instruct the principal to give, in future, on his returns the correct dates when pupils either enter or are discharged from the school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nC.

Also George Gus and Gladys Owen were married before leaving school. The Principal has their names on the September Quarter as being present 31 days, whereas they were not in school one hour during the quarter. I mentioned this fact to him and he claims he is entitled to their maintenance grant during the month of holidays and is dating their discharge July 31, in order to get this grant.\n\nThere is also another case, that of Ivy Watts, No. 94. She was signed into the school July 1, but did not actually become a resident pupil until the re-opening of the School, August 1. Mr. Currie, you will notice, also claims maintenance grant for her. While I am perfectly aware of the fact that the grant is allowed during holidays for those pupils who have been in attendance and are returning to the school after the holidays, I do not see any reason for payment of the grant in the above cases and I would like the Department's regulations regarding this matter that I may be guided in future cases.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\n249 Hastings St. East,\nVancouver, B.C.\nJune 6, 1917.\n\nJ.

I have taken up the proposals submitted with the Hon. the Superintendent General, and most careful consideration has been given them.\n\nWhile the offer of the W.M.S. Board in the way of helping to finance the erection of a central boarding school building that would meet the requirements of the church in that district is appreciated, the undertaking is so large I regret that we cannot see our way clear to assume the obligation at the present time. I wish, however, to express my sympathy with the desire of the church to continue their work in those fields, and hope that they will be able to do so.\n\nI am prepared to grant my approval of the\n\nRev. J. H. Edmison, B.A.,\nSecretary of the Board of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nappointment of Mr. Vanderween as teacher of a day school at Ahoushat and will allow a salary of $750.00 per annum. As soon as you are ready to accommodate a field matron at this point too a fair salary for such service will be granted, the understanding being that a graduate nurse will be engaged.\n\nI think it would be well to continue the day school at Ucluelet as formerly. I note that the attendance there has been very satisfactory, and, pending some arrangement to place the children in boarding schools, the day school should be kept in operation.\n\nThe most difficult situation to meet temporarily is that at Alberni. If Mr. Currie can make satisfactory arrangements to keep the children in residence there, the grant will be continued. It is realized of course that the accommodation cannot be up to the standard of the old school.\n\nWe shall grant the holidays as requested by Mr. Currie in a previous letter from the time of the fire till the end of July, by which time Mr. Currie hoped to be able to make temporary provision for the continuance of the school. I have not heard lately from him but I presume he has been able to carry out his plans.\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory\nand hoping to hear from you at an early date, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nThe Presbyterian boarding schools at Ahousaht and Alberni having both been destroyed by fire early this summer, the question of what should be done to provide for continuing the education of the pupils of these schools has been brought to the attention of the Department by the Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church on behalf of the W.M.S., who has submitted the following propositions:\n\n1st. That the boarding school at Ahousaht be not rebuilt, but that the church be used as a day school, in charge of the resident missionary, for whom they will build a residence, with accommodation for a field matron, preferably a graduate nurse, and that the school should be opened in the autumn.\n\n2nd. That at Alberni the government should purchase the portion of the lot on which the buildings stood, containing 16 acres, for $1600.00, or 10 acres for $1000.00. All the buildings connected with the school were not burned; those remaining intact are the barn, woodshed, chicken house, etc., valued at $3,000.00, which would have\nhave to be paid for in addition to the price of the land.\n\nHaving been previously told that funds were not available for the suggested amalgamation of these schools, the W. M. S. offer to loan the Department $20,000.00 with which to erect a new boarding school to accommodate 100 pupils, to be secured by a mortgage for $24,000.00, which includes the loan and the cost of ten acres of land and the buildings. The mortgage to be at 5% and to be repaid at the end of five years. The government is to own and maintain all the buildings and the W. M. S. to retain the stock and implements. The principal of the school is to be responsible for the care of the children for a year, or until the school is rebuilt, and the W. M. S. to provide, without delay, bedding and clothing for the children.\n\nThe current year's estimates provide for the maintenance of 35 pupils at Ahousaht and 50 at Alberni, 85 in all. The returns from these schools show that there was an average attendance at Ahousaht of 29 and 49.75 at Alberni. Both these schools were doing efficient work and it would be a pity to have it interrupted. If these propositions meet with the Department's approval, it would be to the advantage of the Indian children that the proposed amalgamation should be carried out.\nThe following recommendations are also submitted in regard to Ucluelet:\n\n1st. Appoint a missionary to Ucluelet to minister to the white and Indian populations, his territory to extend from Kildonan to Bamfield.\n\n2nd. Provide the missionary with a launch.\n\n3rd. Have the house at Ucluelet serve as a manse for the missionary and use the school for church.\n\n4th. Discontinue day school at Ucluelet. Transfer pupils to Alberni.\n\nIt would take about three times the amount the W.M.S. offer to loan the Department to erect a suitable building to accommodate 100 pupils and, if it is decided to rebuild, it would be well to secure the 16 acres for a school site. The W.M.S. own the adjoining 146 acres which they would retain for agricultural purposes to help maintain the school.\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns, in his report on the Ucluelet Day School, gives the number of children of school age as 24, with an average attendance of 16. If this school were closed, there should be no objection to allowing the Presbyterian Church to use the building for church purposes.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6431, File 877-1, part 1)\nDear Mr Scott,\n\nIn making up my quarterly report for quarter ending 30 June, should I report the pupils going home after the fire on 3 June, as absent on holidays or how? Some went home right after the fire, others stayed on for days, and still others until end of June. I hope to make temporary provision in time to open up school again by August, and so I think it best to consider July as our holiday month. Or would the Department consider authorizing in this case a longer holiday from the time the fire until end of July? So that we might draw full per capita grant for this period. This I know is departing from general regulations, but under the circumstances I trust you may see your way clear to do so. I have looked taking this matter up when I was at Ottawa, I will forward my report as soon as I hear from you. Thanking you for your kindly consideration of this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\nH.B. Currie\nToronto, July 2nd, 1917.\n\nD. C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nFollowing our interview with you June 15th, our Committee had a conference with representatives of the Women's Missionary Society, at which we drew up the enclosed recommendations.\n\nThese have been considered by the W.M.S Board and by the Executive of the Board of Home Missions and Social Service, and have been adopted by both Boards.\n\nYou will note that we propose to sell to the Government the land on which the other buildings are located. We suggest ten acres. This, of course, is the best part of the property. Mr. Currie values this land at $200 per acre.\n\nThe buildings unburned - that is, school, woodshed, barn, chicken house, etc., we value at $3,000. Mr. Currie says they cannot be put up for this figure.\n\nWe do not propose that the Government shall pay cash for either the land or the buildings, but that the $4,000 shall become part of the advance to the Government.\n\nOur W.M.S. have agreed to erect a house near the church at Ahousaht for the use of the missionary and his family, and the Field Matron, whom we expect the Government to appoint.\n\nOur Board proposes sending a good missionary to Ucluelet to care for the whole district. We are planning to secure a launch for him.\n\nIn looking over these recommendations, I am sure you will be convinced that we are anxious to do everything in our power to assist the Government in caring for the Indian children. This $20,000 is all the money that is available at the present time.\nTrusting the recommendations may find the approval of the Department,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ.H.F.-A.V.\nALBERNI\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n1. That the W.M.S. sell to the Government 10 acres of land for $1000.\n\n2. That the W.M.S. sell to the Government the buildings now on this ten acres (school-wood-shed, barn and chicken house) for $3000.\n\n3. That the W.M.S. loan to the Government $20,000, provided the Government is prepared to erect a new boarding school to accommodate 100 pupils.\n\n4. That the Government furnish the W.M.S. with 1st mortgage for $24,000 (the cost of land and buildings and the amount of the loan), the mortgage to bear 5% interest and to be repaid at the end of five years.\n\n5. That the Government own and maintain all the buildings at Alberni.\n\n6.

Phillipps Harrison,\nBarrister and Solicitor, Notary Public, etc., Cumberland,\nB.C., dated January 15, 1918. Original on 116620/10.\n\nI am acting on behalf of George Mitchell, an\nIndian residing on the Comox Reserve at Comox, Vancouver\nIsland, whose son Willy is an inmate of the Alberni Indian\nBoarding School, at Port Alberni, B.C., of which school a\nMr. Currie is the Principal, and I am endeavouring to\nhave investigated a complaint that Mr. Currie administered\nto Willy Mitchell a most brutal beating.\n\nX X X\n\nI do not wish, at this juncture, to trouble you\nabout the matter of the assault hereinafore mentioned, but\nwill await the investigation promised by the local Indian\nAgent, but I have mentioned the complaint only because I am\ninstructed that Mr. Currie informed George Mitchell that he\n(Currie) would not release the boy when he became 18 years\nof age, but would keep him at the school until he felt like\nletting him go, and also that Mr. Robertson asserts in his\nletter, a copy of which is herein enclosed, that Mr. Currie\nwill release the boy on his 18th birthday \"Providing he be-\nhaves himself in the meantime\". It follows therefore that\nI have some fear, that should the question of release rest\nto any extent upon the recommendation of Mr. Currie, he may\nbe inclined to exaggerate or misrepresent facts relating to\nthe behaviour of the boy, so as to prevent his release.\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nEnclosed please find copy of a communication I have just received from the City Clerk of Alberni.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince writing you May 29th, we have conferred with our representatives in British Columbia in regard to the site of the proposed Indian Boarding School on the Pacific coast.\n\nDr. Geo. Wilson, our District Superintendent in British Columbia, writes:\n\n\"Your letter received, regarding removal of Indian School from Alberni to Ucluelet. Now that a boarding school has been built at Ahousaht, this would place the two schools twenty miles apart, which is ridiculous. I certainly would not acquiesce in the removal from Alberni. It would be interesting to know the names of the petitioners. I think when these names are revealed, you will find them belonging to a class that has never helped the Indian.\"\n\nDr. Wilson states that if he were having an objection to Alberni at all, it would not be on the ground that the Indians contaminated the whites, but that the whites contaminated the Indians.\n\nDr. Clay, of Victoria, our Home Mission Convener for British Columbia, replied by wire and advised \"proceeding at Alberni.\" In a letter I have from him since, he says:\n\n\"All the local ministers strongly support the stand taken in my wire to you.\"\n\nI am enclosing copy of a letter from Mr. Currie, Principal of the Alberni School. In the first place, you will see that the city council, at the last meeting, decided to provide us with water and electric power at reasonable rates. This, I think, represents the attitude of the city council. They would not be willing to cheerfully grant these concessions if they were opposed to the erection of the building.\nIn the autumn of 1918, you sent us copy of a letter written you by A. J. Beck, City Clerk, and dated October 30th, 1918. At that time, the town of Alberni pleaded strongly for the erection of a new building. I judge the town is still anxious to have the school at Alberni.\n\nIn regard to the site, I think Mr. Currie has advanced many good reasons for retaining the school at Alberni. While it might make little difference to the Government where the school is built, it will make a very great difference to the Church, as we have to maintain the work afterwards. With our farm, stock, garden, fruit, etc., we can maintain the work at Alberni at a much less expense than we could at a point like Ucluelet.\n\nThe General Board of the Women's Missionary Society are unanimous in urging that the building be erected at Alberni.\n\nI brought the matter before our Board a few days ago, at our meeting in Hamilton, and they instructed me to notify the Department that we want the building at Alberni. It seems to us that there are some interested parties behind the petition that was sent to you. I am sure the Indian Department will not be a party to sending the Indians back into the wilderness, either to advance the interests or satisfy the whim of anyone.\n\nHow would it be to have a representative of the Department sent to look over the ground? From what I can learn from private sources, I do not think that the matter should be decided by your Indian Agent. It is possible that his is the only opposition.\n\nI am enclosing also copy of a letter that has been sent us by Mr. Neill, who states that he was Indian Agent in the district for ten years; also letter from H. A. Bain, representing the session of Alberni Presbyterian Church.\n\nYou will note from all these communications that our representatives on the coast are rather eager to know the names of the parties who have been objecting.\n\nShould the Department decide to build at Alberni, as I firmly believe it will, what about the site? I understand that the Government, at the present time, has no property at that point and that it is a rule of the Department not to build on land not owned by the Government. Two years ago our Board made the following suggestions to the Department:-\n1. That the W.M.S. sell to the Government 10 acres of land for $1,000.\n\nII. That the W.M.S. sell to the Government the buildings now on this ten acres (school, wood-shed, barn and chicken house) for $3,000.\n\nIII. That the Government own and maintain all the buildings at Alberni.\n\nIV. (a) That the W.M.S. retain 146 acres, with which to help maintain the school and from which to secure fuel.\n(b) That the W.M.S. retain wagons, buggies, implements and stock.\n\nAt a later date, July 12th, 1917, we suggested that you might purchase 16 acres rather than 10, at a cost of $1600. Our church paid $2000 for the 16 acre block.\n\nWould either of these suggestions made by the Board find the approval of the Department now?\n\nTrusting we may have your decision soon,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/CMcG.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Edmison,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Edmison:\n\nYour letters of May 22nd and 29th, to hand and contents noted. In reply to the enquiry re water and electric light, I approached the city council at the last meeting and am pleased to report that they are very pleased to meet the wants of our new school as to both light and water at reasonable rates.\n\nAs to the letter of the 23rd, re the protest re rebuilding at Alberni, I can only say it will be a calamity if the Department allows itself to be swayed to building at Ucluelet instead. As to the statements in that letter, they are untrue:\n\n1. As to the statement there are very few Indians at Alberni. There are more Indians at Alberni than in any other tribe on the Barclay Sound. This is a statement I can give figures to prove if necessary.\n\n2. As to the statement that the town people desire the Indian Reserves at Alberni opened up for settlement - There is no desire on the town people's part for such. There may be individuals who might hope to profit by such a move. But the town has more area than there is any demand for. At the present moment, there are over 3000 parcels of land up for sale on account of delinquent taxes.\n\nAt the next meeting of the city council, I will approach the council, and I am sure they will send you a letter approving the rebuilding on the present site, which is not within the corporation, but about two miles from its centre.\n\nThe following facts, if considered, will amply justify the Department in rebuilding at Alberni. The present high cost of living necessitates large quantities of food to be produced by the school to supplement the maintenance grant. This is being done at Alberni and will gradually improve - whereas at Ucluelet there is no suitable area procurable. Here we grow vegetables, have a large stock which furnishes us with milk, butter, beef, pork, eggs, and have a good supply of apples, pears, plums, raspberries, strawberries, gooseberries, currants. It would take simply years and a mint of money to duplicate at Ucluelet. The farm aspect alone should decide the Department.\n\nThe transportation at Ucluelet will always be an adverse consideration. There are only three boats\na month from Ucluelet to Victoria. We have the same boat service plus the train service at Alberni. The up-keep of a good sized launch would have to be provided for at Ucluelet.\n\nThere is no doctor or hospital nearer than 55 miles from Ucluelet, while at Alberni they are always available night or day. This fact often means the sacrifice of life at the present time at Ucluelet.\n\nThe fuel proposition is also an important one. On our Alberni property there is an unlimited supply which will supply the school's needs for all time. At Ucluelet, coal would have to be bought as the timber there is practically all hemlock and cedar.\n\nOur farm at Alberni is well stocked. We have a team of horses, a motor car, 16 head of stock, three of which are registered dairy shorthorns, 14 hogs, 150 chickens, with wagon, democrat, buggy, two ploughs, two harrows, mower, hay-rake, seeders, and all necessary farm tools including a stump puller; telephone with city water and electric light available.\n\nTo my mind Alberni is an ideal location. Even the drainage is all one would desire. I believe it will be a serious mistake to even think of changing the location of our school.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) H. B. Currie.\nDear Sir:\n\nRegarding a protest supposed to have come from Alberni against the location of the Indian School here, I may say I never heard of any such objection amongst the population of this neighbourhood; most people are pleased to hear of the erection of such a fine building.\n\nI have lived here twenty years and been Mayor and Alderman and am in a position to know the feeling of the people.\n\nI was Indian Agent in this district for ten years and can certify that this is the proper location for a school for the Indian children and of Alberni Canal and Barclay Sound.\n\nI would be interested to know who in this neighbourhood objects to the school being here, and on what grounds.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) A. W. Neill.\n\nH. B. Currie, Esq.,\nAlberni, B.C.\nCOPY.\n\nAlberni, B.C.,\nJune 7th, 1919.\n\nDear Dr. Clay:\n\nMr. Currie came in to see me this morning re the matter of the location of the Indian School.\n\nI am surprised that there has been such action taken by anyone in this community. I may say such a protest is unwarranted and does not represent the opinion in any way of the community here.\n\nThe Session of Alberni Presbyterian Church not long since heartily endorsed the proposed rebuilding of the school at Alberni as being the proper place to rebuild such school.\n\nWithout doubt, whoever sent such a protest has done so for personal reasons and not because of a real interest in the welfare of the Indians. I can make a guess as to the person and might even judge as to his motive, and it is not the best welfare of the Indians. He has no interest in the church.\n\nI trust you will do your best to convince the proper authorities that the protest carries no community weight with it and that it is right and proper to rebuild at Alberni.\n\nWith best wishes, I am\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Signed) H.

It is asserted that the proximity of the Indian reserves is detrimental to the town, and that the presence of the school will attract the Indians to the reserve in the vicinity of Alberni, thus tending to perpetuate the Indian holdings which the town people hope will soon be opened up for settlement.

Clements, Esq., M.P.\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Mr. Clements,\n\nAn informal deputation of citizens has asked me to draw your attention to the proposed rebuilding of the Indian Industrial School. The citizens represented object strongly to the location of the school at Alberni, where there are very few Indians, and think it should be built at Ucluelet, or some suitable place on the Coast where the native population is so much more numerous than here.\n\nThey assert the school will attract Indian families here which would otherwise continue to be absent from their Alberni reserves, and which they hope someday will be opened for settlement, and this would be delayed by the return of the tribe.\n\nThe proximity of the Indian Reserves is considered by them to be detrimental to the town. Therefore they request you to enquire if the Department has definitely decided upon locating the school at Alberni; and if not they will be glad of an opportunity to state their case to you in a more definite manner.\n\nI suggested a petition, but Mr. Prescott, the City Clerk, thought this would take too long a time, that it would be better to consult you first. I think I have correctly expressed their views.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6431, File 877-1, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nRe. Alberni Boarding School.\n\nThe Alberni Boarding School building was totally destroyed by fire on the 2nd of June, 1917. Nearly all of the contents of the building were saved and the following outbuildings were uninjured, woodshed, barn, chicken house, etc. In the previous month the Ahousaht Boarding School was burnt down. Both these schools were owned by the Presbyterian Church and built on their land.\n\nIn July, 1917, the Rev. Mr. Edmison, Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church, submitted a proposition for the rebuilding of the Alberni Boarding School. He suggested that the Government should put up a building large enough to accommodate one hundred pupils and that they should buy the site on which the old school was built containing sixteen acres at $100.00 an acre and also that the Government should pay $3,000 for the outbuildings.\n\nThe Women's Missionary Society offered to loan the Government $20,000.00 towards the erection of the building, in case funds were not available.\n\nIn the meantime they proposed to put up temporary buildings and carry on the school.\n\nThe Department was not prepared to accept this offer, nor undertake the rebuilding them.\n\nWhen they asked for a building for 100 pupils at Alberni, it was their intention to abandon the boarding school at Ahousaht and conduct a day school there. After giving the day school a trial it was found that it was not a success.\nsuccess and the Board of Home Missions decided to rebuild the boarding school at this point. This building was under construction when Mr. Inspector Cairns visited Ahousaht in July of this year and he stated that it would be ready for occupation shortly.\n\nWith the erection of the Ahousaht Boarding School it would not be necessary to provide for the original number contemplated at Alberni and a building to accommodate about fifty or sixty pupils and staff should meet the requirements there.\n\nIf boarders are to be taken at Alberni a new building is urgently needed, as the temporary buildings now in use are said to have totally insufficient accommodation and to be practically devoid of sanitary arrangements. The City Clerk of Alberni forwarded a resolution from the City Council, dated October 29th of this year, in which they gave it as their opinion that grave risk to the whole community in the district is at all time being taken in allowing the present makeshift arrangement to exist.\n\nIf the Department is disposed to rebuild provision will have to be made in the Estimates for the purchase of the site and outbuildings and for a suitable building to accommodate sixty pupils and staff and, as the cost of material and labour is so high at present, $60,000.00 or $70,000.00 would be required.\n\nThe Indians of the West Coast Agency earn their livelihood chiefly by fishing and sealing off shore, and also by working about the canneries. Many migrate annually to the United States to assist with the hop-picking and others go to the Chilliwack District on the mainland for the same employment. The reserves in this agency are small and scattered and, as their families accompany the Indians on these migrations, day schools in this locality are impracticable.\n\nThere are about one hundred Indian children of school age in this agency who are recognized as Presbyterians and a boarding school at Alberni and one at Ahousaht would furnish educational facilities for about all the children of that faith.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This increase in pupilage is made in view of the completion of the new building and in order that the school can recruit up to the full number for which accommodation is provided. The Presbyterian Church authorities have been informed of the increased pupilage granted.\n\nThe Principal should make every effort to secure a sufficient number of new children to bring his enrollment up to the number provided for, and I have to request that you will cooperate with him with that end in view. It is considered that there is a sufficient number of Protestant children on the Reserves in the vicinity from which to obtain the required number. You should give the Principal every assistance you can in his efforts to recruit these new children. Only those who are of school age and in good health should be accepted. Completed forms of application and certificates of health should be promptly forwarded for all new children taken into the school.\n\nThe Department will expect to hear at a later date that the Principal and yourself have been successful in obtaining the required number of new pupils.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the Principal of the increased grant in the pupilage, and the desire of the Department to have this number in residence as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Classrooms, dormitory, lighting system (power from city) and disinfecting room were especially fine.\n\nThe farm is large, of fair quality, but needs clearing. Rev. Mr. Currie has considerable stock, and runs a butchering business in the interests of the school. Inspector Ditchburn and Agent Cox think he pays more attention to this business than he does to the school. Mr. Currie is a hard worker, of unprepossessing appearance, is petulant and quick tempered. Mrs. Currie is a splendid type. My personal opinion of the Principal is that he is hardly big enough for his job. He has certain charges against Mr. Agent Cox and Mr. Constable Bartlett and claims they have been no real help to the school in connection with recruiting and truancy. Mr. Agent Cox has no great sympathy for the Indian people.\n\nPrincipal Currie requests 600 feet of 6\" vitrified tile to drain from a level below the septic tank. The septic tank functions successfully. The Principal will do the work.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nAppropriation for Indian Education for the Fiscal Year 1922-23 provides for a pupilage of 80 only at the Alberni Boarding School. This is a reduction of 20 pupils from the number provided in the appropriation for the Fiscal Year 1921-22.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Date]\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that on the 24th ultimo I went to Alberni to look into complaints made through Andrew Paul that grave irregularities had taken place at the Alberni Indian Boarding School, under the management of Principal Currie. A copy of Mr. Paul's letter is hereto attached which, you will observe, is dated the 31st of August. On the date of its receipt I also received a letter from Mr. Indians, Mr. Cox stating that Andrew Paul and Chief Dan White, of the Opitocheshat Band, had called on him with a like complaint. The Agent's letter, however, was only one of about six lines and threw no light on the situation by way of explanation. I therefore wrote to him and asked him to give me any information he had on the subject and on the 9th of September he wrote more fully but attached to his letter was a report from Principal Currie on the matter which, upon perusal, went to show that the alleged irregularities dated back to 1816 but there did not at first appear to me to be sufficient in the complaint to attach much blame or responsibility on the Principal. A copy of Mr. Currie's letter is also hereto attached.\n\nI took the matter up with Rev. Leslie Clay, head of the Presbyterian Church in British Columbia, and also the Rev. Dr. G. A. Wilson, in charge of the Presbyterian Missions, and it was thought better that we should all go to Alberni to look fully into the complaint and to see if anything could be done to prevent like occurrences taking place in the future. It was not until I was at the School that Principal Currie informed me that the event of the 12th June last was the fourth time that these boys had got into the girls' dormitory on four successive nights. In his letter of the 9th September you will observe he only mentions the one instance.\n\nI therefore feel, as also do Dr. Clay and Dr. Wilson, that some additional safeguards must be made at that school for the future both in the matter of dormitory oversight and closing of possible exist, for it is certainly difficult to understand how these boys could break out of one side of the school and enter the other without being detected until the fourth occasion.\n\nAdjoining each dormitory is a bedroom occupied by some member of the staff and in this bedroom is a small window for oversight of the dormitory. These, however, have been kept closed and curtained and no doubt both the boys and girls have taken advantage of this fact. The member of the staff who\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6431, File 877-1, part 2)\nsleeps next to the girls' dormitory is the laundress but she is not the one who detected the irregularity but it was one of the teachers who sleeps at the back of the building who heard some disturbance in the girls' dormitory and went in and caught the boys in bed with the girls.\n\nI think you will agree with me that the boys took a desperate chance with their lives in getting out of their side of the building and entering that of the girls from the front. This, however, I think can be prevented for the future as I instructed Principal Currie to fasten the lower sashes of all these windows in the front in such a manner that they cannot be opened, ventilation being obtained by lowering the top sash. I instructed him also to place on top of the projection over the lower windows boards about two inches in width running to the side of the building at an angle. If this is done no foot-hold could be obtained. I also ordered him to have the windows between the staff bedrooms and the dormitories kept partially open each night, and this he has agreed to do.\n\nYou will observe, however, that on a previous occasion the boys got out the dormitory at the back of the building and entered that of the small girls but were caught red-handed. This is quite easily done, for the boys merely have to leave their dormitory through the back verandah, climb over a three-foot railing and walk over the roof of the laundry to reach the verandah adjoining the girls' dormitory, and I feel that the only thing that can be done on this side of the building would be to cover both verandahs over with a heavy No. 3 wire sand-screen, the cost of which would be approximately $65.00 as it will take about 57 yards of this wire and the price is $1.10 per yard.\n\nWith regard to the additional supervision necessary I think that Mr. Currie requires some male assistant in the building who would have more supervision of the boys while in their dormitories and also outside the building than Mr. Currie is, quite apparently, able to give owing to the great amount of work he does in other directions for the benefit of the school. Revs. Drs. Clark and Wilson hold the same opinion as I do in this regard. Both these gentlemen will make reports to the Presbyterian Mission Board and I feel that if you take the question up with them they will realize the importance of giving Principal Currie the desired male assistance.\n\nIf you authorize me I will have the heavy wire purchased and sent to Principal Currie and instruct him to have the same put up in a substantial manner.\n\nYours, sincerely,\n\nW.E. Ditchburn,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir:\n\nAt a meeting of the Indians of the four tribes in this vicinity by a standing vote of those present, I was instructed to respectfully pray the Government in their behalf for the immediate removal of Mr. Curry as principal of the Alberni Industrial School.\n\nAfter hearing the evidence and cross-examining ex-pupils, the chiefs, and leading men, I am convinced that it is in the interest of Christianity, morality and good characters of the Indians in general, that Mr. Curry be immediately removed.\n\nThe outstanding complaint which in itself alone is sufficient cause for his immediate removal, is that several girls during Mr. Curry's supervision of the said school, have become mothers originating from having sexual intercourse while attending said school.\n\nThe consequence is that illegitimate children are brought forth into this world, with its subsequent accompanying ill results, and disgrace brought on the parents who rely on the Government to prevent anything of the kind.\n\nThe facts are that when the condition of the girl becomes noticeable, she is discharged from the school, and her parents suffer the consequences. In some cases the boy has married the girl.\n\nThe Indians bring forth the argument that a school is no institution for the purpose of increasing the population.\n\nMr. Curry, from reliable information, conducts a stock raising business and he sells same every week to the public, and I venture to say that it is quite probable that there is misdemeanor among the pupils while he is busy engaged in the care of his stock and fowl.\n\nAnother reason for such occurrences, is that the children are compelled to remain in school until they reach the age of 18 years. If they were let out at the age of 15 or 16 years, such events would be perhaps less rampant.\n\nIt is further reported that Mr. Curry unmercifully whips the boys on their backs, which is objected to as well as Mr. Curry fighting and kicking the boys for the purpose of correction. It is further reported that Mr. Curry gets extremely mad at the slightest provocation, and whips or hits the boys with his fists, or chokes them.\n\nThe Indians say they have complained to Indian Agent Cox, and to Mr. Curry, with no result, and they will not rest in asking the Department for his removal until he is no longer connected with the school. The Indians if necessary will make complaints against Mr. Curry by oath.\n\nI think it is my duty as a citizen of Canada and good Government, to report the above to you, that you may take steps deserving of the case.\n\nI respectfully submit the recommendation that Mr. Curry be discharged forthwith.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nAndrew Paull,\nNorth Vancouver, B. C., Corresponding Secretary, Allied Tribes of B. C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6431, File 877-1, part 2)\nCOPY.\n\nINDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL,\nof the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\nH. B. Currie, Principal and Missionary.\n\nAlberni, B. C., Sept. 9, 1922.\n\nMr. C. A. Cox,\nIndian Agent,\nAlberni, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your inquiry re trouble in this school, resulting from boy pupils attempting to, or having intercourse with girl pupils of this school, I may say that in the summer of 1920, Margaret Jackson, a girl of about 15 years, a girl who had passed her High School Entrance Examination, had intercourse with a pupil, Alfred Fred, and got in the family way. Also Annie Gallic, a girl of about 14, got in the family way at the same time by meeting Alfred Rasalma, a boy pupil who had also passed his High School Entrance Examination. As you are aware this matter was looked into at the time by yourself, reported to the Department at Ottawa, and four pupils were discharged. At that time it was shown that every reasonable precaution was taken by the Staff of this school. These are the only two girls who have ever gotten into trouble, in the family way, in this school, since I came here twelve and a half years ago. There was another girl, Beasie Shewish that was discharged in June 1916 for being pregnant, but she acknowledged that she got that way while at her home on the reserve. We never knew her to have anything to do with a boy while she was in the school.\n\nSince we moved into the present new school in December 1920, two attempts by boy pupils have been made to get into the girl's dormitory. In March 1921, Norman James (Hugh) and Stevens Jackson broke an inch and a half wood ventilator railing bar loose and got on the laundry roof, crossed to the balcony roof at the rear of the building, but they were heard, and when they were hit to look about, they returned to their dormitory. For this I gave them a severe strapping, with their pants off, they then promised me they would never do so again. Stevens Jackson has been a splendid boy since, and I believe he is really trying to do right, but Norman James (Hugh) has given me constant trouble. On the 12 June, 1922, he and Edward Tatocotch again made the attempt and were caught right in the girls' dormitory about two o'clock in the morning. Norman had been in bed with Cecilis Dennis and Edward with Emma Fred. Neither of the girls are in the family way. As you will remember I phoned you at the time, and you came up to look into the matter, and when I showed you and Policeman Wood the method they used to gain entrance to the girls' room, it was hard for either of you to conceive that it was possible for one to travel such a course, for they had to break one and a half inch boards bars to get into the little boys' dormitory, then to climb in out of the screen window, travel about thirty feet on the outside front wall, about 25 feet from the ground; hang onto wire sills, then again bearing wire from screen windows getting into the girl's wash room, and again break like and half wooden bars to gain entrance to the girl's dormitory. It is for such behaviour that they wish to hold me responsible.\n\nI contend every precaution was taken, but if there is fault anywhere it is in the construction of the building. I do say it is my firm belief that since the first day in this school, I have taken greater precaution to prevent such deplorable things happening, than either Government or Church Officials can reasonably expect.\n\nIndian Affairs.

No staff can be on duty 24 hours a day, and the dormitories are made reasonably safe, and when the pupils are put in there at night and locked in it is expected they will remain there till morning, and that the staff should have the interval for rest; but in the very fact that in both attempts above noted it will be seen that the staff detected the wrong doing at the time, shows that we sleep with our eyes open; in other words there is a constant strain and worry to avoid the very things complained of.\n\nThe one man that lodged the complaint at the Indians meeting was James Rush, father of Norman James, and I am perfectly satisfied, in spite of what is contained in Mr. Andrew Paul's letter, that the vast majority of the Indians have every confidence in me. Some have since told me that a great many of them wish me to continue on, and that since of last of July, 1891, I have recruited 35 new pupils for the school, does not look as though they were afraid to trust their children to my care.\n\nIn spite of the charges of severity, I am prepared to say that I am patient, kind and lenient with every child who shows any attempt at obedience to the rules, but certain offenses must be dealt with firmly, yes surely. But I do as little of that as possible. So let the staff often think I am too lenient, but anyone that knows Indian customs, is aware that it is rarely a parent ever punished a child. In my twelve years I have never known a single case in which he punished the child, and the result is that when the teacher does it they magnify the thing to appear that the child was being murdered. I am satisfied any principal that has had experience will bear me out on this point. I faithfully tried to do my duty, for the best interest of the pupils, and stand with an open mind to learn and adopt any improved methods to advance the work.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) H. F.

Mr. Currie will probably be paid in full without delay and will be given permission to retire at a time convenient to himself.\n\nBy further resolution of the united Boards, it was agreed to appoint Rev.

I have been giving careful consideration to the whole question of the present classifications of Indian residential schools and I believe the time has come when we will have to make new schedules, which will take effect April first, 1926. Your request will not be overlooked during our deliberations. It might be well for you to put your request before Dr. Edmison, as the Department will confer with him at some length in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. H. B. Currie,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nAlberni, B. C.\nDr. Scott,\n\nI am writing you to make application for the transfer of the Alberni Boarding School into the Alberni Industrial School. I am taking this action on the ground that we are actually an Industrial School in everything but name and grant. And I herewith apply that the change take place with the beginning of the fiscal year (1 April 1925). At a recent meeting of the Presbytery of Victoria, this matter came up for discussion and I was instructed to take the matter up with you.\n\nYour Department has provided good buildings for our School and I can assure you we are making the very best use of same. We specialize in farming and Stockraising also dairying. These all work in well as a part of the training and maintenance of the school. At present the new barn you erected for us is full of choice stock. We have 33 head of stock, Dairy Shorthorns, and 3 work horses. 9 of the above are for beef and will be killed for school use as needed at intervals of about ten days or two weeks according to size. We are constantly improving our herd, weeding out the inferior, replacing them with Registered Shorthorns of Record of Performance quality. At present I have on order a young bull out of a cow that produced over 9000 lbs. of milk last year testing 4.4 Butter fat. Also I am getting a young heifer from the same party, out of a cow that gave 10086 lbs milk in 365 days. This also gives us abundant milk which is I believe one of the very first considerations where a lot of growing children are being cared for. I have an excellent farmer and he takes much care in instructing the boys. They are receiving a practical training that many of them will make their living by. More and more as the fishing industry is being exploited, the Indian is turning to other occupations the principal of which is land clearing and farming. I have made provision to have our local shoemaker come to the school certain days each week to give instruction to the boys. This new training will begin as soon as the leather supplies and necessary equipment arrive. As soon as I have your assurance that you will sanction our school being classified as an Industrial School I will look about for a permanent man that can instruct in both shoe repairing and Carpentry the latter trade would be very useful to our Indians.\n\nI notice that the schools in our immediate vicinity are mostly Industrial schools. First the Christie School on the West Coast has always been, at least for many years, an Industrial School now this school has never done the Industrial work carried on in the Alberni School. I maintain that our School has a 50% stronger claim to being classed as an Industrial School than the Christie School. Next I notice that the Kuper Island and Sechelt Schools are now both classed as Industrial Schools. The latter apparently...\nALBERNI, B.C.,\n\nhaving reached that status in 1926, I only noticed the change recently. Both these schools are in identical class with our own. The three being comparatively new schools erected by the Government. Having the same enrollment practically and carrying on identical work. As the matter stands I find myself handicapped in keeping my school up to my desired standard. The new buildings require other surroundings to be in keeping. There is a great deal of fixing up and improvement to grounds, buildings and fences as well as land clearing and a general toning up to bring the surroundings up to what I want them to be and what I think they should be. As it is I can carry on only in a limited way. Whereas were I receiving the same grant as the other schools, namely $170.00 for each child instead of $140.00 it would make a difference to me of about $250.00 per year then I would be in a position to carry on somewhat as I believe I would like to. While a great deal more might be said, yet I have every confidence you will see the need in which I stand and the fairness of my contention that being on a par with the above schools I should be classified as they and receive the same Maintenance Grant, from the first April next. Trusting I may have your favorable consideration and reply, in due course.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.B.

At the same time while Mr Crawford is in his 72nd year he is well preserved and capable of doing very good work in the Class Room. Naturally he is not as active and alert as a young man.

There appears to be a lack of control, which is quite apparent after the manner in which the classes were conducted by the previous teacher. We understand that Mr. Crawford is 72 years of age and it is thought that a younger man is needed to obtain satisfactory results.\n\nI should be pleased to hear from you regarding the continuing of the services of Mr. Crawford and whether it is intended in the near future to make other arrangements to secure a competent teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

FROST, INDIAN AGENT, ON THE ALBERNI\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL FOR THE MONTH OF\nJANUARY, 1925.\n\nMr. Baillie resigned his appointment as\nteacher at the end of December, 1924.\n\nIt is early to judge the abilities of the new\nteacher, Mr. John Crawford, but there appeared a lack\nof grip on the classes, at once apparent after the\nprevious teacher. I am afraid this is due to Mr.\nCrawford's age, 72 years. In my opinion a younger\nman is needed to obtain satisfactory results.\n\nNOTE: Mr. Crawford is the Senior Teacher.\nThe Agent, who last visited the school\non the 27th of January, stated that\nthere is no improvement shown in the\nwork of Mr. Crawford.\nOttawa, Sept. 30, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, furnishing an estimate of the cost of repairing the ceilings which were damaged by fire at the Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say it is considered that the stains made by the water can be covered by a coat of paint and, when this has dried, they could be calcimined the same tint as the balance of the ceilings.

Re damage from Fire and water at the Alberni Residential School on August 20th 1924, I have the honour to report that on Septr 12th I went carefully over the parts of the building in which damage had been done, and found that (in my opinion) the material used in the ceilings had not been injured other than by stains and that could the stains be obliterated, the material would be quite servicable for many years, having this in view I secured the opinion of Mr T Costen an expert Painter and Decorater on the matter, and Mr Costen assured me that the stain could be covered so that they would be quite undetectable, by first painting over the stained portions and then Calsonining them the same tint as the balance of the ceilings, but to remove the discoloured portions of the ceilings and replace by new material would cost in the vicinity of $100 dollars, and the new material would need Calsonining to conform to the colour scheme.

An alarm was turned in to the Alberni City Fire Hall, but the fire was checked when the apparatus arrived on the scene at 1 pm. The amount of damage done by fire and water will not exceed $150.\n\nFrom observation of the seat of the fire, and after careful consideration and examination of all conditions connected therewith I am of the opinion that the fire was of incendiary origin. Governed by that opinion, an enquiry was held immediately after the fire was over, to place if possible, the responsibility for the same.\n\nThe persons composing the enquiry were Mr. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools, Mr. H. Halpenny, detailed by Govt Agent Freeze, on behalf of the Provincial Government, Mr. H.B.

Service Inc.)\u2014The mission school for Indians. That is to say, all children from the ages of 7 to 18 must attend the government mission schools. Those schools are conducted by the government in conjunction with the Presbyterian church. The government provides one hundred dollars per child per year, the church furnishes the educators, the local Indians supply the children employ.\n\nNear Alberton, old town, there is one of these missions. It stands on a high hill overlooking the valley and the sea. Around the village of Sheshiah the Indian tribe is located. The village is chiefly of log huts in which no white man would ever dare to live. Some hundreds Indians reside, except while off on hunting and fishing expeditions.\n\nThe mission is maintained by the H. B. Curries, charmed by the beauty of the Indian service a great number of years. They have white women nurses and two nurses. More than ninety children were cared for this year. The mission itself is very well constructed and as comfortable as any private residence in the city. It is divided into two parts\u2014one for the boys and one for the girls. Everything that is taught in public schools is taught here, including cooking, sewing, painting, dairying, wood-carving, lumbering, etc. The finished products from these schools is said to be exceptionally fine.\n\nCanadians are encouraged to marry into the white or yellow races. All Indians who are engaged in business are declared illegitimate and the Indians involved suffers from his fellows. Yet, all Indians are encouraged to marry, and they graduate from school.\n\nThe Indian race up here, as in other parts of the country is diminishing fast. It is said that within twenty-five years will not be more than a thousand or so on the entire Vancouver Island. The Queen Charlotte islands, some miles north of here, contains 90,000 Indians. Twenty years ago, today there are barely 5000 there.\n\nMany of the Indians here are very fine. Some are said to be more than 100 and one would not doubt it, were we to see them by chance while driving through the woods. Most of the older Indians are almost blind and are totally deaf.\n\nAt one of the Sprout lakes, on the side of a high rock, there are all sorts of Indian carvings. These represent many things, including a monstrous fish. For many years, so the legends say, Indians came and appeared only once in a while taking back below the water with him his toll of Indians who had not behaved themselves. There is an inevitable carving of the hero who slew the fish and was made chief of the tribe.\n\nCornelius Vanderbilt, Jr.\nEditor and Publisher.\n\nVOICE OF THE PEOPLE\n\nLetters will be published each day under this heading.

I will discuss this matter with the W.M.S. in the very near future.\n\nI may say that our representatives at the coast are recommending some assistance for Mr. Currie.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/JDF.\nThe junior classroom is crowded, there being about sixty pupils. Mr. Pitts recommends that a third teacher be engaged. This class to meet on the ground floor of the old classroom, which would accommodate about fifty pupils.\n\nHowever, it must be kept in mind that the half-day system should be used. Indian pupils will not do good work and maintain their health and strength if they are kept indoors too much. I would therefore recommend that the half-day system should be inaugurated. The first consideration in connection with the education of the Indian pupils is the matter of health.\n\nIf these pupils are kept in the classroom five or six hours per day, it is probable that the death rate will be increased. It will be noticed that four deaths were reported last year, and in November 1927 there were two cases of pneumonia requiring the attention of a trained nurse.\n\nI would therefore urge that there be given careful attention to the health of the pupils.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. E. E. FROST, INDIAN AGENT, PORT ALBERNI, FOR THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER ON THE ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThe pupils have returned after summer holidays, (on 15th) some have failed to return from sick leave.\n\nThere are 14 new pupils recruited during the month, and the Grade 1 classroom is now full. There are too many pupils in this room to be handled with any degree of efficiency by one teacher (about 40) 14 of whom do not understand or speak English. An additional teacher is needed for proper efficiency in this room.\n\nMiss Hazel C.

Principal and staff at the Alberni Indian Residential School as on June 30th next. The Department approves of your proposal to place the Rev. F. E.

D.,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nNovember 21, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Neill:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the scale of per capita grants at Indian residential schools in your constituency. At the present time the rates are as follows:\n\n- Alberni - $160 for 90 pupils,\n- Ahousaht - $165 for 40 pupils,\n- Christie - $175 for 80 pupils.\n\nAhousaht receives a larger grant than Alberni, because the building is church-owned and the transportation costs are higher. Christie receives a higher rate for the same reasons, and further, because it has been classed as an industrial school.\n\nI may say that, in the past few years, there have been adjustments in the amount of grant paid to Indian residential schools. It was felt that the old classification was no longer fair to the smaller schools, particularly those situated distant from markets. These adjustments have resulted in the $20 increase for Alberni, $25 for Ahousaht and $5 for Christie.\n\nI believe it advisable to answer the last paragraph of your letter by a short resume of the rules governing the payment of per capita grant to Indian residential schools. Our Estimates and the Appropriation provide a per capita grant for a certain pupilage at each school. If the average attendance for any school is greater than the pupilage allowed because the school authorities have recruited to overstrength, the extra pupils are carried by the management without grant, until such time as the Department secures an increased appropriation. If extra pupils are present because the Department has requested the school to admit urgent cases, then super-numerary grant is allowed and payment is made on the basis of the actual average attendance. However, in no case do we allow or ask a school to admit more pupils than can be safely accommodated. The air space in dormitories and classrooms determines the limit of safety. The addition of compulsory attendance clauses in the Indian Act did not in any way affect the rules governing payments of grants. While the Department cannot adjust attendance, we are guided by the amount of accommodation available.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6431, File 877-1, part 2)\nJanuary 2, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Neill:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th ultimo, with reference to the pupilage at the Alberni Indian Residential School. I am pleased to inform you that I have made arrangements for a grant for 110 pupils as from April 1st, next. I should be glad if you would inform the Rev. Mr. Pitts.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nA. W. Neill, Esq., M.P.,\nAlberni,\nB. C.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nAlberni, B. C.,\nDec. 13th, 1928.\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nM.P.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI have your letter of the 21st ult., re grant of Indian Schools. The Alberni school has somewhere about 106 pupils now enrolled, although the grant is only for 90. It is true that I think two of them are under school age, but they were put in with the knowledge and approval of the Indian Agent, because it was a case of destitute orphans, with no one to take care of them. The reason that this school has more pupils than the grant calls for is no doubt the result of the efforts put forward by the school official, whom you authorized to be placed in this agency a couple or three months ago. I suppose the principal should have refused admission as soon as his quota was reached, but that would have meant confusion for your Department, which had employed a man to see that these children came to school.\n\nIt may be that in no one case did your Department in writing specifically ask that this extra child should be admitted to the school, but the principle is the same.\nYour Department sent the children or caused them to be sent and the school took them in.\n\nI submit that under these circumstances you ought to allow a supernumerary grant to take care of the average attendance over 60 for the last quarter and for this quarter.\n\nThe accommodation in the school is ample for the extra number.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA. W. Welll.\n15 Dinnick Crescent,\nToronto, Dec. 5, 1928.\n\nDr. Scott,\nc/o Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI have just had a letter from the Rev. Mr. Pitts, at Alberni, of which the following is a part.\n\n\"The Department have given grant for only 90 pupils for the last two quarters. On the June quarter they held back $94.00 and on the Sept. quarter $60.40, and if they will not pay for more than 90 we will lose on this quarter about $350.00 grant, as our average will be over 96.\n\nI do not think this is fair as they have put the children in the school, accepted them at Ottawa and notified me that they were to be grant earning pupils.\"\n\nI sincerely trust that Mr. Pitts will be given grant for the full average number of pupils in attendance there. You can quite understand that this school requires the full Government Grant to keep the finances right, as the farm land connected with this is limited owing to the excessive cost in clearing the stumps from the land.\n\nAs the school is now, for this quarter, Mr. Pitts has taken on an additional teacher, making three school rooms, instead of two, owing to the additional number of pupils. Mr. Pitts is doing excellent work, as a matter of fact is doing more than two men's work himself to keep expenses down within the revenue.\n\nTrusting that you will give this your usual prompt attention,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(SGD.) Adelaide Clark\nIndian Sec. W.M.S.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6431, File 877-1, part 2)\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nRecently I have been having some correspondence with Mr. Indian Agent Frost with regard to the manual training instruction at the Alberni Indian School and he has forwarded to me a letter from Principal Pitts who states that he has now secured a Mr. Carr, as farm instructor, and also to handle the manual training as he has had a course in manual training, drafting, blue-prints, etc. The Principal also states that he has secured the services of Mr. Eli Robinson, principal of the Collegiate Institute at Stonewall, Man., to take charge of the senior classes. Mr. Robinson has also taught manual training for a number of years at Stonewall and he comes to the school prepared to take on any or all of the manual training work. However, I will write you further with regard to this particular subject at a later date, as I have gathered about all the information I can as regards what assistance should be given to different schools towards the salary of instructors.\n\nI thought, however, it would be advisable to bring to your attention the following quoted paragraph in the principal's letter dealing with the per capita grant, for he claims that the Alberni School only received a grant of $150.00 per capita while others receive $170.00.\n\n\"Again the late Inspector Cairns informed me on his last visit that nearly all the residential schools of B.C. were getting a grant of $170 per pupil per annum and would hardly believe that we were getting only $160. The school I left in Manitoba was getting $170 and was not nearly so well equipped with staff as we are here. The revenue from dairy farms was high, rent, wages and salaries less costs averaged less (not about half). In the estimates for this year I have had to ask the Church for over seven thousand dollars to supplement the per capita grant.\"\n\nMr. Anfield, of the Alert Bay School, informed me yesterday that he has been promised $180.00. I think, therefore, that it would be advisable to increase the grant at the Alberni School in order that it may be on the same plane as the others.\n\nI am very busy at the present time and there are a lot of matters that I have been wanting to attend to, but hope to get everything cleared up as soon as the new Assistant Commissioner is appointed which I hope will be in the very, very near future.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nW.B.D.M.\n\nRussell Ferrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

From the first of April, next, payment will be made on an average attendance up to 115 pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Colin G. Young, D.D.,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, January 17, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 571/28 of the 5th instant, with reference to the per capita grant and the pupilage at the Alberni Indian Residential School. At the outset, I wish to write a short resume of the rules governing the payment of per capita grant to Indian residential schools. Our Estimates and the Appropriation provide a per capita grant for a certain pupilage at each school. If the average attendance for any quarter is greater than the pupilage allowed because the school authorities have recruited to overstrength, the extra pupils are carried by the management without grant, until such time as the Department secures an increased appropriation. If extra pupils are present because the Department has requested the school to admit urgent cases, then supernumerary grant is allowed and payment is made on the basis of the actual average attendance. However, in no case do we allow or ask a school to admit more pupils than can be safely accommodated. The air space in dormitories and classrooms determines the limit of safety. The addition of compulsory attendance clauses in the Indian Act did not in any way affect the rules governing payments of grants. While the Department can compel attendance, we are guided by the amount of accommodation available. From time to time, the Department approves of the admission of applicants to Indian residential schools. In other words, their eligibility is determined; but, of course, their actual entry to the institution is contingent upon accommodation being available.\n\nThe present pupilage at the Alberni Indian Residential School is 90. The Department permits the enrolment of 94 or 95 children, so that the average attendance will\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni,\nB. C.\n\n- approximate\napproximate 90 and the maximum per capita grant earned. I regret it will not be possible to allow a pupilage of, and to pay grant for more than 90 pupils this fiscal year, as there are no funds for the purpose; but I am pleased to inform you that arrangements have now been made for a pupilage of 116 at the Alberni School as from April first, next.\n\nYou refer in your letter to Section 10 of the Indian Act, which provides for the compulsory education of Indian children. Every physically fit Indian child of school age shall attend such school as may be designated by the Superintendent General. This section is used when accommodation is available and children are not in school; but, if there are no openings for pupils, the Department is careful not to designate schools and the duties of any truant officers are confined to the return of truants and the keeping of the institutions up to strength.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of this letter, which you will please hand to the Reverend Mr. Pitts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nJanuary 17, 1929.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. Young was in the Deputy's office today and Dr. Scott called for this file. The Deputy seemed to give him the impression that we might increase the pupilage at Alberni to 115 and possibly allow the increase to date from January first. Dr. Scott requested that you take this matter up with him again as soon as you return.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to respectfully bring to the attention of the Department the question of payment of capitulation grant for pupils in the Alberni Indian Residential School, and to place the matter before the Department for consideration, as I see it.\n\n1. Section 10 of the Indian Act enacted that all Indian children between the ages of 7 and 15 years of age who are medically fit shall attend either day or residential school. There is no provision made whereby any authority can excuse them from attending school because of lack of accommodation, nor for school authorities to decline to accept pupils for that reason.\n\n2. School principals had on various occasions complained to this office that there were Indian children of school age that were not attending school and who would not do so unless pressure was used and they were compelled to attend.\n\n3. The Department, in August 1928, approved of the appointment of a Truancy Officer to recruit such children and convey such as were found medically fit, to the various schools.\n\n4. Covering letters accompanying applications for the admission of children to the Alberni Indian Residential School, submitted to the Department for approval, asked that they be admitted as grant earning pupils, and on approval by the Department, no exception was taken to that clause.\n\n5. On September 27th, 1928, authority was granted by the Department for the equipping of a third classroom at the Alberni Indian Residential School to provide accommodation for extra pupils as the two classrooms then in use had become too crowded.\n\nThe Alberni Indian Residential School is rated by the Department for 90 pupils; there are now 106 pupils on the roll and 98 are actually in residence.\n\nThese remarks are respectfully placed before the Department for consideration and a ruling requested governing the admission of further pupils to any school that is already up to its allotment in pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd. R. Frost\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 24, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, informing the Department that the Reverend Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School has had occasion, for cause, to dispense with the services of Mrs. Carr and also Mr. G. J. Carr, farming instructor. It is hoped that the Principal will secure the services of qualified persons to fill the vacant positions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nSir;-\n\nI have the honour to advise the Department that the Rev. Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School has had occasion to dispense with the services of Mrs. Jean or Margaret Carr, one of the school staff, for cause, without notice or wages in lieu of same. The Rev. Principal reported the facts of the case to me and I advised him that I considered that he was legally within his rights in so doing. I also advised Mrs. Carr that I considered the Rev. Principal was quite within his rights.\n\nFurther, the Rev. Principal again applied to me for advice regarding the discharge of Mr. G.J. Carr, Farming Instructor at the Alberni Indian Residential School, (for cause) and after hearing the facts of the case I advised the Rev. Principal to dispense with the man's services at once and to pay him one month's salary in lieu of notice, and to give him reasonable time to find housing accommodation and remove his personal effects.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd R. Frost\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 22, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn:\n\nI have your 182/15/14977 of the 13th instant, and in reply I beg to state the Department is pleased to learn that suitable arrangements have been made for manual training activity at the Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nI may say that in the past few years there have been adjustments in the amount of grant paid to Indian residential schools. It was felt that the old classification was no longer fair to the smaller institutions, particularly those situated distant from markets. Only a few years ago, the Alberni School received $140 per pupil. The grant there is now $160, and it is the intention to make it $170 as soon as funds can be provided for the purpose. Of course, where the institution is government-owned and is fairly close to markets, the minimum grant is allowed. Your recommendation will not be overlooked when the estimates for the coming fiscal year are being prepared.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. F. E. Pitts, B.A., Principal\n\nMr. McLean\nAs Deputy & Secy.\nDept. Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nAlberni, B.C. Oct. 4th, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYours of Sept. 26th, No. 159-1-11, to hand re progress of manual training in Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nOn the last of May '29, I wrote Commissioner Ditchburn through Agent Frost, asking what grant or assistance would be given by the Dept. to secure a properly qualified Manual training instructor.\n\nCommissioner Ditchburn replied on June 1st, that he \"would recommend a grant of $400 per annum for this work\" but that I must not take this for granted until further advised. Since then I have heard no further instructions about it.\n\nHowever, as it was necessary to secure a teacher for the year I advertised for a male teacher for the senior classroom, who could teach manual training. I secured Mr. Eli Robinson who has a B.S.A. and had taught manual training at Guelph, Ont. and Stonewall, Man.\n\nCommissioner Ditchburn objected to the classes being held in the evening. As the pupils in the senior room are in for only the half day it meant that if the teacher of that room gave time during classroom hours to manual training, that it was going to break up the classroom work for the girls as well as the boys.\n\nJuly 1st, I put in a requisition for some further necessary equipment for manual training and have had no word of it since.\n\nAnother difficulty has arisen that the Department sanctions the pupils leaving the school at 16 yrs. of age. I had persuaded the older boys to come back this year and three of them to take the entrance exams next June and all to take manual training. They had just got started at this work when a good run of salmon etc. convinced the parents that they needed them and the position of the Dept. as interpreted by the Indian Agent was that we could not keep them if they wanted to go. Consequently, four of the boys took advantage of it and I had to consent to their going. Those over 16 years who remain know that if the school does not suit them they can go. We have now on the roll only 13 boys over 12 years of age out of 52, and only 5 of these are over 14 years. Indian children at these ages are not developed like white children of the same age.\n\nAs a result I find myself with a farm and stock, a large steam heating plant burning wood, a large baking outfit and a large laundry equipment, and sewing instruction room making our clothing and with children going out at 16 years none of them able to do very much to help with this work. Besides the members of staff are tied up teaching and caring for 100 small children.\n\nFor reasons above mentioned, I have not had time nor heart to undertake the Manual training. The expense of having an instructor just for this work is beyond our revenue and out of all proportion to the result that could be accomplished with these small children.\n\nI am reporting on the above matters to the Dept. and the Church offices and asking that some understanding be reached between the Dept. and the Church as to the management of this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. E. Pitts\nOttawa, November 9, 1929.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, enclosing a communication received from the Rev. Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School. I am enclosing, for your information, copy of official letter of today's date which is being directed to the Rev. Mr. Pitts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

F. E. Pitts of the Alberni Residential School, B. C.\n\nThis matter has been considered by the Sub-Executive Committee of The Woman's Missionary Society of The United Church of Canada, and the following resolution was adopted:\n\n\"THAT WHEREAS a communication from the Rev. F. E. Pitts, Principal of Alberni Residential School working under The Woman's Missionary Society addressed to the Department of Indian Affairs has been received and carefully considered by the Sub-Executive of The Woman's Missionary Society of the United Church of Canada, and WHEREAS it seems reasonable that questions so vital to the best interests of an institution splendidly equipped by the Department should be laid before the Department of Indian Affairs for its information and consideration, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that Mr. Pitts' letter go forward to the Department of Indian Affairs with the endorsement of The Woman's Missionary Society, and with the urgent request that the fullest consideration be given to the particular points referred to in the communication, namely, (1) age of leaving school, (2) difficulties in management, (3) the difference in grants to institutions.\"\n\nOn behalf of The Woman's Missionary Society,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6431, File 877-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nPOOR-COPY\nOttawa, October 25, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to manual training at the Alberni Indian Residential School. The Department is prepared to allow $40 per month towards the salary of an instructor for this important work. You should keep this in mind when you are deciding what can be done. The Department has not received any requisition for necessary equipment, and I believe you should send this to Mr. Indian Agent Frost, asking him to forward it to the Department with his recommendation.\n\nI am writing to Mr. Frost today, with a view to learning if something cannot be done to keep boys in the school until they are more mature. You might discuss this with him and keep in mind that the age for discharge from these schools is 18 and that we can compel attendance up to the 16th birthday.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. F. E. Pitts,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nAlberni, B. C.\nOttawa, November 9, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 4th ultimo has been forwarded by the General Secretary of the Woman's Missionary Society of the United Church. On the 25th ultimo, I wrote to you with reference to the Department's assistance in connection with the manual training activity, and I stated that I was writing to Mr. Indian Agent Frost, in an effort to keep boys in school until they were more mature. May I repeat that the age for discharge from Indian residential schools is 18 and that the Department can compel attendance up to the 16th birthday. I may say that the Deputy Superintendent General is seriously considering asking Parliament to make some changes in the compulsory education clauses of the Indian Act. If the proposed legislation is secured, in special cases the Department will be able to compel attendance even after the 16th birthday. In the meantime, Mr. Indian Agent Frost has been instructed to inform parents and others that it is considered in the best interests of pupils to remain in the school for a further period. This will be his reply to requests for discharge when a pupil is 16, provided such pupil is not really needed at home.\n\nWith reference to the pupilage at the Alberni Indian Residential School, you are already aware that an increase from 90 to 115 has been allowed as from the beginning of the current fiscal year. Concerning the amount of the per capita grant, there have been adjustments from time to time during the past few years. The Alberni School grant has been increased from $120 to $150 per capita, while other schools to which you refer have in the same period been increased only $20 - from $150 to $170 per capita. Even before your letter was received, the Department had decided to make the per Capita grant at the Alberni Indian Residential School $165 as from April first, 1930, provided Parliament allows the increase. At a later date, it is hoped that no Indian residential school in British Columbia will have a per capita grant of less than $170. This, however, is contingent upon the necessary funds being appropriated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. F. E. Pitts, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nAlberni Residential School,\nAlberni, B.C.\nOttawa, July 18, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, with reference to Inspector Barry's report on the Alberni Indian Residential School. It is not the practice of the Department to send a copy of an inspector's report to the Rev. Principal. For your information, I may say that Mr. Barry reports there has been a very great improvement in the cleanliness of the school and that the work in the classrooms has improved a little. Our officer, however, was somewhat critical of the general management of the school. Further, he was not satisfied with the manual training activity. He requested that the Department take no action at the present time in the matter but that the report following his next inspection be awaited.\n\nThe Department believes that you are giving intelligent consideration to the management of this school. I understand that Mr. Barry made some suggestions in connection with the general management and I trust that there will be considerable improvement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Pitts, B.A., Principal\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI would be pleased to receive a copy of Capt. Gerald Barry's (Inspector of Indian schools for B.C.) report on this school. These reports should be of value in helping the principal in managing the school. Thanking you in anticipation of this favor.\n\nI am Yours Obediently,\n\nF. E. Pitts\n\nAlberni, B.C., June 24th, 1932\nEXTRACT from Inspector Barry's Report regarding his visit to the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL on April 26th, 1932. - Original on File 159-1-6.\n\nGeneral:\nThe headings of this report have been arranged to follow for the most part those of my report on this school made after my inspection in June, 1931. It is necessary to read the reports together to get a true view of conditions here.\n\nI am glad to say that there has been a very great improvement in the cleanliness of the school and the work in the schoolrooms has improved a little. The two teachers engaged by the Principal last September were recommended from this office.\n\nAfter inspecting their work, I told the Principal that I thought the teachers were doing very good work. He resented this and told me that he did not consider that the Department had any right to say whether he should or should not keep on the teachers for another year. I explained that all I had done was to inform him of my opinion of his teachers, which was very much my business, as if they had not been satisfactory changes would have had to be made.\n\nI consider that Mr. Pitts' administration of the school is very weak. It will be seen again and again through this report that the general supervision of the school is below the average. I have warned the Reverend gentleman that had it not been that the school was much cleaner this year, I should have recommended that he be asked to resign. He may make up his mind to properly look after his school, now that he understands that while I or any other official of the Department is perfectly prepared to help in any way possible poor administration which endangers the lives of the Indian children will not be tolerated. I much desire however that the Principal be permitted to continue here till I have an opportunity of again inspecting this school this Fall. I do consider that he should receive any warning that the Department considers necessary in order that conditions may be greatly improved.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nI wish to draw the attention of the Department to the fact that the Manual Training Grant seems to have been spent in a very poor manner. No worthwhile Manual Training has been done in this school so far this year. I also wish to point out that the salaries paid as under seem to me to be excessive:\n\nRev. F.E. Pitts\nALBERNI INDIAN RES. SCHOOL.\n\nRev. F. E. Pitts, B. A. Principal $1600.00 per annum\nMrs. F. E. Pitts Matron 925.00 \"\nMiss Ketha Pitts Primary Teacher 780.00 \"\n\n(Board included in each case).\n\nThis makes a total to one family of $3305.00 per annum\nwith room and full board.\nThe Principal's salary might well be cut to $1200.00 per annum\nThe Matron's salary should not exceed 720.00 per annum\nand there is no reason why the Primary Teacher's salary should be more than say\nthat of the Senior Teacher 720.00 per annum\n\nThis includes full board and would total $2640.00 per annum\nfor this one family or a total saving of $665.00 per annum\nwhich with the Manual Training Grant from the Department would pay\nthe salary of a properly trained Vice Principal and M. T. Instructor.\n\nEXTRACT from Inspector Barry's letter of June 9, 1932, addressed\nto Commissioner Ditchburn, forwarding above report.\n\nAs you will see, I am very far from satisfied with conditions\nat this school. I have pointed out some of the more obvious faults.\nEach year quite a large proportion of the staff changes. This is very\nbad for the school; but very few seem able to endure more than one year.\nThe school is far too much a one family institution. You will see how-\never that I am asking the Department not to ask the United Church to\nmake a change in the administration at Alberni, till I have had the\nopportunity of observing how much the present Principal and his wife\nhave taken my remarks to heart. If when I inspect the school in\nSeptember, there has been no decided change for the better, I shall\nhave a definite recommendation to put before the Department.\nALBERNI INDIAN RES. SCHOOL:\n\nPer Capita grant of Alberni Res. School increased to $170 from April 1st, 1931. Mr. Agent Frost advised by letter of July 15th, 1931, on File 159-1-3.\nOttawa, July 9, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nMr. Barry, Inspector of Schools for British Columbia, in a report on his inspection of the Alberni Indian Residential School, has drawn attention to the overcrowded condition in the junior girls' dormitory. He states there are 25 beds in this room, while there is only air space to accommodate 22 girls. I would, therefore, request that you arrange to reduce the number of beds in this dormitory to 22.\n\nThe Inspector also states that the junior boys' dormitory did not seem to be well ventilated, the beds were untidy and the toilet in the washroom attached to the dormitory was not properly ventilated. He also states that when he inspected this dormitory it was not very clean and there was water on the floor.\n\nThe Inspector further states that the boiler room was very untidy. Debris from wood used as fuel had been allowed to collect, there being a big pile in one corner of the room. It is also stated that the grates of the fire box and the bridges in the furnace are broken.\n\nI have to request that you will make early arrangements for proper ventilation and cleanliness in the junior boys' dormitory and in cleaning up the debris in the boiler room.\n\nRelative to the new grates and repairs to the bridges in the furnace, I have to request that you will arrange to have this equipment installed and the furnace placed in good condition during the present summer, the cost of same to be paid from per capita earnings or other receipts of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. F. E. Pitts, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Res. School,\nAlberni, B.C.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nEXTRACT from Report of C.H. Barry, Inspector of Schools for B.C., dated June 10 & 11, 1931, regarding his inspection of the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 159-1-6.\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nThroughout my inspection, I noticed again and again the result of what I may term \"Slack Supervision of the Boys\". The condition of the boys' dormitories, toilets, broken windows in the barn, etc., speak for themselves. I consider that this is a matter which could be easily remedied. The boys themselves while out of school show clearly this lack of training, which even extends to their manners. These remarks do not in any way refer to the girls of the school.\nOttawa, February 12, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15/15/33050, dated the 7th instant, with reference to absence from duty of the Principals of the United Church Indian Residential Schools at Alberni and Ahousaht.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department gave no special authority for these Principals to attend a convention in Toronto. We were advised by the authorities of the United Church that it was their intention to hold a convention on the 29th and 30th ultimo and that the Principals of their residential schools would attend. We were informed, further, that satisfactory arrangements could be made to carry on the school work during their absence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to call attention to Clause No. 3 in the Agency report of Mr. E.R. Frost, of the West Coast Agency, dated February 2nd, for the month of January. Under the heading of \"Schools\" the Agent writes:\n\n\"No comment other than that the Rev. Principals of the Alberni and Ahousat Schools are attending a Church Conference at Toronto, leaving the schools in temporary charge of a male teacher.\"\n\nFrom the foregoing it would appear that the Agent feels that he should have been notified if authority had been granted to the Principals of the Alberni and Ahousat Schools to leave these schools in temporary charge of a teacher and go to Toronto to attend a Church conference. Possibly the Department may have given such authority and if so we do not appear to have been advised of the arrangement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas. O. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 16, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, which reached the Department on Saturday last, enclosing copy of a communication from the Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School. It is noted he requests that leave of absence be granted him, in order that he can attend a Conference of the United Church at Toronto and that it will be necessary for him to leave Alberni on or about the 13th instant.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of the leave of absence requested by Rev. Mr. Pitts. It is noted that he has made arrangements to satisfactorily carry on the work during his absence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni,\nB. C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith, for the Department's consideration, a request from the Rev. F. E. Pitts, B.A., principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School, for permission to attend a conference of the United Church, at Toronto, convening on January 29 to 31st, which will necessitate his leaving Alberni on or about January 13th.\n\nI consider the male teacher mentioned in Mr. Pitts' letter is quite capable of taking charge of the routine school work under Mrs. Pitts, and the Farm Instructor, in my opinion, is capable of taking care of farm matters, during Mr. Pitt's absence, and this will be more satisfactory than a stranger as acting Principal.\n\nI have agreed to the Rev. Mr. Pitts' request and respectfully request the Department's endorsement of my action.\n\nEnc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEEF/N.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Other matters make it urgent that I go a little earlier, I shall probably be away from Jan. 13th. to Feb. 10th.\n\nI have a man teacher in the senior class-room and the Farm Instructor, who will be able under the direction of Mrs. Pitts who is matron, to look after the School while I am away. I therefore request the Indian Department to release me from the responsibilities as principal while away.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(Sgd) F. E. Pitts.\nOttawa, May 18, 1933.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, relative to the engagement of a teacher for the senior classroom in the Alberni Indian Residential School. It is noted that the teacher you wish to engage is a resident of Manitoba and formerly taught in the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you have not stated the qualifications which Miss Thorpe possesses. While the Department has never objected to the engagement of teachers who are not residents of the province in which the schools are located, yet it prefers that local teachers be engaged. If Miss Thorpe has Manitoba professional qualifications, the Department would have no objection to her appointment as teacher in the Alberni Residential School. The Department has been informed that there are a number of B.C. teachers, fully qualified, who are out of positions; and it might be advisable, if you so desire, to communicate with Mr. G. H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, P.O. Box 665, Victoria, B.C., who would be able to recommend a teacher having B.C. professional qualifications.\n\nThe Department will leave the matter of the appointment in your hands, on the understanding that the teacher engaged is professionally qualified.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. F. E. Pitts, B.A.,\nPrincipal, Indian Res. School,\nAlberni, B.C.\n\nT. H. McInnes,\nActing Secretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am about to engage a teacher for the senior classroom and have a chance to get Miss Nora E. Hope of St. Boniface, Manitoba, who was with us in the Birtle Indian School for three years before Church Union. I know Miss Hope to be a splendid teacher and interested in all school activities.\n\nWhat I wish to know, is there any regulations about engaging teachers locally or within the Province? There are a number of B.C. teachers out of positions but I do not know them personally and there is hardly one in a thousand that can handle the senior room in an Indian...\nschool as successfully as this\n\nPlease let me know at your earliest convenience as I wish to complete the engagement.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH. E. Pitts\nPrincipal\nOttawa, August 23, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to Inspector Barry's report on his inspection, in April, last, of the Alberni Indian Residential School. In reply I have to inform you that the contents of your letter have been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nReverend F. E. Pitts, B. A.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nAlberni, B. C.\nIndian Residential School\n\nREV. F. E. PITTS, B.A., PRINCIPAL\n\nAlberni, B.C., August 8th, 1932.\n\nMr. A. F. MacKenzie,\nSec'y Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have before me your letters 159-1-5 July 8, 1931, and 159-1-1 July 18, 1932, both relating to Inspector Barry's report on Alberni Indian Residential School. In both these letters you seem to have gathered from the Inspector's report that we run a dirty school and have a slovenly way of doing things.\n\nMy reason for asking in letter of June 24th for a copy of Inspector Barry's report was due to the following remarks he made in my office here. On April 26, 1932, after inspecting the classrooms, residence, outbuildings and farm, apparently well satisfied with everything, he came with me into the office to get some statement of staff salaries, finances, etc. I remarked that I expected he would be remaining two days for the inspection, when he burst out in the most vindictive manner with the following remarks. \"I came here intending to ask for your retirement from the principalship of this school. It has improved a little since my last visit. You have the dirtiest school in B.C. If the Roman Catholic sisters visited your school they would be shocked at the condition of it. You were not nice to me when I came for inspection. You have not a nice manner anyway. You quarrel with your staff. I have gone to the trouble to find out how you get along and have a stack of correspondence so high, (indicating about 2 inches). You tried to get me out of my job. It was too stupid of you to say anything against an officer of the Department. You can do what you like. I am strong enough now with the Dept. You can't put me out.\" You were not invited to attend the meeting to arrange for the inter Indian school sports. You are not interested in sports.\" Then referring to staff and salaries as he went out on the steps said in a loud voice that could be heard by the older Indian girls on the playground, Mr. Clark, B.C. boiler inspector and Mr. Nightingale, Indian Agent's assistant, who were in a car waiting for him, \"Three of your family are getting Three Thousand Dollars salary here. You will have to carry on the school properly whether you get these salaries or not.\" I called him back into the office to prevent being heard by children and explained that my salary and Mrs. Pitts' salary was fixed by the Women's Mission Board in Toronto.\n\nAll of the foregoing remarks were made by Inspector Barry in my office in less than five minutes. I probably should add by way of explanation that I have had no personal acquaintance or connection whatsoever with Inspector Barry outside of his inspection of the school. His attitude toward me has arisen out of his first report on the school which was sent through your Department to the church offices in Toronto and was sent on to me for explanation and reply. I replied to the church offices and I presume my reply was sent back through your offices to Inspector Barry.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6431, File 877-1, part 2)\nMr. Barry went directly from here to the Indian Agent's office and made the same railing attack upon me there to the Agent in the presence of his assistant, Mr. Lightningale, that the school was dirty and that I was paying Three Thousand dollars in salary to my own family. If you want to know what reception his remarks got there ask Indian Agent Frost.\n\nIt is not easy to submit quietly to criticism of being dirty or selfishly dishonest in the matter of salaries.\n\nIn reply re school being dirty. The morning after Inspector Barry's remarks, I had Indian Agent Frost make a thorough inspection of the school, that he might officially answer any enquiry from your Department. I also had Miss Brodie, who has been senior teacher in Cecelia Jeffirey and Ahousant schools for the last 20 years go all over the school and I had Rev. Dr. S.S. Osterhout of Vancouver, Superintendent of Missions for the United Church go over all the residences and building. Any of these will answer questions directly to the Department concerning the cleanliness of the school.\n\nRev. Principal & Mrs. Raley of Cequaleetza Indian School visited us and remarked as they went through the whole building, \"I don't see how you can keep an Indian School so clean.\" Rev. Dr. Osterhout from the pulpit in Alberni, referred to the school as a \"beautiful home so beautifully kept by Mr. & Mrs. Pitts.\" Mr. Travers and Mr. Shepherd, inspectors of the B.C. government, after going through the dormitories and whole residence said to each other \"everything is as clean as a new pin.\" All the visitors who go through the school speak in the same way of the cleanliness of it. The children too are so clean in their work that we have no hesitancy in having them help with preparing food and serving it for our table as well as their own.\n\nAs to management. We have no trouble with discipline of the children. Each member of staff is responsible for the children in their charge and I keep a close oversight of all the departments. We are right against an Indian village, yet we have no trouble with the Indians. The 115 children I consider a very fine lot of workers for their ages in all branches of household and farm work. Our relation to children and parents is most cordial.\n\nAs for technical manual training, i.e. with the carpenter tools, I am not at all satisfied with what we have accomplished, but it has been through no lack of interest or effort on my part. I hope we are in a way now to do better.\n\nTo answer his remark about my quarrelling with my staff, I wish to say that we all live in the building and have our meals together. So far as I am aware there has been no word of quarrel by myself or family with any other member of staff. It is true I have often found it necessary to point out their duties and errors and have dismissed a number because I was not satisfied with them. No one has left because dissatisfied with my treatment or management. Three or four whom I have dismissed probably have furnished Inspector Barry with the \"stack of correspondence\" he speaks of.\n\nI did not know that I had been slighted in being left out of the Inter-Indian School sports till told of it by Inspector Barry. When he spoke of it as he did I had reason to think that he knew why. At any\nI was not prepared to take the time or money to take a number of the children so far away.\n\nTo say that I am not interested in sports is another thing. Our basketball teams compete with the white boys in High School public schools and town. In the last two years have held the Junior League cup against all of these. Our boys have football and baseball teams and compete credibly with white boys in all competitions at celebrations. I engaged one of the best basketball players in the country to coach them, supply them with equipment, arrange the games, am a member of the town Athletic committee, etc., etc.\n\nRe classroom work. Out of 200 applicants I engaged the two teachers recommended by Inspector Barry largely on his recommendation. They were inexperienced but I think did good work.\n\nIf Inspector Barry's criticism of my management has to do with the fact of my salary and that of my wife and daughter, I have only to say that we were all college trained for this work and have had considerable successful experience in it. If our salaries are too high it is the church and not the Department that is responsible for paying them. Twice this year since we knew of the 10% cut in the per capita grant we have offered to take a reduction in our salaries and the Women's Dominion Board have declined.\n\nInspector Barry overstepped not only his duties but his business when he attacked me in this way and when he discussed these things within the hearing of the school children are outsiders, he overstepped all propriety. And when he left me with the remark that we would be able to work together now and then went straight to the Indian Agent's office and in the same vindictive mood attacked me again behind my back he forfeited all claim to my respect or confidence.\n\nMrs. Pitts and I have worked for over thirty years in the church, ten and a half of which we have lived in residence with Indian children and worked in the school. We have asked no personal favors from either the Church or Department but have hoped to win from the Church and Department esteem and confidence in our work. Anyone who destroys that robs us of what we have held most dear. This is why I have been driven to state these unpleasant facts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. E. Pitts\nThe Secretary.\n\nDecember 14, 1934.\n\nWEST COAST AGENCY INSPECTION REPORT NO.5.\n\n6. SCHOOLS:\n\nI visited the Alberni Residential School. There were 122 children in school at the time of my visit. I visited the class rooms of Grades 5, 6 and 8, and they appeared to be working well, under efficient teachers. It struck me, however, that some of those in Grade 8, were too old to be at school.\n\nThe manual training in this school seems very good, though it would be a great help, and of great use to the Indians if some training in boat building was given them, as after all, most of them will have to earn their livings as fishermen when they grow up, and they should be able to build and repair boats and engines.\n\nI found everything in the dormitories and other parts of the school clean and tidy.\n\nI also visited the kitchen which was in good order, and I found that the children were to have for supper, vegetable soup, bread and butter and jam, and that there was plenty of milk for everybody at all times.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Geo.

May 31, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your 159-1-5 of the 20th instant, Mr. A.W. Neill, M.P. for Comox-Alberni, has asked me to await receipt of his views on the school situation on the West Coast of Vancouver Island before submitting my report and recommendations to the Department. I felt the Department would wish me to extend this courtesy to Mr. Neill and I am therefore delaying the preparation of my report until the information Mr. Neill wishes to submit is received and considered. I have asked Mr. Neill to let me have this information as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 26, 1937.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am in receipt of a memorandum from the Minister's office, in which the suggestion is made that provision for an Indian day school be made at Alberni during the coming school year.\n\nIt would appear, from the reports here, that there are approximately 35 children of school age on the adjoining reserve and that there is a building that might be used as a day school until a building programme is decided upon and the necessary appropriation voted for the construction of a new school.\n\nInspector Barry's report indicates that the Alberni site is not centrally located and not suitable for a day school. It is just possible, however, that the remaining building there might be used for a year at least, despite its distance from the reserve. Provision, of course, could be made for a noonday meal, and this itself would tend to encourage regular attendance. I am myself rather favourably disposed to the experiment, but I am anxious to obtain from you a definite recommendation before reaching a final decision.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B. C.\nOttawa, May 26, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nRe: Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nI have, for acknowledgment, Mr. Pratt's memorandum of May 22nd and also letter received by him from Mr. A. W. Neill, M.P.\n\nMay I refer to my memorandum to you of May 7th, in which I submitted figures indicating the extent to which provision had been made for the pupils formerly enrolled at the Alberni Residential School.\n\nIt is impossible to reach a decision in respect to our building programme on the west coast of Vancouver Island until we obtain an official report from the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, Major D. M. MacKay. It is just possible that this report will reach us in the course of a few days.\n\nThe information at our disposal indicates that the site at Alberni is not centrally located and consequently not suitable for an Indian day school. If, however, there are 35 children on the adjoining reserve, willing to attend classes at Alberni, I can see no objection whatever to the employment of a day school teacher during the coming school year. It is my intention to communicate with the Commissioner for British Columbia and obtain from him information in respect to the accommodation available. If this accommodation is at all suitable, a day school teacher will be employed and take charge of the school from September first.\n\nI am returning herewith Mr. Neill's letter.\n\nActing Director of Indian Affairs.\nMinister's Office\n\nMay 22, 1937\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Alberni Indian Residential School - re accommodation for pupils\n\nWill you please furnish an immediate report covering the attached letter from Mr. A.W.

Pratt\nSecretary\nOttawa, May 20, 1937.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nMay I refer to my letter of May 9th, in which I asked you to obtain for me a full report on the school facilities provided by the Department on the west coast of Vancouver Island.\n\nThe departmental records indicate that we have on file a report from Inspector Barry, which report was forwarded to you, at Ottawa, while you were in attendance at the Inspectors' Conference. My understanding was that, in addition to Inspector Barry's report, you would forward certain recommendations in respect to the construction of a school to take the place of the Alberni Residential School, destroyed by fire on February 21st, last. The officials of the United Church have been communicating with me, pressing me for a decision in respect to our building programme at Alberni. I should be glad, therefore, if you would, at your convenience, let me have any recommendations you may care to offer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M.

M. MacKay. The Inspector's report, in which he advocates the establishment of a residential school at Ucluelet, has been received by the Department. I am still awaiting, however, an official report from Major MacKay. Just as soon as I receive this report, I will welcome an opportunity to discuss the whole matter with Dr. Cechrane and yourself, or with either of you.\n\nIt is my intention to be in Toronto on June 2nd, and, if the time at my disposal will enable me to do so, I shall be glad to call at your office, in the hope that I may have an opportunity to discuss a number of matters with you.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.

A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have been requested by the officials of the Woman's Missionary Society to enquire what provision the Department is making for the education of the children on the West Coast of Vancouver Island, following the destruction of the Residential School at Alberni. Mr. and Mrs. Pitts, who were in charge of the School, are retiring on July 1st, 1937, from the service of the Society and from the active service of the Church. This would leave the mission without a missionary, and before making any appointment, the Woman's Missionary Society would be glad to know what the Department is going to do to provide for the education of the children who had been looked after in Alberni.\n\nI understand that a proposal is being submitted, looking towards some re-organization of the educational work in that part of British Columbia, which may have some effect on the type of missionary who will be appointed. We are anxious to co-operate with your Department and would like to know what you have in mind.

In addition to this, a letter was sent to Dr. Cochrane on March 10th, in which the suggestion was made that the Alberni and Ahousaht Residential Schools should be consolidated and a new building erected at Alberni, capable of providing accommodation for all the Indian pupils on the west coast of Vancouver Island. Dr. Cochrane acknowledged receipt of this letter on March 11th and stated: \"I have noted with interest the suggestion that the Ahousaht and Alberni Residential Schools might be consolidated by building an improved day school at Alberni, where provision would be made for dormitory accommodation for 50 or 60 pupils. While at this stage I do not think I would like to express a final opinion in regard to the proposal, I am bound to say that it has much to commend it. After you get all the information you desire and have made up your mind definitely, I would be glad to have your views before a recommendation is submitted to the Minister. It seems fair, too, that we should submit your suggestion to the officials of the Women's Missionary Society of the United Church, who, as you know, have been responsible for the administration of the Alberni School.\"\n\n- On March 9th\nOn March 9th we communicated with Mr. D.

Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Mr. Crerar:\n\nRe: Alberni School.\n\nAs you know, the Alberni Residential School, conducted for the Department of Indian Affairs by the Women's Missionary Society of The United Church of Canada, was destroyed by fire two or three weeks ago. We have not heard from the Department with regard to the measures which it proposes to take as a temporary solution of the situation. I understand that Mr. Pitts, the Principal, is still keeping on the staff and he ought to be informed just what his next step should be.\n\nI need hardly urge that the Department should, in view of the emergency, see that the necessary supplementary grants are asked for rebuilding at the earliest possible moment. We would be glad to know what the suggestion of the Department is as soon as possible, because, under the present circumstances, except for a few of the pupils, who we understand have been sent to Ahousaht, the rest are in the meantime without any educational advantages at all.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n\"H.B. Cochrane\"\n\nRBC.MLT\nOttawa, March 9, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are anxious to secure the fullest possible information that can be supplied us, in respect to the re-building of the Alberni Residential School.\n\nWe feel that, before a definite decision is reached, a complete survey of the territory adjacent to the Alberni School site and the Ahousaht Residential School should be undertaken by Inspector Barry, in cooperation with the Indian Agent. We should have before us an up to date census of the school population and a rough sketch or map of the district, indicating the distances between the Indian homes and the school. Information should also be supplied in respect to the permanency of the Indian population and the approximate number of pupils whose parents are likely to move from place to place during the school year.\n\nWhile no definite decision has been reached by the Department, there is a strong feeling here that there should be a consolidation of the Ahousaht and Alberni Residential Schools and that this can best be achieved by building an improved day school on the Alberni site. We have in mind a day school with approximately four or five rooms, with a basement, so constructed that it could be utilized profitably for vocational instruction (elementary domestic science, carpentry work, boat building, etc.) To this main building could be added dormitory accommodation for approximately 50 or 60 pupils. This proposal, if adopted, would mean that the majority of the pupils would attend school during the day and return to their homes at the close of each school day. It is just possible, of course, that they might have to be\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria,\nB. C.\nprovided with a midday meal. If this suggestion seems impracticable to you and Inspector Barry, we want you to express an opinion in respect to the desirability of constructing two improved day schools, with or without dormitory accommodation. Owing to the prevailing economic conditions, it is exceedingly difficult to justify the rebuilding of the Alberni institution as a residential school, particularly in view of the fact that the Ahousaht school, if it is to be continued, will have to be rebuilt within the next two years.\n\nThe decision we shall have to make in respect to these matters is a rather important one, and any information with which you can supply us will be deeply appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, March 10, 1937.\n\nDear Dr. Cochrane:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information, copy of a report submitted to the Department by Mr. P. B. Ashbridge, Indian Agent, Port Alberni, B. C. This report, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nI may state that I have discussed with Dr. Dorey the situation existing at Alberni as a result of the fire. There is a feeling here that an attempt should be made to consolidate the Ahousaht and Alberni Residential Schools by building an improved day school at Alberni, in which provision would be made for about five or six classrooms and with a dormitory capable of accommodating 50 or 60 pupils, attached to the main building. This proposal, if adopted, would mean that the majority of the pupils in attendance at school would reside at their homes, attend school during the day and be provided with a meal at midday.\n\nI have not at my disposal here sufficient information to justify me in submitting a definite recommendation to the minister. I am, however, communicating with the Indian Commissioner at Victoria, asking him for a census of the school population, the desirability of Alberni as an educational centre, the distance of the majority of the Indian homes from the Alberni School site, the permanency of the Indian population, and any other information he may deem it necessary to send forward. Just as soon as I receive this report, I shall be glad to communicate with you again.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Robt. B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary, Bd. of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to the Department's letter of January 10th, 1935, re fire drill at the Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nI beg to state that, I am of the opinion that Mr. Inspector Barry, misunderstood the Rev. Principal regarding his fire protection report. As all the pupils had been instructed as to what to do in the event of a fire alarm and all had been over the fire escapes at least twice previous to Mr. Barry's inspection, to teach new pupils what was expected of them, but no time had been taken as to the length of time it took to evacuate the school.\n\nI further beg to advise the Department that on the 6th instant, fire drill was held at Alberni School, all pupils passed over the fire escape twice and appeared to know what was expected. In the first drill the time taken to clear the school was, 2 minutes 25 seconds, and in the second test 2 minutes and 5 seconds. All small children were first out and took the greater portion of the time in each test.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd E. Frost,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEEF/N.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 10, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the report of Mr. G. H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, on his recent inspection of the Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Inspector draws particular attention to the matter of fire drill. He states the Principal informed him that there has not been a drill for some time and that the little beginners have not been instructed in fire drill. It is most important that regular fire drill be held, and I would request that you take this matter up with the Principal at once. The younger pupils should be quietly instructed in what they are to do during such a drill, before an alarm is turned in. In fact, all pupils should be definitely instructed concerning what they are to do in case of an alarm. I would request that a drill be held as soon as possible and that you be present to see a fire drill carried out from the dormitories down the fire escapes. After the drill is held, I would request that you inform the Department regarding the result.\n\nThe Inspector speaks in the highest terms of general conditions and the work being performed at this school. He states that the school has greatly improved and that, on the whole, he was pleased with his inspection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. E.

C., on his visit to ALBERT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, December 12, 1934 - forwarded under cover of Asst. Commissioner Perry's letter dated Jan. 2, 1935.\n\nI am sorry to report that I could not hold the usual fire drill that I am accustomed to supervise when inspecting Residential Schools AS THE PRINCIPAL REPORTS THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A DRILL FOR SOME TIME AND THAT THE LITTLE BEGINNERS HAVE NOT BEEN INSTRUCTED IN FIRE DRILL. I could not therefore take the responsibility of having a fire drill till the new comers had been instructed, and I asked the Principal to see to it that they were so instructed and REGULAR FIRE DRILLS HELD in accordance with the instructions of the Department. I would like to suggest that the Department satisfy itself that this is being done. Possibly the Indian Agent could be instructed to see a fire drill carried out from the dormitories down the fire escapes. It is, however, necessary that the little children be quietly instructed in what they are to do during such a drill before an alarm is turned in.\n\nBefore leaving the school I informed the Principal that I considered the school greatly improved and that on the whole I was greatly pleased with my inspection. I asked him to see to it that the Fire Drills were held regularly, as laid down by departmental regulations.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE\nP. O.

The Ucluelet children were sent to Ucluelet Day School. The actual distribution was, as follows:\n\n- Returned to Cowichan Agency........19\n- Placed in Ahousaht School.........8\n- Placed in Ucluelet Day School......17\n- Sent to homes at outside points...37\n- Remaining in Alberni.............31\n\nTotal........112\n\nIt will be seen from this that there are at present 68 children not attending school, of which number 31 are resident in Alberni. For those 37 children living at Coastal points no satisfactory provision can be made at the present time; as, with the vacation period approaching, it would not be to advantage to admit them to Ahousaht School for such a short time, as these children invariably accompany their parents to the fishing grounds.\n\nHowever, provision for the Alberni children could be made by using the one-room building saved from the fire on the site of the old School as a Day School. This room was originally the primary school-room, is in good order and can at very little expense be equipped as a Day School. The room in question is 25' by 35' and can accommodate up to 35 pupils, which would take care of all children resident at Alberni. Moreover, I understand the teachers are still at Alberni and willing to offer their services as Day School teachers.\n\nThe use of this building as a Day School for the\n\nR. A.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMr. R. A. Neay,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nArising out of your letter of Feb. 26th, I take the liberty of writing you on the question of policy for the rebuilding of Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nI have before me a letter from Mr. A. W. Neil, M.P. for Alberni and also a letter from the United Church offices in Toronto, both of which say that the suggestion of your Department is to replace the Alberni Residential school with a day school also the Ahousaht Residential school with a day school and to build a residential school at Ucluelet.\n\nI have discussed these suggestions with the Indian parents, past Indian agents, Boards of Trade and residents of these communities. I have also discussed the suggestion with the Presbytery of Victoria, in session, which includes all the United Church on Vancouver Island, and also the Conference of British Columbia in session, which includes all the United Church in British Columbia. All are unanimously agreed that the residential school should be built at Alberni on the old site; that the Ucluelet residential school would be more expensive to build; would be less convenient for both children and staff; would take 20 years to develop grounds and site anywhere equal to the present site; would require the Department to own their water supply, which is questionable whether it is possible at all. It would also require sufficient fire protection and hospital accommodation. Any repairs to electric plant, plumbing, carpenter work, etc. would not be easily available and more expensive. Part time teachers in the manual training in carpenter work, boat building, diesel engineering and electric work are always available in these towns and would not be available at Ucluelet.\n\nTwo things are fundamental in training the Indian children. The first is a moral stamina that will make them dependable; the second is association with the people with whom they are to work and live when they get out of school. Without these all the book work will amount to nothing.\n\nThe residential schools have accomplished most by bringing the children from different reserves, different bands, different tribes together from the age of 7 to 18, so that now the relationship of these bands are friendly toward each other and have developed common ideals.\nAfter 15\u00bd years as principal of an Indian Residential school, during all of which time I and my family lived in the school with the children, (5\u00bd years on the prairie, 10 years here) I am strongly convinced that by the return to the day schools on the reserves, the Department is throwing away a great deal of the effort and expense that has been put forth by the residential schools during the 25 years of their existence. Especially is this true of the schools on the west coast of Vancouver Island.\n\nIn an inventory to Indian Agent Ashbridge I have conservatively estimated the value of the site, building, water and light connections, etc. at $21,500.00, yet worth a small fraction of that for any other purpose than a school.\n\nI am sure that if you personally looked over the ground you would agree with me that the residential school at Ucluelet instead of Alberni is ridiculous.\n\nI am not writing this from personal reasons. I have already resigned and my resignation has been accepted both by the Br. Columbia conference and the Toronto Board. I am still looking after the farm and stock and Department property until the matter is decided as to whether or not it is to be used as a residential school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

F. E. PITTS, B.A., PRINCIPAL\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Training & Welfare,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI take this opportunity of writing you direct about three pupils from this school who have been attending high school in Port Alberni and who resided in the residential school here until it was burned. From February till June they resided at their homes and attended school regularly and did exceedingly well at their studies.\n\nEddie Klutei and Willie Tatoosh have been in high school three years. They resided at the school and we received the usual grant for them. Your department paid the high school fees in addition to the grant\u2014viz. $5.00 each per month.\n\nI enclose a letter from the principal of the high school stating his opinion of these two boys and their ability as students. I heartily endorse all that he has said. These boys are all-round students. They are popular with the other students\u2014180 in the school. They are leaders in sports and are as well advanced in music as nearly any of the pupils in the school. The whole high school staff are always enthusiastic about their deportment and conduct.\n\nEddie Klutei has led his class in nearly all the examinations since going into high school and Willie Tatoosh has been about fifth in a class of from 45 to 60. They have completed Grade XI and part of Grade XII or senior matriculation. They are anxious to continue in school this year but will not be able to pay the fees and provide books, clothing and board at home.\n\nIt would seem a shame that after spending so much on these boys' education that they should be thrown out after having done so well and having worked so faithfully all these years.\n\nThe third boy, Charlie Klutei, is younger-aged 14\u2014and has been in high school only one year. He is more clever than either of the others but I am not going to urge his case lest it prove detrimental to the other two.\n\nI hope you may see your way clear to give assistance to these boys as has been done in the past. I write you direct because Agent Ashbridge is not very favorable to higher education for the Indians. I always wrote directly to Mr. Sutherland about them.\n\nI still believe in the Indians and that Alberni School was doing good work with them up till the fire\u2014and that our school occupied an enviable place among Indian schools.\n\nI have confidence in you and your ability to manage the situation re the rebuilding the residential school.\n\nI must confess that, whoever was to blame, I think the way the department dropped us and cut off all grants and assistance the day the school burned, leaving us to pay the debts, provide for the staff, and clothing for a number of the children, look after the property etc., was, to say the least, utterly unfair, and would not have been done by any commercial organization in Canada.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nF. E. Pitts\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nSept. 7, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Pitts:\n\nI am informed that there seems to be some possibility of the three Indian boys not being able to continue at school.\n\nIn my opinion, if such should happen, it would be nothing short of a tragedy. I have been teaching school here for ten years now, and have seen various types of students in the district. Nevertheless I can unhesitatingly state that both Eddie and Willie are by far the most brilliant all-round pupils I have encountered. Should they continue I feel morally certain that either will have an excellent chance for the provincial scholarship, and aside from personal wishes in the matter, it would be a shame if these two boys, who are probably the first Indians ever to have the opportunity of leading the province, should be deprived of the chance.\n\nI feel as certain as anyone can be of anything in this life that one of them, if not both, will at least win a bursary if allowed to continue to University.\n\nMy own opinions may seem rather strong, but I feel sure that if you consult any member of my staff you will find that my views are shared by every teacher here. Nothing that I could say in praise of either of these boys would, in my opinion, be adequate. I hope and trust that you will use every means within your power to have them enabled to complete High School.\n\nI am very truly yours,\n\nEric J.

At the request of Commissioner MacKay, I inspected and reported upon a suggested site at the mouth of the Alberni Canal. This was dealt with in a separate report.

If another school is erected, I think it will have to be at Alberni, though it may prove more advantageous and less expensive to do with day schools instead.\n\nGeo. S.

No specific period with respect to which he is anxious to secure information is mentioned. It is altogether likely, however, that Mr. Neill has in mind the destruction of the Alberni Residential School by fire and recommendations that may have reached the Department with respect to the selection of a site for the construction of a new school. If such is the case, I may state that we have no such recommendations on file here. Inspector Barry's interim report sent forward to Major MacKay during his attendance at the Inspectors' Conference was sent back to Major MacKay a few weeks ago, after the matter had been discussed very fully with Mr. Pratt and Mr. Bethune.\n\nWe have on file here reports sent forward by Inspector Barry and Indian Agent Ashbridge at the time the fire took place and we have, also, on file letters dealing with the disposal of the live stock at the school, the placement of a certain number of the pupils at Indian day schools and the desirability of opening a room at Alberni as a temporary Indian day school. In none of this correspondence, however, are there any recommendations in respect to the rebuilding of the residential school at Alberni or at any other point.\n\nMay\nThe Deputy Minister\n\nMay I suggest that Mr. Neill meet Major MacKay, Inspector Barry and Mr. Ashbridge at his home just as soon as a conference can be conveniently arranged. If he is willing to do this, these officials could place at his disposal any recommendations they may have in mind with respect to the rebuilding of the Alberni Residential School or any other buildings they may have in view on the west coast of Vancouver Island.\n\nThis procedure may appear to be somewhat unusual but I think it is justified in view of the fact that Mr. Neill seems to have convinced himself that we have on file here certain information that we are deliberately withholding from him. A conference such as this might, also, tend to satisfy him for the time being and prevent unnecessary correspondence. Major MacKay has not yet sent in to the Department his official report on the rebuilding of the school at Alberni. Consequently, it would appear that this is an opportune time to have him discuss the matter with Mr. Neill. If this suggestion meets with your approval, I am attaching hereto copy of a letter that might be forwarded by you to Major MacKay.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, July 29th, 1937.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from A. W. Neill, M. P., in which he asks to be supplied with copies of recommendations sent forward to the Department by Captain Barry, Rev. A. E. Caldwell, Rev. F. N. Pitts and Mr. Ashbridge, with respect to Indian schools on the west coast of Vancouver Island.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Neill's request is somewhat indefinite, but it is altogether likely that he has in mind the destruction of the Alberni Residential School by fire, with any recommendations that may have reached the Department with respect to the rebuilding of a school at Alberni or at any other point.\n\nMr. Neill seems to have the impression that we have on file here certain reports or recommendations with respect to our building programme on Vancouver Island and that we are unwilling to place these at his disposal for reference. I have been wondering if it would be convenient for you, Inspector Barry and Indian Agent Ashbridge to interview Mr. Neill at his home and discuss this.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nthis subject with him. You could, at that time, let Mr. Neill see departmental letter addressed to you on March 9th, 1937, and discuss with him any steps that you or Inspector Barry have taken since that time towards the preparation of a report and recommendations to the Department. I am convinced that, unless some such step as this is taken, Mr. Neill will continue to feel that he is being somewhat ignored by the Department and, perhaps, what is worse still, he may feel that we are withholding information from him to which he is entitled.\n\nI am today communicating with Mr. Neill, intimating to him that, in all probability, you will arrange a conference with him at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSecretary.\n\nMajor D.

I want to know the recommendations made concerning Indian schools on the West Coast of Vancouver Island made by Capt. Barry, the Rev. A.E. Calwell, the Rev. F.E. Pitts, and Mr. Ashbridge.

Neill, M.P., attached thereto.\n\nMr. Neill, in this letter, states that the departmental per capita grant to the Alberni Residential School was stopped immediately following the receipt of a report of the destruction of the school by fire. This statement is correct, and the action taken was in strict conformity with the Treasury Board and departmental regulations governing the payment of per capita grants. I know of no authority by which these per capita grants could be continued, other than by the introduction of a special estimate based on compassionate considerations and regularly voted by Parliament.\n\nThe action taken by the Department at Alberni has been discussed on at least two occasions with Dr. Corhrane and Dr. Dorey, representatives of the United Church. At no time has either of these representatives expressed the opinion that the action taken was in any sense unfair or irregular. The representatives of the Church were aware, of course, that the Department was called upon to make provision for a large number of the pupils who had been until then in attendance at Alberni. Eight of these were sent to the United Church residential school at Ahousaht and 17 to the day school at Ucluelet.\n\nThe records indicate here that personal property\nproperty belonging to the Rev. F. E. Pitts, Principal of the School, was insured for $800, by the Queen Insurance Company of America, Policy 124927.\n\nTeachers at Indian residential schools are employed, not by the Department, but by the Church Authorities, and we have no information at our disposal, indicating what action was taken by the officials of the United Church, in respect to the payment of the salaries to members of the staff following the destruction of the building by fire.\n\nT.R.L.M\n\nActing Director of Indian Affairs.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJune 7, 1937\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Alberni Indian Residential School\n\nWill you please furnish a full report covering the attached letter from Mr. A.W.

C. had been asked to submit a general report which had not been received but you recommended me to write to Major MacKay. I did so and he replied that Captain Barry had reported on the school situation and had made certain recommendations to Ottawa and that the report was now before the Dept in Ottawa, but that it was of a confidential character and that he was not therefore giving me any of its contents.\n\nThis is the usual buck passing which is so prevalent nowadays in the Indian Department. You cannot give me the information because you have not got the report but you advise me to ask Major MacKay for it, and then Major MacKay says that he has sent in the report but he will not tell me what is in it. This buck passing and talk of confidential reports is nonsense, as you are well aware. I can compel production of it inside of a week after the House opens, and I will, and a good many things which need opening up in the management of the Indian Department.\n\nNow, am I to get this information, to which I am entitled, now or am I not?\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA. W. Neill.\n\n\"A. W. Neill\"\n\nANN:MG\nOttawa, June 10, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nI have, for acknowledgment, Mr. Pratt's memorandum of June 8th and also letter received by him from Mr. A. W. Neill, M.P., attached thereto.\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information, copies of certain correspondence that has taken place between the Department and the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch at Victoria, B.C., in respect to the rebuilding of the Alberni Residential School.\n\nThe first letter was sent forward to Mr. D. H. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, on March 9th. The second letter is dated April 13, 1937, and is copy of a communication received by Commissioner MacKay during his attendance at the Inspectors' conference held at Ottawa at that time. The third is a letter dated May 20, 1937, sent forward by the Superintendent of Welfare and Training. The fourth is Commissioner MacKay's reply thereto, dated May 31, 1937. All of these letters, you will note, are self-explanatory.\n\nYou will note, from Mr. Hill's letter, that he sent forward to Commissioner MacKay a preliminary report prepared by Inspector Barry, in respect to the survey undertaken in response to the request contained in the departmental letter of March 9th.\n\nMajor MacKay left this report with the officials for their information, on the understanding that, immediately following his return to Victoria, he would undertake a review of the whole matter and send in\n\n- an official\nan official report, containing his recommendations in respect to the rebuilding of the school or schools necessary to take the place of the school destroyed by fire at Alberni. Inspector Barry's report has not been considered an official report on the questions outlined in the departmental letter of March 9th, nor was it addressed to the Department. It was simply sent on to Major MacKay during his stay here, on the understanding that it would supply him with certain information necessary to discuss a number of problems intelligently with departmental officials.\n\nThere are a number of objections to making this report or any part of it a subject of public discussion at this time. It has never been the policy or practice of the Department to give publicity to information contained in reports submitted by officers of the Department to their superiors. These reports have invariably been looked upon as confidential or semi-confidential documents. Mr. Barry, in his preliminary report on conditions at Ucluelet, has this to say: \"As I did not wish to arouse too much publicity, I did not walk over the proposed site of the suggested consolidated school (at Ucluelet). I saw the site from a distance. From the information supplied by our Indian day school teacher at Ucluelet, I am convinced that, here, we have an ideal site for the erection of a new type of school which would prove of more use to coast Indians than any school built so far.\"\n\nIt will thus be seen that it is of the utmost importance that officials of the Department safeguard the Government from any attempt that may be made to purchase school sites, in the hope that these sites can be resold to the Government at an enhanced price. It would appear that certain groups of individuals are already working in the hope that the new school will be established in a district some close to a town in the development of which they are interested. The exercise of pressure by such individuals makes it exceedingly difficult for the departmental officials to calmly and dispassionately review the whole question.\nquestion and reach a decision that will be in the best interests of the Indian school population in the territory now under review. It is a matter, however, of government policy. If it is the decision of the Government that these reports should be released to members of Parliament representing the districts concerned from time to time, the officials of the Branch can be instructed to have these reports, or copies of them, forwarded to the interested parties.\n\nI am returning herewith Mr. Neill's letter.\n\nActing Director of Indian Affairs.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nDAY LETTER\n\nOttawa, June 10, 1937.\n\nREV.

Pitts.\n\nI also asked if you could see me on Saturday morning as I shall be on my way to Newfoundland and there are many matters which I should like to discuss with you. I have no doubt that I shall be in receipt of a reply shortly.\n\nWith best regards, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD:BJ\nOttawa, January 29, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nIn response to a request received from Mr. Bethune, I am sending forward herewith copy of a report and certain recommendations relating to the rebuilding of the Alberni Indian Residential School, received by the Department from Major D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for British Columbia.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have received your 159-1-1, of January 19th, and beg to advise that a report with recommendations with respect to the rebuilding of the Alberni Indian Residential School is going forward to you today. Careful attention had to be given to the various locations suggested for the new school, and it was only last week that a review of all the information supplied in this connection was possible.\n\nOn Sunday, August 22nd, last, I called on Mr. A.W. Neill, M.P., at Alberni, and spent some hours with him, during which the replacement of the Alberni Indian Residential School was fully discussed. I may say that I found Mr. Neill strongly in favor of building the new school at Alberni, and he also expressed himself as of the opinion that the present Residential School at Ahousaht should also be replaced. In other words that two Protestant Indian Residential Schools should be operated, as was the case prior to the destruction by fire of the Alberni Residential School. I informed Mr. Neill that the last school survey showed conclusively that one Residential School would be quite sufficient to meet our requirements and that in view of the authentic information available, the reconstruction of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School would not be justified. I understand that Mr. Neill subsequently expressed himself as favorable to the suggested amalgamation of the Ahousaht and Alberni pupilage into one school.\n\nThe question of where the new school should be built was exhaustively gone into and much time was devoted to an examination from many angles of the suitability or otherwise of the locations suggested. After prolonged consideration of all the circumstances involved, I concluded that the school should be built at Alberni and I have so recommended.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nAt your request I have given some considerable thought to the question of the establishment of a new Indian Residential School in the West Coast Agency, and because of differences of opinion both in Departmental and Church circles, regarding the location of the proposed school, careful investigations have been made of the numerous sites suggested as suitable, particular attention being given to Ucluelet, Sechelt, Pachena Bay and Alberni.\n\nI think it would be of value to look at the need for a new Indian Residential School apart from its actual location and to examine the general aspect of the Indian educational situation on the West Coast.\n\nThe present Residential School at Ahousaht can only be used as such for a very limited time, as it is in need of extensive repairs. The Ahousaht School building has been condemned on account of deterioration, lack of adequate water supply, lack of sanitary arrangements and excessive fire hazard.\n\nThe average pupilage at the Alberni Residential School was 135, and Ahousaht 50. Inspector Barry reports that there are at Ahousaht in the neighbourhood of thirty children for whom Residential School care ought to be provided, and at points along the coast line of Barclay Sound some twenty children who might well be accommodated in a residential school on the grounds of loss of one or both parents or whose home conditions are for some reason unsatisfactory. It would appear therefore that in this particular section that the total number of children for whom residential school accommodation must be provided is not in excess of 60.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nThere\nThere remains that large group of children at various points along the coast who have fairly good homes but who must be provided with Residential School accommodation in the absence of available Indian Day Schools.\n\nThe combined average pupilage of Ahousaht and Alberni was 185, and excluding from this 25 pupils lately attending Alberni Residential School now diverted to Coqualeetza, and about 15 receiving Residential School training who should attend the Indian Day School at Ucluelet, there would be available 145 pupils from Alberni, Sarita, Ahousaht, Clo-oose, Port Renfrew and other West Coast Reserves for Residential school attendance, entirely insufficient to justify the operation and maintenance of two protestant Indian Residential Schools for that section of Vancouver Island. The circumstances are such that there is every justification for the amalgamation of the residential school pupilage of Ahousaht and Alberni in one school. In passing it probably would be as well to mention that Ahousaht is a protestant Indian village surrounded by Roman Catholic Indian communities.\n\nIt is readily admitted that the Residential School continues to be an important factor in fitting the Indians for greater independence in both industrial and domestic spheres, but as Indian home conditions improve, as they are improving, and Indian parents more fully recognize and accept responsibility for the upbringing of their children in their own homes, it is reasonable to expect that the day school system will to an ever increasing extent, supersede the Residential School system as a medium of Indian Education. It is particularly desirable that the graduates of Indian Residential Schools be given more opportunity of accepting responsibility for the upbringing of their children and not get into the way of depending unnecessarily on governmental care and support of them.\n\nChildren of Indian Day Schools are not out of touch with their homes and parents to the same extent as the children of the Residential Schools and take home with them from day to day something or what they have learned, and unlike the Residential School pupil, they are in a much better position to learn something of the skills of their parents, Hunting, Trapping, Fishing, etc. While the Residential School continues to be necessary for the special cases, orphans, pupils from poor homes, etc., the Day School is much closer to the homes of the Indians.\nThe children remain within the family circle. The well trained teacher, particularly a married one, either man or woman, who lives on or near the Indian village and daily comes in contact with the Indian people, is of the very greatest help to the children and their parents.\n\nMarried men as teachers in our Day Schools whose wives are either trained nurses, or who can act as practical nurses, especially in the larger villages, are what we require.\n\nDesirable as I consider the extension of the Day School system to be, I am not satisfied that the general condition of homes and occupation on the Reserves, of the protestant Indians of the West Coast, is such as to make the day school system feasible at this time.\n\nAfter much careful thought I have concluded that it would be safer and good policy to build a new Protestant Residential School in the West Coast Agency. The building should be of good quality brick, and the general type required would be that of the Kuper Island Residential School with the wings extended to the rear. The school should be large enough to take one hundred and fifty pupils, about seventy-five in the Boys' side and the same number on the Girls' side. The wash-rooms should open off the dormitories and not be in the basement as at Lytton and Alert Bay. There should be four modern classrooms with two Vocational Rooms and a large hall to accommodate the entire pupilage, which could be used for lectures, entertainments, etc., in addition.\n\nThe drainage system should be by six or eight inch pipes, as four inch pipes have been found to clog up and frequently require cleaning out and the cause of much inconvenience and expense.\n\nThere must be an engine workshop and manual training shop and space to build boats.\n\nThe heating should be by hot water operated by automatic oil burner or automatic coal stoker.\n\nAt least four fire escapes reaching to the ground should be provided.\n\nThe ....\nThe foregoing together with the existing arrangements in the more modern of our Residential Schools should guide the general planning of the proposed new school.\n\nCoastal points such as Ucluelet, Sechelt and Pachena Bay have been suggested as more suitable for the new school than Alberni but after examining all the information I could obtain, I am satisfied that the preponderance of argument is in favor of Alberni.\n\nI respectfully submit the following recommendations to best meet the educational requirements of the Protestant Indian pupilage of the West Coast Agency:\n\n(1) That a new Residential School to accommodate 150 pupils be built on the Departmentally owned property at Alberni and that in such construction the needs of the actual Coast Indian be kept in mind and provision made for greatly extended vocational training along lines which might be of use to the pupils on graduation.\n\n(2) That Ahousaht Residential School be abandoned as such, and such of its pupils as should attend a Residential school, be absorbed by the new Alberni Residential School.\n\n(3) That a new one room Indian Day School to accommodate 20 to 30 pupils be built at Ahousaht for those pupils now attending the Residential School who could, because of satisfactory home conditions, attend a day school.\n\nThe report on the School survey of the West Coast Agency by Capt. G. H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, in accordance with Departmental instructions dated March 9th, 1937, file 159-1-5, will be forwarded under separate cover at an early date.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, January 19, 1938.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nMay I refer to a letter sent forward to you from the Department, dated July 29, 1937, in which the suggestion was made that you should interview Mr. A. W. Neill, M.P., with respect to the rebuilding of the Alberni Residential School.\n\nThe Minister's office is anxious to be supplied with any information you may have, relating to this interview. They are anxious, also, to have your report and recommendations with respect to the rebuilding of this school, just as soon as you can conveniently send them forward. Your immediate attention to this matter will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nBox 8,\nVancouver, B. C.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, October 26, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Neill:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of October 18th, in which you point out certain advantages that are likely to accrue from the rebuilding of the Alberni Residential School on the old site at Alberni.\n\nI may state that a survey of educational facilities on the west coast of Vancouver Island has been undertaken by Inspector Barry, and my understanding is that Inspector Pragnell and Commissioner MacKay have also made an investigation. I have not yet received, however, Commissioner MacKay's official report, which will, no doubt, contain certain specific recommendations. In the absence of this report, no decision has been reached by the Department with respect to the rebuilding of the school to take the place of the one destroyed by fire nor has any particular site been given consideration by the officials here. It is unnecessary to add that the suggestions contained in your communication will be given careful consideration when the matter to which they relate comes up for review and decision.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n\nA. W. Neill, Esq., M. P.,\nAlberni,\nB. C.\nHouse of Commons\nAlberni, B. C.,\nCanada\n\nOctober 18th, 1937.\n\nDr. H. W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nThere has been a lot of discussion and correspondence re\nthe Indian Boarding School maintained at this point.\nSuggestions has been made that it be rebuilt at Sechart and\nUcluelet.\n\nSechart, which is the last place put forward, would in-\nvolve buying the site at an unknown price and starting from the\nbeginning and clearing land, bringing down water, and all the\nexpense that goes to starting a school where there are no\nfacilities whatever.\n\nAt Alberni you have got a farm that goes a long way to-\nwards providing the maintenance of the children and supplying\nthem with fruit, milk, meat and vegetables. Before a farm like\nthat could be developed at Sechart, if ever, the ground being\nunsuitable and steep, it would cost twenty to thirty thousand\ndollars. The farm here is mostly worked by the farm instructor\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nwith the aid of the boys, and the open air work is good for them.\n\nThere are doctors and a well equipped hospital within four miles of the Alberni school. If the school was put at Sechart it would mean a special trip for a doctor on every occasion, a distance on the round trip of about 40 to 50 miles, and of course the doctor could not make as frequent visits in case of say, an epidemic.\n\nIt is alleged Sechart would be more central. That is only the case on paper because pupils coming from Nitinat going to the Sechart school, while Sechart is nearer to Nitinat as the crow flies, it is really further away, would have to come on the steamer and the steamer calls at Alberni at least ten hours before it calls at Sechart. The steamer comes up the eastern channel and Sechart is on the western channel and the steamer only calls at the western channel after it has been up to Alberni and back again.\n\nI strongly recommend that the boarding school be built at Alberni.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA. W. Neill.\n\nAWN:MG\n\n[Signature]\n\n(over)\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, October 15, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a request for tuition grants sufficient to enable Eddie Klutesi and Willie Tatooch to proceed with their high school studies at the Alberni district high school.\n\nIt would appear that both these pupils have been in attendance at the high school during the last three years and have obtained very creditable marks. In view of this fact, the Department is sympathetically disposed to assist them in completing their high school studies.\n\nI am anxious to know what arrangements can be made to have these boys continue at high school. You might let me know the approximate cost of board, tuition fees, etc., and, if these appear to you to be reasonable, I am inclined to think the boys should be permitted to take up their studies at once. You might also let us know what your opinion is with respect to Charlie Klutesi. This boy has spent one year at high school and, according to our records, is 14 years old. It is just possible, in view of the lateness of the season, that this boy might be well advised to postpone his attendance at high school until next year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\nOttawa, October 15, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Pitts:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant and to state by way of comment that I am today communicating with the Indian Agent at Alberni, in the hope that arrangements can be made immediately to have the two boys on whose behalf you have written proceed with their high school studies.\n\nIn view of the fact that the high school has been open and in operation for a period of 6 weeks, it might be well to advise Charlie Klutesi to remain out of school for this year, on the understanding that his case can be reviewed at the opening of the academic year 1938-39.\n\nI note, in the last paragraph of your letter, your reference to the destruction of the Alberni Residential School by fire and your comments thereon. I may state by way of explanation that the destruction of the Alberni School, the payment of government grants, the care of the children and a number of other matters were very carefully reviewed by the officials of the Department, immediately following the fire.\n\nThe law and regulation governing the administration of residential schools do not permit the payment of per capita or other grants to any schools other than those actually in operation. It is my understanding that this law has been in force ever since residential schools were established. Any financial assistance, therefore, necessary to compensate the staff, could only be allowed by a special appropriation voted by Parliament on compassionate grounds. Unfortunately, the fire at Alberni was\n\nRev. F. E. Pitts, B. A.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nAlberni, B. C.\nnot an isolated case. Two residential schools have been destroyed by fire since I entered the Department in December last.\n\nI find it difficult to understand your reference to clothing for the children. Our records indicate that on March 2, 1937, the Indian Agent wired the Department, asking for authority to purchase clothing and shoes for the children who had been in attendance at the Alberni School, and he was authorized to make such purchases in a telegram dated Ottawa, March 8, 1937. Not only did we make provision for the purchase of clothing necessary for the children, but we also secured from the Indian Agent and the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia reports on the best ways and means of providing day school accommodation for at least a number of the pupils. On reviewing the case at this date I cannot think of anything we could have done other than what we did do without the special authority of Parliament.\n\nIt has occurred to me that the question of governmental assistance to residential schools where buildings are destroyed by fire is one that might very well be discussed with the Government by the representatives of the churches responsible for the operation of residential schools. I have learned from experience, however, that a great many matters such as this are seldom given any attention until fire takes place or some other disaster occurs, and, at that time it is usually discovered that the law governing such institutions is not sufficiently flexible to meet the demands created by the emergency. The result is that about all the officials are in a position to do is to express sympathy. I am not at the moment blaming anyone particularly for this condition. I am simply expressing the thoughts that have occurred to me since the receipt of your communication.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A.

attending any school, it would follow that there would be allowing for four deaths, an average of three pupils a year available for the Beginners' Class of such a Day School at Ahousaht Village as I have recommended.\n\nThere are some 10 Boys and 12 Girls at present attending the Ahousaht Indian Day School, who have been shown on another page as available for a Day School at Ahousaht.\n\nIt would therefore appear that a one room Indian Day School could accommodate the twenty to thirty pupils suitable for such a school in this village.\n\nThe saving in Per Capita Grant on these 22 children now at the Ahousaht Residential School would far more than pay for teaching and other services at the proposed Ahousaht Indian Day School.\n\nWithout going into exact figures it would appear that the saving would be over two thousand dollars a year.\nSchool Survey, West Coast Agency.\n\nList of Children of School Age and Under at Ucluelet:\n\n| Name of Father | Attending Ucluelet Indian Day School

There are some 30 children here of school age, though at least 9 are above 14 years of age.\n\nThese children are about 40 miles by water from Port Alberni.\n\nThey would be nearly 60 miles by water from Ahousaht. I understand that these Chiahts would not go to Ahousaht in any case as the Bands are ancient enemies.\n\nIt would appear that a Day School might be established on the Chiaht Reserve, but a glance at the numbers of children of under school age, about 25, would indicate that there would be only 3 to 4 for the Beginners Class yearly. I have not gone into this matter with the Indian Agent but may say that some of the children would be better off at a Residential School.\n**Nitinaht Band:**\n\n**List of Children of School Age and Under.**\n\n| Name          | Child Name | Age | Sex |\n|---------------|------------|-----|-----|\n| Simon Chester | Stanley    | 6   | B   |\n|               | Shirley    | 4   | G   |\n| Sam Campbell  | Bertha     | 10  | G   |\n| Gillette Chipps | Cecelia | 16  | G   |\n|               | Albert     | 3   | B   |\n|               | Josephine  | 2   | G   |\n| Mary Chipps   | Francis    | 6   | G   |\n| Nichol Cheater| Baby       | 1   | G   |\n| Morris Dick   | Ralph      | 13  | B   |\n|               | Hazel      | 10  | G   |\n|               | Mitchell   | 8   | B   |\n| David Dick    | Martin     | 15  | B   |\n| Joshua Edgar  | Joseph     | 14  | B   |\n| (Mrs Ralph)Edgar | Martin | 15  | B   |\n|               | Leonard    | 14  | B   |\n|               | Perry      | 13  | B   |\n|               | Effie      | 10  | G   |\n|               | Cyril      | 6   | B   |\n|               | Julia      | 8   | G   |\n| Peter Gray    | Albert     | 13  | B   |\n|               | Tommy      | 8   | B   |\n|               | Lucy       | 7   | G   |\n| Margaret      |            |     |     |\n| William Gibbs | Pearl      | 7   | G   |\n|               | Lee        |     |     |\n| Lorena        |            |     |     |\n| Harry Joseph  | Louie      | 15  | M   |\n|               | Cecelia    | 12  | G   |\n| Phillip Joseph| Herbert    | 4   | B   |\n| Thomas        |            | 1   | B   |\n| Ernest Johnson| Gladys     | 7   | G   |\n| Baby          |            | 2   | B   |\n| Robert Joseph | Baby       | 2   | G   |\n|               | Baby       | 1   | G   |\n| Frank Mighton | Jimmy      | 6   | B   |\n|               | Phillip    | 5   | B   |\n|               | George     | 2   | B   |\n| Wilfred Robinson| Douglas | 9   | B   |\n|               | Elizabeth  | 8   | G   |\n| T.

Some of the children from this Reserve go to Coqualeetza, and I would recommend that when establishing the new Residential School accommodate these pupils. The conditions at Coqualeetza are so different to those on the West Coast that the farming etc. learned at Coqualeetza will be of no use here.\n\nIt is in my opinion a very great mistake to take the Indian children out of their own environment and train them in a mode of life which they will certainly never follow. There must be some, even remote, connection between the life in the Indian Residential School and the future life on the Indian Reserve, if the children are to make any use of the training given.\n\nThere are about 37 children of school age on the Reserves near Clo-cose, with some 24 under school age. Had this place been easier to get to, and it been possible to keep all the children here, a Day School might have been established. In addition to some of the pupils being taken to Coqualeetza, no doubt for reasons satisfactory to the Indian Affairs Branch, others in the past were taught at the local Provincial Day School, I am informed.\nSchool Survey: West Coast Agency.\n\nUchucklesaht Band:\n\nList of Children of School Age and Under.\n\nCharlie JACKSON Amy 14 G\nFred GOOTES Clarence 14 B\nAmelia 18 G\nMary 11 G\n\nMartin GOOTES Allan 12 B Thelma 5 G\nSimon GOOTES Kelly 15 B\n\nJames R.

There are about 27 children of school age now without any school since the Albemar Indian Residential School was destroyed by fire.\nGeneral Remarks:\n\n1. The Indians who remain throughout the year in their own villages are for the most part the more destitute members of the population.\n\n2. The children of the above Indians could attend the day school located in the village, but for other reasons, home conditions, etc., are more often permitted to attend the Indian Residential Schools.\n\n3. The Indians with facilities to fish, boats and other equipment, are those best able to support their children under the usual day school system. These Indians are however away from their own villages for some part of each school year while engaged in the usual seasonal occupational migrations. Numbers are absent for a considerable part of the year.\n\n4. While all the better class Indians are not away from their villages for the whole of the school year, number are so absent from September to October while engaged in hop picking, from November to March attending to trap lines, and in May and June berry picking. From June to August few are in the villages. There is a general move to the fishing grounds early in June, and Indian Day Schools along the coast of B.C. are often closed about the middle of that month for want of pupils.\n\n5. At Ahousaht the whole of the Indians are only in the village from November to February, if then.\n\n6. In the West Coast Agency it may be taken for granted that at least seventy five per cent of the Indian parents do move from their own villages during some part of each school year.\n\n7. Should children from the same village be received as resident pupils and as day pupils in a combined Residential and Day School located in or near a village, there would be constant complaint from the parents, in that some of the children of the local Band were receiving more clothes and food than others.\n\n8. It is highly doubtful that the type of combined Residential and Day School mentioned in the letter from the Indian Affairs Branch under date of March 8th and No. 1591-5 would prove a success in any part of British Columbia where the population is so constantly on the move.\n\n9. Indians in British Columbia are certain to object when another family has been given something which they have not themselves received at the same time. Day school children attending any sort of combined Day and Residential School would most certainly have to be given a substantial noon meal at the school. I am aware that this is not being done in North Vancouver, but it would certainly be best here on the West Coast.\nGeneral Remarks Continued:\n\n10. Day pupils attending a combined Residential and Day School would need regular supervised baths in the school, and suitable school clothes. There would need to be as little difference as possible in the treatment of the day and residential pupils. A simple school uniform, as used in the B.C. private schools should be provided for day and residential pupils.\n\n11. A Residential School takes children away from objectionable home conditions which are fairly common on the West Coast. The home conditions at Ucluelet are in advance of those in other villages. The Day School there is a success, and few if any of the Ucluelet children should be permitted to attend an ordinary Indian Residential School, as many have been attending the Alberni Indian Residential School in the past.\n\n12. There are no lands in Indian villages on the West Coast suitable for farming and few gardens are even possible. The training of boys at an Indian Residential School in farming is a complete waste of effort. An Indian Residential School on the West Coast should eliminate farming. A large garden should be cultivated largely to provide fresh vegetables.\n\n13. The children at present residing in Residential Schools for Indians in the villages quite generally say they have been educated. The opposition of parents is not the actual reason why they have been at school. It is due to negative methods of learning at school, and is not due to the lack of interest shown by the care of the parents.\n\n14. Of the children attending school about half are of school age. A total of 100 pupils will attend the new school while the building is completed. It should be located near the central point along the coast.\n\n15. There are sufficient children in the village of Ahousant to justify the establishment of a new Day School as part of the while project.\nGeneral Remarks Continued.\n\n16. The Indian parents at Port Renfrew, Sarita (Banfield) and Clooose shown on the attached map would certainly object to send their children to a Residential School at Ahousaht owing to tribal animosity.\n\n17. The Indian Residential School at Ahousaht is in very bad repair as far as the main building is concerned. The class rooms are very small and the older one is so constructed that the water floods over the floor in times of heavy rain. About one quarter of the floor space was a great pool of water while I was inspecting there. No building with the exception of the new residence is worth retention at Ahousaht, and the general site is a particularly poor one for a Residential School.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nIt is recommended that a new Indian Day School of one room on the general plan of the Campbell River Indian Day School but somewhat larger be built at Ahousaht Indian Village. The school should be able to accommodate up to 35 pupils. It should be located on the high piece of rocky land in front of the Indian Village at Ahousaht. This site is on the sea, and has large village greens on each side, a path at the rear or village side, and the sea in front; and is an excellent site. It is of course on Indian Reserve, but it is likely that the Indians would like to have a new Day School here in their village.\n\nNo teacher accommodation should be provided in this proposed one-room school. The teacher should be a girl for preference, and live with the Missionary, possibly in the new residence built by the Department on the Woman's Missionary property just over a half mile from the Ahousaht village, and adjoining the present Ahousaht Indian Residential School. There is sufficient new lumber at the Ahousaht Residential School to provide a fine Day School in the village and the present classrooms (two) at the Residential School would provide desks and Blackboards, etc. These class rooms are too poor to be worth preserving. The main Ahousaht School Building is in such a poor state of repair that it will not last much longer than the time before or to which must elapse before a new Residential School can be constructed. The present Ahousaht Residential School site is hopeless for such a school from every point of view.\n\nAn improved Day School of four or five rooms with a basement and other accommodation as suggested in the letter from the Secretary of the Indian Affairs Branch dated March 9, 1937 is in my opinion quite impracticable either at Alberni, Ahousaht, or elsewhere on the British Columbia coast.\n\nThe whole of the above is submitted with respect and in the hope that my recommendations will be of assistance to the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch at Ottawa.\n\n31st January, 1938.\nGerald H.

This allows for some five deaths.\n\nThere are only 24 pupils at present on the roll of the Day School, but as nearly all these are quite young the numbers will increase rapidly year by year. Next year there should be about 30 and possibly 35 for the school year starting in September, 1936.\n\nFor no reason should pupils at Ucluelet be permitted to attend an Indian Residential School unless it be the direct and definite recommendation of the Indian Agent covering some unforeseen eventuality.\nSchool Survey: West Coast Agency.\n\nToquart Band:\nList of Children of School Age and Under\n\n| Name       | Age | Sex |\n|------------|-----|-----|\n| Cecil MACK |     |     |\n| Bernice    | 14 G| Baby|\n| Cuthbert   | 11 B|     |\n| Mack       | 10 B|     |\n| Douglas    | 9 B |     |\n| MACK       |     |     |\n| Carl       | 15 B|     |\n| Phillip MACK |   |     |\n| Ronnie     | 7 B |     |\n| Leonard    | 9 B |     |\n| Gertrude   | 2 G |     |\n| Kent       | 1 B |     |\n| Jimmy McKay|     |     |\n| Jimmy      | 8 B |     |\n| Marjorie   | 4 G |     |\n| Robin      | 6 B |     |\n| Norma      | 2 G |     |\n| Sam        | 1 B |     |\n| (Mrs J.)

Some of the children from this Reserve go to Coqualeetza, and I would recommend that when established the new Residential School accommodates these pupils, as conditions at Coqualeetza are so different to those on the West Coast that the farming etc., learned at Coqualeetza will be of no use here.\n\nIt is in my opinion a very great mistake to take the Indian children out of their own environment and train them in a mode of life which they will certainly never follow. There must be some, even remote, connection between the life in the Indian Residential School and the future life on the Indian Reserve, if the children are to make any use of the training given.\n\nThere are about 37 children of school age on the Reserves near Clo-oose, with some 24 under school age. Had this place been easier to get to, and it been possible to keep all the children here, a Day School might have been established. In addition to some of the pupils being taken to Coqualeetza, no doubt for reasons satisfactory to the Indian Affairs Branch, others in the past were taught at the local Provincial Day School, I am informed.\nSchool Survey: West Coast Agency.\n\nUchucklesaht Band:\n\nList of Children of School Age and Under.\n\nCharlie JACKSON Amy 14 G\nFred COOTES Clarence 14 B\nAmelia 12 G\nMary 11 G\nMartin COOTES Allan 12 B Thelma 5 G\nSimon COOTES Kelly 15 B\nJames R.

There are about 27 children of school age now without any school since the Alberni Indian Residential School was destroyed by fire.\nGeneral Remarks:\n\n1. The Indians who remain throughout the year in their own villages are for the most part the more destitute members of the population.\n\n2. The children of the above Indians could attend the day school located in the village, but for other reasons, home conditions, etc., are more often permitted to attend the Indian Residential Schools.\n\n3. The Indians with facilities to fish, boats and other equipment, are those best able to support their children under the usual day school system. These Indians are however away from their own villages for some part of each school year while engaged in the usual seasonal occupational migrations. Numbers are absent for a considerable part of the year.\n\n4. While all the better class Indians are not away from their villages for the whole of the school year, number are so absent from September to October while engaged in hop picking, from November to March attending to trap lines, and in May and June berry picking. From June to August few are in the villages. There is a general move to the fishing grounds early in June, and Indian Day Schools along the coast of B.C. are often closed about the middle of that month for want of pupils.\n\n5. At Ahousaht the whole of the Indians are only in the village from November to February, if then.\n\n6. In the West Coast Agency it may be taken for granted that at least seventy five per cent of the Indian parents do move from their own villages during some part of each school year.\n\n7. Should children from the same village be received as resident pupils and as day pupils in a combined Residential and Day School located in or near a village, there would be constant complaint from the parents, in that some of the children of the local Band were receiving more clothes and food than others.\n\n8. It is highly doubtful that the type of combined Residential and Day School mentioned in the letter from the Indian Affairs Branch under date of March 9th and No. 159-1-5 would prove a success in any part of British Columbia where the population is so constantly on the move.\n\n9. Indians in British Columbia are certain to object when another family has been given something which they have not themselves received at the same time. Day school children attending any sort of combined Day and Residential School would most certainly have to be given a substantial Noon meal at the school. I am aware that this is not being done in North Vancouver, but it would certainly be best here on the West Coast.\nGeneral Remarks Continued:\n\n10. Day pupils attending a combined Residential and Day School would need regular supervised baths in the school, and suitable school clothes. There would need to be as little difference as possible in the treatment of the day and residential pupils. A simple school uniform, as used in the B.C. private schools should be provided for day and residential pupils.\n\n11. A Residential School takes children away from objectionable home conditions which are fairly common on the West Coast. The home conditions at Ucluelet are in advance of those in other villages. The Day School there is a success, and few if any of the Ucluelet children should be permitted to attend an ordinary Indian Residential School, as many have been attending the Alberni Indian Residential School in the past.\n\n12. There are no lands in Indian villages on the West Coast suitable for farming and few gardens are even possible. The training of boys at an Indian Residential School in farming is a complete waste of effort. Any new Indian Residential School on the West Coast should eliminate farming entirely. A large garden should be cultivated largely to provide fresh vegetables.\n\n13. The children at present returning from Residential Schools find conditions in the villages quite different to those they have been accustomed to in school. The opposition of the older Indians, not the small parents of whom many have been at Residential School, tends to negative many of the high ideals learned at school. The failure here is not due to the school system as much as to the lack of a follow up system in the care of the young graduates.\n\n14. Of the children at present attending Ahousaht Indian Residential School a total of 10 Boys and 12 Girls might well attend a Day School in the village while the remaining 16 Boys and 16 Girls should be in Residential School at some central point along the West Coast.\n\n15. There are sufficient children in the village of ahousaht to make the establishment of a new Day School there a worthwhile project.\nGeneral Remarks Continued.\n\n16. The Indian parents at Port Renfrew, Sarita (Banfield) and Clooose shown on the attached map would certainly object to send their children to a Residential School at Ahousaht owing to tribal animosity.\n\n17. The Indian Residential School at Ahousaht is in very bad repair as far as the main building is concerned. The class rooms are very small and the older one is so constructed that the water floods over the floor in times of heavy rain. About one quarter of the floor space was a great pool of water while I was visiting there. No building with the exception of the new residence is worth retention at Ahousaht, and the general site is a particularly poor one for a Residential School.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nIt is recommended that a new Indian Day School of one room on the general plan of the Campbell River Indian Day School but somewhat larger be built at Ahousaht Indian Village. This School should be able to accommodate up to 35 pupils. It should be located on the high piece of rocky land in front of the Indian Village at Ahousaht. This site is on the sea, and has large village greens on each side, a path at the rear or village side, and the sea in front, and is an excellent site. It is of course on Indian Reserve, but it is likely that the Indians would like to have a new Day School here in their village.\n\nNo teacher accommodation should be provided in this proposed one room school. The teacher should be a girl for preference, and live with the Missionary, possibly in the new residence built by the Department on the Woman's Missionary property just over a half mile from the Ahousaht village, and adjoining the present Ahousaht Indian Residential School. There is sufficient new lumber at the Ahousaht Residential School to provide a fine Day School in the village and the present classrooms (two) at the Residential School would provide desks and Blackboards, etc. These class rooms are too poor to be worth preserving. The main Ahousaht School Building is in such a poor state of repair that it will not last much longer than five or six years or so which must elapse before a new Residential School can be constructed. The present Ahousaht Residential School site is hopeless for such a school from every point of view.\n\nAn improved Day School of four or five rooms with a basement and other accommodation as suggested in the letter from the Secretary of the Indian Affairs Branch dated March 9, 1937 is in my opinion quite impracticable either at Alberni, Ahousaht, or elsewhere on the British Columbia coast.\n\nThe whole of the above is submitted with respect and in the hope that my recommendations will be of assistance to the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch in Ottawa.\n\n31st January, 1938.\nGerald H.

Box 5,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, February 10, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe DEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nRe: Rebuilding of Alberni Residential School\n\nIn response to the request contained in Mr. Pratt's memorandum of January 31st, I am submitting herewith, for your consideration, certain comments on a report dated January 21, 1938, relating to the rebuilding of the Alberni Residential School, submitted to the Department by Mr. D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for British Columbia.\n\nCommissioner MacKay's report was submitted in response to instructions sent forward to him in departmental letter dated March 9, 1937.\n\nThe Alberni School, at the time of its destruction by fire (February 21, 1937) had a pupil enrolment of 115 and a per capita grant of $180.00 per annum was paid. Twenty-two of the pupils formerly enrolled at the residential school are now attending a day school at Alberni. This day school is conducted in one of the buildings that escaped destruction by fire. Seventeen are receiving instruction at the Ucluelet Day School and eight were placed in the residential school at Ahousaht. It is possible that, in addition to these, a number of the pupils enrolled at the beginning of the present academic year at Cocusaletza are pupils who were formerly enrolled at Alberni. It will thus be seen that provision has already been made...\nbeen made for a large number of the pupils.\n\nMay I point out that five residential schools have been destroyed by fire in recent years:\n\nCross Lake, Manitoba - February 25, 1930,\nQu'Appelle, Sask. - November 12, 1932,\nMacKay, Manitoba - March 13, 1932,\nGrouard, Alberta - January 13, 1937,\nAlberni B.C. - February 21, 1937.\n\nThe Lebret School has been rebuilt by the Government and the Grouard School by the Catholic Church authorities.\n\nNo provision has been made in the 1938-39 estimates for the building of residential schools. If it is decided that funds will be available in the 1939-40 estimates, my recommendation is that provision be made for the rebuilding of the Alberni Residential School. Consideration can be given in the meantime to the suitability of one or two Indian day schools or an improved Indian day school, to provide accommodation in northern Manitoba for pupils formerly enrolled at the MacKay school. I have already sent forward specific recommendations with respect to the rebuilding of the school at Cross Lake.\n\nCommissioner MacKay's recommendation, that the Ahousaht Residential School, with an enrolment at this date of 64, should be abandoned and a residential school with accommodation for 150 pupils built at Alberni, is based on a survey made by Inspector Barry, in which the statement is made that there are 150 Indian pupils on the west coast of Vancouver Island for whom education cannot be provided in Indian day schools. The Ahousaht School, from the standpoint of sanitation and fire hazard, should be abandoned at the earliest possible date. Inspector MacKay's recommendation, therefore, appears to be sound, in view of all the circumstances.\n\nA fully modern school of fireproof construction\nwith accommodation for 150 pupils would cost approximately $150,000. I concur in Commissioner MacKay's recommendation when he states that this school should be equipped with all the facilities necessary for vocational instruction.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, January 31st, 1938.\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nYou referred here a memorandum submitted by the Director of the Indian Affairs Branch enclosing copy of a report and certain recommendations submitted by Major MacKay with respect to the rebuilding of the Alberni Indian Residential School.

I am taking this matter up again because the School is full, and Mr. Caldwell has a number of requests from Agents to admit cases of necessity. I understand, for example, that there are three children from Mr. Ashbridge's agency, whose mother is waiting to go to the Coqualeetza Sanitarium as soon as she can get the children into school. She is a widow. I hope that it will be possible to have these children admitted and paid for.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MIT\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6431, File 877-1, part 4)\nOttawa, February 7, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, requesting an increase in the pupilage at the Alberni Indian Residential School. I think the best course for you to follow would be to present your request to the Minister's office on the occasion of your next visit to Ottawa.\n\nOn reviewing the quarterly return from this school, it appears that they have an enrolment considerably higher than the authorized pupilage. I am wondering if the school is able to adequately accommodate the number the Principal has at present in attendance. As this school is only using temporary classrooms, I am inclined to feel that it would be preferable to keep the enrolment to the authorized pupilage.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Director.\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2B, Ont.\nAttention of Mr. R.A. Hoey\n\nFebruary 20th,\n1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe - Per Capita Grant, Alberni School\n\nI have spoken to Mr. Jackson about this. He will confer with you. We find that the per capita for Alert Bay and Christie is $180.00 - for Alberni $170.00. Frankly, we cannot see why there should be any such difference. We think we should receive grant at the rate of $180.00 from October 1st, 1944, leaving the repayment of the amounts expended to take care of the previous months.\n\nWe hope this matter will be cared for.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6431, File 877-1, part 4)\nOttawa, March 16, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER.\n\nThis Branch is in receipt of a letter from Reverend George Dorey, D.D., Associate Secretary, Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, requesting that the per capita rate at the Alberni Residential School be increased from $170.00 to $180.00 per annum. I understand that Dr. Dorey also spoke to Mr. Jackson regarding this matter.\n\nThere has been no radical change in the basic per capita rate at Indian residential schools since 1931. At that time certain basic rates were established at all residential schools and the rate at the Alberni School was set at $170.00 per capita, while the rate at the Christie School, which is also on Vancouver Island but is more inaccessible, was placed at $180.00. Dr. Dorey has pointed out to me that while, geographically, Christie appears more inaccessible, as a matter of fact it costs the United Church practically the same rate to ship their supplies to Alberni. Taking everything into consideration, I would appreciate receiving the Minister's approval to increase the per capita rate at Alberni from $170.00 to $180.00 per annum, effective January 1, 1945.\n\nAt this time it might be interesting for you to have a review of the per capita structure at Indian residential schools. An Order-in-Council passed on October 22, 1892, authorized the per capita grant method of financing what is now known as \"Indian Residential Schools\". At that time per capita grants\nvaried from $60.00 to $145.00 and the average grant for the succeeding twenty years was $84.00.\n\nIn response to a request from the Churches for larger grants for residential schools, the Department in 1911 prepared a schedule by geographic divisions and types of buildings and a formal agreement was made between the Department and the management of the residential schools. This agreement was in effect from April 1, 1911, to April 1, 1916. The average grant during that period was $115.00.\n\nIn 1919 a bonus or flat increase of $10.00 on the basic rate was allowed all residential schools and in 1921 an additional $10.00, or a total bonus of $20.00, made the average rate for all residential schools in Canada $135.00. In 1924 this bonus was incorporated in the regular scale of grants. In January, 1926, there was another upward revision and an effort was made to deal more fairly with the small school, also the school remote from markets and the school where farming and other facilities were inadequate. This particular revision was continued for five years, and by 1931 the average per capita grant paid to Indian residential schools in Canada amounted to $172.00. Owing to economic conditions existing following the year 1930, the per capita rate was reduced by 10%, or, in other words, the average per capita grant in Canada for 1932-33 was approximately $155.00. A further 5% deduction was made during the years 1933-34 and 1934-35, bringing the average to $147.00.\n\nIn 1935-36 and subsequent years the 15% deduction was restored, bringing the average per capita rate back to the same as existed in 1931-32, namely approximately $172.00. As a result of representations made by the Churches co-operating with the Department in the operation of residential schools, a special payment of $10.00 per capita, over and above the regular per capita rate, was made for the calendar year 1942 and a similar amount for 1943. For the year 1944 this special allowance was increased to $15.00.\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa, March 26, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY.\n\nRe: Alberni Indian Residential School,\nNo. 877.\n\nPlease note that the Minister has approved increasing the per capita allowance at the above mentioned school from $170.00 a year to $180.00 a year, effective January 1, 1945. In memorandum of March 16, on File 159-1-1, this increase has been approved and signed by the Minister.\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa, March 28, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th ultimo, the Minister has approved increasing the per capita allowance at the Alberni Indian Residential School from $170.00 to $180.00 a year, effective January 1, 1945.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nActing Director.\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n239 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2B, Ont.\nOttawa, March 16, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER.\n\nThis Branch is in receipt of a letter from Reverend George Dorey, D.D., Associate Secretary, Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, requesting that the per capita rate at the Alberni Residential School be increased from $170.00 to $180.00 per annum.

Hoey, Esq., Acting Director of Indian Affairs, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Alberni Indian Residential School\n\nI beg to submit the following report on my investigation of conditions at the Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nYou will recall that in July last you requested me to endeavour to look into conditions at this school as soon as I could make the necessary arrangements. It is regretted that it has not been possible to get this information before you earlier owing to heavy demands on my time and the absence of Inspector Coleman from the office. I arranged for Dr. Hugh Morrison, Provincial Inspector of Schools for the Courtenay-Alberni area, to accompany me but he was unable to do so owing to provincial matters that required his attention. Dr. Morrison did, however, arrange to inspect the school shortly following my visit and his report is enclosed herewith.\n\nMr. Ashbridge accompanied me during my visits to the school and was very helpful in getting out information regarding the pupils, arranging meetings and providing transportation.\n\nThe Indians of the Sheshaht and Opetchesht Bands, having learned of my presence in Alberni, requested a meeting to discuss school matters. This was arranged by Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge in cooperation with Mr. Caldwell, who kindly allowed the use of the Residential School assembly hall for the purpose. Reference will be made to this meeting later on in this report.\n\nThe greater part of three days was spent at the school during which matters relating to the operation and administration of the institution were thoroughly discussed with Mr. Caldwell and a careful inspection made of every room in the building.\n\nPerhaps I should say at the outset that I went to Alberni feeling none too hopeful of finding conditions at the school satisfactory. Indeed, I fully expected to find little change from what I had known them to be during Mr. Scott's administration. It was most encouraging, therefore, to find evidence of considerable improvement in conditions generally. There is no doubt whatever that Mr. Caldwell has made a very commendable effort to bring the school in all its departments up to the standard expected by the Department. This is verified.\nby Dr. Morrison who made his investigation in cooperation with but entirely independent of that carried out by me.\n\nOrganization of staff\n\nIncluding the Principal there are twenty on the staff. The duties of each member and the salary received with board and lodging provided are as follows:\n\n| Name                  | Position                                      | Salary |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Mr. A.E.

Allen and Mr. L.C. Woollard have resigned.\n\nGeneral Conditions\n\nThe school throughout was clean, indeed cleaner than I had found it on any previous visit since its opening some years ago. The boys and girls playrooms, where one could reasonably expect some untidiness and litter on the floors, were in good shape. The same condition was found in the dormitories, wash rooms, dining room, kitchen and related rooms and the class-rooms. In fact everywhere throughout the school there was evidence of properly organized effort to effectively deal with the matter of keeping the school in a clean and proper condition. It was always a most disheartening and discouraging experience for me on visits to this institution to invariably find most of the rooms...\nused by the children in a dirty and untidy state and, despite earnest efforts on our part to have the principal improve matters, to see the same condition continue year after year.\n\nThe old day school building, now in use as a classroom, and the manual training shop were visited. Some painting was being done in the former to brighten the classroom which was much in need of this improvement. The Manual Training Instructor was in the process of organizing his work on the basis of Departmental requirements, and from the orderly appearance of the workshop and the program of practical instruction set out gave promise of making a worthwhile contribution in the division of the school. The facilities at present available for manual training are not satisfactory but should do until more adequate accommodation can be provided. When this happens, the existing building could be used exclusively for boat building.\n\nThere were 228 children in residence at the time of my visit. The per capita grant is allowed for 225. I doubt if the school could properly accommodate a larger number of pupils although the Principal suggested that it could. The dormitories did not appear crowded but I am satisfied that this condition would develop with a larger enrolment. Some ten children were sleeping on mattresses on the floor but this has been rectified as a result of the supply of new beds which were in order at the time. More new mattresses and bedding are needed.\n\nThe children were much better clothed than I found them on previous visits and much more responsive. They appeared happy and contented, due, no doubt, to better and more constant supervision and control, organized sports and keener interest on the part of the staff in their general well being.\n\nMeals and Dining Room\n\nThe organization for cooking and serving meals was quite satisfactory. The behaviour of the children at the tables was commendable. There was evidence of much better supervision and control in this respect than I found on previous occasions. An abundance of food of excellent quality is supplied and increasing attention given to the matter of nutrition in the preparation of menus.\n\nHealth Services\n\nApart from a small number of children in the infirmary for various minor ailments, the health of the children, at the time of my visit, was good. Miss McKenzie, who holds the position of school nurse, is not properly qualified professionally nor otherwise for the post and should be replaced as soon as a suitable registered nurse can be secured. Dr. C. Pitts of Port Alberni is the doctor required, but it is doubtful if it is possible for him, in view of the heavy demands on his time owing to a shortage of doctors in the community, to give the service that an institution this size should have. This situation should be remedied immediately normal conditions return.\nWater Supply\n\nThe water supply is secured from the municipal system of the city of Alberni. The quality is good and no doubt the supply is adequate for the normal needs of the school. Pressure has been reported quite low at times, too low to be of effective use in time of fire. It is understood that the city has under consideration the necessary improvements to meet this situation. The cost of water to the school has risen sharply since the first of the year as a result of the new rates established by the city. Should these rates be maintained it may be advisable to further explore the possibilities of securing a supply for both the Residential School and the local Reserve from Heath Creek or some other source.\n\nCensus of Children of School Age or Under Belonging to the Sheshahlt and Opetchesahlt Bands\n\n| Name of Parent | Names of Children | Church | Home Address | Home Conditions |\n|----------------|-------------------|--------|--------------|-----------------|\n| Henry Billy    | Larry Billy       | U.C.   | ?            | Fair            |\n|                | Loreen            |        | Living away  |                 |\n| Tommy Bill     | Tommy Bill        | U.C.   | Alberni      | Fair            |\n| Mrs. B.

in these two reserves there are 19 children of school age not attending any school.\n\nIt has been suggested from time to time that a day school should be provided to meet the needs of the children of the local reserves. It will be recalled that the attitude of\nthe Sheshaht Indians to the Residential School during a considerable part of Mr. Scott's administration was openly hostile. This situation has been somewhat composed since Mr. Caldwell took over, but is still far from satisfactory. The following solutions to meet the problem of the education of the children of the local reserves were put forward and carefully considered.\n\n1. Have children attend the Residential School.\n2. Have children attend the Residential School as day pupils and receive mid-day meal at the school.\n3. Provide a day school on the Opetchesah Reserve or at a point approximately midway between the two reserves, that is, Sheshaht and Opetchesah.\n\nWith reference to solution (1), our experience would not justify a continuation of this arrangement. It has not been successful. Solution (2) would involve mixing up the Residential School and Day School pupils, which is not desirable inasmuch as it would most certainly cause discontent amongst the former owing to the wide freedom enjoyed by Day School pupils in comparison with the restrictive character of Residential School life. Dr. Morrison, Mr. Ashbridge and the writer are agreed that solution (3) appears the best under the circumstances.\n\nThe Indians suggested that the old Church building on the Opetchesah Reserve could be repaired to meet our needs until such time as a new school could be built. I examined the building referred to by the Indians and concluded that it was too far gone to warrant the extensive repairs that would be necessary to put it in shape. The building has been unused for many years and appears to be on the verge of collapse. However, I instructed Mr. Ashbridge to secure a report from a competent builder on the condition of the building. The Agent's report in this connection has now come to hand and is to the effect that the building is beyond repair and should be torn down. Mr. Ashbridge is being asked to ascertain if there is any suitable accommodation in the locality that could be secured on a temporary basis for use as a classroom.\n\nJoint Meeting of the Sheshaht and Opetchesah Bands\n\nAs already stated the Indians of these Bands requested a meeting with the Commissioner to discuss school matters. The meeting was presided over by Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge and was orderly throughout. The particular matters which the Indians wished to discuss had to do with the following:\n\n(a) Visiting hours at the school.\n(b) Allowing children out of school to visit in Alberni and Port Alberni with their parents.\n(c) Use of the wash rooms on the girls' side.\n\nI found the regulations covering (a) and (b) quite reasonable and in line with those in force in other Residential Schools. The Indians were informed that these rules were designed to protect the health and general well-being of the pupils and, although some exception might be made because of unusual circumstances, any general relaxation of them could not be permitted. With respect to (c), it was disclosed that the use permitted of these wash rooms was altogether too limited and, in some cases, had resulted in the children having to go elsewhere to relieve themselves. I instructed the Principal to remove the existing restriction and permit the use of these facilities.\nconsistent with the needs of the children. It transpired that Mr. Caldwell was not familiar with the restrictions placed on the use of these wash rooms which had been imposed by the girls' matron, Mrs. Mackenzie, apparently without consulting him.\n\nThe question of establishing a day school to meet the needs of the local reserves was discussed at considerable length and resulted in the meeting unanimously declaring in favor of a day school being established on the Opetchesht Reserve or some suitable alternative site between the town of Alberni and the Residential School. There were twenty Indians eligible to vote present at the meeting, 16 from the Sheshaht Band and 4 from the Opetchesht Band.\n\nAdditional Accommodation Required\n\nIt will be observed from Dr. Morrison's report that he recommends the construction of a classroom wing with a minimum of seven classrooms to permit of full school days for Grades I to IV inclusive. If the school is to be operated on a full school day basis, and I think there is general agreement that it should, instead of the half day system as at present, no doubt seven classrooms would be necessary. In addition to classroom requirements, gymnasium and manual training accommodation should be provided. It might be possible to house all three in one building but this is a matter for the Department's architects to consider. I should be glad to further discuss this and other matters relating to this school during my forthcoming visit to the Department.\n\nD.M.

B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nPBA/AM\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nAlberni Residential Indian School. Date of visit:\nAlberni, B.C. Jan. 2, 3, 4, 5, 1945.\n\n1. GENERAL CONDITIONS\n\nInformation received from competent sources in and around this school indicate that there is a distinct improvement in the school's operation since the change in principalship last summer. The principal holds the respect and loyalty of his staff, and the children appear happy - a prime requisite if their individual characters are to be properly developed.\n\nThe most important point which impressed itself upon the mind of the inspector was the necessity of additional financial investment in this plant in order to make the present excellent building and equipment more effective in regards to returns for investment already made. In other words more investment must be made, if only to protect what is already invested. Much of the following report will substantiate this statement.\n\n(1) Present buildings.\n\nIn regards to sleeping, eating and general living conditions, the building provided is excellent. It is a three storied fire-proof attractive double winged building.\n\nProvisions for class-work are totally inadequate. Apparently three or four years ago this wing, newly completed, containing the class-rooms, was burned. Nothing has been done since to replace it with the result\nThere is an immediate necessity of some teachers' desks for some of the present staff.\n\n(2) Recreational facilities.\n\nPlaying space is rather limited, but plans are being made for extension. There is no gymnasium. This could very well be provided in the basement of the new class-room wing.\n\n(3) Cultural facilities.\n\nLibrary materials are meagre. The present principal and staff are to be complimented on what they have done since September to do away with the vacuum. In the new wing, space for a good library should be supplied. There is a lack of good supplementary reading materials. No use is made of school radio programmes. Films are shown every Saturday, and a National Film Board operator visits the school once a month.\n\n(4) Vocational education facilities.\n\nThe industrial educational shop is not very satisfactory for a school this size. As a result the programme appears to be inadequate.\n\nThere is a large barn, and some ground under cultivation. The grounds appear unsuitable for farm produce, as it is high and rocky. The loam on the floor of the river valley lies below the school. If some of this could be secured, the school could be brought close to self-sustenance, and vocational - agricultural programmes could be greatly enhanced.\n\n(5) Health services.\n\nThe services of medical practitioners from Port Alberni are used. An infirmary with an unqualified\nthere a maximum number of 225 set for grant purposes? Yet the school is handling around 280 children.\n\n(8) Education of children on adjoining reserve.\n\nIn regard to this question there appears to be only three solutions as follows:\n\n(a) Have the children from the adjoining reserve attend the residential school as day pupils.\n\n(b) Have the residential school children attend under supervision a specially built day school for children from the reserve.\n\n(c) Keep the residential and day schools distinctly apart.\n\nSolutions (a) and (b) would decidedly hamper the work of the residential school with its pupils. They are impractical. Solution (c) therefore, appears the best, especially as the day school should be built across the Somass River. On this side of the river, the Indian people are not itinerant, have steady employment in the mills in the Alberni District and as a consequence, maintain better homes than the itinerant Indians who live in the contiguous vicinity of the residential school.\n\n2. VOCATIONAL TRAINING.\n\nThe school's vocational training programme is very weak. This is due to several reasons, which include lack of properly qualified instructors, inadequacy of buildings and equipment, and a certain inertia which seems to have prevailed in the school's administration.\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nAlberni Residential Indian School.\n\nDate of visit: Jan. 2, 3, 4, 5, 1945.\n\nAlberni, B.C.\n\n1. GENERAL CONDITIONS\n\nInformation received from competent sources in and around this school indicate that there is a distinct improvement in the school's operation since the change in principalship last summer. The principal holds the respect and loyalty of his staff, and the children appear happy - a prime requisite if their individual characters are to be properly developed.\n\nThe most important point which impressed itself upon the mind of the inspector was the necessity of additional financial investment in this plant in order to make the present excellent building and equipment more effective in regards to returns for investment already made. In other words more investment must be made, if only to protect what is already invested. Much of the following report will substantiate this statement.\n\n(1) Present buildings.\n\nIn regards to sleeping, eating and general living conditions, the building provided is excellent. It is a three storied fire-proof attractive double winged building.\n\nProvisions for class-work are totally inadequate. Apparently three or four years ago this wing, newly completed, containing the class-rooms, was burned. Nothing has been done since to replace it with the result\nthat the present temporarily improvised class-rooms are overcrowded, and the children above Grade I are receiving only half-time education. Forty of the forty-seven children in Grade I are crowded into a room 18' x 36', intended originally as a sewing room. There is no room for the other seven children, so they are, of necessity, classed as kindergarten and put under the charge of a senior pupil - which is, of course, entirely unsatisfactory to all parties concerned.\n\nGrades 4 and 5 are taught in the auditorium (one-half time to each class), and Grades 2 and 3 are taught in an adjacent frame school structure. This is fairly satisfactory, although cloak-room space and a large stove should be provided. Grades 6, 7, 8 are held in a room which is about the same size as the Grade I room.\n\nIt is quite evident that the building of a wing containing the rooms necessary for educational purposes is imperatively and immediately necessary. In order to give an adequate and modern school program, permitting full school days for Grades I to IV inclusive, at least seven teachers, allotted as follows, will be required. (This estimate is based on the present school enrollment, which four teachers are endeavouring to handle).\n\n| Grade   | Teachers |\n|---------|----------|\n| Grade I A | 1 teacher |\n| Grade I B | 1 teacher |\n| Grade II  | 1 teacher |\n| Grade III | 1 teacher |\n| Grade IV  | 1 teacher |\n| Grades V, VI | 1 teacher |\n| Grades VII, VIII | 1 teacher |\n\nSeven class-rooms, then, as a minimum are required.\nThere is an immediate necessity of some teachers' desks for some of the present staff.\n\n(2) Recreational facilities.\n\nPlaying space is rather limited, but plans are being made for extension. There is no gymnasium. This could very well be provided in the basement of the new class-room wing.\n\n(3) Cultural facilities.\n\nLibrary materials are meagre. The present principal and staff are to be complimented on what they have done since September to do away with the vacuum. In the new wing, space for a good library should be supplied. There is a lack of good supplementary reading materials.\n\nNo use is made of school radio programmes. Films are shown every Saturday, and a National Film Board operator visits the school once a month.\n\n(4) Vocational education facilities.\n\nThe industrial educational shop is not very satisfactory for a school this size. As a result the programme appears to be inadequate.\n\nThere is a large barn, and some ground under cultivation. The grounds appear unsuitable for farm produce, as it is high and rocky. The loam on the floor of the river valley lies below the school. If some of this could be secured, the school could be brought close to self-sustenance, and vocational - agricultural programmes could be greatly enhanced.\n\n(5) Health services.\n\nThe services of medical practitioners from Port Alberni are used. An infirmary with an unqualified\nnurse in charge is maintained. Effective X-ray work is being done. However, the work could be more effective if a qualified nurse were in charge.\n\n(6) Organization of Staff.\n\nIncluding the principal there are twenty on the staff. In regard to nature of duties it may be divided into three parts, viz:\n\n(a) Professional and secretarial\n\n(b) Supervisory.\n\n(c) Maintenance.\n\nAs already indicated in this report the professional part of the staff is understaffed. Instructional qualifications of members in the supervisory part are inadequate, if some real vocational training is to be attempted. It is realized, however, that this is a difficult problem to solve during present abnormal wartime conditions. There should be an assistant principal, who should either be the professional head of school instruction, or the chief supervisor, preferably the latter if properly qualified. The senior room teacher should be given full responsibility for operating the school. He or she should be thoroughly qualified and conversant with modern teaching techniques. In order to obtain such a person a better salary than is at present paid the senior room teacher will have to be offered.\n\n(7) Financial Grants.\n\nThere should be a thorough investigation into the question of the adequacy of the present per-pupil grant to this school. It appears quite low. Why is\nthere a maximum number of 225 set for grant purposes? Yet the school is handling around 280 children.\n\n(8) Education of children on adjoining reserve.\n\nIn regard to this question there appears to be only three solutions as follows:\n\n(a) Have the children from the adjoining reserve attend the residential school as day pupils.\n\n(b) Have the residential school children attend under supervision a specially built day school for children from the reserve.\n\n(c) Keep the residential and day schools distinctly apart.\n\nSolutions (a) and (b) would decidedly hamper the work of the residential school with its pupils. They are impractical. Solution (c) therefore, appears the best, especially as the day school should be built across the Somass River. On this side of the river, the Indian people are not itinerant, have steady employment in the mills in the Alberni District and as a consequence, maintain better homes than the itinerant Indians who live in the contiguous vicinity of the residential school.\n\n2. VOCATIONAL TRAINING.\n\nThe school's vocational training programme is very weak. This is due to several reasons, which include lack of properly qualified instructors, inadequacy of buildings and equipment, and a certain inertia which seems to have prevailed in the school's administration.\nuntil the appointment of the new principal. Because of the above reasons, the present programme is really more of a plant maintenance one than a training one.\n\nAt the present time not much can be done about securing highly qualified vocational instructors, who have the ability of planning and using the pupils' time to the best advantage in both a vocational and plant maintenance sense. The third reason, i.e., administrative inertia, is now a thing of the past. The present local administration has some very good and practical plans. They should get the fullest Departmental support, consistent with practicality. This will lead to the rectification of the second reason, i.e., lack of proper building and equipment. If possible the farm should be moved to the lower river flats; a general shop, as well as a woodworking shop, should be installed, so that various household maintenance arts, such as electrical repairing and sewing, may be taught. Boat building, and trades appertaining to the fishing industry should be taught. House construction and allied building trades should be taught. At the present time there appears to be little vocational training for the girls, except large scale cooking (quite unnatural for most), some sewing, mending and laundering. A graduate nurse could teach some home nursing.\n\nIndeed in the residential schools there is a splendid opportunity for the giving of worthwhile vocational training, if the supervisory staff is qualified, and if there is adequate equipment. Under the circumstances the present supervisory staff is doing very well.\nbut more money must be spent on the supervisory staff and on equipment in order to secure better and more intelligent results.\n\n3. FIRE PROTECTION.\n\nThis is a fully fire-proof building. All fire exits are lighted red on each floor. Fire extinguishers are placed outside the dormitories. There are fire gongs on each floor. There are no fire escapes on the exteriors.\n\n4. DORMITORIES.\n\nAll dormitories are clean, tidy and well ventilated. There are all told ten; five boys and five girls. Each accommodate from twenty-two to twenty-five children. One set of lavatories and bathroom serves two dormitories. In the bathroom there are two baths, and four showers, and in the washroom, six toilets and twelve wash basins. This toilet and washing accommodation is of excellent quality, but only fairly adequate, especially as the children must arise and go to bed all at the same time.\n\n5. MEALS AND DINING ROOM.\n\nDining rooms and kitchens are all very sanitary and clean. The dining room for the children is slightly crowded. In order to alleviate this situation, the principal's suggestion that the present staff dining room be given over to the senior pupils is a good one. This is based, of course, upon the proviso that accommodation elsewhere be found for the staff.\n\nThe cooking and serving of meals are well organized. The behaviour of the children at the tables is very\ncommendable, and correct table and eating habits are being successfully inculcated.\n\nThe food served is of excellent quality, and abundant. A study of daily menus for the past year indicated that the nutritional content is very high for an institution of this time. Sincere attempts are being made - and successfully in the summer - to meet Canada's nutritional requirements; In these days of high prices for greens it is pleasing to note that this institution does, I believe, better than the average Canadian family in meeting nutritional standards.\n\n6. WATER SUPPLY.\n\nWater supply is fully modern, and, I presume, is certified by public health authorities.\n\nH. M. Morrison,\nInspector of Schools.\n\nCourtenay, B.C.\nJanuary 16, 1945.\nOttawa, April 25, 1945.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nAs you are aware, the basic per capita rate at the Alberni Indian Residential School has been $170 per pupil. Recently, the authorities of the United Church of Canada made representations to the effect that they should be allowed the same basic rate as paid at Christie and Alert Bay schools. After giving the matter some consideration, the Department agreed to their request, and from January 1, 1945, the basic per capita rate at Alberni is $180.00 per pupil.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nBoard of Home Missions\nThe United Church of Canada\n299 Queen St. West\nToronto 2 B, Ontario\n\nAttention of Mr. R.A.

In addition, we have reviewed the cubic air space in the dormitories and it is found that, with an enrolment of 225, the air space is less than we consider it should be, namely: 500 cubic feet per pupil. Additional pupils to the number you mention would still further decrease the air space in the dormitories per pupil and, we are inclined to feel, would overtax some of the other facilities in the school.\n\nWith the above in mind, we are not prepared to favourably consider your request at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A.

Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nRe: Authorised Increase of Pupilage.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSome time ago Dr. Dorey took up with the Department the question of increasing the authorised pupilage of this school. The reply of the Department to the request suggested that consideration would be given providing it involved the admittance of pupils in necessitous circumstances. Such was the reason for the original request.\n\nSo many more applications are made than we could possibly provide accommodation for that parents are in all cases advised to make application through the Indian Agent. However, during the year, applications arising from necessitous circumstances are received from both Indian Agents and parents. I will quote from a few now before me:\n\nWest Coast Agency: Three children, no father, mother awaiting admittance to Coqualeetza Band.\n\nCowichan Agency: Boy and Girl, in close contact with I.B., Boy, Mother dead, Father away from home a lot. \"Left to the care and tender mercies of the other members of the Band, none of which are 'the best'.\"\n\nBella Coola: Girl, 11 years, badly treated at home by stepfather who makes a slave out of the girl. \"This boy's father is dead.\"\n\nTwo children... lost their mother last year, Father away a great deal. Girl, 14, running wild when Father is away at work.\n\nFrom Parents direct:\nKincolith, B.C.: Seven children, no mother, application for boy, 14 years... \"This is the first child he ever went to go to school.\"\n\nKincolith, B.C.: Three children, no teacher for two years.\n\nThese are a few of the more necessitous requests. There are many others giving cause as lack of day school, or parents away at canneries or war work. This situation will probably adjust itself under post war conditions.\n\nThe maximum pupilage allowed for this school is 235. Dec. 1944 quarter shows average attendance of 226.60. March, 226.03. I have already advised the Cowichan agent to send in two children for whom he made a special appeal. The school could accommodate at least twelve pupils more than the present maximum and it is requested that the grant earning pupilage be increased by that number.\n\nTo complete the pupil situation, only 3 boys and four girls will be graduating this term. Three parents have made request for continuance of their children into High School, and this request will later be submitted with recommendation. I am not anticipating any reduction of attendance through absenteeism, as heretofore. It is apparent that many applications for next term cannot be considered.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Pupils appear to be more happy than formerly, and better progress is apparent.\n\nDormitories, class rooms, kitchens and playroom are all well kept and clean. Passages, storerooms, and outbuildings are also clean and tidy. Domestic water supply system was inspected and a serious leak discovered and remedied.\n\nSchool is now closed for Summer holidays and preparations being made for redecorating and necessary repair work.\n\nP.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nMr. Phillip Phelan  \nChief, Training Division,  \nIndian Affairs Branch,  \nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI wish to thank you for your two letters dated April 25th advising me that the Department had given consideration to the matters of increasing the maximum pupilage and also the acquiring of farm lands. In regard to the former, I may say that I had not thought our dormitory space was fully occupied as there seems so much room for the pupils. Perhaps that is because the dormitories are so high and airy. I presume there would be no objection raised to the few that we have over the present complement.\n\nI received an urgent request recently from Mr. Ball, of Vancouver, in respect to three children who are apparently stranded at a Steveston cannery. Their mother must go to the Coqualeetza San. at once. I wrote him to send them over. There is only a short time now before the summer vacation and I presume the children in question will be kept here during the summer. I have written to all the Indian Agents re the absences of this term now on the register. If any number of these return next term I will not have room for any new pupils.\n\nI may mention that, at Norway House, where the Medical Officer wished to enter some pupils in necessitous cases whose entry brought our pupilage over the maximum, special arrangements were made with the Medical Services branch to help to cover the expense of the care of these pupils without thereby increasing the grant-earning pupil quota. Would some such arrangement here be possible, where necessitous cases are admitted during the term, after the school complement is reached?\n\nAs to the matter of farm lands, I think there has been some misunderstanding. I had not thought to have the Department invest funds in farm land at this time. It is true that we do need more land. The present farm lands can never be made to pay. Considerable expense in survey has been made by the Department of Transport on the Somass Dairy Farm adjoining us, which has probably the best farm land on Vancouver Island. The survey is for the purpose of establishing a commercial airport there. Part of this airport would be on land owned by the large lumber mill operators, Blosdel, Stewart and Welsh. I am told that the Government engineers have recommended this site. It is unlikely that the landing strip...\nwould be sold separate from the rest of the farm therefore there is a probability that the Department of Transport would become possessed of the whole farm. In this event, I had thought, the school could lease the remaining farm from the Government, or in some such way acquire the use of it.\n\nI may say that the owner of the Dairy Farm, Mr. Christie, has sold his equipment, that is, the ice cream making machinery, the pasteurizing plant and the dairy routes, to a local co-operative Company. He is a wealthy man and wishes to retire. He wanted the school to take over his 50 odd head of dairy cattle and the farm on half shares, but the proposition was too large for me to entertain; and, also, it is not my wish to operate any farm for commercial purposes in connection with the school. However, I did undertake to seed about twenty acres of the land for Mr. Christie for a half share of the crop. This is now being done without any additional expense to the school in labour, seed, or equipment. The results this fall should at least show no loss on our farm operations (as compared with a 50% loss last year) and may, in addition to providing the school with a full supply of farm produce, which has not been done hitherto, show a profit on operational costs.\n\nThe only other alternative to the undertaking of larger farming operation of the nature mentioned above was to stop all farming operations in connection with the school in order to wipe out the operating deficit. This would mean that we could not even grow root crops, for the land must have barn fertilizer, which necessitates the keeping of cattle.\n\nI hope that this will explain my letter to Mr. Allan from whom I thought I might be able to obtain information as to what the intentions of the Department of Transport was in regard to the Somass Farm. This farm could be such an asset to the school that I hope the Department will not lose sight of the possibility of acquiring it for the school in some way in the future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPrincipal.\n\nI may add that farm operation is not valueless from a vocational training point of view. A number of our pupils come from the Fraser Valley and the Hazelton district, where the Indian people engage in farming.\nThe United Church of Canada\nBritish Columbia Conference\n\nREV. W. P.

Indian Arts and Crafts Society at an exhibition held in the West Coast capital recently. The exhibition was open to all Indian school children in British Columbia.\n\nFive feet tall, with an attractive bronzed complexion, Judith is quiet and reserved. She has poise and a perfectly natural ease with strangers, but is reluctant to talk about herself.\n\nShe belongs to the proud Tsimshian tribe who inhabit the Skeena river on the B.C. mainland, about sixteen miles south of Prince Rupert. She has three sisters and eight brothers. Two of her brothers, Kelly and Raymond, fought in the war, the latter having been killed. Her brother Raymond, she says, was a skilled wood carver until he was seriously injured in the arm when his tank blew up.\n\nJudith was brought up in accordance with the ancient traditions of her people, a famous fighting tribe. She was initiated into the secret tribal societies and was taught native tribal ritual and dances at a very early age.\n\nBut her parents found the education facilities were inadequate on the Skeena Indian reserve and sent her to Albert four years ago to continue her studies. She has just completed her ninth year in school.\n\nWhen an art class was formed at the school last December under George Sinclair, a well known Victoria painter, Judith from the outset showed exceptional talent. Within six months she had outstripped her classmates, and was producing paintings fit for an art gallery. Even before her work came into public notice, people were offering her up to $100 for her works. She has refused the offers on the advice of her instructors.\n\nJudith says she got a surprise when informed she had won the scholarship. She never hoped to be able to hold her own against scores of competitors from all parts of the province. Now greatly encouraged, she wants to continue with her work and to paint Indian scenes and the legends of her people.\n\nSince Judith has come into public notice, she has met some of the best professional painters in British Columbia. Her paintings, along with others are on exhibition in Vancouver.\n\nHer teacher, George Sinclair, considered hard to please, described his pupil as \"a girl exceptionally talented and who has shown great promise.\"\n\nHe admits, however, at first he was afraid that his pupil's success might go to her head.\n\n\"But I had no reason to be afraid,\" he says, \"she is a level-headed girl and will go far with her work.\"\n\nArthur Pickering, one of the best known ethnologists in the province, and who has one of the largest private Indian collections in Canada, said she was a discovery.\n\n\"West Coast Indians are artistically gifted,\" he commented. \"She undoubtedly the forerunner of many others who are to follow.\"\nClose Indian School\nPORT ALBERNI, June 17.\u2014A. E. Caldwell, principal, presided at closing exercises of Alberni Indian School. Prizes for scholastic and athletic ability were awarded by Rev. J. G. G. Bompas and Constable J. M. Green, Provincial Police.\n\nVictoria Colonist\nJune 18, 1947\n17-Year-Old Girl Wins Art Scholarship\n\nA soft spoken girl with an attractive browned complexion is being recognized today by prominent artists and art critics as a first-class artist. She is 17-year-old Judith Phyllis Morgan, a native girl, who has spent eight months and had never held a paint brush in her hands.\n\nThe Indian girl, who attends school in Prince Rupert, was the first member of her race to win the $150 scholarship offered by the British Columbia Welfare Society at an exhibition held here last week. The prize was open to all Indian school children in British Columbia.\n\nJudith was selected to attend the city to study native designs and carvings from the big Indian collection in the Provincial Museum. Five feet tall, dark and pretty, Judith is a shy girl, but relaxed. She is perfectly at ease with strangers.\n\nShe belongs to the proud Tsimshian tribe of the Skeena River, 16 miles south of Prince Rupert. She has three sisters and eight brothers. Two of her brothers served in the army. One died in the war, the latter was seriously wounded in Sicily.\n\nJudith was brought up in accordance with the strict traditions of her people. From childhood she saw the tribal dances and ceremonies of her people. She was taught the legends and history of her tribe.\n\nFirst United Church Names Army Veteran As New Organist\n\nExceptional Talent\n\nWhen an art class was formed at the school last December under George Sinclair, a well-known Victorian artist, Judith from the outset showed exceptional talent. Her instructor quickly observed how well suited her imagination and keen sense of proportion took her in hand.\n\nFrom then on Judith made rapid strides. Within a few months she had outstripped her classmates, and was producing paintings little less than gallery worthy when she came into public notice people were offering close prices for her work. She wisely refused at the request of her instructor.\n\nAlthough the Indian girl has been warned by some of her close friends that she should not go on in becoming an artist and wants to paint Indian scenes and other records of her people on canvas.\n\nIn this respect she has the strong support of Mr. Sinclair who describes his pupil as exceptionally talented and a great promise.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Enclosed is a memorandum from Inspector Davey which explains the reason for the operation of the school on this system and also the way in which beginners are employed when not in class.\n\nfor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTo: Indian Commissioner\nfrom: School Inspector\n\nAs requested by you I investigated the operation of the half-day system at the Alberni residential School on the occasion of my visit during the latter part of the week of April 16th to 19th.\n\nAs you are aware, shortly after the new school was erected at Alberni the class-room block burned down which gave rise to a number of problems, one of which was the accommodation of pupils in class-rooms. For some time now the Principal has accommodated these pupils by erecting temporary partitions in the auditorium and by using some small rooms which were designed for other purposes. Even with this arrangement it was impossible to provide for the pupils on a full time basis. However, the new class-room block is now nearly completed and there is no doubt that it will be in operation for the new term beginning in September.\n\nWhile the beginners are not in the class-room they are permitted to play either in the playrooms or out on the grounds, weather permitting. This play period is supervised by one of the members of the staff and it appears to be the best possible arrangement for these pupils during that time.\n\nIn connection with the new class-room block, I may say at this time that it is unfortunate that the building contains only four class-rooms and I would suggest that one of the rooms in the basement be fitted out and equipped for use as a class-room. This will make it possible for the Principal to accommodate the majority of his 230 pupils on a full time basis, although the classes even then would be quite large. I have already discussed this suggestion with the Principal and he agrees that this could be suitably arranged.\n\nYou may be interested in the attached picture which I took on the occasion of my visit. This shows the present stage of completion of the new class-room block.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nDistrict Inspector of Schools.\n\nRFD/mh\nOttawa, March 25th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. Mackay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nEnclosed is a copy of a letter from the Principal of the Alberni School, and I would appreciate it if you would bring this letter to the attention of Inspector Davey.\n\nWe were not aware previously that the whole school is operating on the half day system. What do the beginners do the other half day?\n\nWhen Inspector Davey has a chance to visit this school please have him look into the matter and let us have a report.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr. A.J. Doucet,\nTraining Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing the February Manual Return with a statement of the time allotted to woodworking. The pupil personnel of the classes change from month to month as some pupils are allotted to farm work, some to boiler room work with the engineer, and others to gardening during the season.\n\nWe are, of course, operating on the half-day class-room system in all grades. Pupils attend class-room in the morning for one month and in the afternoon for the next month. I hope soon to change this, when finances permit the employment of more teaching staff, so that all junior pupils, at least to grade three and perhaps to grade four, will receive full time class-room instruction.\n\nOur new class-rooms may be ready for occupation before the end of this term. Then we will have, I hope, a more suitable manual training room in the basement of the class-rooms with better equipment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 29, 1946.\n\nMajor D.M.

Box 70,\nVancouver, British Columbia.\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, enclosing copy of a resolution adapted by the\nBritish Columbia convention of the United Church of Canada.\n\nIt is not possible to consider increasing the Per Capita Grant at the Alberni Residential\nSchool at the present time.\n\nWe are prepared to consider increasing the salary of any qualified teacher in an Indian School,\nin order to bring such a teacher on a parity with those employed in the neighbouring white schools.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI enclose herewith the Rev. W. P. Bunt's letter of the 1st inst. advising of a resolution adopted at a recent annual conference requesting an increase of the grant to Alberni Residential School to enable it to increase the salaries of its teachers, also for a review of the salaries paid to teachers of Indian Day schools.\n\nThe first part of the resolution has been dealt with in my letter of today forwarding the Inspector's report on Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nWith regard to the second clause it will be noted that my acknowledgment (copy enclosed) to Mr. Bunt raises the question of whether they intended to consider only those teachers whose ability was on a parity with the average Provincial school teacher. My recent experience indicates that some persons nominated by the Church for teaching positions were entirely unsuitable for the work with little, if any, professional or other qualifications, and that these were being paid a salary at least equal to that of Provincial teachers of comparable rural schools. On the other hand, we have one or two outstanding and devoted teachers, such as Miss Phillips at Bella Bella.\n\nIf a School Inspector is appointed he could make a survey of the situation and recommendations, which I am confident would indicate the necessity of replacing several nominees of the Protestant churches and possibly one or two others.\n\nFor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nJUN 19 1946\n\nIndian Affairs.

George Dorey, D.D.\nTORONTO, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Dorey,\n\nI am enclosing a letter I have received from the Manager of the Bank of Montreal which carries our account. Mr. Wylie spoke to me about the increasing overdraft. He is not, of course, worried about the account, but only about the irregularity of permitting a $7000.00 plus overdraft where the authorization is only for $4000.00. You will remember that this matter came up before when I first took over. The prospects then, however, were that the overdraft could be reduced. This was done, down to the approximate amount of $3000.00 at one time. The situation now has changed, however, and I see no prospect of anything but ever increasing expenditure if the present price and wage trend continues.\n\nThe overdraft for January is $6221.00, with a total adverse Cash Book balance of $7425.00. January accounts and salaries are still to be paid (on February 15th, when the remittance advance of $4000.00 is received). This will approximate $6000.00. The arrears of revenue due to the school amount to $1500.00, leaving an overall deficit of some $11,000.00, bringing us back to where we were three and one-half years ago.\n\nFirst, there is the absolute necessity of increased Government revenue. Procrastination should no longer be tolerated. Also, the Government should either assume definite responsibility for the deficit to date, either by payment of the deficit or satisfying the carrying banks that it is a Government responsibility. In the meantime it is necessary that the Principal should have authorization to incur an overdraft to the amount of his expenditure under the present and prospective operating cost..... to what amount I cannot estimate, but I would say the authorization should be for $10,000.00. I still suggest that the expenditure over revenue should be carried as a deficit and Bank overdraft. Subsidization by the Church in the reduction of deficit or the augmentation of current revenue would simply encourage the Government to continue its policy of evading its Indian education responsibilities.\n\nFurther, may I suggest that the deferring of proper action on the part of the Government and the Church in dealing promptly and decisively with the matter of school finance tends to debase the functional value of the school personnel. I have already lost one of the best Boys' Supervisors in the educational system, a man who has made this work a vocation, because of lack of opportunity and security afforded in employment by the school. There is no inducement given to the teachers to continue employment in a residential school. They are sacrificing salary, experience scale increases and superannuation by teaching in a residential school. It might be noted here that teachers in all the Alberni Public Schools have this week been awarded an\nI have been fortunate in obtaining a very good slate of teachers this term, but I cannot hope to engage them for another year. We must be able to offer teachers inducements at least the equal of the Public Schools, otherwise we must put up with the left-overs (if there are any) to the detriment of our standard of teaching.\n\nAlso there is the functional value of the Principal to consider. No Principal could be expected to continue to give efficient attention to all the many duties that make for the efficient operation of an institution such as Alberni School, and carry, at the same time, the constant burden of ever increasing debt, about which one can do nothing and of which there is no end in sight.\n\nSurely the Churches ought to be able to impress the urgency of the emergency on the Government, so that immediate action can be taken. It is absolutely useless for the Government or the Church to counsel retrenchment or economy. This has been practiced to the limit beyond which we cannot go. It is false economy, and functional suicide, to attempt further economy in food. The late Principal of the Alert Bay School foolishly tried this experiment at the beginning of this term, resulting in his resignation, and a loss in prestige of that school with the Indian people from which it will take them a long time to recover. Salaries must be held down, at the cost of operating with a mediocre staff. The present supply situation in clothing, boots and shoes, soaps, and in practically every necessary line, is such that we cannot bargain or question either price or quality.\n\nI will note some comparative costs as of January 1947 and January 1948:\n\n| Item          | 1947          | 1948          |\n|---------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Meats and Butter | $624.02      | $661.86      |\n| Groceries     | $505.63      | $582.40      |\n| Coal          | $305.60      | $542.30      |\n\nDry Goods cannot be compared, as we are now replenishing supplies not obtainable a year ago. However, the Dry Goods account for January of this year is $1104.56, and the Boots and Shoes account $575.16. It can also be noted that stocker coal, which cost us $12.20 per ton a year ago ($9.45 per ton two years ago) is now $19.50 per ton. May I say also that in the matter of food and fuel our consumption quantity has not been increased.\n\nWill you please attend to the matter of the Bank letter as soon as possible? Further than that, I would at least like to be assured that the condition of the finances of this school, and the deficit, is approved by the United Church as far as the efforts of the Principal is concerned... or, of course, should a contrary viewpoint be taken, I would like to be advised.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) A. E. Caldwell\nPrincipal.\n\nI enclose Financial Statements for the Dec. quarter and the month of January. All accounts are paid with the exception of Fuel and Clothing. I am holding a carry-over in the fuel account of $1092.30 as at the end of January, and in the Drygoods account $982.36. These accounts continue in good standing.\nBANK OF MONTREAL,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nFebruary 3, 1948\n\nA. E. Caldwell, Esq.,\nPrincipal, Alberni Indian Residential School,\nAlberni, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Caldwell:\n\nOverdrafts in the school account have been gradually increasing and the high point in December was $5721, in January $6221, and at present time $7,181 with approximately ten days before you receive your next cheque. It is therefore reasonable to expect that this total will be in somewhat larger figures before this cheque arrives.\n\nThe Executive meeting of Board of Home Missions of United Church of Canada, on 6th of June 1944, authorized you to borrow by way of overdraft up to but not exceeding four thousand dollars. Owing to increased cost of operation it is now apparently impossible for you to finance within this amount and in order to put the account on a proper basis we should now be furnished with a new authority authorizing the operation of the account within an amount which you consider will enable you to finance.\n\nWe should be glad if this matter could be attended to without delay and a new authority in increased amount furnished under seal from the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) A. H. Wylie,\nManager.\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI enclose copy of a letter which I am sending to the Minister today.\n\nI want to say to you that I mean exactly what I say when I suggest that the Secretaries will recommend to the Board the closing of the Alberni School, if it means having to carry on at the expense of Home Mission money. There is no reason in the world why the Churches should have to find money to perform in part the functions which are in whole the responsibility of the Government.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEncls.\nThe Honourable J.A. Glen,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Glen:\n\nI am writing you today, enclosing a copy of a letter which I have just received from the Principal of the Alberni Residential School, and a copy of the accompanying letter from the Bank of Montreal.\n\nYou will remember that on November 28th, a delegation from the Churches waited on you to put before you the need of substantial increases in the per capita grants, if the Schools are to continue to function.\n\nYou will see that there is an accumulated deficit at Alberni of over $7,000.00. I hope it will be possible for the Government to make some grant that will be retroactive, as well as to increase the grant substantially, because I can assure you that, although it will be with the greatest regret, it will be impossible for The United Church of Canada to continue to operate the Alberni Residential School, if it means the putting in of substantial amounts of our missionary funds. I am quite sure that the condition in a number of the other Schools is similar, and I hope that the Government will be able to do something without delay.\n\nI regret having to add to your troubles at the present time, but you can understand that when a man has the Bank of Montreal pushing him like this, he is in a bad way.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours\n\nH.M.LT\n\nEnclosure.\nMr. R.A.

The fact is that the whole of this money had been advanced by us before we got it. You may not know it, but the fact that the government does not pay its bills before they are actually due -- and in this case a little over a month after the final due date -- means that the Church has to borrow money. Last year it cost us between $600 and $700 to see that our Schools got paid once a month.\n\nI hope to see you on Tuesday.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You are aware, of course, that until such action is taken and the amounts actually included in the Estimates and tabled in Parliament we are not permitted to make a public or semi-public announcement on the matter. This method of procedure may not be wholly satisfactory to you, but there is not much that either of us at the moment can do about it.\n\nIn the case of the Alberni School, the amount of the per capita allowance for the December quarter was $12,938.63 and a cheque for this amount went forward to the Treasurer of the United Church of Canada about February 2, 1948. This sum should enable the Principal to meet his obligations for the time being at least. Incidentally, while I have no desire to awaken hopes that are not warranted by the facts, nevertheless I feel the chances for the churches securing additional financial aid this year are more promising than they have been at any time in recent years.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street, West,\nTORONTO 2B,\nOntario.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTo: The Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nFrom: The District School Inspector.\n\nRe: George S. Sinclair\n\nI refer to the letter of Mr. A.E. Caldwell, principal of the Alberni Residential School dated May 8th for the purpose of giving art instruction in our residential schools and the attached letter of June 9th from the B.C. Arts and Welfare Society. I know Mr. Sinclair and have seen his work which is of a very high order. However Mr. Sinclair is at present suffering from an arthritic condition which makes it difficult for him to get about, and for this reason I cannot recommend that he be employed by us in a supervisory capacity as suggested by Mr. Caldwell in his interview with you.\n\nWhen recently in Victoria I had an opportunity to discuss with Mr. Sinclair the possibility of his employment in a residential school. He stated that such employment did not offer the security which he desires and for that reason he was not interested in such a position. If the teachers in the residential school had the same status he would not have left the residential school.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nDist. School Inspector.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing for your information Mr. A.B. Caldwell's letter of May 8th wherein he advises that Mr. George S. Sinclair, Art Instructor and Supervisor of classroom curriculum at the Alberni Residential School, has been offered a position with the Provincial Department of Education and suggests that in an attempt to retain his services he be employed by the Department as Art Instructor to be available to all other Indian schools in B.C.\n\nI may say that Mr. Sinclair's work as Art Instructor is known throughout the Province and the fact he has been successful in securing a position with the Provincial Department of Education is evidence of his qualifications. It is realized, however, that it would be extremely difficult for the Department to employ him other than as a teacher not under the Civil Service and in any case I should prefer to discuss the whole matter with District School Inspector Davey who, I expect, will return to this office in about a week's time before making a definite recommendation.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nALBERNI, B.C.\nMay 8th 1948.\n\nRe. George S. Sinclair,\n\nDear Mr. Arneil,\n\nYou will remember me mentioning a prospective appointment under the Department of Education for B.C. for George S. Sinclair, who has been Art Instructor and Supervisor of all class-room curriculum at this school for some two years, with marked success particularly in the realm of Native Art.\n\nMr. Sinclair has received notice of his appointment to the position of supervisor of Elementary Correspondence Art with the B.C. Department of Education in Victoria. The appointment was to be effective May 1st. However, Mr. Sinclair has arranged a delay until June, on the plea of having to give notice in his present employment.\n\nMr. Sinclair's inclination is to remain in the Indian work in which he is particularly experienced and efficient. I think Major Davey will agree with me that his acceptance of the appointment with the B.C. Government would mean a decided loss to the Department of Indian Affairs. Native Art is a subject of growing importance and Mr. Sinclair has already established himself as a leading exponent, teacher and authority in this sphere.\n\nI expected to be able to tell you what salary he is being offered by the B.C. Department, but this information has not yet come to Mr. Sinclair. He is getting $1260.00 here, with $40.00 per month deducted for board, etc. The minimum salary of a Technical Arts Instructor, for which Mr. Sinclair is qualified, is, I believe, $1800.00 per year.\n\nWhether Mr. Sinclair remained exclusively in the service of this school, or whether his qualifications could be made use of in a wider capacity by the Department of Indian Affairs in B.C., I feel that his services should not be lost to us.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nThe first weeks of school saw forty little folks pass into the Grade one room. Some felt very shy and some had a very strange feeling in their throats. Soon however everyone was so busy getting to know his new friends there was no time for feeling lonely.\n\nWe were delighted, a few days after school began, to have a book of our own to color, talk about and best of all to read. We are looking forward too, to the other books we will have this year.\n\nDuring our Social Studies period we have spent much time learning about home life. To help in this study we have planned and made a house with the help of a few seniors. We have made some furniture and some we hope to have people in it.\n\nMother Goose is an old friend now for we have been learning all about her and watching her big family appear along the black board and on the windows.\n\nChristmas shopping and the concert has come and gone. Now we are looking forward to Xmas day and all the happy things that go with it.\n\nNutrition teacher\u2014 \"Did you have anything at recess today, Levi\u2014candy, oranges or apples?\" Levi\u2014(thinking desperately)\"Two Waters\".\n\nJUNIOR NEWS\n\nThe members of the Junior room wish to report a very successful term.\n\nAt the beginning there were forty-two pupils. Since then some of our members have departed to the new class room, one to the Sanatorium at Nanaimo; so at present we number only thirty-five. The boys seem to be in the majority\u2014twenty to fifteen.\n\nWe believe that all pupils feel that they have made good progress and have found their work interesting.\n\nOur Art periods have been greatly enjoyed and some very good work has been turned out.\n\nAmong the project work attempted were posters on cleanliness and posters on Indians and Eskimos. In the future we plan to make posters on Tuberculosis.\n\nThe results of our October tests were generally good.\n\nSeveral have appreciated visits from their parents and friends from home.\n\nWe have all been very grateful for the lovely fall. It has helped to shorten the term a lot.\n\nThe first snow came on November 13th and brought with it the usual snowball.\n\nWe are all looking forward to Christmas and we extend to all a Very Merry Christmas and a Happy and prosperous New Year.\n\nPRACTICAL ARTS NEWS\n\nOur room opened September 28th with Miss Zahner as teacher.\n\nA lot of our work is hand work and so far in our leather work periods we have completed several useful articles including some suitcases, change purses and wallets.\n\nEvery Thursday the girls spend the day in the sewing room.\n\nWe are made up of Grades one, two, three, four and five. And we go to school all day.\n\nSaid the man smiling to the waitress, \"Look here girl, my pipe feet are cold.\" Said the girl to the man \"That's up to you, if your feet are cold put on your shoe.\"\nSENIOR NEWS\n\nThe Senior class this term is made up of grades Six, Seven and Eight.\n\nSince the beginning of the term everyone has been working hard and the results of the October tests showed the results of this work. In grade six Barry Keith came first with Murray Livingston second and Bert Underwood third. There are twenty-three pupils in grade six this term too.\n\nIn grade seven Doris Underwood came first with Violet Campbell second and Stanley Charles third. Twenty-eight pupils make up grade seven.\n\nIn grade eight David Jacobsen and Percy Monk came first and second with Roma Ridley coming third. There are eight pupils in grade eight.\n\nThe Christmas concert has come and gone again and everyone had a busy time practising for their part.\n\nGrade six and seven are taking practical art this year and both grades have been working on a Christmas decoration. This parade is held every Friday and is looked forward to by all.\n\nHolidays have started and now everyone can relax for two weeks and enjoy Xmas with all its fun and frolic.\n\nThe Seniors extend to all a Very Merry Xmas and a Happy New Year.\n\nHIGH SCHOOL NEWS\n\nThere are seven students attending high school in Alberni from here. Two are in grade nine, three in grade ten and two in grade eleven. They are kept quite busy and home work seems to be the byword. They are holding their own too, and looking forward to the day when they will graduate.\n\nSOCIAL LIFE\n\nThe Hallowe'en parties have come and gone and everyone claims that they had a good time. The Assembly hall was gaily decorated in black and orange by Miss Kennedy's group of C.B.I.T. girls, a fine job was done.\n\nFriday night has been set aside for dances for forms one and two with Mr. Peake as host, they have themselves a good time come Friday night.\n\nSaturday is show day and several interesting films have been shown. Most of the films have been educational and everyone is looking forward to seeing some longer features.\n\nWe have had several visitors to this school including a group of grade three pupils from the Alberni school. They were very interested in our school and its pupils and regretted that their visit was so short.\n\nWith Xmas almost here many visitors are expected, however we will write about these next time.\n\nSPORTS\n\nBasketball has been the main sport so far this term. Because of the wet field and constant rain the boys have not been able to play as much basketball as they would have liked. They did play the local High school team on a very slippery field and lost the game. They are looking forward to return the match when the field is drier.\n\nWe have a junior boys basketball team who call themselves the Western Eagles. They have been playing in the junior league district and are at present in second place. Play-offs start in January and the boys hope to make a good showing. On a recent trip to Duncan the boys played the Indian boys team there and lost by two points the final score being 36-34. By the way their colors are blue and gold.\n\nThe girls have been practicing basketball too but have played no outside games yet.\n\nThe boys have been practicing boxing also in preparation for a tournament.\n\nC.G.I.T.\n\nOur groups this term are organized much like they were last term. There are five groups and regular meetings are held Wednesday nights. Craft work occupies most of the evening.\nThis year there are approximately twenty-five boys in the group. Dan has taken over Bob Wilson's position as chief ranger. Meetings are held every Tuesday night and handy crafts are the major projects.\n\nA junior group has been organized called the Trail Rangers and they meet Tuesday nights.\n\nCHRISTMAS CONCERT\n\nThe concert this year was held on Friday December 17th in the Auditorium at 7:30. The programme lasted until 9:30 and everyone enjoyed it. A good many of the parents and friends were there and the hall was full.\n\nWHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PICTURES?\n\nby Bruce Johnson; Grade V\n\nIn our October Tests, Amelia Drake, Peggy August and Simon Williams tied for highest standing in Grade five. Howard Cecil, William Cecil and Geddes Wilson were the outstanding pupils in the Grade four class.\n\nDuring the Fall several of the pupils had visitors.\n\nBecause of the heavy snows and lately the heavy snow the boys have not been able to practice football and basketball, but they are hoping to do so in the new year.\n\nFrom the Principal\n\nThis is being written on Xmas Eve. Preparations are all made for a BIG DAY tomorrow. Santa will fill the stockings for the little folks during the night; the staff will serve the Christmas dinner at noon; Santa Claus will come in person at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. Then the big Christmas cake will be cut for supper. All together, pupils and staff look forward to our usual Merry Xmas (to distribute the mountain of presents that he has been sending in for the past few weeks).\n\nThis Christmas a number of pupils have been permitted to go home at the request of their parents. This is an experiment that will be continued each Christmas if the children are returned to school promptly and in good condition. Unfortunately the homes of most of the pupils are too far away to permit them to go home. The parents or such can be assured that their children will have a good Christmas.\n\nI am glad to report a successful term thus far. Our teaching staff has been increased by two making possible the more individual care especially of backward pupils. Our school is filled to capacity, of course, and the health of the children has been excellent. We had a visit from Dr. Fett, chief of the Nutrition Division of the Department of National Health and Welfare, Ottawa, and his Associates, and we feel complimented in receiving the following recent report from him: \"You may be interested to know that the dietary records so far show your school children to be better fed than most similar groups in Canada, whether Indians or not, and that their medical records are also good.\"\nI am sure the parents will be glad to know this.\n\nSpace will not permit me to write at any great length, but I would like to mention the \"Fashion Show\" that was put on in the great Store of Woodard's in Port Alberni. Two of our High School girls, Judith Morgan and June Wilson, took part in this show, modelling clothes from \"Slacks\" to evening dresses. The girls selected the clothes they modelled themselves. I wish you could all have seen them. They received many compliments and have had such a thrill in wearing what has been put on.\n\nI may also say that the Basketball game with the Duncan Indian boy's team, mentioned elsewhere in the letter, is the first game of organized basketball to be played among Indian teams on Vancouver Island. This is good stuff and we have more of it.\n\nIn conclusion, my wishes to you and your family very Happy and joyous Christmas out to all the parents everywhere. May we all remember that Christmas is celebrated because: \"Unto you is born this day in the City of David a Saviour which is Christ the Lord.\"\n\nTHE STAFF AND PUPILS EXTEND TO ALL A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS AND BEST WISHES FOR A HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS NEW YEAR.\n\n[Signature]\n\nTHE STAFF AND PUPILS EXTEND TO ALL A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS AND BEST WISHES FOR A HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS NEW YEAR.\nAttention: Colonel B.F.

However, each teacher will of course have deducted from his salary the Retirement Fund amount.\n\nI presume that cheques should be made out in favour of the teachers and forwarded to them in care of Mr. Caldwell. Then he can make certain that each teacher pays back to the...\nschool funds the amount which they have been receiving from the Principal as salary since 1 September, 1949. This would have to be a matter of adjustment between each individual teacher and the Principal.\n\nMr. Caldwell would also have to determine the amount to be charged each teacher for board, laundry and other personal services.

Davey,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Davey,\n\nI have been able to satisfy my teachers in the matter of salary, to carry them over the Christmas vacation, but I have advanced them altogether $2400.00, which is mortgaging my bank credit near the maximum. In a letter from Dr. Dorey recently received he states:\n\n\"The order-in-council is ready... all it needs is a few final touches from the legal minds. The Department is not yet ready to discuss dollars and cents.\"\n\nWould it not be possible for the \"contract\" to institute the payment of the teaching salaries at once, leaving the legal technicalities and the financial adjustment until later? This is the time of the year of our greatest operational expense, with cost of fuel and utilities at their yearly peak.\n\nI am wondering, too, if there will be further delay, once the order-in-council is signed, in the teachers making formal application as required by the Civil Service. I note that there is an application form attached to the November teachers' bulletin for \"appointment as permanent Civil Servant\". Would it be advisable to have these forms filled and signed by the teachers so that there may be as little delay as possible?\n\nRe. furnace for Sechelt: The Superintendent in charge of this equipment is out of town for a few days.

Such appointments are for superannuation purposes only. The requirements for such an appointment specify that teachers must be employed for at least two years in Indian Day Schools. I assume that they will not have this status until the Department takes over the payment of their salaries in accordance with the agreement now being prepared. Since this agreement is apparently to be retroactive to the beginning of September, this year, I assume your teachers will not be eligible for this classification until September 1951. It will however be necessary for your teachers to complete application forms for employment by our Department. I think it would be better to defer completion of these by the teachers until such time as the Department is prepared to proceed with classifying them as Day School teachers.\n\nRegarding the furnace at Sechelt, it has been decided to proceed with the installation of an oil heater so it will be unnecessary to secure the furnace from the army camp.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.F. Davey,\nInspector of Indian Schools.\nOttawa, 13 December, 1949.\n\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nPlease find attached a submission to Council concerning the payment of the teachers at the Alberni Residential School. This matter has already been discussed with Mr. Jackson and the submission indicates an experiment in the payment of teachers at Indian residential schools.\n\nAs you are aware, this is being done at three schools: the Mohawk Institute, the Shubenacadie Residential School and now, as indicated, the Alberni Residential School.\n\nAs both the Mohawk Institute and the Shubenacadie Residential School are government institutions, it was not necessary to make a submission to Council. The Alberni Residential School is, however, operated by the United Church of Canada, which denomination has concurred in the payment of these teachers.\n\nThe present per capita rate at this residential school is $274.00 per pupil per year. An increase to $288.00 was authorized by the Minister but this has never been paid, due to the fact that this matter had been discussed with Mr. Jackson and it was decided to delay the increase until a decision had been made in connection with the teachers' salaries.\n\nWhen authority is obtained by Order-in-Council for the payment of these teachers, it is our intention to obtain details of the qualifications and salaries of these teachers, when a further submission will be made concerning such changes, if any, in the per capita rate.\n\nDirector.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Alberni Residential School\n877-1 (E)\n\nJanuary 24, 1950.\n\nAttached please find completed T.D. 1, Employee Questionnaire, Oaths of Allegiance and Office and Application forms for the teachers at the above mentioned school as requested in Mr. Neary's Army Signals message of January 9th.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Robert Maize, one of the applicants, has had some military service.

The grant to the Alberni Residential School has been delayed, pending the receipt of the teachers' qualification records.\n\nUpon enquiry, we have discovered that there was no actual agreement entered into for the operation of the Alberni Residential School when it was recently re-erected.\n\nIt has therefore been decided that an Order-in-Council will not be necessary for the payment of these teachers but that it can be tried on an experimental basis for a period of one year on the following understanding:\n\n(a) That the Department will pay the salaries of classroom teachers at the Alberni Residential School for a trial period of one academic year, namely 1 September, 1949, to 30 June, 1950.\n\n(b) That these salaries will be based on the Indian day school teachers' salary schedule.\n\n(c) That salary cheques will be mailed to each individual teacher but in care of the Principal of the School.\n\n(d) That the school management can settle with each individual teacher the amount to be charged for such\n\nRev. George Dorey, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\nservices as board, room, laundry facilities, etc.\n\nI had intended to write to you concerning this matter in greater detail when I received the qualification forms completed by the teachers.\n\nThe audit report for the period June 1, 1948, to August 31, 1949, shows that the teachers' salaries at this school amounted to $7,920.00 with an authorized enrolment of 235 pupils. This meant that the salary cost for each teacher per pupil was $33.00. Therefore it would be safe to assume that the Alberni Residential School will benefit from the payment of the teachers' salaries by the Department to the amount of approximately $35.00 per pupil (or equivalent to an increase in per capita rate of about $35.00).\n\nI will be away from town next week but will phone you when I return as by then we should have received the qualification forms from the school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

These teachers should be charged the prevailing rate in the community in which the school is located.\n\nFor example, if the prevailing rate for room and board is $60.00 and a fair charge for laundry is $3.00 per month, then the teacher is required to reimburse the school management in the amount of $63.00 per month.\n\nIf a teacher performs duties over and above those expected of a classroom teacher, such as evening supervision, a small adjustment can be made in the amount deducted for board services.\n\nFor example, whereas a teacher doing no additional duties might be charged $61.00 per month for board; another teacher doing some night supervision might be charged $55.00 per month for board.\n\nI am sure that you will appreciate the reasons for the above action. If you have any questions to raise concerning the above arrangement, please do not hesitate to Air Mail me immediately.\n\nWe are most anxious that this experiment works and we have already learned from our experience at the other two schools that arrangements as described above must be made with the teachers concerned.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

It is noted that this rate is acceptable to the teachers and that each teacher gives one evening a week to recreation room supervision apart from the club and study supervision that is normally expected from a teacher.

We have received the ruling that salary earned in 1949 but paid in 1950 is considered as 1950 salary. The amount received by the teachers will therefore appear on their 1950 T-4 slip.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAttention: Colonel B.F.

Our Board will meet in ten days or so and I want to be in a position to report. I shall be very glad to have an official letter from you, seeing that we have nothing on file, and I think we should.\n\nWe have received from Mr. Phelan a statement that advances are being paid to residential schools for the quarter ending March 31st, for which we are very grateful.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\nAlberni Indian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\n\nALBERNI, B.C.\nMarch 10th 1950.\n\nFurther to Income Tax, Teachers.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI find in checking my letter to you of March 8th re Income Tax deductions for teachers that I have made two errors in dates that confuse the sense of the letter.\n\nIn the third paragraph, where I suggest the inclusion of the teachers salaries earned during the four months of 1949 in their income tax return for 1950... this should read \"their income tax return for 1949\".\n\nIn the last paragraph, for \"by the inclusion of the four months of 1950\"...\"inclusion of the four months of 1949\" should be read.\n\nMay I further point out that reduction of the 1949 tax because of the last four months salary of 1949 being carried over to 1950 would not compensate the teachers for the increase due to the higher bracket income of 1950 by reason of the inclusion of the four months of 1949 in the 1950 income.\n\nAs instances: the increase in the 1950 tax on a yearly salary of $2520.00, with the inclusion of four months salary earned in 1949 would be $155.00; on a yearly salary of $2400.00 the increase for 1950 would be $128.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nAlberni Indian Residential School\n\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\n\nALBERNI, B.C.\n\nMarch 8th 1950,\n\nRe: Teacher Tax Deductions.\n\nDear Col. Neary,\n\nFurther to my letter re teacher salaries, the matter of Income Tax deduction seems to me to require consideration.\n\nWhile some teachers had drawn advances since October 1949 that left balances of about $100.00, others had balances of $500.00, all of which I have paid since receiving the cheques. It would appear that the 1949 deferred salaries paid in March 1950 will place the recipients in a much higher bracket of 1950 income if the deferred balances (or if the full payment as reported from your office to the Income Tax authority) is taken as 1950 income.\n\nWould it be permissible, in their income tax return for 1950, for the teachers to compute the full amount due to Dec. 1949 as having been received in 1949, recording your deductions for that period?\n\nUnless the Income tax Return can be manipulated in this way, it would also appear that the Tax deductions at source would require to be much more than shown in the cheque vouchers, as the four months salary in 1949 would require to be included in the 1950 total salary received.\n\nMay I request your advice in the matter before taking it up with the teachers, also. If the above suggestion can be entertained, would you please send a \"Return of Remuneration Paid\", Form T4, to each of the teachers, showing salary paid and tax deductions?\n\nThe advancing of the total of the 1950 salaries by the inclusion of the four months of 1950 would appear as a penalty for a delay for which the teachers are not responsible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nAlberni Residential School\n\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\n\nA.B.Caldwell.\n\nMarch 8th 1950.\n\nCol. B.F.Neary,\nSupt., of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nRe. Teacher Salaries.\n\nDear Col. Neary,\n\nI have your letter of Feb. 16th giving the classification of our teachers and the amount of the individual salaries, effective from September 1st 1949, followed on March 4th by receipt of the salary cheques, sent in my care.\n\nI note your instructions re the charge for board, room and laundry. Enquiries made from the City Council and the Government Employment offices set the local rate for board and room at $55.00 per month in the Alberni District. While, pending ratification of the change in the teacher salary schedule at this school, no assurances had been given the teachers regarding the salaries to be received, some of them had been under the impression that the cost of board, etc., to them would be $40.00 per month, the rate obtaining under the old schedule of salaries. It was also pointed out by those teachers with Indian Day school experience, that a teacherage was provided in some of the day schools, for which no charge was made.\n\nTo compromise, I have suggested that, subject to the approval of the Department, the board rate, for this present term only, be set at $50.00 per month. This rate is acceptable to the teachers and I would ask that you give your approval. May I also point out that each teacher lives one evening per week in recreation room supervision; apart from the club and study supervision that is normally expected from a teacher and in which they all engage.\n\nThere would appear to have been some error in setting the salary of Miss G.J.May. Miss May taught at the Alert Bay Day School last year at a salary of $1740.00. She would apparently be entitled to an increase of $60.00 this term. Miss May admits that the error probably occurred in the filling out of the application she submitted recently when the present arrangement was ratified. I have taken this matter up with Mr.Davey with a view to adjustment.\n\nI trust that the tentative arrangements made in regard to board will meet with your approval and I wish to express my appreciation to you and the Department for the removal of what has been an increasing handicap in the engaging of competent teachers for this school, and also for the prospect of some alleviation of the heavy financial burden that has caused overmuch preoccupation during the past few years.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nREGISTERED\n\nOttawa, June 27, 1950.\n\nMr. W.S.

Neary,\nSupt of Indian Education,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nRe. U.S.S.R. Publications.\n\nDear Col. Neary,\n\nMr. Maize, our Senior Teacher, has given me your letter to him of the 10th Inst., and your explanation that you are not aware of the type of publication that is on the material list issued by the Department clears up the question that has been in my mind as to why such publications were recommended for our pupils.\n\nAs you see, the publications are of a very high order, on excellent paper and of a fine excellence of presentation, but it is purely propaganda and it's seeming reasonableness makes it most undesirable material, in my mind, for the inculcation of the student mind, particularly the Indian, gaining first impressions of political and economic ways of life.\n\nReading the material, it is hardly to be wondered that our High School and University youth, striving towards an ideal, and conscious that our own democratic way falls far short of the ideal, finds it attractive, particularly under the impression that it is disseminated with the approval of our Government. Such material is only safe reading for the advanced student of political economy, fully acquainted with counterbalancing material.\n\nWould it be possible for our Government to combat this propaganda of the U.S.S.R. by compiling equally attractive publications explaining and eulogizing the democratic way of life? The effectiveness of such would be out of all proportion to the expense, and would be much more productive of educative result than banning the undesirable publications.\n\nHowever, as far as our own students are concerned, I think it would be desirable to remove these publications from the list of study material.\n\nI will await your comment.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nApril 17th, 1950.\n\nMr. F.E.

Caldwell,\nPrincipal,\nAlberni Indian Residential School,\nAlberni, B.C.\n\nAlberni Indian Residential School\n\nDear Mr. Caldwell:\n\nWe have received both your letters of March 8 and that of March 10 concerning the salaries of teachers at the above school.\n\nThe Department is prepared to approve the board rate of $50.00 a month. It is noted that this rate is acceptable to the teachers and that each teacher gives one evening a week to recreation room supervision apart from the club and study supervision that is normally expected from a teacher. We are pleased that it has been possible for you to make a suitable arrangement.\n\nWe are attaching for your information copies of two letters sent today to Mr. W.S. Arnell regarding the classification and salary of Mr. R.M. Baker and Miss Grace J. May.\n\nWe have contacted our Treasury Branch officials concerning the matter of Income Tax payment on salaries of the teachers for the years 1949 and 1950. We have received the ruling that salary earned in 1949 but paid in 1950 is considered as 1950 salary. The amount received by the teachers will therefore appear on their 1950 T-4 slip.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAlberni Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\n\nA.F.Caldwell.\n\nALBERNI, B.C.\n\nJuly 8th 1950.\n\nCol. Bernard F. Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nRe: Teachers Salary Olan.\n\nDear Col. Neary,\n\nIn reply to your letter of June 24th enquiring as to the success of the experiment in the paying of Residential School teachers' salaries by the Department, I do not know how far the plan had been premeditated in other schools in which the experiment has been conducted, but in our own case we will be better able to make a report at the end of the coming term, as, not being fully assured last September nor indeed until the Order in Council was passed establishing the policy in December, that the increased salary scale would actually become operative, we were not in a position to be as selective in our teaching appointments as we now are for the coming term.\n\nWhile all our teachers were fully qualified, a condition which I have been able to maintain without exception during my principalship of Alberni, their teaching capabilities, for the most part, left much to be desired. Our senior teacher, a veteran who has been here for the past three years, lacked the experience and capability to take charge of a grade 8 class, nearly all of which, under our present developed system, will graduate to the 9th grade in the Public High School. Further, it was expected that this teacher would function as class room principal, for which his inexperience unfitted him, leaving the general class-room supervision to myself, and I had neither the time nor the academic teaching training to handle this work as efficiently as required. This teacher is now taking summer school and hopes to gain further experience in the Public Schools.\n\nThen we filled our teaching staff with three elderly teachers who were verging on, or past, the age limit of 65. One had been teaching for some years at the File Hills Indian School and came well recommended but did not measure up, by any means, to our required standard. Another had passed the period of possibly former efficiency. The third was possibly the best teacher on the staff and is being retained next term.\n\nOf the three male teachers (one being the senior teacher already referred to) one was efficient and is being retained, and the other inefficient. We had further employed a teacher who, while unqualified, had operated a kindergarten in the Old Country, and who was given, in addition to her main function of singing and music instructor (she was nominally on the supervisory staff) a pre-primary class of some 20 pupils. She did a splendid job with these pupils and I plan to keep her on under the same circumstances, although she cannot qualify for a civil service appointment.\nOnly two of our teachers from last term, therefore, have been considered sufficiently efficient to retain. Perhaps I should say three, as a Primary teacher, Miss Bone, who had been here three years and has been progressively efficient, resigned to leave the field of instruction, largely because, being of an intensely evangelical turn of mind, was perfectly satisfied with the low salary she was formerly receiving, but considered there was not sufficient sacrifice entailed in working for the larger salary. There is nothing much one can do in a case like that. Mr. Davey would have liked to appoint her to a day school but the same circumstances apply there.\n\nI go into this detail to indicate, as I said, that the experiment has not had a fair trial. Some teachers have already been engaged for next term. Mr. Davey has furnished me with their qualifications and indications are that we will have a more efficient teaching staff under the new, and now established conditions.\n\nHowever, I can report that we have had a very successful academic year. It is less than two years since I have been able to establish the full day class-room instruction, doing away entirely with the half-day instruction in all grades as formerly. This has had a most marked effect in the work of the pupils, even more than might be expected. The progress is apparent in all grades, but particularly in the Primary and Intermediate, and it is already affecting the age at which pupils are prepared to enter the Grade 9 in the Public High School. In another year or two, it is apparent that the age for Grade 9 advance will be 14 to 15, instead of 16 to 17 as formerly. I am confident that, with efficient teaching such as we can now expect, this average age of Grade 9 advance will be further reduced.\n\nIf I may take up your time, I would like to further discuss this High School question with you. This term we had 16 pupils in the High School, 8 in Grade 9, 4 in 10, 2 in 11 and 2 in 12. Seven pupils were taking the University Entrance Course and nine the Commercial or General Course. Two pupils graduated from Grade 12, one is accepted for nursing training at the Vancouver General Hospital and one is attending Normal in Victoria, with a view to the teaching of Art (with Morgan). One pupil failed in Grade 11 and two in Grade 9. It is recommended that one of the Grade 9 failures take the Grade 10 general Course next term. The other two failures are not returning. All others passed their grades, with one Grade 12 pupil being recommended in all subjects. Our pupils are handicapped in English and Mathematics particularly... although little below the average High School pupil. This is accounted for by the lack of elementary grade grounding due to the half-day classroom system formerly employed.\n\nI might add, in passing, that we have had many compliments from the High School teachers on the general conduct and good manners of our Indian pupils. I am told they are models for others in the High School. Actually, contrary to my own former apprehensions, we have had not the slightest behavioral trouble with our High School pupils in the school, probably due to the fact that, while being permitted to engage in all High School activities and social functions, within the Residential school they are subjected to the same routine exactly as other pupils. Their social contacts have been successful beyond my expectations. Friends have been made, and visitation by invitation at friends' homes and by friends here at the school has been permitted and encouraged. There has not been a vestige of discrimination and the innate fear of discrimination has practically been eliminated from the psychology of our Indian pupils. One of our girls was President of the Hi-Y group in\nGrade 12 and was the representative at the annual convention of the Groups in Vancouver. This process of assimilation has been greatly furthered in our school generally by participation in league sports, softball, football, etc., with all the Sunday Schools of the city, and with teams from industrial plants and other organizations. Although our teams were, on the average, better than opponents, often of older ages, the good spirit displayed, and the real friendships formed, have been most encouraging. It has been my policy to eliminate the word \"Indian\" as a discriminatory term in the school, as it tends to establish a sense of inferiority that has a retarding influence on general progress, and in this I think we have been quite successful.\n\nI may say here also, that I have just received a request to attend the opening of the Exhibition of Indian Arts and Crafts in Victoria on Monday next, taking two of our pupils, who have entered art exhibits, with me. I understand that Dolly Morgan, sister of the now famous Judith Morgan, has been awarded this year's scholarship, with some other award to the other top pupil. Our Art class this year has been extra-curricular and has been supervised by Judith Morgan in evening sessions.\n\nTo continue with the High School problem. First, I may say, that the parents, almost without exception, are desirous, with the pupils, of High School continuance. We are fortunate, at Alberni, in having a High School where our pupils are welcomed and where a somewhat intensive interest is taken in them. It was apparent, at the High School convocation a few weeks ago, where over 40 pupils graduated, that the two graduating pupils from this school were easily the most popular, judged by the applause of the audience.\n\nAs it appears at the present writing, 12 of our pupils will be continuing at High School in grades 10, 11, and 12 next term. In addition there will be 14 pupils entering grade 9..... the grade 8 graduates of this term. I have had two further applications for High School pupils who have passed grade 8 in day schools. This will make a total High School pupilage of 28 attending the Public High School next term. If the present trend continues (and I see no reason why it should not only continue but be accelerated) there is indication that, conservatively, there will be an advancement to High School of some 15 pupils per year...... not including any entrants from day schools who may be sent here for High School entrance. An average of 15 yearly (which, as I say, is a conservative estimate) covering the four years of High School, will give us a High School resident pupilage of 60 at this school, and this within the next three years.\n\nThe actual situation now is that we have a full pupilage of 24. Not more than 12 to 15 pupils will be discharged, or may not return, for the beginning of next term in September. Applications for admission, as indicated by requests from the various Indian Superintendents, are in the neighbourhood of 150. High School pupils for next term will take up dormitory space for 26...... 2 are attending the High School from their local homes. That is the problem both present and future. If a policy of admissions is left with me as Principal, I am at least able to know what accommodations are available for the few I can take at the expense of the prospective primary applicants or at the expense of the High School continuants. Personally, I feel that we are doing the greatest good in providing for the High School pupils, not only in continuing their education looking towards their establishment in useful and independent occupations, but also, and perhaps the most important, in having these pupils under our supervision and guidance during the middle teen age when they most need care. My experience generally has been that these pupils develop a remarkable solidarity of character in their latter teens under sympathetic guidance.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6431, File 877-1, part 4)\nThus, our immediate problem is that of space and policy. With the remarkable increased interest, on the part of both parents and pupils, in matters of education, I feel that we will be missing a great opportunity if we were either to curtail or neglect to expand the educational facilities. It is a problem that must rest on the Government.\n\nI am fully in accord with the policy of placing Indian pupils in public, or (as far as the elementary grades are concerned) in the Indian Day schools. I have eliminated every pupil in this school that can be so accommodated and will continue to do so as opportunity affords, but the necessity of the residential school, both as a means of education for the underprivileged and as an opportunity for higher education continually increases.\n\nI regret the length of this letter but the opportunity for discussion occasioned by your request for information provided an unusual opportunity.\n\nIn conclusion, I would give as my opinion, after a number of years of competition in teacher engagement not only with the Public schools but, of late years, with our own Department in the matter of salaries, of necessity having to put up with teachers who were the rejects from the Public schools, or teachers from other Provinces desiring to insinuate themselves into the B.C. Public School system by means of summer school credits while engaged in Indian work, that our new system can produce nothing but unqualified success.\n\nI need scarcely add that the relief of the financial burden which this new system has occasioned and which has permitted me to see financial daylight for the first time in my experience at Alberni, is appreciated more than I can say.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nI must add that I appreciate greatly the whole hearted support, encouragement and understanding that I have continually received from Commissioner Arnell, Inspector Davey and the other officials of the Department.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6432)\n\nFile 877-2, part 1\nWest Coast Agency - Alberni Residential School - Quarterly Returns. 1942 - 1949\n\nFile 877-2, part 2\nWest Coast Agency - Alberni Residential School - Quarterly Returns. 1949 - 1952\n\nFile 877-4, part 1\nWest Coast Agency - Alberni Residential School - Supplies. 1940 - 1952\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1.

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Albemarle Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 4, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Albemarle, this 12th Jan., 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Alberta Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 1, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Col.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Alberta Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 1, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at Edmonton, this 12th Jan., 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Alberni Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: January 8, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at: Port Alberni, BC\n\nthis 8th Jan., 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nthis [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRego.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Albemarle Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 1, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Albemarle, BC\n\nthis 2nd April, 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of quarterly grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Albemarle Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 1, 1943.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Albemarle this 2nd April, 1943.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY Certify that the above statement is true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nALBERNI, B.C.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the foregoing statement is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residences of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY Certify that the above Return is correct and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended... 19...\n\nPrincipal...\n\nDated... 19...\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at... 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY Certify that I have examined and faithfully statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pasting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Alberta Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 5, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Alberta Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 5, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Edmonton, October 6, 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A.403\nReqn.

(RG 10, Volume 6432, File 877-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Alberta Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 5, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 5, 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFonds No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Alberni Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 6, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at: Alberni, BC\n\nthis 6th October 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\nReqn.

(RG 10, Volume 6432, File 377-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. Average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended DEC 31 1943.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated JAN 8 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended DEC 31, 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JAN 8, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return contains a faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the foregoing statement is a true and correct statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY the within statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended MAR 31 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nAPR 1 - 1944\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Port Alberni B.C.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within is a true, correct and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the attached is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the ALBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended JUN 30 1944\n\nPrincipal R.

(RG 10, Volume 6432, File 877-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance (pupils during quarter)\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the above Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the\n\nRESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nALBERNI, B.C.\n\nSchool for the Quarter ended SEP 30 1944\n\nPrincipal\n\nOCT 8 1944\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the above statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the above Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the KENNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ALBERNI, B.C. ended SEP 30 1944\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated OCT 8 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a truthful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended SEP 30 1944\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated OCT 8 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Port Alberni BC this 16th October 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the above named is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the\n\nRESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nSchool for the Quarter ended SEP 30 1944\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated OCT 8 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the above is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that I have examined and found the statement of the attendance at the ALBERNI RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, ALBERNI, B.C., School for the Quarter ended DEC 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return; giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended DEC. 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, ALBERNI, B.C., School for the Quarter ended DEC. 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Port Alberni, B.C.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFonds No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and School for the Quarter ended...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify an accurate and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY Certify that the above Return is correct and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended MAR 31st 1945.\n\nDated APR 5th 1945\n\nPrincipal\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at this 6th April 1945\n\nIndian Agent\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return contains a truthful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, ALBERNI, B.C., School for the Quarter ended MAR 31 1945.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated APR 5 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Alberni this 6th April 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return contains a correct statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended MAR 31, 1945 19...\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated APR 5, 1945 19...\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Alberni B.C.\n\nthis 6th April 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.
