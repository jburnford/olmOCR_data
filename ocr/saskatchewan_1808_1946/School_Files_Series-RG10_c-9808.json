Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pacing No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 12, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date, 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 12, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this day of 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 1045           | Percy Wandy           | 16\u00bd | 1   |      | Piapot          | 10            |                  | Carpentry              | 2-10-42                    | 90         |\n| 1048           | Herbie Strongeagle    | 14  | 1   |      | PasquaW         | 9             |                  | Carpentry              | 11-11-42                   | 90         |\n| 1049           | Peter Chapiesan       | 13  | 1   |      | Piapot          | 5             |                  | Do                     | 23-11-42                   | 90         |\n| 1050           | Harvey Ironseagle     | 14  | 1   |      | PasquaW         | 6             |                  |                        | 25-11-42                   | 90         |\n| 1051           | Alvin Stemchild       | 13  | 1   |      | Starblanket     | 4             |                  |                        | 1-9-43                     | 90         |\n| 1056           | Leo Desnomie          | 14  | 1   |      | Peepeskisis     | 7             |                  |                        | 1-9-43                     | 90         |\n| 1057           | Patrick Yuhaha        | 14\u00bd | 1   |      | Oak Lake        | 7             |                  |                        | 1-9-43                     | 90         |\n| 1059           | Gerald Anauquod       | 14\u00bd | 1   |      | Muscowpetung    | 7             |                  |                        | 1-9-49                     | 90         |\n| 1061           | George McKay          | 13\u00bd | 1   |      | Peepeskisis     | 6             |                  |                        | 1-9-43                     | 90         |\n| 1065           | Wilfrid Deegan        | 14\u00bd | 1   |      | S.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1957.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 1st 1957\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 15th, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Agency**\n\nREPORT of the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School at Lebret, Sask., on Reserve for Quarter ended June 30th, 1950.\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Red Apple River] School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 15th 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nthis [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present year all pupils listed on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 15, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this ........................................... 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated Oct. 15, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\nR. 3444\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Agency**\n\nREPORT of the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School at Lebret, Sask., on Reserve for Quarter ended September 30th, 1950.\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| 1167            | Vicent Worm           | 17  | 1   |      | Poorman's       |               |                   |                          | 1-9-48                      | 92         | 19                                               |\n| 1168            | Thomas Okimaw         | 18  | 1   |      | God's Lake      |               |                   |                          | 1-9-48                      | 92         | 19                                               |\n| 1169            | Andrew Yellowback     | 16  | 1   |      | Cross Lake      |               |                   |                          | 1-9-48                      | 92         | 19                                               |\n| 1171            | Ivan Yuzicapi         | 10  | 1   |      | S.Buffalo       |               |                   |                          | 1-9-48                      | 92         | 19                                               |\n| 1172            | Wayne Goodwill        | 9\u00bd  | 1   |      |                 |               |                   |                          | 1-9-48                      | 92         | 19                                               |\n| 1173            | Guy Goodfeather       | 9\u00bd  | 1   |      |                 |               |                   |                          | 1-9-48                      | 92         | 19                                               |\n| 1174            | Louis Whiteman        | 9\u00bd  | 1   |      |                 |               |                   |                          | 1-9-48                      | 92         | 19                                               |\n| 1175            | J.S.

No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct. 15, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [blank] School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal [signature]\n\nDated Jan. 4, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent [signature]\n\nDated at [blank] this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupil during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...School for the Quarter ended...Dated...Principal...Dated...\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at...this...19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...School for the Quarter ended...1950\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated...1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at...this...19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 2, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

**Amount of per capita grant due for Quarter:** \n\n**NOTE**: Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The annual per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 2, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days its residents of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Name of School] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nthis [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipal will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pasting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\u201d\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is obtained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended... 19...\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: 19...\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended...School for the Quarter ended...Principal:\n\nDated...Indian Agent\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at...NOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTERING SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|------------|\n| 1240            | Thomas Glen Bellegarde   | 7.2 | 1   |      | Peepeskisis    | 1                  |                         | 2-9-51                   | 92/58      |\n| 1241            | Bruce Tacon              | 7.2 | 1   |      | Oakriver       | 1                  |                         | 2-9-51                   | 92/58      |\n| 1242            | Peter Thorn              | 9.3 | 1   |      | Pasqua         | 1                  |                         | 2-9-51                   | 92/58      |\n| 1243            | Wayne Dubois             | 7.2 | 1   |      |                | 1                  |                         | 2-9-51                   | 92/58      |\n| 1244            | Clayton Lasuisse         | 7.3 | 1   |      | S.Buffalo      | 1                  |                         | 2-9-51                   | 92/58      |\n| 1245            | Harold Benjoe            | 8.2 | 1   |      | Muscowpitung   | 1                  |                         | 2-9-51                   | 92/58      |\n| 1246            | Leslie McArthur          | 7.3 | 1   |      | Whitebear      | 1                  |                         | 2-9-51                   | 92/58      |\n| 1247            | Robert Geo.Big eagle     | 8.3 | 1   |      |                | 1                  |                         | 2-9-51                   | 92/58      |\n| 1248            | Victor Big eagle         | 7.2 | 1   |      |                | 1                  |                         | 2-9-51                   | 92/58      |\n| 1249            | Edward McArthur          | 7.1 | 1   |      |                | 1                  |                         | 2-9-51                   | 92/58      |\n| 1250            | Allan Rob.Lerat          | 7   | 1   |      | Cowessess      | 1                  |                         | 2-9-51                   | 92/58      |\n| 1251            | Baptist Robinson         | 14  | 1   |      | Cross Lake     | 9                  |                         | 2-9-51                   | 92/58      |\n| 1252            | Arnold Whiteman          | 6.8 | 1   |      | S.Buffalo      | 1                  |                         | 1-10-51                  | 92/58      |\n| 1253            | Delbert Okeweehow        | 9.6 | 1   |      | Muscowpitung   | 1                  |                         | 1-10-51                  | 92/58      |\n\n**TOTALS**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTERING SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|------------|\n|                 |                          | 150 | 172 |      |                |                    |                         |                          |            |\n\n**NOTE\u2014Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column.**\n\n**Indian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ...............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is obtained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nthis ........................................... 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days attended by pupils during the quarter on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

The furnaces are of an old pattern with small flues, too narrow to take away the smoke and gas of gall coal. Up to last year we could procure anthracite coal from the West, but now it is impossible. Consequently, being having insufficient heat, the gas is often escaping into the room through the hot air registers, and we had several explosions that happily had no other consequences than to blow the door open. This inconvenience can be avoided by purchasing Pennsylvania coal, but it cannot be always procured and presently costs $13.50 or the station and $16.50 at the school beside the loss in transport. These new furnaces would cost about $350.00.\n\nI am your obedient servant,\n\nJ. Hugonard\nPrincipal\nApproximate Cost of Electric Light\nQu'Appelle School\n\n252841\n\n16 H.P.

Hugonard.\nMemorandum:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nWith reference to the matter of providing temporary quarters for the staff and pupils of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, I would recommend that the present carpenter shop, blacksmith shop, shoe-shop be fitted up at a small cost and converted into living quarters for these pupils who belong to the Agencies at a distance. By this arrangement it would mean that bench work in the carpenter shop would have to be discontinued for a time. The blacksmith could I think find some small building to carry on what work was absolutely necessary, when the present shop is being used for living quarters.\n\nThose children belonging to the Qu'Appelle Agency who can not be accommodated conveniently in the temporary quarters could be sent home to their parents until the Department has decided what action to take with regard to putting up new buildings. Of course a small sum of money will be required to fit up outbuildings. I do not think it would be wise to expend $5000.00 in erecting temporary buildings.\n\nA supply of clothing and bedding should be sent in at once for children returning to the reserves, as well as those remaining. I would recommend that $1,500.00 be placed at the credit of the Principal, for the purpose of purchasing furniture, stoves, cooking utensils, and other kitchen equipment. Many of the articles will have to be replaced at once. By having cash to purchase better bargains can be obtained.\n\nAs to the clothing I would suggest that the Principal be wired for a list of what is absolutely required, and whether they can be had in Winnipeg or not. As you are aware it is important that warm clothing should be provided at once.\nonce as the weather is likely to be quite severe at this time of the year.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\n8th January, 1904.\n\nI do not think that suitable clothing could be had at once in Winnipeg and that it would be wise to purchase in the East forwarded by Express.\n\nW.

A few of the younger children have been allowed to go home and those that were delicate if they had suitable homes.\n\nThe building above the root house, formerly the boys' junior class room, makes a capital temporary dining room and the paintshop is used as a kitchen; the children dine in sections, boys first then girls. Pending the arrival of Rev. Father Hugonard I have not done anything further than provide for immediate wants\u2014except to get in some loads of flooring which is being seasoned above the bake oven.\n\nMost of the books of real consequence for the transaction of business were saved.\n\nThe origin of the fire is a mystery. Mr. Tourigny who first noticed it tried to put it out with an overcoat and failing this ran 20 steps to the dining room and gave the alarm, inside of two minutes we had chemical extinguishers and hand grenades and water playing on the room.\nroom and passage, but the smoke from the burning neat's foot and fish oil was so overpowering and the spread of the flames so rapid that we soon saw there was no chance of saving the building--this was the original portion and entirely of wood--and directed our energy to saving bedding, clothing and provisions from the burning building and covering the out buildings with snow and blankets. The fire started at 12.40-45 and by two o'clock the buildings were in ruins. No personal property was saved. I had lent my coat and felt boots and so saved them. The boys were without caps or mitts and unfortunately in their oldest clothing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd.) E. D.

We have to be very thankful that it occurred in the daytime and\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6328, file 660-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nthere were no accidents. Had it happened in the night time the probable loss of life is awful to contemplate, as only who have had experience of fires say they have never seen one attended with such dense smoke volumes of choking smoke. In less than two hours from the commencement of the fire the last building fell.\n\nAs the fire originated in the boys' lamp-room I attach a rough diagram of that part of the building; the room was in a very central position as you can see. In the lamp-room there was a table on which the lamps were cleaned; above this table a shelf on which the lamps were placed when cleaned, and beyond the table a fixed shelf one foot from the ground floor made in the form of a sink and covered with galvanized iron\u2014on this shelf was placed the 5 gallon combination pump and oil-can and any spilt oil or leakage found its way there. Meatfoot oil, fish oil and boot blacking were kept under the table on a shallow portable galvanized...\niron covered trough on which the bushes and boot cleaning outfit were also kept. On the other side of the room was a rack in which the brooms were kept and an old doorway that had been converted into a cupboard; the boards had shrunk apart and though there was no door to the cupboard from the lamp-room, daylight could be seen through the cracks; this room and indeed all this part of the building was composed entirely of wood and two of the walls of the room were lined with tar-paper. There was no stove in this room, no furnace beneath it or furnace pipe into it, and there was no reason to expect any fire there. There were fire-pails, tanks with hose connections was in the main hall about 25 feet away.\n\nOn Monday 14th January the pupils and employees went into dinner at ten minutes past twelve, as usual, passing this room in going from the boys' assembly hall to the dining-room. At 20 minutes past twelve Mr. Sworder the clerk passed this room going to his office and noticed that the door was open; at about halfpast twelve the assistant farmer passed this room going from the office.\nwith the orders on Du Appelle Station given him by Mr Sworder. About 12:35 PM Mr Plapper, the tinsmith, passed this room going out from dinner to his tin shop; he did not notice any smoke or fire; but less than five minutes later heard the alarm and saw smoke issuing from the window of the lamproom. At 12:40 PM Mr Tourigny, the farming instructor came over from his house to transact some business in the office, he noticed a little blaze as he passed the lamp room, the fire was on the galvanized iron-covered shelf. Mr Tourigny immediately stepped into the room and removed the coal oil can from the shelf and carried it into the boys' assembly room; he returned immediately to the lamproom taking a coat from the wash room, the flame was now quite large and going up the wall, Mr Tourigny tried to smother it and then to beat it out, finding that it only spread rapidly in all directions he ran to the dining hall just as grace was being said and gave the alarm. The Assistant Principal immediately went out with some of the larger boys and Mr Sworder,\nthe clerk, and others at once took\nthe chemical extinguishers and\nhand grenades to the scene of\naction as the flames were then\nspreading rapidly in the passage\nway, and the grenades and chemical\nextinguishers were of very little\npractical use. Mr. Sworder turned\nthe hose on, but, though it had\nonly been used a short time before\nto try and flood the skating rink,\nit had become so dry the escaping\nwater prevented enough pressure\ngoing down the pipe to take the\nrink out; by this time the smoke\nwas so dense that efforts to use the\nhose further were abandoned and\nit was realized that there was no\nhope for the building.\n\nOn hearing of the alarm of\nfire Mr. Murphy, the junior teacher,\nmarched the boys out through the\nkitchen entrance; returning, he\ntold the Sisters who then marched\nthe girls to their dormitory where\nthey gathered up their blankets\nand bedding and marching down\ntook them to a safe place in their\nplayground; they endeavored to\ngo up to their dormitory again to\nget their dresses and many personal\neffects but owing to the dense\nvolumes of smoke were unable to\ndo so. After finding the fire\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6328, file 660-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nbeyond control Mr Sworder hastened to the dormitory to see that there were no boys there. The Assistant Principal had gone up another stairway for the same purpose, meeting in the dormitory, the Assistant Principal went up to the dormitory on the third story and found his retreat cut off and had to travel over some hundred feet of roofs before getting down; Mr Sworder returned through the smoke and after setting some employees to work at taking the books and papers from the office went round with ladders to the girls side of the building expecting to be able to save much of the property, thereafter seeing that hospital patients had all been removed efforts were made to enter the building through the windows but the dense volumes of choking smoke prevented this; the girls in the meantime had taken all the moveable articles from the junior girls' class rooms. Mr Sworder then returned to the office and endeavored to get to my office which was locked to get my books, on account of not being able to find the right key or at any rate to turn the bolt and as the flames were lapping the ceiling.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6328, file 660-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nover his head he retired, and taking his saddle and diving harness from a cupboard was in the act of bringing them out when the glass of the fan light cracked over his head and he felt the building rock, dropping the saddle etc. He jumped to the window and got out just as the woodwork supporting a heavy chimney gave way and the chimney fell dragging down the flooring with it. An attempt was made to get things from the store over the gymnasium but, apparently from an explosion of hot air, this part of the building was the first to fall; one of the boys was inside when it went and jumping through the window fell twenty-three feet to the ground without sustaining any injuries.\n\nThere was a strong west wind blowing at the time straight for the stable shops and it was feared these would go, so all the contents were removed. Over 300 sacks of flour were carried from the bake shop; bucket brigades were organized and snow and wet blankets placed on the most exposed portions of the buildings and guards stationed about the wood yards to prevent the fires.\nof dry wood taking fire\u2014a slight change in the wind at the critical moment facilitated the saving of the out buildings, even the hen house 8 feet from the burnt portion was saved, though many of the shingles were burnt from the roof and the window frames and sash were repeatedly on fire.\n\nThe employees and many neighbours worked hard and appear to have done everything possible under the circumstances.\n\nDuring the excitement some of the younger children started off home, but as soon as this was discovered conveyances were sent after them to bring them back.\n\nThe fact that the Employees living in the building all lost everything they had there shows the disinterestedness of their endeavours on behalf of their charges and the government property.\n\nA careful estimate places the loss as follows:\n\n| Buildings & fixtures | $9300.00 |\n|---------------------|----------|\n| Moveable contents   | $16500.00|\n| Private property    | $5000.00 |\n\nTotal loss: $70800.00\n\nThe buildings saved are:\n- Wash house: 50 x 18\n- Hen house: 44 x 16\nBoothouse with paintshop\njunior boys' classroom and\nshoeshop & store room\naddition to above\nBakery and flour store\nwith addition\nMill & Electric plant room\nSheds for coal, lime etc.\nCarpenter shop\nBlacksmith shop\nStables, Barns, Closets,\npig sty, sheds, root cellar, etc.\n\nArrangements were at once made for housing the children in the R.C. Mission Church and Public Schoolhouse; the paint and shoe shops were turned into dining-room and kitchen; a large stove was purchased; good tools and equipment were taken back to the shops and store houses; supper was served up at the usual time and the regular routine of work was carried out excepting that there has been no class work.\n\nThe Mission have kindly placed their church at our disposal\u2014except during Sunday service\u2014till a new school can be erected, and we are putting an upper floor in it\u2014an extension of the former gallery\u2014this supplies\nthe girls with a dormitory, class\nroom and playroom.\n\nAs we could not keep the\npublic school house and we\nfound other quarters were too\nscattered and inconvenient (not\nformal), a frame building was\nerected and is nearly complete; to\nbe used provisionally as boys\ndormitory, classroom and play\nroom.\n\nThe office and the men's\nquarters are in the tin shop above\nthe blacksmith shop and the\nshoemaker has removed to the\nupper story of the Carpenter shop.\n\nAbout three quarters of our\npupils or 170 are here at present,\nothers are returning daily of their\nown accord and I expect all will\nbe back in ten or fifteen days.\nThe school can be easily be\nkept going without material\nsuffering to the pupils though\nthe staff and especially the\nSisters will have to put up with\ngreat inconvenience, having to\nuse small and cold rooms for\nseveral purposes.\n\nI consider it most important\nto keep the school going here and\nat any rate to hold the older\nchildren; the mention made in\nthe Free Press that the children\nwere to be distributed to other schools brought Indians here from every reserve and especially from Crooked Lakes to protest against it and demanding their children. In my absence it was a source of much embarrassment to the staff allaying the fears of these people and providing sleeping accommodation and meals for them. Only one, an expatriate, gave his consent in case of necessity to the transference of his child to another school.\n\nThe many telegrams, letters and tokens of sympathy I have received clearly show how popular the rebuilding of the school will be. It will lessen the cost a great deal if the material is gathered during the winter and I would urge that a sum for this purpose be put on the supplementary estimates or appropriated from the unexpended Indian vote by an order in council.\n\nAlthough the loss amounts to over $70,000 and material and labor are higher now than when the buildings were erected and a steam heating system would cost more and I would suggest that it will be used; I would make $50,000 sufficient to build the school and refurnish it with\nwhat is most necessary.\n\nI am confident that the rebuilding would meet with general public approbation. Probably two buildings would be better than having all under one roof as heretofore, and I would suggest that the buildings be of less inflammable material if possible, and that advantage be taken of all modern improvements in school architecture to have a thoroughly up-to-date building.\n\nI do not think that any better or more convenient site could be selected than the old one, especially as there are so many thousands of dollars worth of buildings and improvements yet intact. The school was so centrally situated for so many reserves.\n\nBeing at some distance from the main farm is certainly a disadvantage but on the other hand the Government already own the property, have a great amount of money invested in improvements on it and know its defects and possibilities.\n\nThe distance from the railroad and cost of transportation from it to the school has been a considerable item, but this year instead...\nof going 18 miles we will have a railway about 7 miles away and there is every probability that one will be built into the valley before long; these nearer railroads should lessen this item.\n\nThe site of the buildings has proved healthy, is most picturesque, has a never failing water supply in the Qu'Appelle Lakes and is excellently situated for gardening and root growing facilities.\n\nThe N.W.M. Police rendered every assistance and had a guard on the ruins for three nights. The Commissioner telegraphed from Regina offering the use of tents or anything else he could supply as with\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOTTAWA, 28th January, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nRev. Father Hugonnard, Principal of Qu'Appelle Industrial school, forwards under date the 18th inst., a long report on the destruction of the main building of this institution by fire on the 4th instant.\n\nThe Principal was absent at the time of the fire and did not learn of the catastrophe until he reached Winnipeg on his way from Ottawa.\n\nThe fire started in the lamp room and though apparently accidental it must have resulted from carelessness in allowing the boys to have access to this room in the middle of the day when there was no work to be done there. I am surprised that a place of this description, where about 150 lamps were locked after and kept with a supply of coal oil and other inflammable matter, should ever have been allowed to be placed in the position shown on the sketch enclosed by Father Hugonnard.\n\nAfter the fire was discovered everything possible seems to have been done to put it out but with the start it had obtained they were unsuccessful and the whole building, with its valuable contents was destroyed entailing an estimated loss of $70,000.\n\nThe pupils and staff have been provided for temporarily, but if this school is to be kept on, new buildings will have to be put up at once. Father\nHugonnard says that he had about 170 of the pupils still on hand out of a total enrollment of 225 at the time of the fire, which was the number provided for by the Department.\n\nTo replace this school will entail a heavy expense and the Principal asks that $50,000.00 be at once included in the Supplementary Estimates to rebuild and furnish with the most necessary equipment.\n\nWith the difficulty experienced in obtaining pupils for industrial schools and the problematical results of their training while in such institutions, it is a question whether it is advisable to re-establish this school on the same lines as formerly, and also whether a smaller institution would not meet the requirements. In either case I consider that it would be better not to have all the work carried on in one building, as there will always be danger from fire in connection with these schools.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

General,-\n\nThe plans submitted by the Rev. Father Hugonard for the proposed new Boarding School at Qu'Appelle show the main building and two wings connected with the said main building with passages 50 feet long, in the basement and first floors. The main building is 120 ft. X 50 ft. and 51 ft. high from the ridge of the roof to the floor of the basement. The plans of the basement and three floors are furnished, but only the front view of the main building.\n\nThe specifications throughout are practically satisfactory for the purpose of executing the work by days' labour, under the superintendence of a foreman, or architect.\n\nIf the work should be let by contract, the specifications would require to be drawn out in more detail, especially under the headings of hardware, painting, heating, plumbing, water supply and lighting.\n\nI have discussed the plans and specifications with Father Hugonard, and drew his attention to the following points:-\n\nThe distance apart of joists is omitted; should be 16 inch centres.\n\nThere is no reference to the belfry in the specifications.\n\nThe posts marked on the plan 10 X 10 are not specified. They may be made smaller, but not less than 8 X 8. The beams are not specified.\n\nCentre walls should be constructed in the basement, instead of piers to carry the basement floor joists.\njoists, and these should be 2 X 10 instead of 2 X 6.\n\nThe stairs throughout the three buildings should not in any case be less than 4 feet wide.\n\nThe Vice Principal and the Sisters' bedrooms in the dormitories appear to be very narrow. Their width should be increased if convenient.\n\nThe idea of putting a safe inside of the chimneys, in order that space around them may be used for ventilation purposes, is certainly a good one. The air space, however, should be considerably greater. Father Hugonard explained that they would place ventilation pipes from the chimneys to the different dormitories and classrooms, which appear on the plans to have no ventilation provided. The plan proposed by the Rev. Gentleman would appear to be satisfactory.\n\nNo drainage from the building, or disposal of sewerage are specified. I discussed both these questions with Father Hugonard.\n\nThe heights of the different ceilings are specified to be, commencing at the basement, 9 - 10 - 12 and 10 feet respectively. The chapel from the floor to the top of the arch is 19 feet high. These heights cannot be very well increased, without adding considerably to the cost of the building, and I think they are sufficient for ventilation, and also any great height would increase the cost of heating. It is noted that the height of the building as shown on the plan does not correspond with the height of the stories as specified.\n\nI may add that should it be decided to let the work by contract, several more plans will be required of sections and front and end views of the different buildings.\nWater tanks should be specified and their positions shown on the plans.\n\nOrdinarily the cost of the three buildings complete should be from $75,000 to $90,000. If constructed in the manner proposed by the Rev. Father Hugonard, that is by utilizing the labour of some of the pupils, and having the work executed under the superintendence of a reliable man, the work will cost considerably less.\n\nChief Surveyor.\nOTTAWA, 12th April, 1904:\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nRev. Father Hugonnard, Principal of Qu'Appelle Industrial school, has submitted plans, specifications and estimates for the erection of buildings to replace those destroyed by fire on the 4th January last. The estimated cost of material and labor for the proposed new buildings amounts to $2,425;23 which the Chief Surveyor considers reasonable for the class of buildings proposed. This estimate is intended to provide accommodation for 225 pupils and the staff. At the time of the fire they had this number in residence and are now carrying 219, who are in temporary quarters.\n\nIf it is the intention of the Department to continue this school on the same scale as formerly, the accommodation asked for will be required and the proposal to have three semi-detached buildings would appear to be a better arrangement than to include all the different departments under one roof.\n\nThis school is one of the oldest in the Territories and has been satisfactorily and economically managed by the present Principal since it was started in 1864.\n\nThis school belongs to the Government and is carried on by the Roman Catholics on a per capita grant of $120 for each of 225 pupils, and the question before the Department is whether it will rebuild.\nand if so, for what number of pupils.\n\nIf it is decided to rebuild, Father Hugonnard is prepared to have the work done by day labor; tenders could be called for or it could be erected by the Public Works Department. Under proper supervision Father Hugonnard's proposition would appear to be the best.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It has been always a credit to the Department and has received the praises of the public in the press and otherwise.\n\nThe location is as good as can be found anywhere and has been often admired by visitors. Its proximity to the surrounding reserves has made the recruiting easier than for other schools situated on the Road lines or near towns. It has been the first, the largest and likely the best Industrial school and seems destined to be continued rather than any other.\n\nAround Qu'Appelle, some day schools and a boarding school were closed to send the children to Qu'Appelle School.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6328, file 660-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe shops, buildings and their contents saved from the fire are worth over $1200.00. The stock, implements, farm and garden are in a very good condition, and the public is anxiously expecting the rebuilding when it was, while boarding school would have to be on the reserve.\n\nThe principal training given to boys is in farming which every boy has to learn. Carpentry is also taught and found useful to boys. We have other shops which are needed for the school and the teaching done is it is useful to make boys handy and enable them to do their own work in the States. Industrial schools give the best results and a change to a boarding school would be a retrograde step.\n\nA colony of our ex-pupils at Tile Hill under Mr. Graham is giving good results and our school has been the means to bring ex-pupils from other reserves to that colony.\n\nThe cost of maintenance is less than in any other industrial school in the N.W.Territories and much less than in the States.\n\nThe School is running now with an attendance of 219 pupils.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ.

That in the opinion of your petitioners it is very desirable that a grant be made during the present session of the Dominion Parliament sufficient to rebuild the Indian Industrial School at Lebret, recently destroyed by fire;\n\n2nd. That your petitioners trust that you, as Minister of the Interior, will take the necessary steps for that purpose;\n\nAnd your petitioners will ever pray.\nOTTAWA, 30th May, 1904:\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of a petition from the residents of the Town and District of Indian Head recommending the rebuilding of the Qu'Appelle Industrial school recently destroyed by fire; and in reply I beg to inform you that this matter is now under consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nD.G.

The upstairs to be used as dormitory with two bed-room for the Sisters; the downstairs to be used as school rooms, play rooms, clothes room, sewing room, and hospital. It will be used during winter; it should therefore have two boards used inside and outside with paper between; the roof can be made of double boards instead of shingles which could not be taken off without damage.\n\nPresently the girls are in the Parish Church where a floor has been temporarily put upstairs. It is three hundred yards to be made before and after every meal, stormy or rainy day; and it was expected that permanent building would be put this summer. The cost will be about $1320.00. We require also lumber to make present office and bedroom warm enough for the winter, the cost of that lumber will be about $250.00, making a total of $1570.00.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) J.

The subject is one upon which, it seems to me, the Principal should have communicated direct with the Department. As he, however, has addressed the letter to the Commissioner I may perhaps venture to remark that it is a pressing necessity that adequate accommodation should be provided for the children of the School, who have been housed in the Mission Church since the destruction of the institution by fire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Indian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nThe question of rebuilding Qu'Appelle Industrial school is still undecided. The pupils to the number of nearly 200 are still in temporary quarters and if the school is to be continued, some provision will have to be made for comfortable housing them before winter sets in.\n\nFather Hugonnard has already submitted plans, specifications and estimates for the erection of buildings which would entail an expenditure of over $50,000, which the Chief Surveyor considers reasonable for the class of building proposed. This estimate is intended to provide accommodation for 225 pupils\u2014the number now authorized\u2014and the requisite staff. The old school site is considered suitable in every way, and shops and outbuildings to the value of about $12,000 are still intact. The school is one of the oldest in the Territories and has been satisfactorily and economically managed by the present Principal, who is able, under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church, to carry it on with a per capita grant of $120.\n\nThe Principal could make shift to carry on the school for a time if temporary buildings were provided and he has submitted an estimate, amounting to $1,570.00 for the erection of a temporary building for\nthe girls, who are now housed in the Church. Of course this would be a needless outlay if it is proposed to re-establish the school on the old basis.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Two hundred and twenty-five children is our authorized number and we have 319 at present in attendance.\n\nThe proposed buildings will cover 384 square feet less ground than the old buildings and have 768 square feet less floor area.\n\nThe following is an itemized statement of floor areas:\n\n| Building                  | Dimensions | Square Feet |\n|---------------------------|------------|-------------|\n| Old Building - Destroyed by fire |            |             |\n| Boys' Building            | 70' x 60'  | 4200        |\n| Gymnasium                 | 80 x 40    | 3200        |\n| Boys' Playroom            | 60 x 35    | 2100        |\n| Girls' Building           | 80 x 50    | 4000        |\n| Hospital Building         | 60 x 40    | 2400        |\n| Dairy                     | 16 x 14    | 224         |\n| Cellar                    | 10 x 10    | 100         |\n| Indian Parlor             | 20 x 24    | 480         |\n| Old Milk House            | 10 x 10    | 100         |\n| Outside Porches           | 20 x 10    | 200         |\n\nTotal ground space: 17244\n\nTotal floor area: 61684\nProposed Buildings\n\nMain Building 120' x 50' 6000 3 1/2 floors 22,000\nBoys do 80' x 50' 4000 4 \" 16,000\nGirls do 80' x 50' 4000 4 \" 16,000\n\nTotal ground space 14,000 Floor area 54,000\n\nThe proposed main building is to be\n120 x 50 feet each. All will have a basement\nand three floors. The height will be less\nthan that of some of the old buildings.\n\nThe cost of the three buildings is\nestimated at $52,098 which is much less\nthan the cost of the old buildings with\nthe additions and improvements that have\nbeen added from time to time, though the\nproposed new buildings will be much\nbetter adapted for school purposes than\nthe old ones were.\n\nIt is to be remembered that material\nand labor are high now and that three\nbuildings will necessitate a considerably\ngreater expense in erection and in plumb-\ning, lighting and heating plants than if\nthe whole school were under one roof.\n\nThe plans have been made with a\nview to the utmost economy of space and\nmaterial compatible with the convenient\nand necessary accommodation of staff\nand pupils and the estimate of the cost\nof the three buildings has been most\ncarefully gone into and is the lowest at\nwhich our experience leads us to believe\nthey can be properly constructed; and\nits lowness is partly based on my hope\nof an immediate appropriation being granted in order to get much of the material on the ground before the roads break up and work on the farm commences.\n\nThe Regina school\u2014one building I believe\u2014and built when labor and material was cheaper\u2014and much smaller than we require cost $48510.23 under the Public Works Department.\n\nThe boys department of our old school was erected in 1884 by contract and was more or less an experiment, in many ways it was unsuited for a school.\n\nThe building and maintenance of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School was decided by an Order in Council presented by the Deputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs\u2014Mr. Van Koughnet\u2014and approved in April 1884. Six hundred acres of land belonging to the Oblate Order at the Qu'Appelle R.C. Mission were handed to the Department by Archbishop Tache on the condition that the school would be established.\n\nThe rebuilding of the Elkhorn school, destroyed by fire, is a precedent, if any were required, for the rebuilding of the Qu'Appelle School which, I believe, has always been a credit to the Indian Department and has often elicited the praise of the Public in the press and otherwise and I am sure that when once decided upon the new school will be a credit in every way.\nto the present administration.\n\nAlthough we are eighteen miles north of the C.P.R. Roy and will be seven miles south of the Kirkella extension, the present location is conceded by those knowing it and the vicinity to be excellently adapted for an Indian school.\n\nIt is centrally situated for several groups of reserves and is on the line of communication used by the Indians visiting between the different Agencies.\n\nOur past freedom from contagious disease and fevers indicates that the location is healthy.\n\nThe first remark of nearly all visitors is praise of the natural beauty of the site and surrounding scenery.\n\nThough there are local stores a post office, a convent, public school and church we are four miles from the nearest liquor dealer and are immediately surrounded by a well established moral population; which are great points in favor of our present location as against being in or near a railroad town.\n\nAll our out buildings and shops, stables, barns and granaries amounting in value to over $10,000 are intact with most of their equipment.\n\nThe farm and gardens are in first class order well fenced with stone walls and pickets, board, or wire fences.\n\nIn order to reduce the cost and to\ninsure the completion of the building before winter it is most important that the material and labor should be secured at once.\n\nThough the Mission and congregation do not begrudge the use of their church by our girls, under the circumstances, still it cannot be denied that over 100 girls using the building for dormitory, class and play room cause more wear and tear, especially to the pews, wainscoting and woodwork, than 20 years of normal use.\n\nFrom the many expressions of good will and constant enquiries and the surprise expressed that there should be any delay in proceeding with rebuilding the school I am confident that the Public expects the school to be rebuilt at once and will highly approve the expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. Hugonard\nPrincipal\nSir,\n\nAs applications are coming in for transfers and admissions to the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, I should be obliged to be advised as to what it is proposed to do in regard to providing accommodation for pupils there, in lieu of the quarters destroyed by fire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Father Hugonnard estimates that the sum of $1570.00 will be required for the erection of a temporary building for the girls who are now housed in the church. In addition to this bedding and clothing to replace that destroyed in the fire, amounting to $1500.00 will also be wanted to put them through the winter. See Father Hugonnard estimate dated 29th June last on No. 21A of this file. If funds can be found out of this year's estimates provision should, I consider, at once be made for the purposes above set forth, as it would, I consider, be most unfortunate to break up the school now. The children would have to be sent home which is not advisable. If the Department agrees to this expenditure, the Indian Commissioner would be the proper officer to direct how it is to be made.\n\nIndian Affairs.

On the other hand I was told lately by Dr. Bell of Winnipeg, an eminent authority on bacteriology, that in all cases scrofula pus contains the germs of tuberculosis and I am informed by those who have had most accurate knowledge with reference to Indians that they had scrofula before the contact with white people.

Tucker of Moose Woods on the subject of Industrial Schools, requesting from me a report on the said letter.\n\nWith reference to the three ex-pupils of Regina Industrial School referred to in that letter I beg to call your attention to the fact that Lucy Little Crow only attended our School one year, Becky White Cap one month and Sam Buffalo seven months. Mr. Tucker seems to be taking a good deal for granted when he assumes, as apparently he does, that these three pupils in the short periods during which they attended our School, caught consumption here. If his implied opinion that the other Industrial Schools are responsible for all these cases of consumption rests upon as slim basis as this, I do not think the letter deserves to be considered very seriously. Of course, I am not in a position to say that Becky White Cap in one month and Sam Buffalo in seven months did not contract consumption in this School.\n\nAs for the marriage of Lucy Little Crow; she was sixteen years of age when she came to this School, only stayed one year and consequently the School can hardly be expected to have made a very profound impression on her character. And as for her marriage to a strange Indian on her return to the Reserve and the Indian's elopement with another young woman, I should say that the responsibility for such misfortunes or irregularities should certainly rest upon the Missionary and Agent in\ncharge of the Reserve where these things happened rather than on the School where she spent so short a period. Mr. Tucker does not say, however, that Lucy has misbehaved. I find that the late Principal apparently did what he could to make an impression during her residence here, as it appears that she got two floggings and other punishment, but it certainly seems absurd to hold the School responsible for the conduct of the pupil who came in at the age of sixteen and spent only one year in the institution.\n\nRegarding Sam Buffalo I am credibly informed that he died of hemorrhage on his way home after having obtained leave of absence to visit his parents. Here again, considerable is taken for granted when Mr. Tucker makes the statement that he died of consumption.\n\nSpeaking generally for our School in connection with the spread of consumption all I can say is that every possible precaution is taken to prevent contagion or the development of the disease and after visiting quite a large number of Day and Boarding Schools, as well as several Industrial Schools, I have no hesitation in saying that I believe the precautions taken in this direction in Industrial Schools are certainly more effective than in the majority of the Boarding Schools. In our School we not only watch the pupils carefully to detect the first indications of disease, but every boy and girl in the institution is weighed in their night dress once a month and a record of such weights, together with height and chest measurements is kept in a book provided for the purpose. The Matron and Assistant-Principal, who make these weights and measurements, turn in to me a record each month of all losses.\nin weight since the previous month. The condition and habits, appetite &c. of those who have lost in weight are carefully noted, and steps taken by means of alteration of diet, fresh-air tent treatment and change of work, to prevent further loss and bring about recovery. If there is any suspicion of disease the Doctor's attention is called on the occasion of his next visit, when he makes a careful examination and if necessary prescribes medical treatment.\n\nBy these precautions and good circulation maintained in the main building and dormitories and the use of four large tents, (two for boys and two for girls,) I am satisfied that we are not only providing more favorable conditions for our pupils than most Day or Boarding Schools, but conditions very much superior to those existing in their homes on the Reserves.\n\nIn spite of all these precautions, of course, it is true that from time to time cases of consumption develop in the School. Where there is any suitable home to which to send the pupil we ask leave of your office to send the pupil home. There are cases, however, in which it is impossible to send the pupils home because of their family circumstances, but in all cases where they are retained in the School they are kept separated as far as possible from contact with the other pupils and every precaution taken to prevent contagion.\n\nI must say that I am very much surprised at Mr. Tucker's statement that they have only had one death from consumption in ten years except those who brought the disease from the Industrial Schools. Either Mr. Tucker is laying a heavy account to the charge of the Industrial Schools, and as we have pointed out on a very slim foundation, or they have had a much lower mortality on his reserve than in all the reserves with which I\nam familiar. Two years ago this summer I had the promise of two pupils from Okanaise Reserve who were to be brought to the School the following Christmas. Before Christmas time came one of them had taken sick and on that account neither of the girls was brought. Before spring the sick one died of consumption and subsequently the other sister was reported as having contracted the disease. Last autumn two pupils were promised me from Pipestone Reserve and I was lamenting that owing to inability to get to the Reserve late in the fall the pupils were not secured. This summer, however, I found that both these children had died of consumption on the Reserve. These children had never been at any School and I am not aware that they had any contact with any pupils who had been at school.\n\nI have seen in my predecessor's correspondence a letter from the Commissioner's office in answer to a report made by the late Mr. McLeod on this subject, in which he had made a comparison of the mortality in this Industrial School with the mortality of children on the Reserves; and apparently in the opinion of the Commissioner a good case had been made out in favor of the Industrial Schools from a health standpoint.\n\nRegarding sending children home from the Industrial Schools with consumption, since apparently that is the disease Mr. Tucker has reference to, it is an easy matter for Mr. Tucker to call it \"a crime.\" There are others who consider it a wrong policy to retain them in the School after they have contracted the disease. I am somewhat at a loss to know therefore, how a policy can be adopted that will suit all parties. In the majority of cases parents pledge us to send their children home in case of sickness, and there seems to be no choice in the matter.\nAs for the spread of the disease on the Reserve that is a matter, the responsibility for which I think, rests with the authorities on the Reserve.\n\nI know it is a commonly accepted view that the Indians were free from consumption until their contact with white men and the sending of their children to the schools. On the other hand I was told lately by Dr. Bell of Winnipeg, an eminent authority on bacteriology, that in all cases scrofula pus contains the germs of tuberculosis and I am informed by those who have had most accurate knowledge with reference to Indians that they had scrofula before the contact with white people.

Tucker's letter on the health of Indian Children attending Industrial Schools.\"\n\nThe health of the pupils of these schools appears to be one of the greatest problems we have to grapple with and I fear that there is some ground for the allegations of Mr W.R. Tucker though probably his statements are greatly overdrawn. But it is a fact that the Indian people of the Northwest live largely in the open air, and the close confinement of such houses as we are accustomed to does not appear to be favourable to their health. I notice that on the reserves I visit the people live in tepees in the summer season, and it is well they cannot adjust themselves all at once to the conditions of life of the white man. Probably in our schools we may have erred a little in not keeping the children a larger portion of the time in the open air. It is a sad fact that consumption has carried off a large number, not merely in connection with the Red Deer School but most of others so far as I can learn. Not but what the disease has also made great inroads also among those who have not attended school on the reserves, and I cannot believe that the pupils returning from school have been the means of communication in all cases, or in many, as Mr Tucker suggests, in order to meet the difficulty suggested in Mr Tucker's letter and that weighs upon my own heart as well as his.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6328, file 660-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndustrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\n\nHon. David Laird\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nAug. 17th, 1904.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAccording to your request I herewith enclose a few comments on Mr. Tucker's Communication to the Department re Consumption in Industrial Schools.\n\nBeing personally acquainted with Mr. Tucker, his good work for the Indians on his reserve, also some of his views on the Education of the Indian, I am not surprised at this expression against Industrial School Education. I do not for one moment doubt the facts he relates regarding the children who have attended such schools from the Moosewoods Reserve but I differ with him in some of the conclusions that he arrives at.\n\nAs far as it concerns the two pupils he mentions that have attended the Brandon School but little comment is necessary.\n\nAngie Ten was not a strong girl and was not well when she left the school but shortly after leaving she was married and I was not aware of her death until I learned from his communication. It would be just as easy for me to assert she inherited the disease as for Mr. Tucker to assert that she contracted it at the school, the assertion in either case proves nothing. In her case I believe that it was a development of an inheritance.\n\nThe 2nd pupil, Charles Eagle who has now from 30 to 40 head of cattle, 20 horses, good implements etc., to which may be added about the best Indian he has on the Reserve argues well for Industrial Schools and higher Education for the Indian boy. In fact this a good illustration of the opinion of some men viz. if we are ever going to accomplish any lasting good for the Indian we must educate him. Regarding the peculiarities of the cases mentioned who have attended other schools I know nothing.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6328, file 660-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. Tucker blames Eddie Whitecap for the death of three others of the family. The Whitecap family appears to be one of many where the whole of the children are Tubercular. There are many such where not a child has been to a non-reservation school. The chances are that this family would have gone in that way had Eddie not been at an Industrial School.\n\nIt is unfortunate that 4 out of the 7 who attended industrial schools have died of Consumption, but according to Mr. Tucker there has been four others who have died in the same time of the same disease. It is a great mistake to blame Industrial Schools for the introduction of consumption to reserve life. The Indian died of consumption long before we had Industrial schools and if all the Industrial schools were closed he will still die of the same disease and it is probable that there is none other he needs to fear so much. And the best way to overcome the difficulty is to give him all the education possible, for whatever objection can be raised against the education of the red boy applies with equal force against educating a black boy, a green boy, or a white boy.\n\nI agree with Mr. Tucker that no child with a contagious disease should be sent back to the reserve to spread the contagion. But what are we to do with those who develop consumption in an Industrial School? They should not be kept where there is danger of contaminating the whole school. If there is a home for the child to go to on the reserve, it is certainly the best solution before us at present. I have a case on my hands at present where there is no home to go to and I do not propose to send her to die as a pauper on the reserve, for such cases there ought to be something provided and that at the earliest possible date.\n\nThe fact that four out of the seven who went from the Moosewoods Reserve have died suggests something re the policy of securing pupils for Industrial Schools.\nMany of those who labor on the reserve for the education of the Indian are in the same boat with Mr. Tucker who are against sending children off the reserve of course they always have an exception in cases of special character, such as poor orphan with no one to take care of it, or unmanageable individuals that the reserve is well without. From such unpromising material recruits are easily obtained, hence they frequently find their way into Industrial Schools. It is such children who usually go back to the reserve life, and the industrial school is blamed for making them rogues. One fact is carefully forgotten viz., that if a child is a rogue before it goes to school it will very likely be one when it returns only it will be a different kind of a rogue.\n\nI would not say what Mr. Tucker implies viz., do away with the Industrial Schools. We have more of them at present than the Indian appreciates or at least more than can be properly filled with children of the right standard, under the present method of securing pupil and maintaining the schools. There ought to be some policy whereby only the best children morally, mentally and physically are allowed to attend these Industrial Schools.\n\nThe Indian in the Body Politic is no problem but the Indian on a reserve is a problem, and there must be a non-reservation school through which the Indian boy and girl may find a way from the filth and pauperism of the ordinary reserve life. Close up this door and all other doors of escape, keep the red man huddled on the reserve, continue to give him rations and treaty and the filth and pauperism will continue to the end of the chapter. Better far to burn the ration house, commute with him for his treaty, and in every possible way, labor toward the destruction of the reservation life. The process may be slow, and the time long, but never until then will this vexed and difficult problem be solved.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6328, file 660-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st June covering a copy of a communication to the Department from Mr W.R. Tucker of the Moose Woods Reserve giving his views as to the rebuilding of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School; I would infer from the document that Mr Tucker is adverse to re-building the school and biased against all Industrial Schools in favor of Day Schools; basing his antagonism on the alleged fact that one pupil from this school and some pupils from other Industrial Schools have died of consumption on their return to the Reserve.\n\nI can only deal with the case of Joseph Road (and in consequence of the destruction in the fire of many of our books not in current use I am rather handicapped,) Joseph Road ex-pupil No 254 did not die here, as stated by Mr Tucker, but was reported to me as having died on the reserve the year after his discharge; which was granted in consequence of the persistent demands of his parents to have him home to assist them. Joseph Road was always a delicate boy but as the infirmaryman, myself and others recollect was never on our sick list; copies of our Quarterly School Returns for the two years he was here would give you this information; he was learning the carpentry trade while here and was getting along well. He came of a consumptive family, other members having died of the disease who never attended Industrial Schools.\n\nIn connection with Mr Tucker's statement I would refer to an investigation that I recollect was made some years ago by the\n\nThe Indian Commissioner.\n\nWinnipeg.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have had some experience among Indians, having been over thirty years in close contact with them, living in their encampment while engaged in the buffalo hunt, as well as on their reserves, extending over an area from Lake Winnegosis to the Rocky Mountains and from the United States to a considerable distance North and I have always found consumption the prevalent disease amongst them. Mr Tucker's Reserve must have been the exception to all other Reserves as regards the health of the Indians, and perhaps his knowledge of Day Schools on Reserves is limited to the one Mrs Tucker teaches. I believe the Indian Department both of Canada and the United States did not find the Day School system a success towards the civilization and progress of the Indian Children attending them. In this district the Dept has done away with Boarding Schools and Day Schools on Standing Buffalo's, Pasqua, Pianot the Assiniboins and Poor Man's Reserves sending the children to Qu'Appelle and Regina Industrial Schools. The future progress and civilization of the Indian children is largely dependent on an environment of civilized and industrial life, not usually found on the Reserves and nowhere should conditions more conducive to the desired end.\nand be found than in Industrial Schools situated off the Reserves in prosperous agricultural districts\u2014\n\nIn Boarding Schools on or near the Reserves, the children are usually so much in contact with their relations that they retain much of the old tribal superstitions and mode of thought and hear the lamentations of their elders for the good old days, when there was no Indian Agent or Farm Instructor to bother them about work, and when they did not have to till the land, make hay, or feed cattle, but could steal horses, fight, hunt buffalo, feast and dance. It has been frequently been remarked by persons competent and in a position to judge and also stands to reason, that as a general rule pupils educated away from the Reserves and only seeing their relatives for a limited period each year have more progressive ideas and are more ambitious than those permanently residing on the Reserves.\n\nI understand that the objections to Industrial Schools are the cost of maintaining them, the difficulty of recruiting and the uselessness of the Indians learning trades.\n\nAs to cost\u2014the Qu'Appelle Industrial has always cost less than the Industrial Schools in the United States, where it would be natural to expect the minimum cost as many of the schools are larger, freight rates and the cost of every thing except beef and flour is lower and there are better opportunities for disposing of surplus products.\n\nThis school has a record of being the least expensive of similar schools in the N.W.T., I believe.\n\nAs regards recruiting, this is certainly difficult, but if the Department enforced the law as regards Indian children attending school, I am confident there would be no difficulty in maintaining our number complete under the present circumstances we seldom fall short of 225. Our success in keeping up our attendance is largely due to the central location of this school with regards to the surrounding reserves, the school being on a main road from the reserves to another and near the bridge crossing the Qu'Appelle River.\n\nAs\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6328, file 660-5, part 1)\nAs regards trades. The educational tendency of the day for the poorer classes of white people is extending more and more on technical and industrial lines; if this is an advantage in equipping people who live in an environment of active industry and progress for the battle of life the necessity for such instruction must be far greater for our Indians whose entire mode of life has been changed to make them self-supporting. You can see by our monthly trade instruction returns that our shops are active industries, and that the aggregate earnings amount to a considerable sum, and the class of work done is of a most varied and practical kind.\n\nNo intelligent person will deny that a knowledge of carpentry is a great help on a farm. Our carpenter shop besides doing all the work for the schools, erecting temporary buildings and making alterations after the fire, earned in cash for work performed for outsiders over $2000.00 during the past fiscal year. At present our carpenters are building an Agent's house, a Farm Instructor's house and a barn 30 x 60 on reserves in the Qu'Appelle Agency. We are building a Church at Indian Head and would have taken other contracts had we not hoped to be fully employed rebuilding our own school. Besides building and carpentry work all kinds of repairs are done to rigs and farm machinery from threshing machines down, and new vehicles are made for customers.\n\nThe Blacksmiths and Tinsmiths repair anything from engine boilers to tin kettles. Shoemaking, harness making and repairing are useful industries anywhere though as very few will follow them as a means of livelihood, boys are not kept at these trades long as a rule. Various boys do Painting and Baking.\n\nThe trades combined with our farm and gardens which are second to none in the Territories form an environment of varied interests, industry and progress that cannot help but be most beneficial to the Indian youth.\n\nAfter the Indians of Canada passed under the British Crown which became responsible for\nfor their welfare, the representatives of the Crown often urged the Government to continue the industrial training commenced by the Jesuit Fathers, as may be seen in the official documents in the Indian Department at Ottawa.\n\nThe mistake often made in judging Industrial Schools is that too much is expected from the first generation. Pupils frequently return to Reserves where little or no interest is taken in them and have to struggle along as best they can; whereas an interest has been taken in graduates as a rule do well. Indians are indolent, careless of the future and easily influenced by their surroundings. Unless graduates are properly handled immediately on their return to the Reserve they are apt to retrograde more or less and the schools are to blame. We have many graduates who having been properly handled on leaving school, particularly at File Hills are becoming large and successful farmers.\n\nI contend that an Industrial School conveniently located for the Reserves and properly managed does much more efficient work than Boarding Schools; which are again much better than Day Schools, and I would point out further that with the rapid settlement in this district increasing opportunities for earning a living by following their trades will be offered to graduates wishing to do so.\n\nAs Mr Tucker refers to the rebuilding of this School, I would ask you to have in mind the facts, that twenty years experience has proved the healthiness of this location; everyone knowing it comments on its natural beauty and the splendid water privileges we enjoy; that we are in one of the largest and most progressive farming districts of the West; that when the School was established by an Order-in-Council Archbishop Tache presented the Government with Six hundred acres of land for its location; that the Lebret Mission paid $625. for the right to the piece of land, which is now the site of what is left of the School buildings, and that this site and the 600 acres of land were handed to the Government for the special and exclusive purpose of having...\nhaving an Indian Industrial School, that the trade shops, granaries, barns, laundry, store rooms and other out buildings remain are worth about $12000, that the stone and picket fences, wire fences, shrubbery gardens and farming and pasture lands are being worked and cared for as usual and are a valuable asset, that we have about 220 children in actual attendance whose parents would rather take them home than send them elsewhere, that though called an Industrial School the name Indian Agricultural School would be more appropriate as the trades are subordinate to farming, which is our main feature, that we have over three hundred acres of land under cultivation and cultivate it on the most approved lines in vogue on the Experimental Farm at Indian Head which is our nearest station on the Railway, that all the different branches of mixed farming are taught, the girls learning milking, dairying and poultry raising. We have 75 head of cattle and horses and 67 pigs, and that this school has I believe always given the Department and Public sufficient satisfaction in economy of management, number in attendance, progress, and efficiency, to justify its being rebuilt, especially as the conditions on the Reserves from which we draw pupils and the rapid development of the country adjacent to them, owing to improved railway facilities are exerting a powerful influence towards progress and civilization among the Indians and will present opportunities hitherto nonexistent for the practical utilization of their trades by our graduates, in the vicinity of their homes, and even on the reserves themselves, where increased farming operations and prosperity will create a demand for skilled labor. It is now expected that all the boys will follow the trades they were learning at the school except the farming. The trades we have are all required for the institution the boys are working at it, learn to do their own work and several of our boys do their own blacksmithing, carpentry and...\nand shoemaking on the Reserves. The work done in the shops create around the pupil that atmosphere of industry which is a very important factor in their education and which replaces in them the Indian idea by ideas of industry and civilization.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nSig J. Hugonard,\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 13th June last, covering copy of letter from Mr. or Mrs. W. R. Tucker, of Moose Woods, calling attention to result of observations of Indian children from the Day School on the Indian Reserve there, who have attended Industrial Schools, and have returned to the Reserve with the seeds of consumption and spread the disease amongst the other Indians, I beg to say that a copy of the Tucker letter was forwarded to each of the Principals of the Industrial Schools mentioned therein, and a report asked for on same, copies of which are placed herewith for the information of the Department.\n\nThe reports of the Principals to a large extent break the force of the Tucker charges. At any rate the range of observation on a small reserve like the one at Moose Woods is too limited to warrant the general conclusion that the attendance of Indian children at Industrial Schools tends to spread consumption both at the schools and on the reserves. There is much truth in the remark of Rev. T. Ferrier, of Brandon School, in his report at page 3, to the effect that poor orphans with no\n\nSecretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\none to take care of them or unmanageable individuals that\nthe reserve is well without\u2014and I may add somewhat sickly\nchildren\u2014are the recruits most easily obtainable on the\nreserves, hence they find their way into the Industrial\nSchools.\n\nI attach great weight also to the statement of Rev.\nFather Hugonard, Principal of the Qu'Appelle School, made\non page 2 of his report, and which agrees pretty much with\nmy own previous information with respect to disease amongst\nthe Indians. Father Hugonard says:\u2014 \"I have had some experi-\nence among Indians, having been over thirty years in close\ncontact with them, living in their encampment while engaged\nin the Buffalo hunt, as well as on their reserves, extend-\ning over an area from Lake Winnipegosis to the Rocky Moun-\ntains and from the United States to a considerable distance\nNorth and I have always found consumption the prevalent dis-\nease amongst them. Mr. Tucker's Reserve must have been the\nexception to all other Reserves as regards the health of the\nIndians, and perhaps his knowledge of Day Schools on Reserves\nis limited to the one Mrs. Tucker teaches\".\n\nThe Principals of Regina and Qu'Appelle Industrial\nSchools refer to a comparison said to be made by the Indian\nCommissioner some years ago as to the mortality in Indian\nIndustrial Schools and of children on the reserves, and that\nit was highly favorable to the Schools. This is a misunder-\nstanding; there was no real comparison instituted, though\nin 1899 I had the average percentage of deaths in Industrial\nSchools made out and it was not at all alarming. I have re-\ncently had the reports of such schools gone over for the five\nyears beginning with 1898-9 and ending with 1902-3, and find\nthat the average mortality was 4 per cent. Then I took pay-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6328, file 660-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\npay-sheet returns for the year 1902 of ten of the Indian Agencies from which most of our school pupils are taken and found that the mortality of the children of the bands of the said ten Agencies amounted to 4.40 per cent. As I consider 1902 was an average year, the comparison is not unfavourable to the Schools. Indeed, I have reason to believe that consumption and other diseases are just as prevalent and fatal on the Reserves as in the Schools.\n\nBut as Rev. Mr. Ferrier, Principal of the Brandon Industrial School, points out on page 2 of his report, what is to be done with the pupils who develop consumption in an Industrial School? They should not be kept where there is danger of contaminating the whole school. This is very true, but it is equally undesirable that they should be sent home to the reserve to spread infection there. It appears to me that it might be a practical solution of the difficulty to turn one of our Industrial School buildings, which is not conveniently situated for getting recruits, into a sanitarium for consumptive Indians from the schools and the reserves, to give them proper treatment and prevent the spread of the disease. We are paying almost as much for board and treatment at hospitals now, as would support a medical attendant, two or three nurses and provide supplies for such a sanitarium.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nOTTAWA, September 28th\u20141904.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nFor the Deputy Sup't. General.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner under date of the 16th inst. forwards reports from the Principals of some of our Industrial schools relative to charges made by Mr. and Mrs. Tucker of Moose Woods referred to in my memo of even date in regard to Calgary School.\n\nThe Rev. Father Hugonnard, to whose statement the Commissioner attaches great weight, in his report makes a very strong plea for the re-building and continuance of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School and sets forth his reasons in favor of industrial education for Indians in a very able manner which are also endorsed by the Rev. T. Ferrier, Principal of the Brandon Industrial School who made a separate report on the subject of the spread of tuberculosis and the re-building of Qu'Appelle School.\n\nMr. Sinclair of the Regina School has also reported and an extract is enclosed from letter of Principal Rice of the Red Deer Industrial School dealing with Mr. Tucker's letter. These reports are dealing with the spread of consumption and the suggested remedies to prevent the spread of the disease as well as the question of maintenance of industrial schools, and are well worthy of your careful perusal and will be found hereunder.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is estimated that $1570.00 will be required for the erection of a temporary building for the girls who are now housed in the church and $1500.00 for bedding and clothing to replace that destroyed in the fire. Funds are available to meet this expenditure and I would recommend that it be made, the Department in no way, however, to be committed to the continuance of the school.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6328, file 660-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nThe Minister having decided that the Qu'Appelle school is to be rebuilt I should like to be instructed as to what action is to be taken to carry out the Minister's directions. You will see that Mr Sifton in his memo. says \"Prepare estimate for re-building school\". On the 3rd March last Rev.Father Hugonnard submitted plans and specifications and an estimate for the erection of buildings to replace those destroyed by fire on the 4th January last. His estimate amounted to $22,425.23 for the cost of material and labor. The plans and specifications were examined by the Chief Surveyor,and you will see from his memo. of the 11th April last turned out on this file,that he considered the amount reasonable for the class of buildings proposed. Father Hugonnard's intention was to erect three buildings,a main building 120 ft.by 50 ft.;a boy's building 80 ft.by 50 ft.and a girls buildingof the same dimensions,all to have a basement and three floors. He proposes to place the boys and girls buildings 50 ft.in rear of the main building and 50 ft.apart. Mr Inspector Graham considers that the distance is not sufficient and suggests that the buildings be at least 75 ft.from each other. This would afford greater protection in case of fire and would not alter the cost.\n\nI see that the Indian Commissioner has included a sum of $54,500 in his next year's estimates for the re-building and equipment of this school.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Hugonnard for this school are in the main approved of. Your objection to the proximity of the three buildings has been noted and if the contour of the ground permits, the Department would approve of your suggestion to extend the distance between each building to 75 feet, or 60 ft. at the least.\n\nThe Department has learned that concrete can be advantageously used in a building of this class, and it would like to have your opinion upon this point and whether you would consider it a good substitute for brick, and if so, could the blocks be manufactured on the ground, and how the cost would compare with brick.\n\nThe Department will be able to expend the sum of $25,000 in the purchase of material this winter and if it is necessary to extend the purchase beyond this sum, no doubt arrangements could be made to defer payment.\n\nW.M.

There seems to be a great difference of opinion as to whether buildings made of this material will not crack or absorb moisture.\n\nSome of the buildings I have examined were cracking and I am told this is accounted for by the fact that the proportions were not properly mixed. Whether this is the case or not it convinced me that there would be a risk in putting up a building of such material. I find that the cost of a building built of this material would be slightly more than one of brick veneer.\n\nOn making inquiries I find that the lumber required for this school can be purchased locally to good advantage. Both dealers at Balcarres, D.H. Macdonald and the Imperial Lumber Co. will sell lumber at a very low cost. The main quantity (dimensions and common)\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6328, file 660-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\ncommon boards) can be supplied at about twenty-two to twenty-four dollars per thousand on track which is about eight miles from building site. I consider it advisable to purchase from these parties as they are local firms and I do not think the Department could do much better if they dealt direct with the wholesale men of British Columbia or Ontario.\n\nIn my opinion it would not be advisable to ask the principal to confine his purchases to one of the parties mentioned as he has been dealing with both firms in the past and has received good satisfaction and besides there will be times that a certain class of material will be required that one might have and the other would.\n\nMost of the dimensions and common lumber will have to be purchased from one firm to enable them to get a rate from the wholesalers that will pay them to sell at the price they quote to the Department. Outside of this class of lumber there will be a large quantity of material required which will be divided as the Principal sees fit.\n\nI have made enquiries regarding brick and I am told by Father Hugonnard that Mr. C. Pelletier of Katerwa, can supply the required quantity (kiln run) at $7.50 per thousand at his brick yard which is about eleven miles from the school. It will cost $2.00 per thousand for hauling.\n\nA great deal of the hauling can be done by school\nschool teams, I understand. The teamsters, Indian boys, should be paid wages while at this work; the money thus earned could be funded for them.\n\nWith regard to the hardware required, Mr. Walker, of Indian Head, agrees to supply this at the same rate as Father Hugonnard has been buying in the past, that is wholesale traders' prices.\n\nWith reference to the paying of mechanics, laborers etc. employed at this work, I would suggest that the Principal be instructed to have a time book kept and at the end of each month to have a pay list made up. Wages could be paid from an accountable cheque. I enclose herewith a form of pay-list that I would suggest should be used and if this is approved of a supply could be printed.\n\nThe payment of material should be made as promptly as possible in order to avoid any chance of confusion, and the Principal should insist in having accounts from merchants at the time of the delivery of goods. These accounts should be certified to by the Principal and could be paid out of an accountable cheque if you see fit. In this way accounts could be settled promptly and every now and again a batch of these could be sent to Ottawa with a statement just showing how the balance of the accountable cheque stand.\n\nA separate set of books will be kept with the building transactions, through which all the accounts and vouchers will be passed.

B. H. McDonald and The Imperial Lumber Co., both of Balcarres.\n\nAs soon as the material has been delivered on the building site and has been measured by an official of the Department competent to do so, the accounts should at once be forwarded to the Department after being properly certified to by yourself.\n\nThe Department understands that a great deal of the hauling of building material can be done by the School teams. The Indian boy pupils thus employed as Teamsters will be paid the money to be funded for them.\n\nIt is desired that a separate set of books should be kept in connection with the erection of this building through which all the accounts and vouchers should be passed and they will be subject to frequent inspection by Mr. Inspector Graham.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Rev.

It will take about $6000.00 to do the work.\n\nI also ask that an amount of $2000.00 be placed in the estimates to keep the school in repair. An Institution of this kind requires a certain amount to keep the building up.\n\nI would ask also that $5000.00 be placed in the estimates to replace some old ramshackle buildings that disfigure the premises. These are used as blacksmith and carpenter shop. Twelve years ago I intended to replace these buildings but for good reasons this never was done. I would be glad if this item would be authorized.\n\nI do not think the school building requires painting next year, I went over it closely last\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nand have decided it can last for another year at least before being repainted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

The explanation for the higher charge is that Mr. Maisonniveau had offers of work by others at $5.00 a day and in order that the work of repairs at the school might be proceeded with without interruption Mr. Maisonniveau was promised $4.00 a day to complete the work he had commenced.\n\nThe preparation of the first voucher was made in the office without knowledge of the facts and I beg to recommend for payment the one enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that the play rooms in both the boys' and girls' departments at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School require re-flooring. In my opinion it is useless to put down fir as it seems to go in no time there is so much gravel and the children wear heavy nailed boots. This work can be done very well during the winter season and if there are funds available I would be glad to have your authority to have the work done.\n\nIn addition to this there is a complete set of built-in seats with lids to hold boots and other articles of clothing which should be replaced, this could also be done during the winter months.\n\nThere is also considerable painting to be done throughout the interior.\n\nThe tables in the dining room are covered with zinc which is worn through. The legs are shaky and I am told by the carpenter who went over the work with me that it would not be economy to fix them up as they would not be satisfactory. A dining table should be built with either bass wood or white pine top.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe SECRETARY,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nReferring to my letter of the 23th September in regard to provision for expenditures for the next fiscal year at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, and your No.114-0-5 of the 3rd instant, I beg to request that provision may also be made in the Estimates for the following additional requirements at the school:\n\n1... Pig Sty.\nFencing to be erected around the new buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that I made an inspection of the barns at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School last week and found them nearing completion.\n\nThere are several matters I wish to bring to your attention regarding the buildings.\n\nThe barns should have save troughing. Already with the heavy rains there are trenches along the concrete and it will be no time before the earth will cut away from the foundation. The roofs are large and the water can be saved and turned into a hundred gallon tank that is necessary, in order to carry out the system of having water in front of the animals at all times. The cost of putting on save troughing would be very little and I would be glad if you would authorize me to have this done.\n\nWith regard to the water system in the stables, you are aware that it requires an automatic supply in order to keep water in front of the animals, it is therefore necessary to have a hundred gallon tank put in each building. If this is not done the animals will have to be taken outside and watered at the well, which of course is not satisfactory. I am getting Messrs. Paulin and Swaze to give me figures on this and when I receive them I will forward them to you. In the meantime I would like to have authority to go ahead with the work. Water will be run into the tanks from the roof and from the well.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nI may say that when I was at Lebret I was assured that we would be able to put the cattle in the stables on the night of the 26th of this month.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\nSouthern Saskatchewan District. Fort Qu'Appelle Detachment.\n\nNov 3rd, 1928.\n\nI patrolled this p.m., to Lebret Indian School, with private auto, in connection with the above fire, and interviewed the principal of this institution regarding same. It appears that about 7:00 p.m. on the last night, three Indians, as follows, who belonged to Regina Reserve, Saskatchewan from Regina Reserve, and Sasqua, and Indian visiting on Sasqua Reserve, but originally from Sasqua Reserve, were apparently in the yard left in the dark, lighting a fire for their comfort, whereupon some of the other Indians were alleged to have lit a match, and probably have dropped same before it was fully out, with the supposed result that some little time afterwards it was noticed from the school that fire was issuing from this building.\n\nThe principal asked me if my investigation was at the request of the Indian Commissioner? I informed him, that it was not, complaining that the investigation would be expected of me by my Department.\n\nThe damage done amounts to the burning of a pig pen and wheat granary, also a quantity of wheat will be spoiled etc. I was also informed that a part of this building had been torn down prior to the fire, so stock was burnt.\n\nTwo large new hip roofed barns have recently been completed immediately west of these old buildings.\n\nThe principal explained that his opinion was that the fire was purely accidental, as the three of the Indians were there and fought the fire, and he is satisfied that there was no intent on the part of the fire to carry or extend, which latter, as he was not able to proceed to Lebret until this date.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Wiring in the lofts.......................... $71.30\n   The specifications did not show wiring for the lofts which was clearly an omission. The wiring was necessary as it would be dangerous to use oil lamps in the lofts.\n\n2. Two poles........................................... 12.00\n   The poles were necessary to carry the lights from the old barns to the stables.\n\n3. Approaches to barns, concrete.................... 63.00\n   The approaches to the barns as shown in the specifications were altogether too steep to allow the animals to get into the barns, especially if there should be any ice upon them. I therefore instructed that the approaches be projected another two and a half feet, this had to be done.\n\n4. Two manure booms complete........................ 56.00\n   The specifications did not call for a manure carrier to the dump, this was evidently an omission and I instructed that the track be extended from the buildings to the dump.\n\n5. 400' of No.12 wire............................... 8.00\n   During the recent fire at the Qu'Appelle School four hundred feet of wire was burned.

You will note that there is an item of $210.30 for extras, and a summary of the extras is attached to the certificate with explanations.\n\nIn submitting the final estimates on these buildings I may say that I find them much more elaborate than there is any necessity for their being. In the first place four times as much money has been spent on concrete than was necessary and this necessitated an additional expenditure of $1500.00. I believe that fifty feet of concrete was all that was required for the two buildings whereas we have put in two hundred and nine feet.\n\nThe walls are fourteen inches thick, nine inches is the standard thickness; the walls go down five feet into the ground, one foot would have been ample - all stables in this country are built on these lines. The ventilating shafts are of iron, these could have been made of wood as most shafts are and a saving of several hundreds of dollars would have been effected here. The horse barn is double floored, a single flooring of plank would have been sufficient.\n\nWe could have had accommodation for the same number of stock and had better barns than you will find on\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nup-to-date farms in this country for an expenditure of not more than $7,000.00 whereas we have been called upon to pay $10,692.00. These barns I may say have attracted a great deal of attention in the district and there are no barns like them in the country, they are too elaborate altogether in my opinion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. GRAHAM\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir:\n\nI have received a request from the Principal of the Indian Industrial School, Lebret, to be supplied with the following fire appliances:\n\n- 5 Fire Extinguishers.\n- 3 Axes.\n- 3 100' lengths 1\u00bd\" fire hose.\n- 2 Cals. Sulphuric Acid.\n\nI shall be glad to receive authority to make these purchases.\n\nThe Principal states that during vacation a slight fire occurred under the floor in the kitchen and on removing the stoves it was found that the fire had burned completely through the floor underneath. To prevent a recurrence of this the Principal suggests that the stoves be placed on cement foundations and to do this six bags of cement and about forty yards of asbestos paper, costing in all about $15.00, will be required. I shall be glad to receive authority to have this work done also. There will be no charge for labour as one of the employees at the school could do the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 7th instant in regard to placing additional windows on the left side of the Girls' Classroom, Room 1, I beg to say that it is now too late to do the work this year.\n\nI will take this matter up in the spring and have the work done as there will likely be other carpentry work going on at the institution then and this work can be done at the same time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, Nov. 29th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, regarding the request of the Principal of the Qu'Appelle Residential School to be supplied with certain fire appliances.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the following, viz:\n\n- 6 - 2\u00bd Gal. Fire Extinguishers,\n- 3 - Firemen's Axes,\n- 3 - 100' Lengths 1\u00bd\" Fire Hose, with Nozzles and Couplings, as required,\n- 2\u00bd Gal. Sulphuric Acid.\n\nIt will be necessary, if possible, to obtain competitive prices, and properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYou may also purchase the quantity of cement and asbestos paper required to place a cement foundation under the stoves in the kitchen. We note that you estimate the cost of this to be approximately $15, also that the labour will be performed by the school authorities without expense to the Department.\n\nI have also to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, regarding the placing of additional windows on the left side of the girls' classroom, Room 1. As you state it is too late to do this work this fall, this matter should receive attention next spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In places it is worn right through to the second floor and on examination I find that it requires re-flooring throughout. This work could be done with fir but I think it would pay to put in a hard wood floor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 6th instant regarding re-flooring of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, making new dining room tables and building in seats in the boys' play room, I have an estimate from the Lumber Company and I find the cost will be approximately $750.00 for lumber, and it will take at least $600.00 for labour, making a total of $1350.00.\n\nIn regard to the re-flooring of the chapel in my letter of the 14th I suggested that it might be advisable to use hard wood instead of fir but in view of the price of the hard wood flooring, birch costing $125.00 per thousand, I think after all it would be preferable to use fir and the cost of the material in this case would be about $225.00, labour would probably increase the cost by about $75.00 or $100.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

This veranda is to be on top of the existing passage; the present roof of the passage to be taken off; the brick veneer walls to be run up two feet to the floor joists of the proposed sun gallery, then carried on with shingled walls for a short distance, and from there on frames and sliding sashes. The verandahs on the South wall of the main building, are to be constructed in the same manner, as per sketch.\n\nI may say the passage connecting the two buildings are to be lined with shiplap and V jointing. The approximate cost of this structure would be around $5000.00, perhaps a little more. I would not advise letting a contract. We should buy the material and have a working foreman. The work can be carried on and supervised from time to time by Mr. Punten, who drew this sketch, and knows what we want.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Mr. Commissioner Graham, in his No. 314-7B of September 28th, last, asked that $5,000 be placed in the Estimates to replace the old blacksmith and carpenter shops. In a later communication Mr. Graham referred to the advisability of erecting a new pig sty at the first opportunity. I wish to recommend that he be authorized to expend the sum of $2,500 for new out-buildings at the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The decision as to which buildings should be undertaken this year should be left, I believe, to Mr. Commissioner Graham himself.\n\nI have been asked to report on funds for the verandahs for this school, which are the subject matter of Mr. Commissioner Graham's No. 314-11A of the 11th instant. I have noted that $5,000 is required and I consider that the Appropriation for Indian Education for this fiscal year can stand this charge.\n\nThe Commissioner, in his No. 314-11A of October 31st, last, asked that provision be made for fencing around the new buildings. An item is included in the Estimates in this connection and I wish to recommend that he be authorized to undertake this work also.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nIn your letter of the 6th November last in reply to mine of the 31st October you informed me that funds would be provided in the Estimates to construct a fence around the new stables built last year for the Lebret School, and also for the erection of a pig sty. Will you please advise me if arrangements can be made at an early date to proceed with the work referred to, especially the building of the fence, as the school cattle are now running at large and it is difficult to keep strange cattle away.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. O'BRIEN,\nIndian Commissioner.\nApril 26, 1934.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 11th instant with reference to the providing of sleeping verandahs for the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, I beg to advise you that you are authorized to have these verandahs built in accordance with the sketch submitted. It is noted that the cost will not exceed $5,000. I am returning herewith the sketch, as requested.\n\nI would also advise you that there is $2,500 available for the building of outbuildings and fencing at this school, and you may proceed with the erection of the buildings you consider most necessary and that can be erected within this amount.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Acting) Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.

(RC 10, Volume 6328, file 660-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nAs the work in connection with the buildings at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School is now under way I would ask to be supplied with an accountable advance cheque amounting to $1000.00 to pay for the labor in connection with this work.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6328, file 660-5, part 2)\nSir:\n\nI would be glad to know what has been allowed in the Estimates for repairing and redecorating the interior of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School. There is a great deal of wall painting and ceiling kalsomining to be done at this school, and in order to get the work done at a season that suits the school staff best, we should have the authority now, if possible.\n\nI would ask for authority to spend $500.00 at the present time, to carry out this work. It may be that more money will be required, but I would like to start out with this much authority. It is a large school, and very little has been spent on repairs of this kind since it was built.\n\nThere is another matter that requires your attention; that is, we will have to buy about 800 feet of hard wood flooring, to complete the work of repairs to the floors of this Institution. The main corridor of the administration building should be laid with battleship linoleum otherwise the floor will have to be re-laid, and I do not think this would be economy. There are a great many splinters on it, and it is worn in the centre; and battleship linoleum would add greatly to the appearance of the school, and it is the desire of the Sisters to have this, instead of varnished floors.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that a request has come in from the Engineer in charge of the pumping system at Qu'Appelle Industrial School, to be supplied with a Booster Pump, for pumping air into the pressure system.\n\nI may say that Mr. Paulin, who was doing some work on this school some time ago, informed me that a Booster Pump was necessary. I did not take any action at the time. I would be glad, however, to have your authority to purchase the required pump. The cost would, I understand, be in the neighborhood of $60.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 21, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 314-11A of the 16th instant, in which you inform the Department that it is necessary to purchase a Booster pump for the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. I have noted your estimate of $60 in this connection. You are authorized to purchase a suitable pump, after securing competitive prices if possible.\n\nI have also your No. 314-11A of the 17th instant, with reference to interior repairing and redecorating at Qu'Appelle. In reply I have to inform you that you are authorized to have any work done that is absolutely necessary. If your first estimate of $500 is to be exceeded, I should be pleased if you would inform me. The Department considers that all calking and wall painting should be done by the older pupils, under the supervision of the staff of the school. The materials, of course, should be purchased by yourself in the regular way.\n\nYou are also authorized to purchase 600 ft. of hardwood flooring which is required to complete the repairs to the floors at this school. Before authority can be granted for the battleship linoleum for the main corridors, it will be necessary to know the amount required for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nReferring to your #114-0-5, dated the 21st\n\nI have just returned from a visit to the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, and when there made a careful survey of the building, and find that it would be advisable to put down green Battleship Linoleum in the main hall; also in the hospital hall and the passage to the girls' bathroom.\n\nThe floors in these halls are in poor shape and something will have to be done with them. I am satisfied that the linoleum will be the most satisfactory, will look well, and also will decrease the noise in the building.\n\nThe amount of linoleum required to do the work I have outlined is 275 square yards. I have obtained competitive prices for A.A. green Battleship Linoleum. The lowest quotation received is from the T. Eaton Company, who quote a price of $2.35 per sq. yard.\n\nI would recommend that this linoleum be obtained and if approved by the Department will be glad to receive the necessary authority at the earliest possible date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott.\n\nMr. Commissioner Graham reports that 275 square yards of Battleship linoleum is required for the main corridors of the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. He has been instructed to make certain repairs and replacements at this institution and now wishes authority to purchase the linoleum. The cost will be approximately $650. I wish to recommend that the Commissioner be authorized to make the purchase.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, June 10, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No.314-11A of the 4th instant, in which you recommend that 275 square yards of Battleship linoleum be purchased for the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School.

A lot of work has been done at this institution. The passage between the main building and the girls' building has been carried up another story and glassed in, roofed and finished and we have now a splendid sleeping gallery here. The West gable end of the building has had two new sleeping galleries built the width of the building. A first-class job has been done here. The interior painting of the school is well under way. A fence has been built around the new barns and a large pigsty erected.\n\nYou will see from this report that the work is well advanced and will be completed in good time this Fall.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir:\n\nI beg to draw your attention to the fact that the battery which was installed at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School - I think about two years ago - is now reported to be almost out of commission.\n\nIt appears to me that there is something wrong here. I took this matter up with the Hart Battery people and I am enclosing herewith a copy of their letter.\n\nI understand, in a conversation with the Principal of the School, that the representative of the Company who was at Lebret told him that the battery was faulty when it was installed. It looks to me as though there was something in this. The question of installing new batteries in this Institution requires immediate attention. Would it be as well to try some other battery?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nEnc.\nMr. A.M. Graham,\nc/o Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nCanada Life Assurance Bldg.,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will no doubt recall your conversation with the writer regarding the storage battery in your school at Fort Qu'Appelle, which I looked over in company with our Winnipeg representative Mr. Strong, when in the West.\n\nThis battery while not in the very best condition, seems to be answering the purpose for the time being and as we discussed it is not necessary to spend money on it until it starts to fail. We had hoped when we put it in there that it would give you three years service and are prepared to protect you on this basis. In the event of failure within the three year period, we shall be willing to credit you with a proportionate amount to the length of service lost on a new battery of the Demi Plante type of cell, which we discussed during our conversation.\n\nAn ordinary battery plate is a lead frame work into which is pasted the active material, which gives the discharge, but will with each discharge, gradually disintegrate until there is no active material left and the battery has absolutely no capacity. The demi plate type of plate is solid lead with the exception of a thin film of active material pasted to the outside, which carries on the discharge until the solid lead portion of the plate has become active, which will do the work thereafter. They are usually capable of giving three times the life of the pasted plate and we could give you the names and addresses of many installations which have been in for ten years and are still doing excellent work. The initial cost, of course, is somewhat greater, but based on so much per year for battery service is by far the most economical battery to buy.\nToday a replacement of the same cells as you have would cost you approximately $1380.00 F.O.B. Regina, while we can put in a set of demi plante cells for $1547.00 F.O.B. Regina, with sales tax extra.\n\nWhile you do not need a replacement at the present time, we ask you to keep this quotation before you and bear it in mind when the time comes to renew the cells which you are now using as we feel that you cannot do better than purchase a demi plante type of cell, which we are recommending.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHart Battery Co. Limited,\nC.V.Edwards,\nSales Manager.\nIndian Industrial School,\nLebret, Sask.,\nOct. 4th, 1924\n\nLetter # 9648\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of Sept. 30th, with further reference to the batteries, I would say that they are failing rapidly. It is now necessary to run the engine for lights alone, the lights from the batteries alone is quite dim and besides the discharge rapidly.\n\nNinety per cent of the batteries are filled up and consequently useless, the other twenty per cent are also filling up rapidly and will not last a month.\n\nThe strain on the batteries is increasing as the days get shorter and it will be only a matter of a short time before we will be without lights except direct from the dynamo.\n\nWhen the Battery Inspector was here the early part of the Summer he told our engineer not to touch them as he would see that the company put in new ones.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) G. Leonard\nPrincipal\n\nW. H. Graham, Indian Commissioner\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI would refer you to my letter of the 30th ultimo, #314-11A, with reference to the faulty batteries at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nI now enclose a letter received from the reverend principal, in which he informs me that the batteries are likely to give out at any moment.\n\nI would ask for your authority by wire to have these batteries replaced at the earliest possible date. The agents of the various battery companies are, of course, here in Regina.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

Junior room has three small windows and from fifty to sixty children in this room. Girls senior room is large but poorly lighted; Intermediate is bright but would be better with windows that would open from top.\n\nDormitories for boys, which is one, has hundred and five beds in, there are two for girls, one for junior and one for the senior. Advised that these be well ventilated and the beds to be well aired. Would be better to have accommodation for extra sister to sleep with these children in case of fire, as now there is only one.\n\nBaths: There is great difficulty in bathing these children especially girls, as the hot water has to be carried from kitchen, and can only get that on Saturdays. There are two bath tubs in senior girl's dormitory, while little ones have two downstairs. Would be better, when there are so many if they had hot water and more bath tubs. Boys have spray bath, but this does not clean them properly.\n\nToilets are fairly clean, some have odor, especially boys as boys are careless. Have difficulty with girls' toilet downstairs blocking.\n\nFlorence M.

M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Principal has made repeated requests for the construction of a Carpenter Shop. I would say that a new reason in favour of this plan has been added this year by the request of the Principals assembled at Convention at Duck Lake, viz.: that some young men be sent to Qu'Appelle School in order to perfect their knowledge of engineering and carpentering. Above all the importance of the School calls for the erection of such a building.\n\nADDITION TO COW STABLE.\n\nThe extensive farming operations carried on at Qu'Appelle School necessitate a certain number of outbuildings. A couple of years ago a cow and horse stables were built but prove inadequate for the quantity of cattle. The Principal had protested in due time against the dimensions of those stables but to no avail. In his requests for last year's estimates, asked for the enlarging of the cow barn and he reiterates the same request for the same reasons. For my part, having examined the situation, I take the liberty of urging action from the Department.\n\nSILOS.\n\nTwo silos are needed at Qu'Appelle and I believe the Department will not fail to add same to the outbuildings at Qu'Appelle School.\n\nI beg to recall to the attention of the Department the excellent results of Rev. Fr. Leonard's administration at Qu'Appelle and think that such should be partially recognized by including his requests in the list of Estimates.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Pit Silo - cost about $700.00. The matter of a silo has been under consideration now for three years, but nothing has been done as yet. They have no silo of any kind at this school. I may say that I am not in favor of anything but a pit silo.\n\n2. Another matter that has been under consideration for years is the erection of a Carpenter Shop, Blacksmith and Tin Shop. The cost of these would be about $4000.00. The buildings that are used for this purpose at the present time are old dilapidated affairs that should have been discarded years ago. They present a very bad appearance, to say nothing of the inconvenience of trying to work in such buildings.\n\n3. The repainting of the school should also be done next year, - cost about $1000.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 13, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 514-11A of the 8th instant, in which you recommend certain improvements at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School next year. A note has been made for Estimates in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise the Department that an Inspector of the Sanitation Division of the Provincial Department of Public Health has recently visited Lebret School and made an inspection of the sewage disposal plant which he finds out of order. It appears that provision should have been made for the proper cleaning out of the tank and siphon chamber at intervals and this has not been done, the result being that the necessary bacterial action could not take place in the tank.\n\nIt was necessary to take immediate action and I have therefore ordered a diaphragm pump and the necessary hose at a cost of $70.00 from Cranes Ltd., the only source of supply. I trust my action may be approved.\n\nThis plant will now be cleaned out at regular intervals and it is hoped that no further trouble will ensue.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, October 26th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your No. 314-11A of the 18th instant, in which you report that the sewage disposal plant at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School is out of order.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your action in ordering a diaphragm pump and the necessary hose at a cost of $70 is approved.\n\nYou should forward the usual voucher, in duplicate, covering the cost of the above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith and recommend for payment Regina Voucher No. 4170, in favour of Crane, Ltd., Winnipeg, Man., covering the purchase of a Diaphragm Pump and 20 ft. of Hose, for use at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School.

You may proceed with the provision of a pit silo at an estimated cost of $700.00. Please be guided by general instructions in the Deputy Superintendent General's 1-1-5 of the 6th ultimo.\n\nLimited funds for other improvements are also available and I should be pleased if you would report on the relative importance of the repainting of the school and the three workshops mentioned in your letter. Please let me know which should go forward this year and estimate the cost of each.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

The work shops referred to in my letter of the 6th October last are also very badly needed, and could be erected under one roof for the sum of $4000.00 which I hope will be available. If one of these is built, all should be built together as I do not think it would be good practice to erect part of the building and add to it later on. I shall be glad to know that funds can be provided for both undertakings, that is, the repainting and the work shops.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 11, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 314-11A of the 5th instant, with reference to improvements at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. I regret that funds are not available for the erection of the proposed workshops, but I shall arrange for an appropriation at the first opportunity.

This year I have had the exterior of the building re-painted. It would have been better had it been painted two years ago. The money which we are now asking for is to do inside work.\n\nWith regard to the laundry, this is one of the most unsanitary and inadequate laundries we have at any of our schools in Western Canada.

Besides I could have a local carpenter who could do the work cheaper in the winter at $4.50 per day and I would give him his board.\n\nRefrigerator 18' X 22' X 20' high\nEstimated cost $1,500.00\n\nLean-to addition to the laundry 20' X 35' X 28' high, to receive coal bin, engine and boiler, and the cost of installing machinery including new shafts, pipes and fittings. Also new cement floor for the laundry as authorized in your letter of Feb. 12, 1927, No. 314-118.\nEstimated cost $4,000.00\n\nThe laundry at present is only 35' X 24' X 28' high and contains on the first floor - coal bin, engine, boiler, chimney in the centre 5' square and laundry equipment which leaves no room for circulation.\n\nShop 60' X 20' X 14' high to contain carpenter shop, blacksmith shop and tin shop.

They have also been requested on our estimates in 1925 and again in 1926. The old building which it is to replace is a discredit to a Government Institution.\n\nNew horizontal boiler for the laundry as the old vertical one at present in use necessitates new flues every two years and is almost out of service.\n\nEstimated cost $1,600.00\n\nThe money was voted for a new boiler in 1921. Department letter No. 116575/21, Dec. 1st, 1920. But before the new one could be installed the flues of the old one gave out and had to be replaced. For this reason it was thought better to use this money for repairs which were urgently needed, on the understanding that a new boiler would be installed a year or two later, before the old one required another set of flues. Since then new flues have been put in three times.\n\nI might mention that all the foregoing estimates of cost are only approximate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nW.M.Graham, Indian Commissioner,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I found on going through the main building that the floor in the dining-room has settled.\nInspector Murison's report on Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nfrom 2\u00bd to 3 inches all the way along the front. It was impossible to estimate on the cost of putting this floor back into position, as it will be necessary to take up a portion of the floor to ascertain the cause. I am of the opinion that the floor joists have rotted. The same remarks would apply to the boys' building which is settling. I noted that the stairways were considerably out of level, and here, as in the other building, it will require close examination to ascertain the cause. I found the main building in a clean and tidy condition, also the girls' building. The boys' building, however, was not so neat, excepting the dormitory, which presented a very nice appearance. The classroom floors were untidy in the boys' department, but this could be understood, as it would be almost impossible to keep them clean owing to the muddy condition of the yards. I found their playroom and their lavatory in a dirty condition, and there is no question that there has been neglect in supervising the boys during the hours of recreation. The supporting posts in the playroom are all hacked with knives, and the walls, within and without, have been written on. In the boys' lavatory the seats of the toilets have been wrenched off, one bowl is missing and another has been broken, (I found out that this had been done deliberately by a boy, with a bar of iron), and there was an accumulation of dirt on the wash basins and urinals which, in my opinion, is the result of neglect for months past. I expressed my disapproval of these conditions very strongly to the Principal, and also to the senior boys in their classroom, in the presence\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6328, file 660-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nInspector Murison's report on Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nof the Principal and the teacher, and I trust that my visit will have the effect of bringing about a better state of affairs in this department. The girls' classrooms are situated in the attic of the girls' building. The lighting, as has already been reported by the Provincial School Inspectors, is poor. It has been proposed to double up a number of these windows, and the wall has been opened for an examination as to how best to do this. I am of the opinion that increased lighting could be better obtained through the roof. Possibly it might be less expensive, and it would not have the effect of weakening the building in any way. The Sisters pointed out that two of their bedrooms, as well as the chapel, had never been painted since the building was put up.\n\nFire Protection.\n\nFire hose connected with the water system are provided on each floor, as well as a number of fire extinguishers. I examined the hose and found it in very good condition. The fire extinguishers, according to the cards attached, had been re-charged last Fall. Fire escapes are provided, in the shape of iron stairways, with the exception of the escapes from the girls' classrooms and the gymnasium. They have skeleton ladders provided for these rooms which I think are impractical, but as these rooms are only occupied during the daytime it is questionable if the occasion will ever arise necessitating the use of these fire escapes.\nInspector Murison's report on Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nI noted that a considerable amount of necessary repair work had been done during the winter months. The Principal was authorized by the Department to expend $300.00, and I noted that only very necessary repairs were being made, and the money is being carefully expended.\n\nThe plank walk from the girls' building to the Ice House is in an unsafe condition. The Principal states that he will replace this with a new one at an early date. The storage facilities in the Ice House are not satisfactory. The meat has to be suspended from the ceiling away from the walls to protect it from rats. I noted that the picket fence around the girls' playground required repairing.\n\nLaundry.\n\nThe space in the washroom is limited. A coal bin and vertical steam boiler are located in this room, and when the boiler is being fired the coal dust makes it difficult to keep things clean. A separate room for the boiler and fuel would seem advisable, and their removal would provide additional needed space in the laundry room.\n\nShoe Shop.\n\nIt was noted that the floor in the Shoe Shop was in poor repair. Very useful work is done in this department. All the shoes for the pupils are made here, and are also kept in repair. This affects a saving.\n\nBake Shop.\n\nThis is a brick building, and it was noted that the walls have cracked and have been strengthened by placing 15 horizontal rods through the building. The brick in the ceiling of the oven is falling down, and\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6328, file 660-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nInspector Murison's report on Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nwill have to be repaired at once, as it is getting worse all the time. The chimney from this oven does not appear to be high enough. The Baker stated that it smokes badly, and appearances would bear this out.\n\nWork Shop.\n\nThe old work shop and coal sheds are in a dilapidated condition. I am informed that they will be replaced during the coming summer. This will add greatly to the appearance of the place.\n\nThe horse and cow barns are good buildings. A silo has been built between the two barns. It was tried out this winter for the first time and has proven very satisfactory. The cow barn provides accommodation for 24 cows, and a calf pen. They have 23 milch cows, 1 bull, and 21 head of young stock. A shed is provided for the young stock. They should have at least 35 milch cows at an institution of this size, and in order to accommodate this number it would be necessary to extend the barn at least 30 feet. At the time of my visit they were milking 14 cows, which is not a sufficient number to provide milk for approximately 250 persons. They should have at least 35 in order to keep at least 20 milking steadily.\n\nFarm and Garden.\n\nThere are 900 acres of land in connection with this school. The farm lands are situated from three to six miles away. Of this, about 500 acres are under cultivation, viz:- 375 acres which were sown to grain, roots and vegetables, -and 125-\nInspector Murison's report on Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nand 125 acres under summerfallow. They had 200 acres of wheat, which averaged 17\u00bd bushels per acre, 95 acres of oats averaging a little over 23 bushels per acre, and 55 acres of barley, averaging 10 bushels to the acre. They had 12 acres of fodder crop, consisting of beets, sunflowers, and corn, all of which were a good yield. The garden was a success last year, and provided sufficient roots and vegetables for the use of the school, as well as a considerable surplus for sale.\n\nLive Stock.\n\nThe live stock consists of 23 cows, 1 bull, 21 head of young stock, 26 horses, 20 hogs, 35 young pigs, and about 100 poultry. I may say that the cattle are all Holstein.\n\nAttached to this report are the following statements:\n\nBank Manager's Certificate, April 21/28\nBank Adjustment Statement\nFinancial Statement for fiscal year ended Mar.31/28\nTrial Balance to the end of fiscal year\nTrial Balance from April 1st. to 21st, 1928\n\nThe foregoing is respectfully submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

May 2, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report on the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, which was recently inspected by Mr. Murison.\n\nThe out buildings at this school are in a sad state of repair. You will notice that I have asked for $1,000.00 in the Estimates for repairs to the buildings; I hope this has been allowed.\n\nI would draw your attention to the Inspector's remarks regarding the playroom and lavatory in the boys' department. This condition has almost always existed; it is impossible to keep this up to the standard in which it should be kept. The joists in the main building have apparently rotted away. This will necessitate considerable expenditure and I doubt whether the $1,000.00 asked for will be sufficient.\n\nWith reference to the laundry, I have asked that $2,000.00 be allowed to put a decent laundry in this school, as the present one is far from what it should be.\n\nI note that some money has been spent during the winter in doing minor repairs about the buildings. This is the first intimation I have had that this money was authorized and that the work was being carried on. The walk leading to the ice house is reported to be unsafe; in fact, all the walks are unsafe. I would draw your attention to the Inspector's remarks regarding the storage facilities not being satisfactory. I have also asked for $1500.00 to put this right.\n\n(Sgd.) W. M.

This school has no ice house and, as it was found that the Frigidaire could be provided without exceeding the appropriation allowed in Department No. 114-0-6 dated 31st May last, it was considered more economical to provide refrigeration in this manner, more especially as a change is being made in the provision for electrical energy at this school. You will note in the voucher the use of the word \"contract,\" but no formal agreement was entered into with the Bruce Robinson Electric Limited, but their quotations of the 26th September last were accepted and these are enclosed.

This is the first visit that has been made to this institution by me since last Fall. I find that the plumbing throughout the building is in a very bad state of repair and requires a general overhauling. The pipes under the floors are leaking, in other places the pipes are corroded, the lavatories are out of order and in fact I would say that the whole plumbing system is far from what it should be. In looking up the Estimates I see that there is an item of $1000.00 to look after unforeseen repairs at this school. When this item was inserted it was not meant for the repairing of plumbing, but I should be glad to have your authority to send a man to this school at once to put the plumbing in shape before any further damage is done. I anticipate difficulty in getting a plumber at this time of year, as everybody is very busy. We may, however, be able to get someone if this authority is received at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 2nd, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 314-11A of the 29th ultimo, relative to the condition of the plumbing throughout the building at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. In this connection I have to say that you may arrange to have the plumbing given a general overhauling and any necessary repairs carried out. There is an item in our Estimates for the current fiscal year of $1,000 for unforeseen repairs at this school. The Department will be pleased if you will keep all costs in the repairing of the plumbing as low as possible and see that no unnecessary expense is incurred. This work should be carried out when considered timely by you to have it done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nUnfortunately, things are not going so smoothly with Lebret. According to the information I have received from Reverend Fr. Leonard, work on the laundry could not be delayed. The boiler is in a very bad shape and all the flues must be replaced as soon as possible, one or two going out of order every week. Mr. Graham has refused to renew the flues this spring.\n\nThe Sisters would not consider my proposition. Three years ago they have asked Mr. Scott to have an addition built to the laundry, because the boiler, the engine and the coal bin being located close to the machinery, proper work could not be done and the linen was often soiled.\n\nThe Reverend Principal would be satisfied with an addition and some new laundry equipment, at the cost of about $5,000.00, but this is not Mr. Graham's plan.\nPAULIN & SWAYZE\nPlumbers, Steamfitters, Etc.\n\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nM Dept of Indian Affairs\n(Lebret Indian School)\n\nACCOUNTS DUE WHEN RENDERED\n10% Interest charged on overdue accounts\n\n| DATE   | ARTICLES                        | FOLIO | CREDIT AMOUNT | DEBIT AMOUNT | TOTAL |\n|--------|---------------------------------|-------|---------------|--------------|-------|\n| April 5| 4 boiler tubes per Springstein & Davidson |       |               |              | 11.50 |\n\nEmergent repairs to boiler, Lebret Indian Residential School.\n\nCertified correct.\n\nRegina, Sask. 22nd May, 1929.\n\nW.

At that time, you referred to the necessity for a laundry at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. I should be pleased if you would let me have a recommendation as to the nature of the building that should be erected. You might also give the Department an estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have not yet had any official instructions from the Department regarding the new laundry which is so very badly needed at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School. An item was placed in the Estimates to provide for this, and, as you know, there is no place in the West where the need for a laundry is greater than at this institution. Before your visit to the school, complaints were made by the Indians to the effect that their children were contracting colds and sickness by working in the present laundry, and while this may be an exaggeration, the fact remains that it is really not fit for people to work in, especially in the wintertime.\n\nThere has been an amount of $4000.00 allowed for a Farmer's residence at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, which is not needed this year, and probably a saving will also be effected at other points and I hope that it will be possible to find funds with which to supply this laundry.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

Having made a thorough canvass of the situation, we find that there are three separate units which means three jackets, 3 tanks and three fires to look after and even when working at their full capacity, which is very seldom, they are totally inadequate to supply sufficient hot water. The jacket heaters are done now and will require to be replaced also two of the tanks. The life of these jacket heaters will be about one year, in fact in most cases similar they are stopped up with alkali in six months continuous service.\n\nWe would recommend the installing of a small low pressure boiler and placing same in the central boiler room, from there hook up the present three units with a supply main to each unit from the hot water tank. This tank also should be placed in the central boiler room. The tank and mains should be covered with asbestos air shell pipe covering.\n\nThe tank would be 42x8 feet with a manhole and galvanized coil.\n\nThe advantage of this installation would be the elimination of future repairs such as jacket heaters and range boilers. The steam boiler for this job should last for twenty five years. There would be no alkali accumulation in the boiler as it is a closed system. The coil in the tank would have to be cleaned of scale once or twice a year dependent upon the amount of hot water heated.\n\nThe cost of a #924 steam low pressure boiler will be three hundred and sixty ($360.00) dollars.\n\nHot water pressure tank 42x10' with hot water coil and manhole two hundred and sixty seven ($267.00) dollars.\n\nTime and material for installation of above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPAULIN & SWAYZE\nPer E.P.

The present wires are bare in many spots, and in very poor condition throughout. We would advise putting steel covered B.X. wire and installing 12 new fire call stations. All call stations and bell outlets would terminate in steel boxes, making it as near fire proof as possible.\n\nThis work would be done in the same manner as other Indian schools; that is, there are twelve fire call stations controlling six bells. The annunciator at present installed would be done away with, and a fire call station putting in a call would ring all six bells.\n\nThe price for this work would be two Hundred and seventy-two dollars and fifty Cents ($272.50).\n\nTrusting this is the information you desired, we beg to remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBEAIRSTO ELECTRIC\n**Work Order**\n\n**BEAIRSTO ELECTRIC**\n\n| Description                  | Order | Ret'd. | Charge |\n|------------------------------|-------|--------|--------|\n| 1 30 amp Langley Switch      |       |        | 2.95   |\n| 10 \u00bd\" Connectors             |       |        | 2.00   |\n| 60 ft. 2/14 B.X.

I thought that steps should be immediately taken to have the situation remedied, and the voucher forwarded here-with represents the expenditure. I enclose copy of a report furnished me by the Beairsto Electric Company after this work had been done quoting a price of $272.50 to place the system on a proper and satisfactory basis, and I shall be glad if the Department will authorize the necessary expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Graham, Esq.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen in Lebret on October 8th, I inspected wiring and general layout of distribution at the Indian School. The attached sketch and photos show the arrangement of poles and services on their property.\n\nThe wiring round the grounds connecting the various buildings was put up a number of years ago for the old plant. It is not suitable for the new service of light and power to be supplied by the Montreal Eng. Co., and constitutes a bad fire hazard. Some of the buildings have the service wires running through the window frames and others through BX cable with no protection where passing into buildings. Messrs. Willis and Hall Electrical Contractors, who are now working at the school have installed a new 3 phase 10 H.P. motor in the laundry and they requested an inspection by the Power Commission as they did not see their way clear to connect up motor to the existing wires in the grounds, without adding to the general confusion of wiring. No conduit fitting in end of pipe to root cellar.\n\nChanges that should be made.\n\nThe Montreal Eng. Co. are putting in a new pole in position shown in sketch. This pole will have a cabinet on it containing four pole switch, 3 blades fused and the necessary meter to control all the buildings of the Indian School.\n\nA proper entrance switch and conduit entrance should be placed at every point where wires enter the school buildings and connected up to the central pole where the main switch will be installed.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) Arthur Townsend.\nChief Inspector.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nW. REGINA, SASK., 19th October, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose copy of a letter which I have received from the Chief Inspector of the Saskatchewan Power Commission, concerning the condition of the wiring and general layout of the electrical distribution of the school at Lebret. It seems clear that the changes recommended should be made, and I shall be glad to have the necessary authority from the Department. Whatever changes are involved will be made as economically as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 25, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 314-11 A of the 19th instant, enclosing a report from the Chief Inspector of the Saskatchewan Power Commission, concerning the condition of the wiring and general layout of the electrical distribution of the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. You may put in a proper entrance switch and conduit entrance at each point where wires enter the school buildings and connect up to the central pole where the main switch is to be installed. Please see that no unnecessary expense is incurred.\n\nI wish to refer also to your 314-11A of the 15th instant, enclosing an estimate of the Bearstoe Electric Company for placing the fire alarm system on a satisfactory basis. I have read this report, and I am still in doubt if an expenditure of $272.50 is really required for new fire call stations, etc., and new wiring. You might make enquiries from the Electric Company, with a view to making a further report and recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

As they are on the ground, I have directed them to proceed with the work in question and I trust my action will be approved, as their figure compares favorably with that quoted by the Beaird Electric.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Paulin and Swayze for material and labour in connection with the construction of a new laundry at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School. This involved the enlarging of the old laundry, the replacing of the existing machinery in many cases, and a general over-hauling of the plumbing and electrical work. It is connected with the main building by a long passage which was set on concrete, and the building is now in first-class shape.\n\nWith this account we are well under the $6000.00 authorized. There may be some odds and ends that will have to be supplied later on. However, I do not look to see the amount authorized exceeded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn submitting our report upon the nature of the work done at the Lebret Indian School, I wish to call to your attention the main items of which the bill is composed:\n\n- Laundry, as per bill ........................................ $3675.53\n- Steam Boiler & Heat Water Tank for\n  installing domestic hot water heating ................. 627.00\n- 3 New Steam Coils in Dryer .................................. 212.00\n- Installing new high pressure, steam boiler,\n  replacing old one ........................................... 115.90\n- 2 New Roll Rim Sinks in main Dining Room .............. 42.20\n- 2 New Bath Tubs complete with traps,\n  combination Cox., Waste & overflows .................... 84.00\n- Kenney Flushometers Valves .................................. 207.00\n- Galvanized water pipe ....................................... 242.50\n- Self closing Basin Cox ....................................... 752.00\n- 20 sacks Asbestos ............................................. 70.00\n- Asbestos pipe covering ...................................... 75.00\n- Add for estimate percentage of labour .................... 350.00\n\nTotal ................................................................. $3691.43\n\nWhen you deduct the main items in the account from the total bill, there is a balance of $3615.42 for material labour and expenses upon the whole of the repairs as per our statement. It would be most difficult to say just what part of the whole work that we have just completed could have been left undone. We have been careful to see that the work as far as we have gone has been well and thoroughly done. As such amount that profitably be expended upon this school in bringing the heating up to standard efficiency and we would be pleased at any time to submit a layout of the requirements. There has been no material used unnecessarily in making repairs.\n\nTo specially mention the changing of the domestic hot water system where now, as you know, four jacket heaters at various places in the building, which meant four fires to look after, each heating say thirty to forty gallons of water. Any one of them the size that might be installed in an ordinary private residence.\n\nOne can easily visualize what happens when 75 boys, more or less, are ready for a shower; they would not get more than started before the hot water would be all used. The same thing applies to the other parts of the building where these small jacket heaters were installed. I am convinced-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6328, file 660-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nconvinced that a considerable saving in the amount of coal would be effected, in the use of the new system over the four jacket heaters formerly used if same had been fired continuously to produce the same amount of hot water as the new system. As now installed a small fire carrying one lb. of steam or even less, will supply an abundance of hot water for kitchen and all other purposes. Although a satisfactory domestic hot water system has been installed and will supply all the hot water required, it remains to be seen just what service the school will get from it, as it would appear to be of far greater importance to the management to save a few tons of coal rather than have the pupils well supplied with hot water.\n\nAs soon as the new domestic hot water system was put into operation and the new taps installed, there was a considerable decrease in the number of times the pumps were working.\n\nReferring to the sanitary conditions of the plumbing when we began the repairs of overhauling the Boys' Lavatory off the playroom was positively filthy and in a most unsanitary condition. The sewer was stopped at several points which necessitated breaking up the concrete floor and clearing drain, also putting in suitable floor drains and cleanouts. The twelve lavatory basins were considerably damaged, in some cases torn off the wall. The taps and traps were ruined; two urinals were not working; not a seat on any of the eight closet bowls; flushometer not operating properly. Such unwholesome conditions are very demoralizing upon the students.\n\nIn the main building the sewers were stopped or very nearly so and overflowing in different parts of the building below the floor. A prime condition for starting an epidemic of almost any kind.\n\nA thorough job had been made of clearing all sewer pipes and stopping leaks and such other repairs as was necessary for the safety of the occupants and the proper venting and wasting of all sewer lines.\n\nThe utter lack of any system or management of any kind is directly responsible for these deplorable conditions.\n\nThe part of the building in charge of the Sisters, however, is wholesome and well looked after, especially considering the conditions under which they are working.\n\nThe engineer appears to be a competent man, but the multiplicity of his duties absolutely prohibits his being able to properly do one third of the work allotted to him.\n\nTrusting the above has made the various matters clearer, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPAULIN & STAYZE.\nEXCERPT FROM INSPECTOR MURISON'S REPORT ON QUI'APPELLE SCHOOL DATED APRIL 26th, 1928.\n\nThe classroom floors were untidy in the boys' department, but this could be understood, as it would be almost impossible to keep them clean owing to the muddy condition of the yards. I found their playroom and their lavatory in a dirty condition, and there is no question that there has been neglect in supervising the boys during the hours of recreation. The supporting posts in the playroom are all hacked with knives, and the walls, within and without, have been written on. In the boys' lavatory the seats of the toilets have been wrenched off, one bowl is missing and another has been broken, (I found out that this had been done deliberately by a boy, with a bar of iron), and there was an accumulation of dirt on the wash basins and urinals which, in my opinion, is the result of neglect for months past. I expressed my disapproval of these conditions very strongly to the Principal, and also to the senior boys in their classroom, in the presence of the Principal and the teacher, and I trust that my visit will have the effect of bringing about a better state of affairs in this department.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., Dec. 19th, 1929\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith Regina Voucher No. 6498 for $6009.80 in favour of Messrs. Paulin & Swayze, Regina, the bulk of which is for overhauling and repairs to the plumbing system at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nIncluded in this account is a new steam boiler, $627.00, leaving the cost for labour and repairs $5,382.80. This is a heavy expense and according to Messrs. Paulin & Swayze there is still much that could be done. You will notice from the report signed by this firm, copy of which is attached, the manner in which the plumbing has been neglected, and the condition in which the plumbers found it, which, of course, goes to show that the Principal has neglected to have the repairs attended to at the proper time, and proves conclusively that he is not competent to take charge of an institution of this kind.\n\nOf course, this matter has been taken up with the Department on various occasions, and I merely refer to it again because I think it is too bad that we have to be drilling at this man all the time, not only to look after his plumbing, but everything else about the place.

On page 10 of the invoice dated Nov. 20th, 1929, the item for 10 ft. 2\" D.H. soil pipe @ .50\u00a2 was extended at $10.00, and the amount was changed to $5.00 and the difference deducted on page 22. As the $10.00 amount appears to have been a typographical error and does not affect the total of the page, an underpayment of $5.00 is indicated.

M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, No. 114-0-1, in connection with Inspector Hamilton's report on the Lebret School.\n\nI immediately took steps to have the windows measured for screens, and wired you yesterday as follows:\n\n\"Cost of screen windows and doors for Lebret School will be approximately four hundred and fifty dollars. At present there are only about one dozen screens altogether on the buildings. May I have your authority by wire to incur this expenditure?\"\n\nIf authority is granted by the Department to have the screens made, the price I quoted was received from the Western Manufacturing Co. They will be painted green, ready to put on, and are really good substantial screens, something that should last for years. I could have got them to make up cheaper screens than this, but considered that a flimsy screen made out of 3/8 material is not of much account.\n\nI have also made arrangements for the automatic flushers, and the steps leading up to the windows of the fire escapes. The steps were included in the cost of the window screens.\n\nMr. Hamilton mentioned in his report that one of the bowls in the boys' toilet was out of commission and cracked. The Principal drew my attention to the fact that there are two bowls broken, and these should be replaced. I shall be glad to receive your authority to do this.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

It is noted that you have made arrangements for the automatic flushers and the steps leading up to the windows of the fire escapes, and that the steps were included in the estimate of the cost of the window screens.

This cannot well be put off for another year.\n\nI find that the roof of the school building is in a very bad state of repair, in fact the rafters are rotting away around the dormer windows at several points. This means that the whole roof will have to be repaired, and it may be necessary to undertake this work before the amount asked for in the Estimates has been made available. When this is done the school roof and framing should all be re-painted. The total cost will be in the neighborhood of $4000.00, which is the amount I have asked for. This cannot wait another year.\n\nAt an institution of this size there are always certain unforeseen repairs during the course of the year which have to be attended to, and I have placed the usual amount of $2500.00 in the Estimate to cover this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGraham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nG.

A new battery should be provided. Fire extinguishers are placed throughout the building, also fire axes. The four large red painted Pyrene fire extinguishers, supplied some three years ago, are leaking and useless. The materia in the cases does not stand up and they appear to rust through around the bottoms. Four new ones are needed. Fire drill is observed regularly and all fire escapes are in good condition. No doors or windows are locked leading to the escapes. This school, as the Department is aware, is one of the older buildings, but all fire apparatus is in good condition and the arrangements for fire escapes are splendid. A night watchman is kept.\n\nThe furnace rooms are small. In two of these rooms the smoke pipes leading from the furnace is almost burned through in places and should be renewed. A fire might easily be started should the pipes take fire and in places they are almost as thin as brown paper.\n\nThe laundry is well equipped and is operated one day a week. The grates in the upright boiler are burned out and at present pieces of pipe are being used. A new grate should be provided.\nOttawa, March 26, 1932.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have to request that you will please ship by freight, charges prepaid, addressed to Rev. G. Leonard, O.M.I., Principal, Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, Lebret, Sask., the following:\n\n4 - 1\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) Gallon Thermene Fire Extinguishers, complete with chemical.\n\nYour account covering the cost of these extinguishers F.O.B. Lebret, Sask., sales tax included, should be forwarded to Rev. Father Leonard, who is being informed of the order placed with you and requested, upon receipt of the extinguishers, if in good condition, to certify the account and send it to the Department for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.

Sir:\n\nMr. Inspector Hamilton, who recently visited the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, states that the battery of the fire alarm is in poor condition and that a new battery should be provided. In this connection I have to say that you should arrange for the installation of a new battery at an early date, the cost of which should be paid from per capita earnings or other receipts of the school.\n\nThe Inspector has drawn attention to the condition of the four pump tank fire extinguishers. He states they are leaking and useless. The Department is today placing an order with the Pyrene Mfg. Co. of Canada Ltd., Toronto, to ship, addressed to you, freight charges prepaid, 4-1/2 gallon pressure extinguishers, complete with chemicals. These fires have been requested to be charged to your account covering the cost F.O.B. Lebret, sales tax included. When the extinguishers are received, if in good condition, you should certify the account and forward it to the Department, in order that payment can be made. When these new extinguishers arrive, they should replace the present large type extinguishers which are not fit for further use.\n\nThe Inspector has also drawn attention to the condition of the smoke pipes leading from the furnace in two of the furnace rooms. He states that these pipes are almost burnt through in places and should be renewed, as a fire might easily be started should the pipes take fire. He further drew attention to the condition of the grates in the wash boiler of the laundry. He recommends that a new grate be provided. I have to request that you will inform the Department as soon as possible of the cost of installing new smoke pipes in the furnace rooms and a new grate for the boiler in the laundry. When we have this information, consideration will be given to authorizing the supplying of same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. G.

If you or the members of your staff are unable to supply this information, I would suggest that you have a competent carpenter, one on the list to receive consideration, examine the roofs and eavestroughs and give an estimate, in detail, of the cost. Regarding the labour, you should state definitely whether Indians could not perform most of the work, under the supervision of a competent carpenter foreman. You should also state if the staff could not assist in performing certain of the work. Our funds this year are extremely limited, and it is necessary, before authorizing the work, that you give as full information as possible regarding costs and the labour that can be utilized. Your early attention to this matter is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. G. Leonard, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Indian Res. School, A. F.

The Principal has forwarded a detailed statement of the materials and labour required, at a total cost of approximately $220 for material and $180 for labour. The greater part of the labour will be performed by the school staff, but it will be necessary to obtain the services of a competent carpenter-foreman.

You may engage the services of Mr. Norman Ferguson, of Abernethy, as carpenter-foreman.\n\nPlease obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the materials. These you should certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. You should also prepare and forward, in triplicate, properly certified, an account in favour of the carpenter-foreman for the amount due him for his services.\n\nIt is noted from the estimate which you submit that the total cost of material and labour will be approximately $396.

Derais. He built the Bake shop and Blacksmith shop at this school and has done considerable work for the Department both here and at other schools. He examined the roof of all three buildings and prepared the estimates at no cost to the Department as he expected the Department would engage him as usual to do the work. His wages are very moderate, three dollars per day, and he would also be able to do the tinsmith work in connection with the cove troughs.\n\nAs pointed out in our previous letter, most of the work would have to be done by the carpenter himself since it is practically all patching. We have no objection to Mr. Ferriksen but no doubt his wages would be somewhat higher than for this reason we wished to bring the above facts to your notice before proceeding with the work.\n\nKindly favor us with an early reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n(Ottawa, Ont.)\n\nF.B.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RC 10, Volume 6325, file 660-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith Estimates for the Qu'Appelle Residential School at Lebret. Being unable to find copies of former Estimates for this school on file here, I proceeded to Lebret and took the matter up with the Principal and find that he has not been sending in Estimates for some time. I therefore looked into conditions and have prepared a list of their requirements.\n\nI have inserted an item for $200.00 to extend the sewage drain pipe a distance of about 200' into the lake. At present it is emptying into a creek bottom about 120' distant from the lake and the smell is offensive and the Provincial Health Department have brought the matter to my attention, asking that it be attended to.\n\nThe Principal asks for an additional cow barn. The cow barn in use at present provides accommodation for 24 milk cows. They should be milking at least 40 cows to provide for their requirements. They have at present over 100 head of cattle and no adequate accommodation for them. In addition to the milk cows required, the school herd provides all the beef used by the institution. A barn suitable for their requirements would cost between thirty-five hundred and four thousand dollars which is a considerable sum. In looking over the situation I am of the opinion that the need could best be met placing a lean-to on each side of the present barn. This would be less expensive and in discussing the matter with the Principal, I find that it would be quite satisfactory to him. I have estimated that the cost of the lean-to would not exceed $1500.00. A great deal of the work can be done by the school carpenter.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nschool carpenter.\n\nI have also placed an item of $410.00 for a water softener in the Estimates. The water from the lake is found to be hard on the boilers and pipes. There is some ingredient in it which eats into the metal and causes corrosion. I have made inquiries and it is thought that by softening the water the corrosion would be practically eliminated.\n\nThe washing machine in use in the laundry is not large enough to take care of the large amount of washing to be done and the Principal asks to be supplied with an additional washer. This would cost approximately $150.00.\n\nGeneral repairs are under way in connection with the roof of the main building and in order to keep up a presentable appearance the shingles on the roof should be re-stained. The pig house and silo require painting badly and there is always a certain amount of repair work to be done. I have included an item of $300.00 for painting and $400.00 for general repairs and fencing. The fence on the west side of the boys' playground has to be rebuilt in order to protect the shrubbery. At present all that remains of the fence is the posts.\n\nI trust you will be able to find money for the foregoing, as the items asked for are in my opinion required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Morrison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\nOttawa, October 5, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 314-11A of the 20th ultimo, forwarding your Estimates covering requirements for the next fiscal year at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that same will be noted for consideration when our Estimates are being prepared.

On Thursday last the top row of tubes burst, which put the heating unit out of commission. I at once proceeded to get full details of the repairs required and an estimate of the cost and on the 12th instant wired for authority to have the boiler repaired. In the meantime the girls beds were removed into the main building and two heating stoves installed in the girls' building to keep the pipes from freezing. Watchmen were kept in the building continually throughout the night and day. The Principal was very anxious regarding the safety of the building and visited it every two hours during the night to see that the man was on the job and everything safe. On Sunday morning he administered communion to the pupils and at\n\n- about 6.30 a.m. -\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6328, file 660-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nabout 6.30 a.m. the Sister in charge of the girls, in passing through the girls' building, noticed smoke coming out of a room adjoining the passage. There was no heating unit in this room and the belief is that the fire was caused through a short circuit in the lighting wires. I may say that this building has been infested with rats during the past few years and it may be quite possible that the insulation on the wires was chewed by them. The pipes from the heating stoves which had been installed did not pass through any of the rooms, but were installed in the corridors. After making full enquiry into the circumstances, it would appear to me that very full precautions had been taken to insure the safety of the building. The pupils were all up and dressed, having attended the morning service in the Chapel, and immediately upon the alarm being given the fire fighting equipment was put in operation. This consisted of hose attached to the pressure tanks and fire extinguishers. The people from the Village of Lebret, the Lay-Brothers from the Seminary across the lake, and the Staff from the Sanatorium at Fort San who brought all the fire extinguishers they could gather with them assisted in making a determined effort to save the buildings; but, in view of the rapidity with which the fire made headway and the fact that the wood in the buildings was as dry as tinder, they were unable to stop its progress and the buildings were totally destroyed. The out-buildings however were all saved and a well organized effort was made to save as much as possible. All the records were taken out of the school, as well as the boys' clothing, the bedding, and the food supplies, also some of the furnishings. The girls however only have the clothing they were wearing, as their clothing was all stored in the building where the fire started.\n\nThe boys are now comfortably housed in the Oblate Fathers' College where there is plenty of room for them. The girls and Sisters are housed in the Town Hall and the Convent. The Town Hall is quite a comfortable building. It has a large basement which can be utilized as a kitchen and dining room, the upper floor being used for sleeping accommodation. They have their mattresses, pillows, and bedding, but none of the iron bedsteads were saved. About twenty-five of the girls were taken to the File Hills School by Indian Agent Dodds and Mr. Rhodes, Principal of the School. This is a temporary arrangement. The Reverend Father informs me that he will be able to carry on with some small assistance in the way of equipment. I have your wire this morning granting me the necessary authority to purchase same. With regard to clothing for the girls, some bulk dress goods was saved as well as several of\n\n- the sewing machines -\nthe sewing machines and it may only be necessary to supply some footwear and dress material. I have a small supply of military clothing here which I will send to them at once to meet immediate pressing needs.\n\nI have long looked upon this building as a fire trap. The Principal has been fully aware of the difficulty which would be experienced should a fire break out and I am satisfied he has continually had this in mind and has taken every precaution towards prevention. Fire stations were established throughout the institution and a watchman assigned who made regular rounds. Records of his visits to the different stations were kept on file and examined each day. This, as you know, is our oldest residential school. There are two hundred and thirty-five pupils enrolled. Ninety boys are now in the Seminary and one hundred and twenty girls in the Town Hall. The present Principal, Father Leonard, has been in charge for twelve years. When he took over the management of the school it was heavily in debt, but by careful management he has succeeded in placing it on a sound financial basis. The loss of his school is a great blow to the Reverend Principal.

MURPHY\n\nWith reference to your enquiry, regarding the destruction by fire of the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School at Lebret, Sask., I have to say Mr. Inspector Harrison informed the department, by telegram, that the fire occurred on Saturday night of the 13th instant. The main school buildings were completely destroyed but all outbuildings were saved, also the bedding, pillows, mattresses, baby clothing, food supplies and considerable furnishings from the main building. The girls who were attending church at the time the fire broke out have only the clothing they were wearing.\n\nAt the present time, arrangements have been made for the care of the 256 pupils who were in residence - 115 boys and 141 girls. The boys are comfortably housed in the Oblate Fathers' College, across the lake from the school, where there is plenty of room for them, while the girls and the Sisters of the staff are in the town hall at Lebret and in the convent. The work of the school can be carried on and it will not be necessary to send any children home. Authority has been granted to supply heaters, a kitchen range, dishes, knives and forks - this being the only supplies to be furnished.\n\nIn reporting on the fire, the Inspector states that it was caused through a short circuit in the lighting wires and that the insulation probably had been destroyed by a rat. A watchman was on duty at the school day and night and the lamp was last seen burning after making full enquiries, it would appear that very full precautions had been taken to insure the safety of the building. There was ample fire equipment on hand, but, in view of the rapidity with which the flames made headway and the fact that the wood in the building was as dry as tinder, it was not possible to stop the progress of the fire.\n\nInspector Harrison states that he is keeping in close touch with the situation and that every effort will be made to safeguard the comfort and health of the Indian children.\n\nThe building was the property of the Dominion Government. It was constructed in 1905 and 1906. I would estimate the loss to be approximately $200,000, with no insurance.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nNovember 19, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Murison:\n\nI have your 314-11A of the 14th instant, with reference to the destruction by fire of the main buildings of the Indian Residential School at Lebret, also your telegrams in this connection. I note that, after making enquiry into the circumstances, you found that full precautions had been taken by the management to insure the safety of the buildings and that the fire was caused by a short circuit in the lighting wires. I have also noted the arrangements that have been made for the comfort and care of the pupils and for their accommodation.\n\nThe serious loss occasioned by the destruction of the school buildings is regretted and sympathy is extended to the Reverend Principal and staff. I note that you will keep in close touch with the situation and that every effort will be made to safeguard the comfort and health of the Indian children.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.

These supplies are needed to help us carry on our work as most of our class-room supplies were lost when the school was turned over.\n\nWe did not report this directly to you as Inspector Murray came to Lebret immediately or being notified and no doubt you had his report soon after. We however wish to offer a few comments on the present conditions.\n\nThe boys were transferred to the Oblate Seminary, directly across the lake from the school, where accommodation was provided them by the Oblate Fathers. Here their conditions are much better than before as the building is more modern and they have allotted us sufficient space to accommodate all our boys, so they were able to resume their class-room work with only a very slight interruption. Of course this arrangement can only be temporary as they have given us this privilege at a great inconvenience to themselves.\n\nThe girls are located in the Town Hall. Considerable alterations were necessary but they now have comfortable quarters and further improvements are being made. As the girls' building was where the fire originated none of their clothes were saved except what they were wearing at the time. This made their condition somewhat difficult at first but they have now sufficient clothing and are very comfortable. They have the old church as a substitute and will be able to resume their studies in a few days.\n\nAs most of the boys' clothing was saved and also a large part of the equipment and furniture in the main building, we are prepared to carry on our work efficiently until such time as a new school is built, which we trust will be in the near future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

REGINA, SASK., 3rd December, 1932.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your telegram of the last instant regarding the request of the Church Authorities for funds to erect a temporary wooden building above the foundation of the basement of the old administration building at Lebret to provide accommodation for the girls and also to confirm the following telegram sent to you in reply:\n\nREFERENCE YOUR TELEGRAM FIRST INSTANT THERE IS NO NECESSITY FOR ERECTION OF TEMPORARY BUILDING FOR GIRLS AT LEBRET STOP ALL PUPILS COMFORTABLY HOUSED FOR WINTER PRINCIPAL OF SCHOOL CONCURS IN THIS - WRITING.\n\nYour telegram came to me as rather a surprise in view of the fact that arrangements had already been made for the comfortable housing of both the boys and girls for the winter. I at once went to Lebret and took the matter up with the Principal, Reverend Father Leonard, who informed me that he was not aware that the Church had been asking for the building in question, and in any event if the building had been necessary the foundation of the old administration building was the last place on which it should be built.\n\nI beg to submit the following report regarding the arrangements which have been made so that you will be in possession of the facts in connection with the situation. The Village of Lebret has handed over the Town Hall for an indefinite period to the Reverend Principal for the purpose of providing accommodation for the girls. This building is seventy feet long and I would judge over forty feet wide. It has a high ceiling and there is plenty of air space. There is a basement under one end of the building which is being used as a kitchen. The Principal\n\nDoctor H. W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6328, file 660-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nhas an addition ten feet wide and seventy feet long nearly completed which will be used as a dormitory to provide sleeping accommodation for the girls. As a temporary measure wooden bunks have been built along both sides of the hall, the main portion of the hall being used also as a dining and recreation room for the girls. A laboratory has been built at one end of the building which is well ventilated and clean. Pails are provided which are emptied four and five times a day, the waste being buried in a pit. Disinfectants are freely used. The old Church is being partitioned off to provide three classrooms and classes are expected to commence on Monday next. Large fire extinguishers are placed in easily accessible positions in this building. The girls are quite comfortably housed and are enjoying the experience. I am informed that they are all putting on weight, some have gained as much as ten pounds since they have been placed in these quarters. They appear very happy and presented a healthy appearance.\n\nThe boys are housed in the Oblate Fathers' Training College across the lake. This is a large modern building and provides ample and comfortable accommodation for all the boys. The classroom work was taken up within two and one half days after the fire and was practically continued uninterrupted.\n\nAll the accommodation being used will be at the disposal of the department until such time as a new building is erected. It may be necessary next summer to erect a small frame building which can be later utilized for some other purpose, for housing a number of the larger boys who work on the farm. The site on which the old school stood is the most suitable site for the new building. In order to facilitate the work of building a new school the debris left from the fire might very well be removed during the winter months. This would save a lot of valuable time in the spring if it is the intention to proceed with the erection of a new building.\n\nI found ninety-six boys and one hundred and eight girls present. Now that arrangements for the housing of the pupils has been completed, the balance of the children who are enrolled will be sent back to the school. The Reverend Principal has been very active in making the accommodation as satisfactory as possible.\nas possible under the circumstances and has taken care of expenses in connection therewith. The work already done has been very necessary and has been done at comparatively little cost. I have purchased the equipment which the Department authorized me to get by wire. The Department may rest assured that everything has been done for the comfort of the children and that no expense will be incurred by myself without the Department's authority.\n\nThe Reverend Principal expressed the opinion that possibly the Church Authorities had asked for the building for the girls before they were in possession of the knowledge that a suitable building had already been arranged for.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

Keller Esq. and to whom it may concern:\n\nDuring the year 1929, Mr. Keller was the contractor for sidewalks in this town and the work was done very satisfactorily by his crew and under his own supervision. Now at the end of two years, a committee was appointed to examine all the sidewalks built by Mr. Keller and they report that all the sidewalks are as good today as when laid and that it is impossible to find any fault with them. Each street was covered carefully by the committee and this council is now satisfied that we have had great satisfaction with the work done by Mr. Keller and they can recommend this man for similar work at any time. If this town was buying further sidewalks of cement we would have no hesitation in asking Mr. Keller to do the work again.\n\nBy order of the Council\n\nArthur Jas. Robertson\nMelfort, Sask.

We do not know where you could have improved on the design and we all feel that the plans drawn by you reflect a great deal of credit. Unquestionably your past experience in rink construction has been given to us in this building.\n\nMany visitors ask to be shown over the building and we have heard nothing but good reports, both in regard to its wonderful construction and general layout. We have no hesitation in recommending this type of rink to any parties interested in new rink buildings and you can refer any such parties to us for details. We will be glad to take anyone over the rink if they desire to go fully into same.

I wrote to Mr. Morrison at Regina and he advised me to write you.\n\nI would appreciate, greatly, any information you care to offer concerning the rebuilding of this school. I would like to know the approximate date when the school is to be rebuilt and if the construction will be let by tenders. To whom should I apply for a set of plans?

The children, as the Department knows, are now housed in the Seminary of the Oblate Fathers and in the Town Hall. School accommodation is provided in the old Indian Church. It is hardly possible to describe the hardships experienced by the Principal and the staff in the conduct of a school as large as that of Lebret under such trying circumstances.\n\nThe Department last December agreed to build a temporary structure on the foundations of the old administration building, but the Principal preferred to keep whatever money would have been spent in this connection for the new buildings.\n\nIt is hoped that the Department will be able to make a very early start in the reconstruction of the Lebret School this coming spring.\n\nThe Oblate Fathers of St. Boniface have ten schools under their jurisdiction. In view of the fact that Lebret School was destroyed by fire they have limited their demands for these schools to such repairs and improvements as they thought absolutely necessary so that the Department would have more funds for the rebuilding of the Lebret School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I presume an Inspector or Clerk of Works will be required during construction and I wish to be considered for this post if the appointment is in your hands. I am in a position to give full time to the supervision of this work and the advantage of having a fully qualified architect in charge will be quite apparent to you.\n\nI have had over twenty years experience in the architectural profession in Canada and have been a registered architect in this Province since 1923.

We would therefore advise that we are in a position to supply concrete building block and tile for back-up with brick, load bearing and partition in either bond cement or cinder cement. Also, we can supply bond cement trim stone and ornamental concrete.\n\nIn connection with cinder block and tile we would particularly point out the value of this product as a building product. It is more insulating against heat and cold, its density value is far superior to any other permanent building material, while it is lighter in weight and has greater compressive strength than clay tile, and of\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6328, file 660-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCourse the cost of cinder, sand or cinder tile must also be taken into consideration. The first cost is lower, and the saving is continued throughout construction to the finished wall. Plastering can be applied direct to the tile, and it will hold. All these factors contribute toward saving of costs in the construction of the wall. A considerable saving is possible in the use of cinder tile where nailing is required, as nails can be driven into the tile eliminating wood plugs etc. The rough texture of cinder tile forms a particularly good base for plastering and a strong bond for the mortar in laying.\n\nWe would greatly appreciate you bringing this letter to the attention of the architect drawing up the specifications of this building. He no doubt is familiar with above mentioned facts and will appreciate to know that the products are available here. We would also appreciate hearing from you so that we may get in touch with the architect and give him any further information that he may require. Thanking you,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6328, file 660-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nYour letter dated the 30th ultimo came to hand on the 3rd instant and I left the following day for Lebret for the purpose of consulting the Principal with regard to the blue prints of the proposed new Qu'Appelle School which you sent me. The Reverend Sister Superior requested me to leave the plans with her for a few days in order that she would have the opportunity of conferring with the Mother Provincial of her Order. I expected the return of the plans on Saturday last, but instead I received a phone call from the Reverend Principal asking to be allowed to retain them until Wednesday.\n\nWhen at the school I had prepared a plan of the old school, showing the accommodation which was provided. It is found on looking over the blue print which you sent that no provision has been made for sewing and reception rooms and it is thought that the classroom space is inadequate. It would be a wonderful thing if you could come here personally and have a conference with the Reverend Principal and Sisters before preparing the final plans. I believe that the expense of your trip would be fully justified. You know the Qu'Appelle school is in a little different class than our ordinary residential schools. It has always been looked upon as one of the places of interest to which distinguished visitors to the Province are taken. It is looked upon more as a Provincial Institution and they receive in consequence a great many visitors. We realize, of course, how hard it will be to raise the necessary funds to rebuild the school under present conditions, but, if it is going to be rebuilt, the accommodation you will agree with me should be adequate.\n\nI have looked over the site and am enclosing a rough sketch showing the location where both the Principal and myself think the school-\n\nMr. R. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nthink the school should be situated; that is on the site of\nthe main building facing the same direction as the old school\ndid. The basement walls of the old building, as you will pro-\nbably remember, were field stone. These have not been injured\nby the fire and it would be possible to utilize them again. The\nReverend Principal plans to commence clearing up the debris from\nthe old building as soon as the weather permits. It is\nthought that the amount which can be realized from the cast iron\nwhich will be salvaged will probably pay the cost of labour in\nclearing up the foundations of the destroyed buildings. I, of\ncourse, could not make a very complete examination, but from what\nI could see the pressure tanks for water storage do not appear to\nbe hurt and the large hot water boiler which was protected appears\nto be uninjured. Possibly quite a number of the radiators can\nbe salvaged.\n\nI am enclosing herewith the rough sketch of the\nold building and will forward the new plans showing the suggestions\nmade by the Reverend Principal and myself as soon as the plans\ncome to hand.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

There are a number of men in the Villages of Fort Qu'Appelle, Lebret and in this Municipality who are skilled and unskilled and have been making a precarious existence for the past two or three years.\n\nWe are asking this in order that some Contractor may not drift in from the City and refuse to take on capable local men.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSec-Treas.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6328, file 660-5, part 3)\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, I am sending forward today under separate cover one copy of the blue prints of a sketch which you had prepared of the proposed new Qu'Appelle School. I regret having held this plan for such a long period, but this was due to the Church Authorities who are anxious to have the accommodation provided according to their ideas for requirements. I may inform you that the Mother Provincial of the Order of Grey nuns prepared a sketch, a copy of the blue print of which I am also forwarding.\n\nAs explained in my letter to you of the 16th instant, it was thought that your plan does not provide for adequate accommodation. The attendance of the boys varies from 103 to 120 and the girls from 123 to 145. The Sisters' plan shows an enlargement of the two wings and also an extra story over the kitchen and boiler room wings to provide for a recreation room and extra classroom. This idea is endorsed by the Reverend Principal. According to the manner in which they have divided up the main building, the Reverend Principal is not in full agreement with the plan as prepared by the Sisters;\n\n1. The basement plan provides, in addition to the main dining room, a small dining room for the large boys, a dining room for the small boys, and in the girl's wing a dining room for the large girls and one for the small girls in addition to the Sisters' dining room, the Fathers' dining room, and the workmen's dining room. So many dining rooms I would imagine would make a lot of work and would mean a large staff. These rooms also, in my opinion, limit the space for recreation rooms. It will be noted that more space is provided for a laundry. This is in my opinion a good idea, as they require a lot of room in their laundry. I do not think that the basement plan requires further comment.\n\n2. With regard to the ground floor, it will be noted that the Principal's rooms have been placed on the opposite side to that shown in your sketch. The boys' dormitory is also shown on this floor, as well as the reception room and classroom over the kitchen. A wider passage is also shown connecting the wing with the main building in order to provide for a stairway leading up to the chapel.\n\n3. With regard to the first floor, in the boys' wing, which is the North wing, the Sisters' plan shows a recreation room and two classrooms. There is a doubt in my mind as to whether these two classrooms are provided with correct lighting to comply with regulations.\n\nR. Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nregulations. A small boys' recreation room is also provided for and the Reverend Principal is of the opinion that this is not the proper place for it. It should be in the basement, as he thinks there would be altogether too much noise from a recreation room placed on this floor. I think his point is well taken.\n\n4. With regard to the second floor, three dormitories are provided and the plan appears to be very well made. There is a direct entrance from the girls' and Sisters' quarters to the gallery of the chapel. At the boys' side there is a stairway leading down from the corridor directly outside the exit from the dormitories. The object the Sisters have in view is to have as much separation as possible between the male and female inmates of the institution. It will be noted that several large linen closets are provided for throughout the building. It is thought that these rooms are much better for keeping the children's clothing than the individual wooden cupboard which it has been customary to provide in the dormitories. It is the intention to have shelving in these rooms divided into individual spaces for each child's outfit. I know from experience in visiting the schools the difficulty they have in keeping fastenings and doors in repair on the wooden cupboards.\n\nI may explain again that the building will face the West. The boys' wing therefore should be on the North side of the building, as their playground is situated on that side. The Girls' playground is on the South side of the building site and this should be kept in view when preparing the plans.\n\nWith regard to the information you ask for in your letter, I will answer the questions in the same order that you place them:\n\n1. The existing water supply is obtained from the Lake. The shore of the lake is about 225 feet from the building site, but the pipe has to be carried for some distance out onto the lake in order to get good water. This water is not good for washing purposes and corrodes the boilers badly. A water softener would correct this and would also be a great asset.\n\n2. The fuel used in the boiler is steam coal.\n\n3. The existing septic tank is in good condition. The rough plan which I have already sent forward to you shows the position of it in relation to the old building. With regard to the drainage, the Provincial Health Authorities have found fault with the existing system. At present the 6\" tile sewage pipe discharges into a dry creek 120 feet from the shore line of the Lake. When I examined it in the fall there was a large pool of sewage gathered which gave off a very offensive smell. By extending this tile pipe a further 200 feet and placing it underground, this difficulty would be overcome.\n\n4. Electric power is supplied by the Montreal Engineering Company. It is an alternating current supply - 120-220 volts.\n\n5. Regarding the nature of the soil for the footings, as far as I can ascertain it is a sort of sandy gravel but quite firm.\n\n6. The rough sketch shows the location of the old building and has already been sent forward.\nTrusting that the foregoing information may be useful to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\nJanuary 27, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th addressed to the Deputy Superintendent General, with reference to the Indian Residential School at Lebret.\n\nI may say that at present there are no funds available for the reconstruction of this building, but your request has been noted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

Although the girls have been as comfortable as could be expected in the Town Hall, this building is of frame construction and has been the cause of much anxiety during the cold weather on account of the fire hazard and can only be looked upon as emergent accommodation. We were very grateful to have it under the circumstances, but I feel that before another winter sets in it would be advisable if the money is forthcoming to have the rear wing of the school erected. This would provide accommodation for the girls and no doubt the Church will continue to allow the boys to reside in the missionary across the lake. I may say I have consulted the Reverend Principal regarding this matter and he is fully in accord with me in connection with my recommendation. I can understand the difficulty which the Government would have in providing the large sum required for the erection of the entire building and would be very grateful if funds can be found for the erection of the rear wing as suggested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

Indian School at Lebret. Would say that our face brick are standard size i.e., 2\u00bdx4x8 inches. Our Ruf Tex face brick are made from a mixture of local clays and our western pottery clays, are in dark, medium and buff shades. Our best appearing buildings such as the Sanatorium at Prince Albert, the Court Houses at Swift Current, Assiniboia, Melfort and Estevan are built of our Ruf Tex face, using the full range of shades. We mix the shades while loading the brick so that there is no possibility of the building having a spotty appearance. The price of $32.00 per M, sales tax included f.o.b. Lebret is about the same or a little less than that of good Red Press face brick. Our face brick, Scots Greys, are a high class product used only in corridors and in the facing of buildings where costs are a secondary consideration. These sell f.o.b. Lebret at $55.00 per M.\n\nWe have from time to time sent samples of our R.T. and Greys to the Federal Architects, your city; but would be pleased to submit samples to you for your consideration if you so desire. Should you favor any of our products the same will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nInternational Clay Products Ltd.\n\nManaging Director.\nMarch 21, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to the use of brick in the proposed new Indian Residential School at Lebret, and in reply I would say that the contents of your letter have been noted.\n\nI might say, however, that in the past it has been the practice of the Department to specify brick of a certain standard, and the purchase of the brick is left open to the contractor securing the contract, providing the brick meets the requirements of the specifications.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

The C.P.R. undertook the building of a railway station in Regina as a relief measure and although the cost of the station was practically charged up to Regina's relief quota, the stone cutting was mostly done before it reached Regina, and the Regina stone cutters got no assistance from it.\n\nI am asked to urge upon you the desirability of having any cut stone work for the Lebret Indian School done on the premises, in which event, Regina tradesmen will have an opportunity of getting some work. I may say the building trades have had nothing for three years and any opportunity of work will be very greatly appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) is provided in the Estimates for a commencement on this work, but at the present it has not been definitely decided whether anything will be done this summer or not.\n\nWith reference to the stone I would say that in Indian Residential Schools very little stone work is used as the construction is mainly of brick. Stone work consists principally of window sills and a small amount of trim. All of this work can most economically be done by machine and there will be very little hand work required.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nTo W.

Van Benschoten,\n\nDear Sirs:-\n\nYour letter of the 24th, Ultimo duly received and has been handed to the writer for reply.\n\nWe have two Paterson chlorine machines at our Cardinal, Ontario, Plant, which were installed during the year 1920. These two machines were sold to us by Messrs. Laurie & Lamb and have given entire satisfaction since the time that they were installed. I note your remark that this is the only installation in the Dominion. On this point, however, I believe you are in error, as I understand several of these machines were sold in the West.\n\nWe have no hesitation, however, in saying that the machines give satisfaction and that the upkeep thereon is practically negligible. The writer does not remember of having spent anything whatsoever in the way of repairs. We have no objection to your using our name and citing our experience with reference to the satisfactory operation of the equipment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE CANADA STARCH CO., LIMITED.\n\nJHH/FC.\nSir:-\n\nI am in receipt of a request from the Reverend C. Leonard, Principal of the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School at Lebret, for six additional fire extinguishers for use in the Town Hall where the girls are housed at present. There were only two fire extinguishers saved from the old building and these, together with barrels of water, are the only fire protection they have. I obtained prices from Bowman Brothers in this City for the gallon size of chemical extinguisher and they have quoted Foamine at $11.75 and the Guardian at $13.70. These are manufactured by the Pyrene Company.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

I enclose herewith Encumbrance Certificate authorizing the expenditure.\n\nPlease obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.

Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nMr. Murison and I have just returned from Lebret and we are both very uneasy about the situation of the children there.\n\nThe girls are quartered in the Town Hall, a frame building, where they are sleeping in five deck tiers of bunks. Some of them have beds on top of the ceiling of the entry-way. The kitchen is in the basement and there are one or two stoves with long lines of pipe on the main sleeping floor. The place looks very dangerous from a fire standpoint. The building is flimsy and would burn in a few minutes. I should think, in the event of fire, there would be some casualties. Of course there will be no danger from the heating stoves until cold weather comes, as the cooking range in the basement looks reasonably safe.\n\nThe boys are quartered across the lake and we did not seem to find time to see them. They are safer than the girls, but I am told that their surroundings are less healthy. They sleep in a basement and have most of their living quarters there as well.\n\nI do not know what plans are being made in regard to the replacement of the school or any part of it and should not anticipate any great trouble before you may have an opportunity to see it for yourself, but I should think the Department ought to look forward to making some rather radical changes before cold.\n\nHarold W. McGill, Esq. M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nchanges before cold weather comes. They tell me that the girls are much more healthy in their new surroundings than they were in the old. Certainly they look very well indeed.\n\nThey need a new range at the File Hills Hospital and I am sending through a requisition for it. Mr. Murison knows what is wanted and will get it for them. I recommend this matter for your approval. The cost will be somewhere about $160.00.\n\nI am leaving for Calgary tonight and have heard from Mr. Christianson that he will be able to go to all the Hospitals in the neighborhood with me. I hope you have been able to get off to him some instructions about the interviews of the applicants for the new position.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. L.

All outbuildings were saved, also the bedding, pillows, mattresses, boys' clothing, food supplies and considerable furnishings. The girls were attending Church at the time of the fire and only saved the clothing they were wearing.\n\nThere were 256 pupils in residence\u2014116 boys and 141 girls.\n\nThe boys were transferred to the Oblate Seminary directly across the lake. This is a modern building with facilities for classrooms and dormitories. The girls are located in the Town Hall in the village of Lebret, 3 miles from the school site. Considerable alterations were made to this building but the dormitory accommodation and other facilities are inadequate. In the dormitories, the girls sleep in bunks in tiers of four, one above the other. They attend classes in the old school.\n\nThe sum of $50,000 is provided in the estimates for the current fiscal year to erect one unit as an extension to the proposed main building and will comprise the heating plant, chapel and dining rooms.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nInvoice No. 24300  \nOrder No. 301  \nTerms: 2% June 10th\n\nTo: Bowman Brothers Limited  \nRegina, Sask.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| May 8 | Guardene Extinguishers $13.70 | $22.20 Less 2% |\n\nShipped to Rev.

S. MacKenzie,\nSec. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe note from the press that estimates were passed for the building of a new wing for the new Indian School at Lebret. We wrote you previously calling your attention to the necessity of heating plants in this locality being equipped for the burning of Saskatchewan Lignite coal.\n\nSaskatchewan Lignite is a low rank fuel of approximately fifteen million B.T.U's per ton. It is economically situated for Regina and South Saskatchewan, and therefore can be burned at considerable less cost.\n\nIn designing new heating plants, we recommend that the combustion chamber be fairly high, non-sifting grates be used, together with Forced Draft and Automatic Control. This will enable you to burn the low rank fuel efficiently or it will allow you to burn any grade of fuel more efficiently than the old system.\n\nOur company equipped the buildings at the Royal North West Mounted Police Barracks, Regina and Moose Jaw Post-Office as well as the Armouries. The Regina Post-Office heating cost up to 1930 was approximately $2800. During that season the building was doubled in size. The fuel costs with Sask. Lignite and our equipment the following two years were $240 and $2163; thereby heating double the capacity for the same cost.\n\nWe trust you will give this matter your early consideration, and hope to hear from you by return.\n\nYours truly,\n\nLIGNITE EQUIPMENT LTD.\n\nJAE/HE.\nJune 13, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 9th\n\nI beg to say that it is not the intention to proceed at the present time with the rebuilding of the Indian Residential School at Lebret.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

Les Reverends Peres Oblate for and in con-\nsideration of the compensation and stipulations hereinafter set forth shall\nerect at their own expense an Indian Residential School Building, having\naccommodation for two hundred and fifty pupils, according to the plans and\nspecifications prepared by the architect of the Department of Indian Affairs,\nupon the property of the Party of the Second Part, on a site to be selected\nby the architect of the Department of Indian Affairs adjacent to the site\noccupied by the school building recently destroyed by fire at Lebret, sub-\nject however to the express provision that the awarding of the contract must\nfirst be approved by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, and sub-\nject to the further provision that the building shall be erected under the\nsupervision and to the satisfaction of the architect of the Department of Indian Affairs;\n\n2. The Crown, in consideration of the faithful performance by Les Reverends Peres Oblats of the covenants and stipulations recited in the previous paragraph, agrees that when the Indian Residential School is completed it shall be operated and used solely as an Indian Residential School under the direction and management of the said Les Reverends Peres Oblats, subject to all the Department's Rules and Regulations governing the operation of the Department's Indian Residential Schools;\n\n3. Les Reverends Peres Oblats shall call for tenders for the construction of the said school according to the plans and specifications prepared by the architect of the Department of Indian Affairs as hereinabove provided, and the lowest of said tenders, if reliable, shall be accepted subject, however, to the approval of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs. The Crown shall pay to Les Reverends Peres Oblats for a period of twenty-five years to be computed from the date of acceptance of the said tender, five per centum (5%) per annum payable semi-annually for interest charges, and two and one-tenth per centum (2.1%) per annum payable annually as part payment on the construction cost of the said school as fixed by the said accepted tender, to which cost shall be added an amount sufficient to cover the necessary legal and notarial fees and disbursements, bond discount and expenses incidental to the loan and bond issue required to provide the funds for the said construction, the whole, however, subject to the approval of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Crown shall also during the said period pay annually to the said Reverends Peres Oblats an amount not exceeding four-tenths of one per centum (0.4%) for insurance premiums on the said school and annual charges of the Trustee appointed under the Trust deed securing the bonds to be issued for the above purpose.\nAnd it is expressly provided that there shall be applied annually in repayment on the construction cost of the said school, not only the said two and one-tenth per centum (2.1%) above stipulated, but also that portion of the five per centum which is in excess of the actual interest on the annual balance of the construction cost as shown on schedule attached hereto.\n\nAnd it is further provided that at the expiration of the said twenty-five years the school building shall belong to the Crown absolutely.\n\n4.

After the fire, arrangements were made to accommodate the girls in a building used as a town hall in the village of Fort Qu'Appelle. This is a long, narrow, wooden building. An annex was erected on one side, the full length of the building. Formerly it had housed in addition to the main hall which was over-crowded, unsanitary, and a fire-trap. The girls are sleeping in bunks, 5 tiers deep, in the main building, while in the annex, sleeping in the loft, were 54 girls. All cooking is done in the basement, located under the front entrance to the school, and the food has to be carried up narrow stairs, and into the main hall. This main hall is used as a dining-room, recreation-room, and sleeping-room. The sanitary arrangements are at the most primitive stage; there are no bathing facilities, and the children wash in a wooden trough. The odour in the building, mostly of creolin used for disinfecting purposes, was nauseating.\n\nIn the event of a fire occurring, I cannot see how any of the children or the Sisters in charge could escape. There is also great danger of an epidemic from the over-crowded, unsanitary conditions. In all my experience, I have never seen a situation such as is provided for the girls.\n\nAfter fully considering the situation and consulting Inspector Hurison, Father Levesque (Principal of the School); Dr. Simes, the medical officer; Dr. Ferguson, on the Qu'Appelle Sanitarium; and the Rev. Sisters, and with the sole view of preserving the life of the children, I arranged to secure a building which, when fitted up, will meet the requirements until such time as a new school building can be erected. The building I selected is of stone construction up to the top of the first story and is shiplap above. The interior of the building is finished and has never been occupied. It is a large building with an annex on the side, which has been used as an ice cream and soft drink parlour.\n\nThis building can be obtained at a nominal rental, which the Principal of the School will undertake to pay without cost to the Department. After discussing the situation with the above-named persons, who accompanied me, and in view of the urgent necessity of providing better and more sanitary accommodation for the girls, I authorized it.\n\n- Inspector\nInspector Murison to undertake the cost of fitting up the building. It is estimated that it will cost approximately $2,000 to install hot air heating, erect partitions, and finish the interior walls with beaver board or similar material. The annex can be used as a dining hall and the main building for sleeping and living accommodation for the girls. Mr. Murison will arrange for the purchase of material in fitting up the building and a hot air furnace for heating purposes. He will also make application, from firms on the list to receive consideration. The principal will have his own carpenter and staff do as much of the work as possible. It may be necessary to engage the services of one or two outside labourers. Mr. Murison will take this matter up with Mr. Ferley, the member for the constituency.\n\nIt was necessary to take the immediate action which I did in authorizing the obtaining and fitting up of the building. Dr. Simes and the school authorities were afraid that the Provincial Authorities would condemn the present arrangements of the girls remaining in the town hall, owing to unsanitary conditions and danger of loss of life by fire. I understand that Dr. Stone and yourself visited the school during the past summer and are familiar with the situation. I hope that the action taken by myself, after inspecting the present accommodation of the girls and after consulting the parties named, will meet with your approval. It will certainly solve the situation in providing more adequate accommodation, preventing an outbreak of illness and loss of pupils' lives, until such time as a new school building is erected. If my action is approved I will pay the necessary encumbrance raised covering the expenditure to the $50,000. As you are aware, there was $50,000 provided in our Estimates for the current year towards the construction of a new building. This amount has not been used and there is therefore ample funds to fit up the building. The Inspector and the Principal will see that all work at the lowest possible cost and will see that all material and any extra labour required are obtained from proper sources. The fitting up and use of the building will greatly help the Rev. Sisters in charge of the girls and will satisfy all concerned.\n\nThe boys are housed in a large brick veneer building used as a Scholastic, the property of the church authorities, located across the lake a distance of 3 miles by road from the town hall, used at present as a residence for the girls. The fitting up and use of the building referred to will ease the mind of all concerned and meet requirements, temporarily, for the housing of the girls.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE,\nW. REGINA, SASK., 16th October, 1933\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nWhen Mr. Sutherland was here recently we together visited Lebret with a view to arriving at some means of relieving the congestion in the sleeping accommodation for the girls.\n\nWe viewed an unfinished building from the outside which appeared to be a suitable building, if completed, for our purpose. Later on I again visited Lebret and made a thorough examination of the building and came to the conclusion that it would only partially meet our requirements and would cost a considerable sum of money to put it in shape.\n\nWhen at Lebret the Church Authorities offered the use of the basement of their new stone Church, if we would put it in shape for use as a dormitory. I examined this basement thoroughly. The main basement is 50 feet wide, 100 feet long, and has a 10 foot ceiling. Attached to this building and separated by a two foot thick stone wall is a boiler room in which three furnaces are situated. The central furnace is intended for use in heating the basement only. There are four windows in each side wall and in addition eight large ventilators. This basement room I think would be ideal for our purpose and would reduce the fire hazard to a minimum.\n\nIn order to put the building in shape it will be necessary to put in a cement floor and line the walls and ceiling with plaster board. A drain pipe for the sewage disposal is already installed about the middle of the building. There is an alcove at the east end in which we could install ten or eleven toilets. I am at present engaged in getting estimates of the cost of putting this building in shape. I am of the opinion that we can dig a well 20 feet deep and 6 feet in diameter which will provide a sufficient supply of water. I am also making enquiry as to whether we could -\n\nH. W.

As this building is con-\nnected with the electric power line, it would be a simple matter\nto install an automatic electric pump. The cost of the pump and\nmotor will be approximately one hundred dollars and I am hoping\nto salvage enough piping as well as the pressure tank to enable\nus to operate a water flushing system in connection with the\ntoilets.\n\nWith the splendid ventilation in this room, I am\nsure we can provide sleeping accommodation for the 120 girls in\nthis one building. It is also proposed that we will move the\ntemporary building which has been attached to the Town Hall and\nattach it to the old church building as living quarters for the\nSisters in charge. In the event of the fitting up of this build-\ning meeting with the approval of the Department, it is intended to\nuse the old church which is at present being used as classrooms,\nfor a kitchen, dining room, and living quarters for the Sisters.\nThey would therefore use the Town Hall, which is at present being\nused as a dormitory, for classroom purposes only.\n\nI hope to be in a position to submit you fairly\napproximate figures on the cost within a few days, but I am satis-\nfied that the whole undertaking can be completed for a sum not\nexceeding $3,000.00. It is important that we should get this work\nunder way at once before the cold weather sets in.\n\nWith reference to the labour in connection with these\nproposed improvements, it is my intention to have the carpenter at\npresent employed at the school undertake the supervision of the work\nand our boys can assist with the labour. The only skilled labour\nthat will be necessary will be the plumbers who may have charge of\nthe installation of the toilets and water system.\n\nThe arrangement I have outlined I am satisfied will\nmeet the requirements of the Provincial Health Department and will\nalso fill the need in so far as providing accommodation for the\ngirls is concerned until such time as it may be possible to have the\nnew school erected. I have no hesitation in recommending that this\nproposal be acted upon, if possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

Murphy,\nMinister of Interior and Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nOTTAWA,\n\nDear Mr. Murphy,\n\nAt the special request of His Eminence Cardinal Villeneuve, Archbishop of Quebec, and in the name of the Reverend Oblate Fathers of the Manitoba Province, I beg to submit the following for your consideration:\n\nIn view of the fact that the Government cannot rebuild the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School at Lebret, Saskatchewan, this year, and that, nevertheless, its reconstruction is deemed by us to be very essential to carry on the educational work of the Indians in that section of Saskatchewan, the Oblate Fathers of the Manitoba Province make the following offer to the Department of Indian Affairs:\n\nThe Reverend Oblate Fathers will supply the necessary capital and erect a school according to plans and specifications prepared by the Architect of the Department of Indian Affairs; the construction of this building to be under his supervision. This building would provide accommodation for two hundred and fifty pupils (250), both boys and girls.\n\nOn the completion of the building, the Reverend Oblate Fathers would expect the Department of Indian Affairs to agree to the following terms:\n\n(1) To lease the building so erected by the Oblate Fathers for a period of twenty-five years, subject to the payments mentioned in the succeeding paragraph.\n\n(2) To pay to the Reverend Oblate Fathers the following amounts annually:\n\n(a) 5% on the total amount involved in the erection of the school - such amount to be arrived at by submitting to the Department for its approval vouchers in respect to the main contract and such sub-contracts as it may be necessary to sub-let and accept for the completion and satisfactory construction of the school.\n\n(b) An annual amount of $25 covering depreciation of the building.\n\nWhile the building is under construction progress payments would have to be made to the contractors and it is understood that the Department of Indian Affairs would pay to the Reverend Oblate Fathers interest at the rate of 5% on the actual amounts paid in this manner.\n\nIf, at any time, the Department of Indian Affairs wishes to assume ownership of the building, the Reverend Oblate Fathers agree to transfer said ownership to the Department on payment by the Department of the total amount expended on the erection of the school, less any depreciation previously allowed by the Department.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6328, file 660-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIt is further provided that, if the Department of Indian Affairs so desires at the expiration of the first period of twenty-five (25) years, this lease may be renewable by the Government for a further period of the same duration.\n\nShould, at any time, whilst this lease is in force or during its renewal, the amount of depreciation allowed by the Government be equal to the original amount invested in the building, the Reverend Oblate Fathers will willingly surrender its ownership to the Government.\n\nIn submitting the above proposal at the request of His Eminence Cardinal Villeneuve, Archbishop of Quebec, the Reverend Oblate Fathers of the Manitoba Province do so with a view to assisting the Department of Indian Affairs in providing a necessary building to replace the former Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. I believe it is unnecessary for me to outline the work that the Oblate Fathers have done among the Indians in the West during the past, but I wish to take this opportunity of assuring you of our continued cooperation with the Department in the education of the Indian children.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSIGNED. J. O. PLOURDE.\nO. M. I.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOctober 6, 1932.\n\nI am sending you herewith a further letter addressed to the Minister by Reverend Father Plourde, relative to the rebuilding of the Industrial School at Lebret.\n\nThe Minister desires you to return this letter together with a report thereon.\n\nEnc.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, [date]\n\nMr.\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nOctober 16, 1935.\n\nMemorandum: The Honorable, the Superintendent General,\n\nIn reference to the offer made by the Reverend Oblate Fathers of the Manitoba Province for rebuilding the \"Appelle Indian Residential School,\" I beg to say that it is desirable that the school be rebuilt at the earliest possible date, and it would appear that the Department would be quite justified in taking advantage of the offer made by the Reverend Fathers, providing they would agree to a change in the amount that they would allow the Department should the building be taken over at any time.\n\nThey stipulate in their offer that the Oblate Fathers would agree to transfer the ownership of the building in payment by the Department of the total amount expended in the erection of the school, less any depreciation previously paid by the Department, which in their agreement they mention as 2\u00bd% annually of the total cost of the building. In addition to this the Department should be given credit for the reduction each year of the amount of interest due to the depreciation payments. Under this arrangement the Department would have paid at the end of 25 years \u00a3610 per thousand on depreciation and \u00a3674/10 per thousand, being the amount credited annually due to the reduction in interest, and the Department would have practically paid for the building in 25 years.\n\nIf the Department pays only the interest on the investment, deducting each year the reduction in the amount due to the depreciation payments, they would have paid at the end of 25 years \u00a3650/00 per thousand on depreciation, and would have to pay a lump sum of \u00a3860/00 per thousand in order to take over the building.\n\nI would be in favour of the scheme as first mentioned above. The Oblate Fathers would, of course, have to erect the building in strict accordance with the plans and specifications prepared by the architect of the Department, but no doubt they would be able to build the school at considerably less cost than if same was erected by the Department, owing principally to the fact that they would not be compelled as a private concern to adhere to the Department of Labour's Fair Wage Schedule.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 628, file 660-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIf the work could be started this fall it would be a great help in relieving unemployment in that section of the country. It would have to be definitely undertaken, also that if the offer is accepted that they would proceed with the work immediately and carry same to completion without interruption.\n\nThe Department will appoint an Inspector of Construction to supervise the work, in order to make sure that it is being carried out in accordance with the plans and specifications.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, October 27, 1933\n\nDear Father Plourde,\n\nOn the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, in which you submitted for my consideration certain proposals for the re-building of the Indian Residential School at Lebret, Saskatchewan, I discussed the matter with the departmental officers and am now enclosing copies of a proposed Agreement which I feel embodies the conclusions reached after a full discussion of the subject by yourself with the departmental officials and myself.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.

In this connection it is noted that the unfinished building, which was selected by yourself, Mr. Sutherland of this Department, Dr. Simes, and the Rev. Principal of the School, has, upon further examination by you, been found to only partially meet requirements and that the church authorities have offered use of the basement of their new stone church for dormitory purposes for the girls. The Department notes that you consider the basement of the church would be ideal for the purpose, that fire hazard would be reduced to a minimum and that splendid ventilation could be obtained.\n\nIt is noted that it is also proposed to move the temporary building which was attached as an annex to the town hall, in which the girls are at present located, and attach it to the old church building as living quarters for the Sisters in charge and also to use, as kitchen, dining room and living quarters for the Sisters, the old church which is at present being used for classroom purposes. The town hall, which is at present used as a dormitory, will then be used for classroom purposes only.\n\nThe Department will approve of this arrangement for better living accommodation for the girls, and, in this connection, I have to confirm the following night lettergram to you of the 28th ultimo:\n\n\"Reference your letter 16th, Department approves expenditure three thousand dollars, fitting up basement stone church, Lebret, for girls' dormitory, Qu'Appelle School.

In the employment of any skilled labour for installing heating, toilets and water system, it would be advisable to consult the local member for the constituency.\n\nThe Department will leave this matter in your hands, to have the work performed at the least possible cost. It will be appreciated if you can effect a saving in the amount authorized. I am enclosing an encumbrance certificate, authorizing the expenditure of the amount mentioned therein. You should obtain itemized accounts, in duplicate, covering the cost of all materials, and keep proper time sheets, in triplicate, for the outside skilled labour engaged. These, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. It should be stated on each copy of the voucher that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E.R. No. 1050.\n\nIt is hoped that you will be able to have the work as mentioned in your letter carried out as soon as possible and the children removed from their present quarters in the town hall. Should you require an advance to pay labour, same will be sent you upon request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 114-0-5, dated the 31st ultimo, with reference to authority granted to me to expend $2,000.00 in fixing up the basement of the new stone Church at Lebret for dormitory purposes for the girls. I also acknowledge receipt of your lettergram to me dated the 25th ultimo, which I received on the 29th.\n\nI may advise you that I have conferred with Mr. E. Perley, M.P., and have explained to him the work we have in view. Mr. Perley assured me that the programme I outlined to him as to how the work was to be carried out was quite satisfactory to him.\n\nI proceeded to Lebret on the 30th ultimo, accompanied by Mr. Harry Potts, of Potts and Miller, Plumbers of this City, and we looked over the situation and decided on the work which was considered necessary in order to give them adequate toilets, baths, and water system. We also looked over the material salvaged from the old school after the fire and find that we have a boiler suitable for a pressure tank and also sufficient 5\" cast iron soil pipe for our requirements. I, at the same time, arranged for cement and material for forms from the local lumber yard at Lebret. There is only one lumber yard and, as it was necessary to push the work and they gave me a very good price, I felt that the delay, which would be incurred in getting prices and shipping in, would not be justified; and this action met with Mr. Perley's approval.

Apart from the plumbing, it is not considered that it will be necessary to employ any skilled outside help. I thought it advisable to take two experienced diggers from the City to supervise the excavation in connection with the sewage disposal system and when at Lebret engaged some labourers to assist with the digging. It has frozen very hard during the past few nights and it is advisable that this work should be rushed before the ground freezes solid.

This draft has incorporated most of the clauses contained in the form of agreement submitted by the Rev. Father Plourde. The material modifications effected by the present draft appear in its clauses 5, 4 and 7.\n\nClause 5 has been amended to allow the Oblats Fathers, should they so determine, to proceed without delay in financing their project. The time for doing so is considered favourable and the present period for building is propitious. Besides, the Rev. Fathers by the method suggested would be placed in the position of paying forthwith all disbursements in connection with the construction of the school, saving thereby discounts on material, etc.\n\nClause 4 allows the Government to obtain the ownership of the school at any time by assuming the payment of any outstanding balance on the loan of bond issue contracted for the construction of the school. This allows the bonds to be issued for the full period of twenty-five years without being subject to recall, which would somewhat depress the selling price of the bonds and entail the payment of a recall premium.\n\nClause 7 in the form of agreement submitted by Father Plourde was not required, as the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs could not be sought in damages for any failure of Parliament to vote the monies.\nMr. J. Ryan,\n\nrequired in this matter.\n\nI have substituted to this clause a paragraph allowing the Oblate Fathers to transfer the monies payable to them under the agreement, as this is essential in order to secure the loan or bond issue contemplated.\n\nTrusting this brief letter will explain satisfactorily the purpose and purport of the modifications incorporated in the tentative draft appended hereto, I beg to remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nsigned) C.

We all appreciated greatly your friendly co-operation.\n\nUpon checking over my figures after I arrived here Saturday and preparing a schedule making provision for $100 bonds, that is to say, amortizing each year to the nearest round amount of $100 instead of $500, I find that the figure of two and one tenth percent - 2.1 percent - instead of that of two and fifteen hundredths percent - 2.15 percent - as mentioned in the contract draft will be sufficient in addition to the 5 percent original interest to take care of the total issue in 25 years. So in re-drafting the contract will you kindly make that change?\n\nHowever, may I suggest that in drafting the order-in-Council respecting the annual subsidy for the Indian school at Lebel that the basis of an annual subsidy of 7% percent of the total cost as determined by the superintendent general be used. This money would then be turned over to the Trust Company who would render proper accounts and vouchers as to manner of disbursement. Any unused portion of the annual subsidy would then remain with the Trust Company to the credit of the crown and would bear interest at the current rate, and would constitute a reserve...\nDr. H. McGill,\n\nreserve against possible future disbursements and to meet all or part of the cost of the premium on the bonds should some of the bonds be recalled. At the expiration of the bond issue any monies remaining in the account would then be turned over to the department with an official accounting.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) Gerald G.

It is also agreed that if at any time the Superintendent General should wish to obtain the ownership of the said Les Peres Oblats du Manitoba shall transfer the said ownership to him subject, however, to the Superintendent General assuming to pay to the release and discharge of Les Peres Oblats du Manitoba any outstanding balance on the loan made or bonds issued to defray the cost of the said building;\n\n5.

In this connection I may say that we make a practice of submitting important contracts of this type to the Department of Justice.\n\nThe most important point in which I think the contract needs amplification is that dealing with the cost of the building. I think the contract should itemize the details which are to be included in cost, including cost of financing (details to be properly itemized), and that the cost of financing as well as the whole financing contract should be subject to approval by the Government. In this connection it appears to me unusual to capitalize insurance charges during the life of the building, and it would seem preferable to take care of this item by periodic payments.\n\nClause No.4 should be subject to reconsideration from the point of view of wording and possibly \"The Government of the Dominion of Canada\" should be substituted for \"Superintendent General\" where this phrase occurs in this clause.\n\nProbably it will be necessary to provide for supervision of the cancellation of bonds as they are paid off, though this may be covered adequately.\nin the financing contract, which will be subject to approval.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

No written agreement was entered into. We were able to salvage considerable material from the old building and the actual cost of the completed work is approximately $300.00 less than it was anticipated when the work was commenced.\n\nThe Church basement is now being occupied, but the work in connection with the old Church which is being converted into a kitchen, dining, and recreation room is not yet completed.

No. 1050\n\nLetter No. telegram dated 28th Oct. 1933\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nNote: See order attached to make check payable to V.C. Johnston.\n\nInspector\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nFebruary 16th, 1934.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General -\n\nMr. Orr, Architect of the Department,\nis leaving Saturday night, February 17th, for\nQu'Appelle, Sask., for the purpose of discussing\nplans and arrangements in connection with the\nerection of an Indian Residential school at Lebret.\nHe will be absent about a week.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nFeb. 7, 1934.\n\nDr. H. W. McGill,\nDeputy-Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nMy dear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have just discussed the problem of the proposed new Indian School at Lebret, Saskatchewan, with Mr. W. Murison, Inspector of Indian Agencies and with Doctor R. G. Ferguson, Director of the Anti-Tuberculosis League of this province and his associate Dr. Symes. I thought it well to write to you at once and set forth our views on this important project.\n\nTo begin with, let me say that I am in full sympathy with Doctor Ferguson in his endeavour to provide anti-tubercular protection for our Indian children as well as proper care for those now infected with the disease. His plan of a sanatorium at Lebret for Catholic children in conjunction with the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School and another at Mile Hills for non-Catholic Indian children seems to be quite necessary for reasons that you will easily understand. I saw tentative plans of the proposed new building for this work. They are suitable though quite modest and will not entail any great expenditure of money, about $40,000.\n\nWe have moreover discussed together the main school building and requirements for present needs. After looking over the situation from every viewpoint, it seems most advisable and even necessary to build according to the revised plan sent you by Mr. Murison in February 1935. The truth is that the Indian school population of the Qu'Appelle district has increased and this is likewise true of other districts such as that covered by the Crooked Lake and Duck Lake Schools as well as others. Hence, it is that although theoretically there might be an exchange of pupils to fill the places left by the tubercular children taken to Lebret, in practice, it will be found that the same accommodation would be necessary as heretofore in the main building. Moreover if the present revised plans were cut, the difference in cost would be relatively slight, and the result would not be satisfactory. I, therefore, most strongly recommend that the sanatorium as proposed by Dr. Ferguson be provided and that the revised plan sent you by Mr. Murison last February be adopted as a suitable main building. If this can\nbe done,\u2014and I am sure it can with your kind co-operation\u2014the double problem of sanitary protection for tubercular children and the rebuilding of the historic Indian School of Lebret will be solved to the complete satisfaction of all concerned and for the lasting benefit and welfare of our dear Indian children.\n\nI recall with pleasure your kindness to me two years ago when I visited your office shortly after the burning of the School. I hope that you are very well, and that you may find it possible to solve the Lebret problem along the lines above indicated.\n\nWith every kind wish, I am,\n\nYours very devotedly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nArchbishop of Regina.\n\nP.S. I am writing to the Rt. Honourable Prime Minister along these lines today.\nFebruary 12th, 1934.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your favour of February 7th, for which I desire to thank you. I may say that the matters dealt with in your letter will receive the sympathetic consideration of the Department.\n\nThe subject of the rebuilding of the Lebret school has given the Department much concern and I would ask Your Grace to accept my assurance that we still hope to reach a solution satisfactory to all concerned.\n\nMay I express my pleasure and appreciation of your kind reference to the incident of your visit to the Department some two years ago. I have also a very pleasant recollection of meeting Your Grace in the village of Lebret on the 2nd of July last.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMost Reverend J.

Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nFebruary 28th 1934.\n\nDr H.W.McGill,\nDeputy Supt General,\nDept of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nre Indian School, Labret.\n\nIn view of the possibility of the above work being included in the Government program of public works, I am writing you as to the architectural services in this connection.\n\nThis office has been maintained in Regina for twenty-five years except for the four years of the war when both my partner at that time, F.C. Clomesho, and myself served overseas with the C.E.F.\n\nIn Regina, this office has designed and supervised the erection of some of the most important schools and churches, together with work at St Chad's College, Nurses Home of the Regina General Hospital, and the Masonic Temple.\n\nI am known to most Regina citizens and refer you more particularly to the Hon. W.A. Macpherson, Mr Frank Turnbull and Mr Harrison.\n\nThe Royal Architectural Institute of Canada having in mind the serious unemployment existing amongst Architects and Draughtsmen, have already approached the Government to place as much architectural work as possible with the practicing Architects throughout the Dominion.\n\nFurther, I would suggest that it would be advantageous in many ways to the Government to have all drawings, specifications and supervision done by a local Architect, who would have ready access to the necessary information governing the requirements of the building, and be familiar with the local conditions influencing the choice of materials likely to be engaged on the building.\n\nHowever, if it is decided to place the supervision only with a local Architect and I be favoured with the appointment, my closest attention will be given to the successful carrying out of the undertaking.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RC 10, Volume 6328, file 660-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nEnclosed find a copy of resolution passed by the Council of the Village of Lebret in respect of the rebuilding of the Indian School. There is a great amount of unemployment in Lebret & Fort Qu'Appelle district...this would help the municipalities as relief is concerned - hoping that you will consider the merit of this resolution.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.J.

I remember these receipts particularly, as I informed Mr. Willis that the Department needed them and he was put to some trouble in order to get them for me. Both Miss Wylie and myself remember the incident with regard to these receipts but to make sure we called up Mr. Willis and he also is positive that he furnished the receipts in question. Would it not be possible that the Clerk who checked over the voucher may have overlooked them. If duplicate receipts are desired, I will endeavor to get them for you.\n\nI regret very much having this account held up, as Willis Electric have waited for a considerable time and I know need the money.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

Ashdown Hardware Company Limited, Regina, for metal ceiling supplied in connection with fitting up the basement of the Church as a dormitory for the girls at the Qu'Appelle Residential School.\n\nI regret that this voucher has not been forwarded at an earlier date, but I have been holding it up awaiting a statement of a credit from the J. H. Ashdown Company for material returned. Some material was returned to the Company by the Reverend Father Leonard and I have arranged for a refund of the amount to the Department when the goods can be located. Apparently this was shipped to the Ashdown Hardware instead of to the Western Steel Metal Works and rather than hold back the voucher any longer I thought it better to issue it and have the refund made when the returned goods are located.\n\nWith reference to this expenditure, I may say that the ceiling was asked for by the Reverend Father Leonard to cover up the joists and to make the dormitory easier to heat and also to make it practically fire proof. When he asked for the ceiling I informed him that the cost would exceed the amount allowed for renovations at the school, and he stated that if the Department desired it, he would refund the amount by which the appropriation was exceeded. I expect that the value of the material returned will amount to about $60.00, which when received will mean an over-expenditure of $75.00 over the amount of the appropriation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Detailed statements should be forwarded showing how this amount of money was expended, and, if part was used for wages, receipts should be attached from those to whom wages were paid, also receipts for any purchases made.

Lignite.\n\nSask. Lignite is now being burned with good success in nearly all public buildings, schools, apt. blocks etc. in Southern and Central Sask. at greatly reduced costs over Alberta Coal, but on account of it being a non-cooking fuel, it requires a non-sifting grate in order to stop combustible loss to ash pit, also on account of it being a higher moisture fuel, requires more draft, but with the addition of above makes by far the most economical fuel on the market today.\n\nIf you intend using stoker equipment, we have found that the overfeed type is more suitable to this fuel, and we have a good many plants in use here in Regina and Southern Sask. including Parl. Buildings, C.P.R. Dept., T. Eaton Co. and several others.\n\nWhen purchasing boilers for these plants, it is customary to buy the boiler less grates and get the special grates separately and in this way save the price of the regular type.\n\nWe would appreciate hearing from you by return in connection with above plant and trust that same will be proceeded with in\n\nIndian Affairs.

It has come to the notice of our Members that smaller contractors, not members of our Exchange, have been paying ridiculously low wages, in some cases as low as 15 or 20\u00a2 per hour. This has made it almost impossible for our Members to obtain any of the smaller work against such competition and as a matter of fact most of the work in the last year has been small work.\n\nDespite these facts our Members feel that no real progress towards recovery can be made by cutting rates to a point below a living wage and owing to the length of the winter season in this Province, hourly rates are of necessity somewhat higher than in places where work can be carried on nearly all the year round.\n\nIn view of these facts our Members have decided that the rates set up by this Exchange last year are fair and reasonable and have adopted the same rates for the year 1924. We append a copy of these rates for your information.\n\nShould these rates not meet with your approval we think it advisable, when calling for tenders on any work, that your specification clearly cover the rates to be paid as it is the intention of our Exchange to use these rates when figuring any work where no specific rates are mentioned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. F. Lord,\nSecretary.\nThe following are the rates as approved by our Exchange for 1934.\n\n| Occupation                  | Rate per hour |\n|----------------------------|---------------|\n| Bricklayers                | $1.00         |\n| Carpenters                 | .70           |\n| Electricians                | .80           |\n| Labourers                  | .35           |\n| Painters                   | .60           |\n| Plasterers                 | 1.00          |\n| Plumbers & Steamfitters    | .90           |\n| Sheet Metal Workers        | .75           |\n| Stone Cutters              | .80           |\n| Tile Setters               | 1.00          |\nJuly 18, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Brown,\n\nPlans and specifications are being prepared for an Indian Residential School at Lebret, Sask., and I would ask you to kindly furnish me with a Schedule of Rates for this work, the Schedule to cover all of the building trades.

The sketches show our 10 inch wall, which can be extended in width to 12\", 14\", 16\", 18\", 20\", or to any other width required.\n\n2. The distinctive feature is the airspace, which is continuous from footing to wallplate and all around the building; thereby the heat insulation is assured against extremes in temperature during a storm. The airspace can be varied in width from 2 to 4 inches.\n\n3. The materials are the most durable, being fireproof & vermin-proof, in artificial stone, concrete, cement or other aggregate.\n\n4. The outer section of wall for fronts, enclosures, etc., can be built in artificial stone, to choice, reinforced with steel ribbed bars therein; great strength is ensured, being stronger than the natural stone.\n\n5. The whole outside and bearing walls can be built in concrete, which can be finished in stucco on the outside in any design or color.\n\n6. This system embodies great strength, at low cost and is adaptable to any style of architecture, in large or small buildings.\n\n7. The method of construction is simple, as a course a foot high is placed on the building and reinforcement set in exactly where it is needed for maximum strength.\n\n8. The expansion grouts are set in the concrete on the inner face of the wall, fireplace, picture mould or any other trim too, and the wall is left in ideal condition to receive the plaster, paint, etc.\n\n9. Non-bearing walls can be built to advantage in any room, saving space and having good acoustics and appearance.\n\n10. All materials used in our mixtures are strictly adhered to and the work is completed during construction, as advocated by hydraulic cement methods, in this way the strength & durability can be insured.\n\n11. Cement concrete cures faster than any other material so quickly in walls built with these materials, as the temperature of the room during construction, which is the aid of ventilation and the speedy removal of the form allows the air to circulate freely from four sides and as it is the oxygen of the air that cures the cement and enables you to build the next course in four hours. Curing of the concrete is important and the walls are watered during the whole course of construction, adding daily to the strength of the work.\n\n12. It is essential to keep a dead air-space, as the velocity of sound through air is 1, water 5, wood 15, iron 16, approximately; sound is not transmitted through a vacuum.\n\n\"Collins' Science Series\"\nProf. William Lees, M.A.\n\nThe principle of the thermos bottle, permanent and economical fire-proof, sound-proof and vermin-proof, combines beauty, economy, strength & tranquility all other methods, therefore\n\nA.

W. Turnbull, M.P., regarding the new Lebret residential school, I am forwarding a memorandum submitted by Mr. Orr, Departmental Architect.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. McGill.\n\nRe Lebret School.\n\nThe Minister is in receipt of a letter calling his attention to the fact that no provision is made in the specifications that labour and material shall be local, as far as possible, although the Department of Public Works is said to be insisting on this in connection with its work in Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Minister's correspondent represents that residents of Regina are being dismissed from their employment on work in Prince Albert Park, under the Department of Indian Affairs, on the grounds that the work in the Park is being conducted under the Public Works Department and must be given to local residents. In this he is apparently in error, as the work in the Park is being undertaken by the Department of the Interior.\n\nIt is represented that the material for the Lebret School is specified to be Canadian, and in one case at least - that of the bath-room lining - specifications call for an article similar to that produced by a Toronto firm.\n\nIt is also said that contractors are being told to tender for face brick at $25.00 per thousand, and that no brick of that kind can be had in Western Canada, except possibly from a bankrupt concern in Alberta, who may be selling its stock at bankrupt prices. Hollow tile is supplied in Saskatchewan by two firms.\nThe Minister's correspondent had entertained the hope that the contractor's would be instructed to use local material and local labour wherever possible, but the specifications are alleged to be wide open. It is further stated that the re-enforcing concrete is specified as \"truss-contraction\", and that had the specifications provided for composite construction re-enforcing as an alternative, other firms would have been afforded an opportunity to share in the work. The writer enquires as to the possibility of having the contractors instructed on all of these points.\n\nWill you kindly let the Minister have a memorandum which will enable him to reply.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nMemorandum\n\nDoctor McGill,\n\nWith reference to the attached memorandum regarding the Lebret School, I beg to say that all the materials for this building are specified to be of Canadian manufacture. If same can be procured in Canada, there are no special materials specified for bathroom lining. I presume that the writer of the letter meant the interior finish of kitchen and scullery, which is specified to be finished in white glazed brick, similar to that manufactured by the Don Valley Brick Company of Toronto. To my knowledge the Don Valley Brick Company are the only firm in Canada manufacturing the enamelled brick suitable for this purpose. There are no bricks of this nature being manufactured in Western Canada.\n\nThe specifications provide that the contractor shall supply face brick at $25.00 per thousand. I have been informed that there are bricks manufactured in the Province of Saskatchewan suitable for this work which will not exceed the above amount.\n\nReferring to the reinforced concrete work I am unable to give an explanation of the term \"truss-contraction\". The form in which the specifications were prepared for the reinforced concrete for this building make it possible for all firms manufacturing reinforcing materials to have an opportunity of submitting prices.\n\nArchitect.\nSeptember 29, 1934.\n\nMemorandum\n\nDoctor McGill,\n\nWith reference to the attached memorandum regarding the Macaret school, I beg to say that all the materials for this building are specified to be of Canadian manufacture, if same can be procured in Canada.

We are hoping that they will interest you and that you will consider putting some of them into the Lebret School, we understand that at present you expect to use Terrazzo and we would point out that in the making of these Floor Tile it is about all Labor, very little of the value of them is taken up by the raw material, so that you would be assured that if you could use some of them that it would help the unemployment situation in this District.\n\nThese Tile should last as long as the Building stands, they are a hard dense body and we have sold them to Packing House Factories where they run Large Iron Wheel Trucks over them with loads up to 1500#, also to all other large and small buildings, they are much cheaper than the Quarry Tile made in the old Country and we would be glad to sell them to you delivered in Lebret for 40\u00a2 per Sq Ft.\n\nTrusting that these will interest you and that we may have the pleasure of shipping some of them for the Lebret Job we beg to remain.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\nMedicine Hat Brick & Tile Co., Ltd.\n\nManager\n\nIndian Affairs.

It will, therefore, be necessary to remodel the present septic tank or construct a new one. I would ask you to instruct Mr. Gow to visit the Lebret School and make a complete survey with report and estimate for a sewage disposal system, and an adequate water supply system.\n\nIt would also be advisable for Mr. Gow to consult with the Deputy Minister of Health for Saskatchewan before he makes his survey and report.\n\nThe department has also under consideration the building of a new hospital at Fort Qu'Appelle. It is the intention to have plans prepared this winter and invite tenders early in the spring. While Mr. Gow is at Lebret it would be advisable for him to look over the site of the proposed hospital and submit his recommendations for a sewage disposal system and water supply system. If he will consult with Doctor Simes, the Department's Medical Officer at Fort Qu'Appelle he will give him the necessary information as to the site.\n\nIf Mr. Gow will apply to Mr. A. G.

Formwork has been erected for all outside basement walls except surrounding the boiler room and a small portion of the walls of kitchen and laundry section. Column steel was set in position for all columns in outside walls of main building. The job was closed down on Friday the 23rd. inst; all unfilled forms being braced and covered up to prevent snow drifting into them, and everything left in good shape for a fast start when spring opens up.\n\nIt is the intention of the contractors to do as much work as possible during the winter, on beam and column formwork, here in Regina, to be shipped ready for erection, in order to speed up the preparation for concrete work in the spring.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nH.

This steel is not expensive and should only add to the cost approximately $160.00 and is well worth the money expended.\nWe would, however, like to have an early decision so as not to delay the building.\n\nYours very truly\n(s'g'd) SMITH BROS & WILSON, LTD.\nper Geo. Johns\nGeneral Superintendent.\"\n\nI am in full accord with this suggestion, and in view of the need for speedy action, have authorised this expenditure, trusting that under the circumstances, it will meet with your approval. The steel can thus come forward with the contract order which is expected to be shipped in about ten days.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nH. Dawson,\nSupervising Architect.\nLebret, Sask.\nNovember 8th, 1934\n\nMessrs Smith Bros & Wilson, Limited.\nContractors,\nDonchue Block,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nRe Indian Residential School, Lebret.\n\nIn setting out the lines for the column bases it is found that column 66 comes on the slab over an old septic tank, the top of the slab being practically at basement floor level.\n\nIt is not practicable to place the foundation in the bottom of the tank, which is quite deep, and has been filled up with building refuse and excavated material.\n\nThe best solution appears to be to omit column 66, enlarge cols. 67 and 69, and re-design beam B-73 for 24 feet span between cols. 67 and 69.\n\nThis has been discussed with Mr. R. Gurney Orr, the architect, on the spot, and it will be appreciated if you will take up this matter promptly with the Trus-Con Company, so that the proper steel can be provided for the footings, columns and beam.\n\nEnclosed please find rough sketch of the relative positions of cols. 67-68 and 69 and the septic tank.\n\nYours very truly\n\nH. Dawson,\nSupervising Architect.\n\nCopy to R. Gurney Orr Esq.\nLebret, Sask.\nNovember 12th, 1934.\n\nR. Gurney Orr Esq.\nArchitect.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nQu'Appelle Indian Residential School, Lebret.\n\nIn accordance with your instructions, I beg to submit my first fortnightly report on the progress of construction on the above-named building.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the contractors began demolition of such of the old walls as were found to interfere with their plant-lay-out, clearing away rubbish, and starting excavation for new footings trenches and basement.\n\nForms were made and placed, and concrete work commenced about 2-30 p.m. on Wednesday Nov. 7th. This work continued each day to Saturday Nov. 10th. The weather was clear and mild in the daytime with some frost at nights. All fresh concrete was covered up with cement sacks and canvas at the close of each day's run, and is kept covered until necessary to remove the coverings for the erection of wall forms. When work ceased at 2-30 p.m. Saturday last, there had been approximately 118 cubic yards of concrete poured, all interior column bases except three, and all wall footings except the boiler room and south end included between columns 17 and 62, being then in place.\n\nWith further reference to the foundation for column 68, discussed when you were here on the 8th inst; I enclose copy of letter sent to Messrs Smith Bros & Wilson on that day. On further investigation, however, it appears that if this column were omitted and a 24'0\" span beam substituted, it would have to be 4'0\" deep, which would interfere with door heights in the basement. For this reason, it has been decided to cut out a strip of the slab over the old septic tank and put in a concrete subfoundation re-inforced with five lengths of 6\" steel I-beams, spanning over the walls of the tank. The concrete forming the tank appears to be very sound and hard, judging by the work being done on it by the air compressor. The steel I-beams are on the job for this work.\n\nFather Leonard was consulted today, and he is agreeable to having the ash hoist installed in the n.w.corner of the boiler room, using the platform tree with a pit 1'-9\" deep, the window in the west side of the boiler room being converted into a door for the removal of ashes. The wall footings adjoining the pit on two sides are being placed 1'-9\" lower to form the sides of the pit.\n\nForm construction for the walls is proceeding, and if weather stays good an attempt will be made to pour the curtain walls before freeze-up.\n\nYours very truly\n\nH. Dawson,\nSupervising Architect\nAutomatic Shutters for Ventura Fans\n\nAutomatic Shutters are used in connection with disc type fans as a protection to fan when not running, and to keep out wind, rain, snow and cold.\n\nShutters are constructed of rolled aluminum leaves attached to steel rods supported in a steel frame.\n\nEach leaf of the shutter is edged with a felt strip tightly folded into the metal which prevents the shutter from \"rattling\" when fan is not in use.\n\nThe force of the air when fan is running holds the shutter open. When fan is shut off, shutter closes automatically by gravity. It is advisable to use an automatic shutter whenever the fan is installed in an outside wall. They automatically close the opening outside the fan at night or at any other time, when the fan is not in use.\n\nDIMENSIONS AUTOMATIC SHUTTERS\n\n| Fan No. | List Prices | Ship's Weight Lbs. | Dimensions in Inches |\n|---------|-------------|--------------------|----------------------|\n|         |             |                    | A   | B   | C   | D   | E   |\n| 2       | $12         | 12                 | 17  | 14  | 17  | 3\u00bd  |\n| 3       | 15          | 20                 | 17  | 20  | 3\u00bd  |\n| 3\u00bd      | 20          | 30                 | 23  | 20  | 23  | 3\u00bd  |\n| 4       | 24          | 45                 | 26  | 23  | 26  | 3\u00bd  |\n| 5       | 28          | 60                 | 31  | 26  | 31  | 3\u00bd  |\n| 6       | 36          | 90                 | 37  | 34  | 37  | 3\u00bd  |\n| 7       | 42          | 100                | 42  | 39  | 42  | 3\u00bd  |\n| 8       | 48          | 120                | 47  | 44  | 47  | 3\u00bd  |\n| 9       | 54          | 140                | 53  | 50  | 50  | 3\u00bd  |\n\nCatalog No.: SA 7284, SA 7285, SA 7286, SA 7287, SA 7288, SA 7289, SA 7290, SA 7291, SA 7292\n\nMagnetic Starters\n\nAlternating Current for Sirocco Utility Blowers and Ventura Disc Ventilating Fans\n\nThese starters are recommended for use with Sirocco Utility Blowers and Ventura Disc Ventilating Fans when used on alternating current, single and polyphase, any frequency.

Sizes 3, 3\u00bd and 4 are made with a square adapter plate of steel. Size Number 2 is built on a cast iron ring.\n\nWHEEL\u2014The blades ten in number are unusually broad, with the peculiar Ventura dip. The propulsive force is much greater with the multi-blade wheel construction, and the wide disc at center prevents any back flow at that point. The wheel is light in weight, ruggedly constructed and perfectly balanced.\n\nMOTORS\u2014On direct connected machines operate practically noiselessly and are totally enclosed to prevent dust getting into the working parts. These motors are made by the best known manufacturers, who are specialists in their line, with a world-wide reputation as producers of electrical apparatus.\n\nTESTING\u2014Each fan is given a careful running test with a rigid inspection following, before shipment. You are thus protected and assured of a thoroughly satisfactory outfit when installed.\n\nAPPLICATION\n\n\"Ventura\" Fans are being successfully used for exhausting fumes from metal pickling vats, or other fume or dust producing processes for ventilating basements, toilets, kitchens, offices, shops, etc.\n\nWhere rooms are very large, four to six, and sometimes more, \"Venturas\" are employed to assure proper circulation of air.\n\n\"Ventura\" Fans can be installed in any convenient location, and require very little space.\n\nInstallation Dimensions for Ventura Disc Ventilating Fans\n\n| Fan No. | A   | B   | C   | D   | E   | F   |\n|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| 3       | 12\u00bd | 12\u00bd | 8\u00bd  | 7   | 0   | 23  |\n| 3\u00bd      | 10\u00bd | 10\u00bd | 6\u00bd  | 5   | 0   | 26  |\n| 4       | 10\u00bd | 10\u00bd | 6\u00bd  | 5   | 0   | 26  |\n| 5       | 34\u00bd | 21\u00bd | 28\u00bd | 16\u00bd | 8\u00bd  |     |\n| 6       | 40\u00bd | 21\u00bd | 31\u00bd | 16\u00bd | 8\u00bd  |     |\n| 7       | 45\u00bd | 23\u00bd | 39  | 21\u00bd | 8\u00bd  |     |\n| 8       | 51  | 28\u00bd | 44\u00bd | 24\u00bd | 8\u00bd  |     |\n| 9       | 56\u00bd | 29\u00bd | 50  | 27\u00bd | 8\u00bd  |     |\n\n*The size 2 Ventura Fan is built on a cast iron ring with four bolt holes on 15\u00bd\" circle for fastening to wall.

The price quoted on the no. 1 brick is a special price as these bricks have been sold in the West previously at a much higher figure.\n\nThe above prices, as you will note, are f.o.b. the cars Lebret and to this will have to be added an amount of $2.00 per M. to cover the cost of unloading, hauling and piling at the site of the building.\n\nI might also say that there will be required approximately 250,000 face bricks for this building.\n\nAn examination of the bricks will show that the Redcliff No 2 is a superior brick to that of the Estevan, and I would recommend that the contractors be authorized to use the No. 2 brick on the Qu'Appelle School.

F.O.B. cars Lebret for Estevan selected Buff Brick.\n\nWe regret to state that it will be impossible for us to reduce this price further. As a matter of fact we were rather hesitant to quote the price we did on the job as they will have to be very well selected, and well packed in hay in the cars all of which costs us money. It is true we have sold selected buff in Regina at a slightly lower price, but in that case it was not necessary to select as closely as will be required on this job; and then too, freight to Lebret is somewhat higher than the Regina rate.\n\nWe estimate the unloading charge at $2.00 per thousand and are therefore allowing this reduction for delivery on the cars instead of on the job.\n\nTrusting this will prove satisfactory, we remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE DOMINION LIME & COAL CO., LTD.\n\n[Signature]\n\nManager.\n\nJAN:VM.\nSmith Bros. & Wilson, Limited\nGENERAL CONTRACTORS\n\n104-S DONAHUE BLDG.\nRegina, Sask., November 7th, 1934.\n\nC.

Gurney Orr Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nre Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, Lebret.\n\nYou will have received from Messrs Smith Bros & Wilson a copy of their letter to me dated Dec. 12th, submitting quotations on various changes numbered 1 to 8, and I wish to say, in further explanation, that these were suggested when I interviewed the Sister Superior and Rev. G. Leonard, regarding the glazing of interior doors opening on to the corridors.\n\nChange #1 is illustrated on the larger of the enclosed blue prints, and is required in order that the Engineer may have access to his room without having to pass through the Senior Boys' Dining Room.\n\nChange #2 is also shown on the same blue print, and appears to be necessary, as the senior boys will be under control of male supervisors, and the junior boys under the care of the Sisters, and to provide more complete separation. The outside entrance, Father Leonard points out, is an advantage in the event of visiting sports teams requiring wash-room accommodation, without having to enter other parts of the building.\n\nChange #3. The Sisters wish to convert the closing room next to the Girls' Dormitory on 1st floor into a Sisters' Bedroom, and use one of the other bedrooms as a clothing room. They wish to have an observation window in the partition between this room and the Dormitory.\n\nChange #4. The Sisters are of opinion that two toilets are necessary, where only one is shown in the Boys' Dormitory near the centre of the building.\n\nChange #5. They would also prefer an additional toilet on the Girls' side in place of the Slop sink now shown. This involves a change of the lay-out to obtain more convenient access to the two toilets, and this, with change #4, is shown on the small blue print enclosed.\n\nI understand that the interior bathroom will be used by the staff, and not by the pupils. It therefore seems unnecessary to have a partition between the bath and toilet, so I have shown a re-arrangement to arrive at a simpler piping lay-out. In this connection, there is a slight difference in the concrete framing lay-out and the original plan, in the locations of columns 27 and 33, making it necessary to change the positions of the door into the staff bath room, and that into the closet adjoining the staff bedroom. As shown on the original plan, the bathroom door appears to collide with col. 33.\n\nChange #6. A sink is asked for in the Girls' Dining Room as in the Sisters' Dining Room, to save much carrying to and fro of dishes which could then mostly be washed where in frequent use. This would be placed where it could be most conveniently attached to the existing arrangements.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6329, file 660-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nChange #7. A borrowed light is asked for in the partition separating the visitors' bathroom and the store room adjoining the Girls' Classroom.\n\nChange #8. This is to provide for a Type Z-C Herbert Morris Platform Ash Hoist in the N.W. corner of the Boiler Room, as discussed with you when you visited the site, and subsequently between Father Leonard and myself. The footings of outside walls near this location have been carried down the proper depth to form two sides of the pit.\n\nIn addition to these items, some extra signal gongs have been asked for, about which Father Leonard has written me today. As soon as I get a price on these I will forward it for your consideration.\n\nOther minor changes involving locations of some interior doors have been requested and agreed upon, as they do not incur additional cost.\n\nFather Leonard made allusion to the fact that no chapel furnishings were included in the specification. I presume that this item will be dealt with along with the general furnishings.\n\nI take this opportunity of acknowledging with thanks, your letter of the 3rd inst; notifying me that voucher was being prepared for a payment of my fees based on the amount of the first certificate. The cheque was received on the 11th inst.\n\nReferring to the item of $704.22 appearing as extra on the certificate, I might explain that when in the service of the Saskatchewan Government, it was my custom to show all authorised extras in the progress certificates, and then in the final certificate show the contingency allowance and prime cost sums as deductions.\n\nI will, in future, follow your wish and not show the extras as such unless they begin to exceed the contingency allowance.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nH.

(RG 10, Volume 6329, file 660-5, part 4)\nAmerican Coal Ousted at Saving of 40%\n\nCanadian-Made Stoker in Winnipeg apartment affords marked saving and even temperature burning Western Coal\n\n\"If you go into an apartment block and you see a man with a worried look on his face, you can bet your life he's the caretaker.\"\n\nSuch is the situation in which one Winnipeg caretaker summed up the difficulties peculiar to apartment block heating. With more than 27 years experience behind him, he knows how essential it is to maintain an even and adequate temperature.\n\nAs soon as the temperature in an apartment block is allowed to vary, the tenants complain. Some find it too cold, although they may be the ones who leave their windows open and allow storm sash to freeze so that they cannot be closed. Others find it too hot, and they complain that the caretaker fails to blame their illnesses on the blocks in which they live.\n\nIn the case of older blocks, it is extremely unnecessary to provide any form of heating control because tenants often welcome an excuse to move into another block where they expect heating will meet their wishes. The apartment block owner, however, finds that the complaints of other tenants have satisfied customers in order to operate on a profitable basis.\n\nTenants Well Satisfied\n\nAt the Touraine Apartments in Winnipeg where Mr. E. Sewall is in charge, the difficulty has been overcome by the installation of automatically controlled stokers. Not only is an even temperature maintained to the satisfaction of all tenants but it is being done at a saving in fuel cost alone of 30 per cent. Instead of burning 1,600 pounds of coal daily before Western Canada coal is burned entirely. In addition, Mr. Sewall is now able to spend the greater part of his time doing work in which he is interested, such as painting, cleaning, and regulating the boiler.\n\nThe Touraine is one of Winnipeg's larger downtown blocks, owned by the Great West Construction Company and located at the corner of Kennedy and Ellice. Built a number of years ago, it contains 36 two and three room suites distributed over five floors.\n\nThe Boiler Plant\n\nThe heating plant consists of one H.L.T. type boiler made by the Robb Engine Company, Amherst, N.S. It measures 48 inches by 14 feet, has 52 three inch tubes and is rated at 50 hp.\n\nAt the end of September, 1931, a Canadian Fire-King underfeed stoker, made by the Manitoba Bridge & Iron Works Limited, was installed. It is Model No. 50, having the following four features: minimum per hour consumption, 83 lbs.; maximum, 167 lbs.; and maximum, 250 lbs. It has a steam radiation capacity of 6,200 square feet and a hopper capacity of 650 lbs. Its fan capacity is 750 c.f.m., and it is equipped with static pressure control.\n\nA 15 inch concrete pit was constructed in which the stoker was placed. This pit has concrete curbing to prevent drainage of water into it and was made sufficiently large to permit cleaning the fire box easily. The pit was necessary to obtain sufficient air in the combustion chamber.\n\nPressure control automatically starts and stops the stoker, entering at one pound pressure and shutting out at two and a half pounds pressure. In addition, a special automatic time switch has been installed by Mr. Sewall himself.\n\nTime Switch in Addition to Pressure Control\n\nThe time switch which was installed at a cost of less than $10 has proven extremely valuable in this type of operation. As is customary in apartment blocks, the temperature is allowed to drop after 11 p.m. If Mr. Sewall wishes to go out for the evening, he sets the time clock to cut out at that hour or any other hour desired, and he need not concern himself about the boiler.\n\nIf, however, the temperature should drop in his absence, and the tenants require heat, the boiler will start and maintain the independent operation of the pressure control, so that the suites are kept warm.\n\nHeat is turned off at five o'clock in the morning but even then it is not necessary for Mr. Sewall to get up. Before retiring, or any time during the day, he has merely to set the time clock for five o'clock and at that hour the next morning the stoker goes to work. When Mr. Sewall rises a few hours later he finds steam up and the entire building comfortable and heated.\n\nDuring the cold winter months, clinkers are cleaned out once in 24 hours and then only 2 pailfuls are taken out.\n\nFuel Savings\n\nSome idea of the savings the stoker has effected may be gained from the following annual fuel costs:\n\n| Year | Cost |\n|------|------|\n| 1929-30 | $2,650.55 |\n| 1930-31 | $1,912.70 |\n| 1931-32 | $1,341.77 |\n\nThe saving over the previous years operation was the substantial figure of $857.05.\n\nMr. Sewall cannot speak too highly of his stoker equipped boiler. He spends little or no time tending the boiler and is able to devote his time to general work throughout the building. Previous to the installation of the stoker a night man was needed to fire the boiler. His services are no longer required and Mr. Sewall has realized a further important saving, bringing the total saving up to 40 per cent.\n\nThe stoker operates quietly and notwithstanding the fact that there are only seven rooms and above are occupied suites, yet on no occasion has there been a complaint against the hum of the motor.\n\nDuring the winter, several Western coals were fired and Mr. Sewall says that operation has been entirely satisfactory with Sanderson Creek mine run, rumney nut peat slack, Red River Creek, Black Rock and Drumheller coals. In previous years American coal had been used exclusively.\n\nSuch is what has been accomplished in the Touraine Apartment Building. The benefits have been extended to the entire satisfaction of all tenants with coal from Western Canada rather than the United States and at least 40 per cent below that of previous years. Mr. Sewall has no worries in his boiler room; his work is handled and reduced and his time is now devoted to work and maintenance in other parts of the block.\nSpencer Magazine Type Heater Successfully Stoked\n\nOwners estimate saving over hand firing as approximately 40% burning Western Canada coal\u2014Tenants completely satisfied with steady even heat\n\nWHETHER it is a business block, a school, an apartment or a hospital, almost every building presents its own particular problems. Boilers are very often called on to deliver more steam than they have been designed to supply. Fuel costs change as new sources of supply are developed. The most experienced engineers find that their equipment is not producing steam as economically as the most modern plants in the country.\n\nOne of the major problems which has faced the Western Canada coal industry for years is the fact that many of the business blocks, hotels and apartments in the West were constructed with boilers built in the East where American practice was principally used. With their small grate areas and low settings, these boilers were not suited for the efficient burning of Western coal.\n\nIn recent years, many of these plants have been improved. Settings have been raised, grates have been changed, stokers have been installed, or forced draft systems have been added.\n\nSpencer Magazine Type Heater Equipped With Stoker\n\nChanges of this nature have greatly reduced heating costs at the Westmoreland Apartments, Winnipeg. In December, 1932, a Canadian Fire-King Automatic Pressure Control Stoker by the Manitoba Bridge & Iron Works Limited was installed. The boiler is a Spencer Magazine Type Heater, No. 10-4, rated by the manufacturer at 100 h.p., with standard radiators.\n\nThis type boiler is equipped with water tubes in each side of the fire-box down to the level of the grate. The grate slope upward toward the rear at an angle of approximately 45 degrees where they are supported by an internal water-leg, which brings the boiler return back to the front header of the boiler.\n\nHistorically, it has been considered impracticable to stoke this type boiler, because of the high temperature flames impinging on the water tubes and water-leg. The Manitoba Bridge & Iron Works Limited is satisfied that it has demonstrated the fallacy of this belief by the installation of the Canadian Fire-King Stoker, and the very successful performance and reduction in heating bills, it has given.\n\nThe Westmoreland Apartments, located on the corner of Main Street and Provencher Avenue are situated in one of the finer residential districts of Winnipeg; it is a combination of buildings consisting of three and four room suites and is up-to-date in every detail. The type of building and the type of tenants it attracts, the owners consider it of prime importance to furnish comfortable and steady heat.\n\nStoker Operated by Automatic Pressure Control\n\nInstallation of the stoker was made in November, 1932. It is the Canadian Fire-King Model 20 having the following specifications based on 100 h.p. (100,000 lb. burning coil):\n\nCool feed per hour:\nMin. 60 lbs.\nInter. 117 lbs.\nMax. 184 lbs.\n\nCapacity Steam Radiation:\n4,300 sq. ft.\n\nBoiler h.p. Developed:\n55\n\nBoiler h.p. Required:\n400 lbs.\n\nApproximate Shipping Weight:\n1,800 lbs.\n\nAir Capacity of Fan:\n600 cu. ft. per minute at 2 in. static pressure.\n\nA 15\u00bd in. complete pit was constructed in which the stoker was set. The pit was necessary to obtain sufficient height in the combustion chamber for unobstructed stoker operation with forced draft and it was made sufficiently large to permit cleaning the firebox.\n\nA pressure control automatically starts and stops the stoker cutting in at a half pound and cutting out at one and a half pounds per square inch pressure. It has been found with the stoker that the differential of one pound per square inch gives...\nCanadian-Made Stoker Cuts Fuel Costs\n\nMedical Arts Building in Winnipeg finds coal is most economical and satisfactory fuel\n\nSubstantial savings in fuel costs have been made at the Medical Arts Building in Winnipeg as a result of its two boilers being equipped with underfeed stokers. Canadian coal is being burned instead of American coal as before, the boilers are being operated at higher efficiencies and the entire installation has met with the satisfaction of the management.\n\nThe Medical Arts Building presents certain heating problems peculiar to itself. Its entire space is occupied by physicians and their families, approximately 180, therefore, essential that adequate and uniform temperatures are maintained irrespective of weather conditions.\n\nThe building was erected in 1923 and was originally four stories and basement. Three floors had three more stories were added although no alterations were made to the boiler plant. This brought actual radiation up to 8,500 square feet. With the opening of the additional stories, walls were extended and heat efficiency improved although high-grade American coal was fired. Furthermore, the building is not fitted with storm windows which, on cold and windy days, creates a heavy demand for steam.\n\nHot Water Makes Heavy Demands\n\nMaintaining an adequate supply of hot water also makes heavy demands on the boilers. One hundred and thirty doctors, who occupy the building, sometimes use as much as 500 gallons in an hour. There are two hot water tanks each of 1,000-gallon capacity and are heated from an average temperature of 40 degrees to 160 degrees.\n\nBy itself at the rear of the building is a warehouse measuring 26x34 feet. It is constructed of tile and stucco and although a considerable heating, it has been unusually high ceiling. This building is also heated by the Medical Arts plant and requires a considerable volume of steam especially when the doors are open or in the winter when stock is being loaded or unloaded. However, since the stokers were installed last September all problems have been overcome and the boilers that were somewhat inadequate prior to the installation have been able to meet any demands placed upon them.\n\nThe boilers used are the Vulcan type, rectangular type made by the Vulcan Iron Works Limited. They are 48 inches in diameter, 14 feet long, have 52 three-inch diameter tubes and are each rated at 40 h.p. They are on a twin brick setting and each have a radiation of 3,200 square feet.\n\nCanadian Fire-King Stokers\n\nThe two automatic underfeed stokers are No. 50 Canadian Fire-Kings made in Winnipeg by the Manitoba Bridge & Iron Works Limited. Each has a steam radiation capacity of 6,250 square feet and are capable of feeding per hour as follows: First, feet 85 lbs. of coal; second, feet, 170 lbs.; and third, feed, 250 lbs.\n\nEach stoker has a fan capacity of 750 cubic feet per minute at two-inch static pressure.\n\nSpecial control provides for a combination pressure control and low water shut-off. The pressure control automatically starts and stops these stokers at boiler pressure while the low water shut-off cuts off the stoker if water in the boilers happens to fall below the minimum level as required by Government regulations.\n\nIn order to obtain sufficient height and combustion space, the stokers were installed in a 15-inch pit.\n\nOnly Western Canada Coal Used\n\nSince the installation of the stokers nothing other than Western Canada coal has been burned although under the old hand-drum system only high-grade imported American coal could be used to obtain satisfactory results. A great deal of\nexperimenting has been done since the stokers were put in to determine what Western coals would yield the best results taking into consideration special factors surrounding the plant. Several Western coals have been used with satisfactory results at prevailing prices. An approximate analysis of a nut pea slack that has shown very good results is as follows:\n\n| Fixed Carbon | 28.65 |\n|--------------|------|\n| Volatile     | 33.90 |\n| Moisture     | 4.50  |\n| Ash          | 5.21  |\n| B.T.U. Content | 12,026 |\n\n**Substantial Saving**\n\nDespite all the experimentation with coal ranging in cost up to $9.50 per ton, an actual saving of $546 has been made for the period from October 1 to February 29, as compared with last year. Figures of course, cover only entire periods during which the stokers were in operation and are the latest available figures. Figures submitted by Mr. J. L. Hewitt, manager of the Medical Arts Building, to the board of directors show that the saving over the five-months' period a year ago had been $2,512. Corresponding figures submitted to the board of directors showed that fuel costs during the last five months when the two stokers were in operation had been $1,966. It is expected that the plant will show even more substantial savings now that experimental work has been completed.\n\nThis heat, even on coldest days, heat has been maintained at the same uniform temperature under all conditions. This, as already explained, is absolutely essential in a building where patients are being examined who, in many cases are required to entirely disrobe.\n\nThe stokers running on first feed have proven fully capable of heating the building in normal winter weather, the length of time they were run out varying. In fact, however, it was found necessary during the month of February, they were operated on second feed. At no time have they been operated in high speed.\n\nAn adequate supply of water at 160 degrees F. has been maintained since the stokers were installed although it was always difficult to do so under the old hand-firing system.\n\nWhen warehouse doors were left open for the time the plant was shut down, it became necessary for a fireman to stand over the boilers in order to keep the building's temperature from dropping. Now, the stokers are put in second feed while loading and unloading materials in the warehouses and in this way temperature is maintained without extra effort. The engineer and firemen now spend only a small part of their time in the boiler room and are able to spend considerable time attending to other matters in the building and in taking care of offices.\n\nThe two boilers have been operated at 150 per cent of their rating and have yielded an efficiency of 70 per cent.\n\nFrank S. Coffey, engineer in charge of the Medical Arts Building, is more than satisfied with the operation of the two stokers. Not only have they made possible the economies in the heating plant but a notable decrease in heating costs but they have also made possible the displacement of a considerable tonnage of American coal by coal from Western Canada's mines.\n\n---\n\nReprinted from March Issue, 1932, \"Western Canada Coal Review\"\nHere's What the CANADIAN FIRE-KING Will Do for You\u2014\n\n1.

CUT LABOR COSTS\nFar less labor is required to operate a Canadian FIRE-KING equipped boiler. Your fireman can do other work\u2014his labor cost can be applied on another job.\n\n6. PAY FOR ITSELF AS IT WORKS FOR YOU\nThe moderate cost of a CANADIAN FIRE-KING is soon returned in fuel and labor savings. Add to this the savings that result from more efficient, more accurate operation, and reduced maintenance cost. A CANADIAN FIRE-KING is an investment that pays large dividends.\n\nAuthorized Distributor\n\nTHE MANITOBA BRIDGE AND IRON WORKS LIMITED\nWINNIPEG, CANADA\nHAND FIRING IS WASTEFUL, INEFFICIENT, COSTLY\n\nThe illustration also shows how green coal thrown on the fire tends to smother it. Combustible gases given off as the green coal becomes heated, pass up the stack unburned\u2014as smoke. Furthermore, more air is needed; fuel coal falls through the grate and is carried out with the ash. Opening of fire doors to shovel in coal cools the fire and wastes fuel.\n\nNo business can afford the extravagance of hand-firing\u2014for it wastes one-sixth to one-half of your coal.\n\nCANADIAN FIRE-KING AUTOMATIC FIRING IS ECONOMICAL, EFFICIENT\n\nThe CANADIAN FIRE-KING feeds the fuel from underneath the fire in the method approved by leading combustion engineers. The coal is slowly cooked as it comes in contact with the hot surfaces of the case, and with just the right amount of air, are completely burned.\n\nThe illustration shows how coal is delivered from the hopper to the bottom end of a spiral fuel worm which pushes the coal steadily upward toward the fire-bed. The same electric motor which drives the worm operates a fan at the top of the boiler. As long as fuel is fed into the proper amount to completely burn the coal, the stoker operating only when necessary to maintain the pressure or temperature desired.\n\n1 Heavy sectional tuyere blocks and dead plates\u2014air cooled.

(FG 10, Volume 6329, file 660-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDESIGNED AND BUILT BY EXPERIENCE\n\nIn designing a stoker the problem of the mechanical engineer is to meet the conditions imposed by the combustion engineer. This requires the development of a device which will deliver fuel to the fire just as it is needed with mild, intermittent impulsion essential to maintain level bed and assure maximum combustion efficiency. The CANADIAN FIRE-KING drive unit answers this problem in all its phases. It is a mechanically perfect unit which satisfies the demands of the combustion engineer to achieve a definite condition in the fire box.\n\nNo other drive unit of the variable speed type for stokers offers the features of simplicity and accessibility found in the 1952 model CANADIAN FIRE-KING Gear Case. The Ratchet Type Gear Case as used by us is rugged in construction, correct mechanically, speed adjustment can be made at will while the machine is running without kohlering to shift leashes, and the job is quiet and durable.\n\nOnly in the CANADIAN FIRE-KING stoker is the intermeshed action of the drive mechanism so smooth that the fuel is delivered into the fire-box without disturbing the fire, but in such a manner that the regulator cettle and level the fuel box automatically, provide the possibility of thick spots or thin spots, and thus cut spots for air to blow through. The scientific action of the CANADIAN FIRE-KING drive unit thus achieves an ideal fire-box condition. In so doing, it is years ahead in mechanical perfection and is truly a triumph of CANADIAN FIRE-KING engineering.\n\nThe CANADIAN FIRE-KING Gear Case\n\nThe illustration of the rear of the case shows the compact, sturdy construction and easy accessibility of the speed reducing unit. The worm wheel is a solid one-piece casting of high tensile steel, precision ground and finished to assure quiet operation and long life. All moving parts are carried by heavy Tappkin roller bearings and operate in a bath of lubricating oil.\n\nThe CANADIAN FIRE-KING gear case is equipped throughout with high pressure type floatable oil seals. The gear mechanism is protected against foreign matter by a heavy cast iron cover. The chain drive is enclosed in a heavy cast iron casing, making the part easy to remove and replace\u2014an exclusive CANADIAN FIRE-KING feature. The CANADIAN FIRE-KING drive unit is the only drive mechanism to incorporate the exclusive CANADIAN FIRE-KING feature.\n\nHome of the CANADIAN FIRE-KING Automatic Stoker\n\nThe Manitoba Bridge and Iron Works Limited, Winnipeg, Canada\n\nMANUFACTURERS\nDecember 15th, 1934.\n\nChief Engineer,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have been informed that in specifications for mechanical stokers for Federal Buildings in the West, our stoker is practically excluded in favor of competitive stokers not manufactured in western Canada. We are at a loss to understand this as we believe our stoker is the only stoker manufactured in the West.\n\nBeing a western product, we think our stoker should be given at least an equal chance with other stokers and more especially as it fits right in with the intention of the Federal Works Programme in stimulating employment and providing work for western labor.\n\nWith stokers, as with automobiles and other products, it often happens that individuals have a personal preference for a certain type, or make, which is not based on practical experience in the handling of the product. Our Canadian Fire King stoker has, by years of service and actual results, fully demonstrated its worth and we have as high a percentage of satisfied customers as any other stoker.\n\nWe enclose herewith descriptive folder showing the sizes and capacities of the Improved Canadian Fire King Automatic Stoker. Our improved stoker is the impulse non-packing worm underfeed type, equipped with overhead, totally enclosed silent motor drive to a totally enclosed semi-lubricating gear reduction unit. The tuyeres are of special quality cast iron and made in sections to facilitate removal and minimize replacement costs. Economical operation is obtained by three feeding speeds - to suit any condition of load or weather - and a neutral for supplying air only to the fire bed, with automatic air regulator. A soft steel safety shearing pin protects the stoker from injury by foreign substances in the coal and each stoker is equipped with ample sized hopper capacity.\nTHE MANITOBA BRIDGE & IRON WORKS LIMITED\n\nWe have eighty installations of the Canadian Fire King stoker installed in Winnipeg and throughout Western Canada under practically every type of boiler, and in factories, apartment blocks, office buildings, schools, laundries, churches, institutions, theatres, etc., ranging all the way in size from large residences to plants of 175 H.P. Among these some extraordinary results have been realized in fuel savings in addition to the other advantages of \"even\" heat, partial release of fireman's time and smoke elimination in conformity with city ordinances.\n\nWe will be glad to supply you with further particulars if required on request and would appreciate a reply from you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE MANITOBA BRIDGE & IRON WORKS LIMITED.\n\nH.B.B.\nDecember 17, 1934\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nI have your letter of the 15th with reference to the installation of mechanical stokers for the buildings under construction in Western Canada.\n\nThis department has only one building under construction at the present time, that is the Qu'Appelle Indian School at Lebret, Sask.\n\nThe contract for this building was awarded some time ago to Smith Bros. and Wilson Ltd., of Regina.\n\nMechanical stokers are specified for this building and I would suggest that you get in communication with the contractors.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nThe Manitoba Bridge and Iron Works,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMemorandum\n\nDoctor McGill,\n\nThe specifications for the Indian Residential School at Lebret provide that the contractor shall allow in his tender an amount of $25.00 per M. for the face brick required for this building, the brick to be used to be approved by the department.\n\nWhen in Regina recently in connection with the inspection of the Qu'Appelle School I made inquiries as to bricks that were available for this job, within the price allowed.\n\nThere are two firms who are prepared to supply brick within the amount mentioned. They are the International Clay Products Ltd. of Estevan, Sask., and the Redcliff Pressed Brick Co. of Redcliff, Alta.\n\nThe International Clay Products Ltd. are prepared to supply what they call Estevan Select Buff Brick, f.o.b. the cars Lebret at $23.00 per M. This brick is a wire cut brick of a light buff colour.\n\nThe Redcliff Pressed Brick Co. have offered to supply their No. 2 I.A.L. red faced brick at $21.00 per M. f.o.b. cars Lebret. This brick is a hard burned dark red, pressed brick. I may also say that they have quoted their No. 1- I.A.L. at a price of $25.00 per M. f.o.b. cars Lebret, and their No. 3 at $17.50 per M. The price quoted on the no. 1 brick is a special price as these bricks have been sold in the west previously at a much higher figure.\n\nThe above prices, as you will note, are f.o.b. the cars Lebret and to this will have to be added an amount of $2.00 per M. to cover the cost of unloading, hauling and piling at the site of the building.\n\nI might also say that there will be required approximately 250,000 face bricks for this building.\n\nAn examination of the bricks will show that the Redcliff No 2 is a superior brick to that of the Estevan, and I would recommend that the contractors be authorized to use the No. 2 brick on the Qu'Appelle School. Samples of these bricks are in my office, and I will be glad to show them to you.\n\nI am attaching hereto correspondence with reference to the bricks.\n\n[Signature]\n\nArchitect.\nDecember 5th, 1934.\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General -\n\nEnclosed herewith is a report from Mr. Orr on the specifications for the Indian Residential School at Lebret: I am also sending you the two brick referred to for your inspection.\n\nI concur in Mr. Orr's recommendation and in my opinion an examination of the brick submitted demonstrates convincingly the relative merits of the two samples.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDecember 18, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Dawson,\n\nWith reference to the face brick for the new Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, I beg to advise you that the Honourable the Superintendent General has approved of the use of Redcliff No 2, I.XL pressed face brick.\n\nThe Redcliff Pressed Brick Co. have quoted a price for this brick of $21.00 per M. f. o. b. cars Lebret.\n\nWill you kindly advise Smith Bros. and Wilson of the above decision.\n\nYou will note that the specifications provide that the walls of the stair wells are to be finished in a buff pressed brick, and the contractors should advise what brick they propose using before the same is ordered.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nHarold Dawson, Esq.,\n137A Athol St.,\nRegina, Sask.\nDecember 18, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nWith reference to the face brick for the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, I have today received the approval of the Honourable the Superintendent General for the use of No. 2 L. XL Redcliff Pressed brick, and I have written Mr. Dawson to this effect.\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, a copy of letter addressed to Mr. Dawson.\n\nWishing you a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

This old truism is exemplified by the large number of water softener owners who are turning to the permanent and profitable use of Refinite Zeolite Mineral.\n\nLimited space permits room to list but a few of the many names of those who have adopted Refinite as the best Water Softening mineral obtainable. They have tried the other minerals and have satisfied themselves that Refinite is far superior.\n\nNaturally manufacturers of all kinds of Water Softening mineral make claim to having the best \u2014 but the proof of quality is in the test of time.\n\nNo other Water Softening Mineral has ever duplicated the results obtained by Refinite for quality of softened water, long life of mineral and low cost of operation.\n\nBack of Refinite Zeolite Mineral stand fourteen years of Water Softener experience. In fact, Refinite made Water Softeners possible and profitable for laundries and many other industries.\n\nIf the names listed in this pamphlet are not sufficient evidence of superiority of Refinite Zeolite, we will be glad of an opportunity to prove our claims in your own Plant. In many cases we have saved, in one year's operation, the cost of refilling plants.\n\nRefinite Zeolite mineral delivers more than double the volume of soft water and is free from discoloration or iron rust \u2014 a most important quality to be considered by laundry owners and operators.\n\nTHE REFINITE COMPANY.\n\nNOW USING REFINITE\nThe HIGH CAPACITY ZEOLITE\n\nFOLLOWING is listed several hundred of the laundries and other institutions that have changed from the use of green sand and synthetic mineral to Refinite mineral. The owners of these Water Softeners have proven beyond doubt that Refinite is superior in every way. They not only greatly increased their profits, because of the increased capacity, but are forever free from iron rust and now have a mineral that outlasts many times any other mineral known. Look them over! You no doubt know some of these firms personally, or by reputation. Get in touch with them either by telephone or letter, and have these statements substantiated.\n\nILLINOIS\n\nBLOOMINGTON\u2014MENNONITE HOSPITAL\nChanged Wayne softener, size 36, from green sand to rapid Refinite, increasing capacity from 1,000 to 2,800 gallons per each regeneration.\n\nBLOOMINGTON\u2014MODEL LAUNDRY\nChanged Permutit softener, size 96-inch, from green sand to rapid Refinite, increasing capacity from 8,000 to 24,000 gallons each regeneration, softening 56 grain water.\n\nCHICAGO\n\nGARDEN CITY WET WASH LAUNDRY\nChanged large Permutit, increasing capacity from 90,000 to 120,000 gallons.\n\nSTRAND STANDARD WET WASH LAUNDRY\nChanged large Permutit, doubling capacity.\n\nWHITE EAGLE LAUNDRY\nChanged large Permutit, doubling capacity.\n\nAMERICAN WET WASH LAUNDRY\nChanged large Permutit, doubling capacity.\n\nATLAS WET WASH LAUNDRY\nChanged two large Permutits, trebling capacity.\n\nSUPREME WET WASH LAUNDRY\nDiscarded Paige & Jones, installed Refinite.\n\nSAFETY WET WASH LAUNDRY\nChanged large Permutit, doubling capacity.\n\nNEW HYDE PARK LAUNDRY\nChanged two Internationals to Refinite.\n\nDREXEL LAUNDRY\nChanged International to Refinite.\nCHICAGO (Continued)\n\nRED, WHITE & BLUE LAUNDRY\nChanged Paige & Jones to Refinite, doubling capacity.\n\nCENTENNIAL LAUNDRY\nChanged two large Permutits to Refinite, doubling capacity.\n\nPROMPT LAUNDRY\nChanged large Permutit, doubling capacity.\n\nVICTORY WET WASH LAUNDRY\nChanged Wayne to Refinite, trebling capacity.\n\nSOUTH CHICAGO LAUNDRY\nChanged Paige & Jones to Refinite, doubling capacity.\n\nSOUTHPORT LAUNDRY\nChanged Paige & Jones to Refinite, doubling capacity.\n\nPUBLIC LAUNDRY\nChanged Federal softener to Refinite, doubling capacity.\n\nBISELL LAUNDRY\nChanged large Permutit to Refinite, doubling capacity.\n\nHAHN BROS.

However, the outstanding performance of your Refinite Water Softeners and Rapid Refinite Mineral in our laundry, we believe, merits this.\n\nOur conclusion is not hastily drawn, but culminates sixteen years of constant testing of different water softener minerals under practical operation and close supervision. Beginning with slow regenerating water softeners, we later switched to Green Sand for quicker action, but at the expense of low capacity, frequent regenerations, high flush water and salt costs, and rust troubles.\n\nWe then gradually replaced the Green Sand with Refinite mineral, and we were becoming sold on it when the claims made for Synthetic mineral caught our attention. Having eliminated Green Sand from further consideration, we placed two ten foot Synthetic softeners of the best make obtainable, beside two nine foot Rapid Refinite softeners early in 1929 for a final test.\n\nBy the end of the second year's operation of these four units, the two Synthetic mineral beds had depreciated about 22 percent, while the two Refinite beds showed no depreciation. We removed the Synthetic mineral from one tank and used part of it to replenish the loss in the other tank. The empty tank was then filled with Refinite. However, the remaining Synthetic softener continued to lose mineral and capacity, and last summer we found it necessary to fill it with Refinite mineral also.\n\nOur Refinite softeners are still delivering 40 percent over their guaranteed capacities, and no noticeable loss in mineral has taken place. Salt consumption is now the lowest on record. Also we find that Refinite maintains a softer water in our laundry.\n\nThe best product has proven itself. Therefore, we are proud to say that the Peerless Laundry is 100 PERCENT REFINITE.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nPEERLESS LAUNDRY SERVICES, LTD.\n\nL. F. Caswell - President & Manager.\n\nTWENTY YEARS AHEAD OF DATE MAKES THE PEERLESS LAUNDRY GREAT\nMOOSE JAW STEAM LAUNDRY CO., LTD.\n\nMoose Jaw, Sask.,\nJuly 10, 1954.\n\nRefinite Water Softener Company,\n4 Victoria Park Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nIn the year 1920 we purchased your water softener and filter, with a capacity of 36,000 gallons of soft water delivered in ten hours, based on a hardness of 42 degrees.\n\nDuring this time we have not renewed the mineral, and we believe the life of it is good for many years to come.

The equipment discussed here was purchased from \"Pumps and Softeners Ltd.\" (Darco)\nRefinite Water Softener Company,\n4 Victoria Park Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nAt your suggestion I have much pleasure in writing you to say that last fall I installed in my house, 2220 College Avenue, Refinite equipment furnished through you. I have much pleasure in saying that we are delighted with the excellent supply of very soft water which it furnishes and I wish further to say that it involves a minimum of trouble. The equipment itself is so simple that there is very little opportunity for it to go wrong.\n\nI make this last remark feelingly. The fact is that I discarded a Duro automatic to put in your equipment. The duro was proving very unsatisfactory. In fairness to it I will say that I had had it in the house for five or six years but it had for some time been constantly getting out of order and I could find the water coming through hard.\n\nI have had no more trouble since I installed your equipment and feel very well satisfied at having done so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.

Blackburn,\nc/o The Dept. of Public Works,\nThe Government of Saskatchewan,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are considering the question of installing a water softener in our plant, and we are advised by the Refinite Co.'s representative that you have used their softener in your power plant with splendid results.\n\nWe are taking the liberty of asking you the following questions and trust we are not asking too much of your valuable time.\n\n1. How long have you been using the Refinite Softener and what condition are your boilers in at the present time regarding corrosion? Do you find it necessary to remove scale by hand or can it be washed out with a hose?\n\n2. What was your experience in using hard water in your boilers previous to installing the Refinite Softener?\n\n3. Did you find it necessary to discard your old boilers or are they still in use?\n\n4. Do you experience any difficulty in foaming or priming?\n\n5. Have you had to make any replacements of flues, fittings or piping as a result of using a water softener?\n\n6. What in your opinion would fuel saving be by using the softener.\n\nThe foregoing we admit is a rather lengthy list of questions, but all are important and as already stated if we are not infringing on your generosity too much, we would be glad to have them all answered.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. H. Cushing Ltd.,\nPer: M. W. Cushing, Manager.\nRegina, Saskatchewan,\nMay 6, 1929.\n\nThe Government of the Province of Saskatchewan,\nDepartment of Public Works.\n\nW. H. Cushing Ltd.,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of April 30th, re. the Refinite Water Softener Plant in use here, I beg to reply to your questions as follows:\n\n1. We have been using the water softener plant at the new power house Legislative Buildings for about eight years (since 1921). Our boilers are in excellent shape and there is no appearance of corrosion or scale. The boilers are usually in service from two to four months before washing out. On opening the boilers there is usually a thin film of sediment, which is easily washed out with a hose. After this the plates are brushed and the inside of the drum given a thin coating of Graphite Red Lead and Boiled Oil. This is to prevent a possibility of corrosion which is liable to occur in any boiler where the principal load is a heating load, and the boiler is fed with the returns from the heating system.\n\n2. We had no Refinite Water Softener in the old plant. The boilers in this plant were taken out of service for cleaning every two or three weeks. They usually had a moderately heavy coating of scale, which had to be chipped out where accessible. The tubes could not be cleaned properly and there was a heavy scale in places. When the new power plant was built a water softener was installed at the same time.\n\n3. The old boilers were discarded. They were so badly corroded in places that they were considered unsafe for further use.\n\n4. We do not experience any difficulty in foaming or priming.\n\n5. We have never replaced any boiler tubes or fittings in the new plant except some small valves attached to the water column. This is a good record considering the boilers have been in service eight years. We frequently had to replace boiler tubes in the old plants.\n\n6. It is difficult to answer this question as the saving would depend upon actual condition of boilers before installing a water softener. Boiler scale is very impervious to heat transmission, and a comparatively thin coating of scale will reduce boiler efficiency to a great extent. Tests have been made showing that 1/16 inch average thickness of scale will reduce boiler efficiency from 10 to 12%, but for a number of reasons, which I need not enter into, the results of tests of this kind vary considerably. The above is probably a fair average.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. M. Blackburn,\nChief Mechanical Supt.\nGREY NUN'S HOSPITAL\n\nRegina, Sask.,\nNovember 15th, 1933.\n\nRefinite Water Softener Company,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Sirs,-\n\nIn the fall of 1927, we replaced the synthetic mineral in our water softening plant with Refinite. On opening the softener on November 9th, 1933, we found the loss from wear and tear too small to estimate.\n\nWe use the softened water in our boilers as well as for general hospital needs and are entirely satisfied with the results we are getting with Refinite.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nM.

(FG 1C, Volume 6329, file 660-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAs Refinite is practically a permanent mineral it is in great demand all over the world. We quote from a recent letter from Mr. T. E. Stevens, President of the Refinite Company, to the Regina office: \"This company has been in existence some twenty years. From the first it has used our present mineral, Refinite,---. I think your experience in Regina has been the same as ours in this country. It is our experience that in localities where the water is twenty-five to thirty grains hard and above synthetic mineral is not at all suitable and loses much of its capacity in the first eighteen months, while we have no difficulty in softening the water where the hardness runs from fifty to fifty-five grains. There are quite a large number of towns in this country where synthetic minerals have been tried and given up. Some of them in the State of Minnesota are: Worthington, Willmar, Montevideo, Hutchinson, and others\".\n\n\"As Refinite mineral is able to soften the water that others cannot soften then it stands to reason that Refinite mineral is best for all waters. This is well proven by the large number of Softeners that are changed over to Refinite Mineral. The bulletin enclosed gives a list of 100 or more, which is only a partial list of those changes, but this booklet was made several years ago and most of the changes then were from green sand to Refinite. Synthetic mineral never has been able to gain the approval of laundry owners and industrial plant managers generally, but we do change over a good many domestic softeners that were sold with synthetic mineral---\".\n\n\"We do not hesitate to give a guarantee in connection with our sales that there will be no loss in mineral from attrition over a period of three years; where purchases are made by competition a three year guarantee without loss in mineral should be required by the purchaser. Any manufacturer that has confidence in his mineral will not object to this guarantee. Any manufacturer that refuses such a guarantee is not showing confidence in his own product, and should be eliminated. We are ready to guarantee the mineral to you and you in turn to those to whom you sell\".\n\nREFFINITE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE STANDARD OF COMPARISON\nTo a large laundry water softening equipment is simply a matter of dollars and cents. The softer the water and the more efficient the equipment the less money is spent on soaps and sodas. When one remembers that the large plant in the Moose Jaw Steam Laundry has been regenerated nearly every day for fourteen years, one appreciates the wearing qualities of Refinite mineral.\n\nThe Peerless Laundry in Los Angeles is the largest laundry in the world. Their equipment contains 80,000 pounds, or 40 tons, of Refinite mineral. Their experience with other zeolites is interesting.\n\nThe Refinite Company has divided Canada into several districts, two in Eastern Canada, and one at Regina covering Western Canada. We have over 700 plants in Regina alone, including installations in over 35 apartment buildings, the General Hospital, the Power House at the Parliament Buildings and the Saskatchewan Co-operative Creameries. From the boiler rooms of such firms as P&H Burns and T. Eaton Co., to the Assiniboia Club, there are satisfied Refinite owners everywhere. In fact nearly all the installations in Saskatchewan are Refinite.\n\nAmong our installations in other places are: University of Saskatchewan, Hotel Palliser, Calgary (C.P.R.), Moose Jaw General Hospital, North Battleford Mental Hospital, the Moose Jaw Co-operative Creameries, Saskatchewan Sanatorium, Central Alberta Sanatorium, the Power House at the Alberta Parliament Buildings, the Chateau at Lake Louise and Banff Springs Hotel.\n\nThe Refinite equipment at the Parliament Buildings in Regina was installed in 1921. Mr. William Butterly, the engineer in charge, who has been there for twenty years, is always glad to receive visitors.\n\nWe have placed Refinite equipment in many places in Regina where other zeolites have been tried. We mention the Argyle Apartments, owned by Alderman G. L. Geddie, and the Grey Nun's Hospital, as these had tried synthetic mineral before changing to Refinite equipment. We enclose a letter from Mr. Geddie, and one from the Grey Nun's Hospital. We also enclose a letter from Mr. D. J. Thom, who describes his experience with synthetic mineral in his own home.\nREFINITE MINERAL THE STANDARD OF COMPARISON\n\nThe essential element on which depends the success or failure of any water softening plant is the kind of mineral used.\n\nThe minerals available for water softeners are limited to three kinds. They are: Refinite, Green Sand, and the artificial or synthetic minerals. Since we are the exclusive owners of deposits and patents covering Refinite, all other manufacturers are limited to a choice of one of the other kinds. Actual comparison proves that no mineral yet discovered or manufactured has given over a period of years the capacity and economical results which Refinite users have obtained.\n\nGreen Sand, which comes from New Jersey, contains about 25% iron, which in time has a corrosive action. Many firms find it necessary to remove Green Sand after two or three years use. This zeolite has a much smaller capacity than Refinite.\n\nSynthetic, or manufactured mineral does not run uniform in quality, and being made from chemicals it disintegrates in water slowly and loses its capacity for softening water.\n\nMost large companies and institutions know that synthetic or manufactured mineral is not suitable for plants of industrial size. They also know that synthetic mineral cannot give the proper results in the softening of very hard water.\n\nRefinite mineral is not a manufactured product. It is a flinty, porous clay which is insoluble in water. In its original state it is classed as a natural zeolite. No chemicals whatever are added to nature's formula.\n\nThe raw or natural mineral is very hard, and must be blasted loose. The process of baking it is similar to that of baking bricks. Refinite is our registered name for the finished product.\n\nOne of the severest tests for zeolites is to pass hot water through them. Refinite is the only zeolite that will stand this test.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nW. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., 27th December, 1934.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMrs. Paul, of Regina, who has the Agency here for the Refinite Company of Canada Limited, has been to see me several times in connection with placing the merits of their water softener before our Department. I of course told her that the matter of arranging for equipment is not in my hands. She however was anxious that you should see the enclosed literature with regard to this plant and, if a softener is being put in the new Lebret School or the proposed hospital, she would like to have the opportunity of quoting.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\n\nR. Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nHere's What the CANADIAN FIRE-KING Will Do for You\u2014\n\n1. CUT FUEL COSTS\nThe CANADIAN FIRE-KING is designed to burn Canadian Slack and Screenings\u2014the cheapest size of coal obtainable\u2014and by achieving perfect combustion, it burns fewer tons. Savings of from 10% to 50% in fuel costs are enjoyed by CANADIAN FIRE-KING users.\n\n2. INCREASE EFFICIENCY\u2014ELIMINATE SMOKE\nBy the CANADIAN FIRE-KING method the coal is gradually coked as it feeds up into the firebed, and the gases, mixed with just the proper amount of air, are completely burned. Result\u2014no smoke\u2014higher efficiency, and a correct and thorough burning that leaves far less ash.\n\n3. ASSURE EVEN PRESSURE OR HEAT\nRegardless of the system used\u2014hot water, steam, vacuum, high pressure or low\u2014the CANADIAN FIRE-KING automatically maintains the temperature or steam pressure desired.\n\n4. INCREASE BOILER CAPACITY\nWith a CANADIAN FIRE-KING you can operate your boiler at a greater capacity than is possible by antiquated hand-firing.\n\n5. CUT LABOR COSTS\nFar less labor is required to operate a Canadian FIRE-KING equipped boiler. Your fireman can do other work\u2014his labor cost can be applied on another job.\n\n6. PAY FOR ITSELF AS IT WORKS FOR YOU\nThe moderate cost of a CANADIAN FIRE-KING is soon returned in fuel and labor savings. Add to this the savings that result from more efficient, more accurate operation, and reduced maintenance cost. A CANADIAN FIRE-KING is an investment that pays large dividends.\n\nAuthorized Distributor\n\nTHE MANITOBA BRIDGE AND IRON WORKS LIMITED\nWINNIPEG, CANADA\nHAND FIRING IS WASTEFUL, INEFFICIENT, COSTLY\n\nThe illustration above shows how green coal thrown on the fire tends to smoulder in the grate while gases given off by the green coal tend to be carried up the stack until they are consumed. Furthermore partially burned coal falls through the grates and is carried out with the ash. Opening of fire doors to shovel in coal cools the fire and wastes fuel.\n\nNo business can afford the extravagance of hand-firing\u2014for it wastes one-sixth to one-half of your coal.\n\nCANADIAN FIRE-KING AUTOMATIC FIRING IS ECONOMICAL, EFFICIENT\n\nThe CANADIAN FIRE-KING feeds the fuel from underneath the fire in the method approved by leading combustion engineers. The coal is slowly coked as it comes in contact with the fireside and the rising gases carry away the heat, just the right amount of air, are completely burned.\n\nThe illustration shows how coal is delivered from the hopper to the bottom of the fuel bed worm which pushes the coal steadily upward toward the fire-bed. The same electric motor which drives the worm operates a fan which forces sufficient air through the bed in the proper proportions to completely burn the coal, the stoker operating only when necessary to maintain the pressure or temperature desired.\n\n1 Heavy sectional tuyere blocks and dead plates\u2014air cooled. Outside of front tuyere block solid which prevents concentration of heat on front wall of boiler.\n\n2 Auxiliary air inlet to prevent smoking back through worm tube.\n\n3 Clean-out plate in worm tube to facilitate removal of foreign substance in coal.\n\n4 Damper control in fan inlet to regulate air required for complete combustion.\n\n5 High grade multivane fan to supply forced draft through the fuel bed.\n\n6 Safety shearing pin to protect mechanism from obstructions in worm tube.

This requires the development of a drive unit which will deliver fuel into the fire just as it is needed, in order to improve combustion efficiency and control the fuel bed to obtain maximum combustion efficiency. The CANADIAN FIRE-KING drive unit answers this problem in all its phases. It is a mechanically perfect unit which satisfies the demands of the combustion engineer to achieve a definite condition in the fire box.\n\nNo other drive unit of the variable speed type for stokers offers the features of simplicity and accessibility found in the 1952 model CANADIAN FIRE-KING Gear Case. The Ratchet Type Gear Case is used by us in rugged construction, correct mechanically, speed adjustment can be made at will while the machine is running without bothering to shift clutches, and the job is quiet and durable.\n\nOnly in the CANADIAN FIRE-KING stoker is the intermittent action of the drive mechanism so smooth that the fuel is delivered into the fire box in a continuous stream. This prevents the possibility that the coals settle and level the fuel bed and eliminate the possibility of thick spots which cool the fire or thin spots for air to blow through. The scientific action of the CANADIAN FIRE-KING drive unit thus achieves an ideal fire-box condition. In so doing, it is years ahead in mechanical perfection and is truly a triumph of CANADIAN FIRE-KING engineering.\n\nThe CANADIAN FIRE-KING Gear Case\n\nThe illustration of the rear of the case shows the compact, sturdy construction and easy accessibility of the speed-reducing unit. The worm wheel is a solid one-piece casting of special anti-friction bronze, machined to very close limits, mounting quiet and efficient bearings. The worm gear is precision ground and accurately cut to assure quiet operation. The worm wheel and worm gear operate in a bath of transmission oil.\n\nThe CANADIAN FIRE-KING gear case is equipped throughout with high pressure lubrication. The worm wheel mechanism is protected against overload due to foreign substance in the coal by means of a shunting pin. It is impossible to overload the CANADIAN FIRE-KING stoker. A totally enclosed universal joint coupling connects driving mechanism to CANADIAN FIRE-KING drive unit. The CANADIAN FIRE-KING drive unit is a self-aligning case mechanism of all thrust load\u2014another exclusive CANADIAN FIRE-KING feature.\n\nHome of the CANADIAN FIRE-KING Automatic Stoker\n\nThe Manitoba Bridge and Iron Works Limited, Winnipeg, Canada\n\nMANUFACTURERS\nDecember 29th, 1934.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nDominion of Canada,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nAttention Mr. R.

This chain of lakes, nestling in the deep rugged valley of the Qu'Appelle has attracted a number of summer cottagers and undoubtedly will attract more. Accordingly, the Department of Health of the Province of Saskatchewan desires to prevent, insofar as is possible, the pollution of the waters of these lakes and quite naturally desires that the sewage disposal system at the new school be one that will not give grounds for complaint.\n\nThe water from Lebret lake is not free from pollution and during the present dry cycle the water becomes quite stagnant and gives forth rather an unpleasant odor. However, this lake was the source of water supply for the old school and of necessity will be the source of water supply for the new school. It is proposed to sink a well within 20 to 25 feet of the waters' edge and connect the same by pipe with the pump house. Chlorination of the water supply will be necessary but it is anticipated that due to the sandy nature of the soil, there will be a sufficient quantity of seepage into the well to meet the school's requirements and that filtration will be unnecessary. It is proposed to install a water softener. All installations in connection with the water supply will be concentrated in the pump house addition.\n\nThe sewage disposal system at the old Indian School at Lebret consisted of a septic tank and disposal bed. The septic tank is much too small for the requirements of the\nschool and the disposal bed presumably ceased to be efficient years ago. It is not intended, therefore, to make use of any part of the old system.\n\nIn connection with the sewage disposal systems of the Indian Residential Schools that have received the attention of this office, a septic tank, either with or without a disposal bed has been the usual installation. We proposed to construct a septic tank and disposal bed in connection with the new school at Lebret. However, in discussing the matter with Mr. R. H. Murray, Director of Sanitation, Department of Health of the Province of Saskatchewan, he was definitely opposed to such a proposed method of sewage disposal and suggested the use of sprinkling filters, the system in use at the Provincial Sanitarium near Fort Qu'Appelle.\n\nSprinkling filters are well adapted for use in warm climates but unless well heated lose much of their efficiency in cold climates. Such a system is not suited for Indian Residential Schools for as a general rule the sewage disposal systems at these institutions do not receive proper attention and sprinkling filters require continuous attention for efficiency of results. I have not examined the system in use at the Sanitarium near Fort Qu'Appelle, but have no doubt that it is quite efficient, as is claimed by Mr. Murray, for that institution is well maintained and has a competent engineering and supervising staff whose duty it is to attend to such matters.\n\nIn connection with the Lebret School, we have designed a septic tank and sewage disposal bed that will meet the requirements of the institution and also, we think, render the effluent less harmful than the present lake water. We realize, however, that we will have difficulty in convincing Mr. Murray of such efficiency of results.\nAccordingly, we have prepared a design for a sewage disposal system by means of chlorination. This system is in use at the Ninette Sanitarium in Manitoba. It was installed in 1931 and is said to be very efficient. The Ninette Sanitarium is located on the shores of Pelican lake, a beautiful body of water lying amidst the scenic beauty of the Pembina Valley. Pelican lake is a summer resort and many cottages border its shores and the Manitoba Government are just as anxious as the Saskatchewan Government that pollution of such lakes be not permitted.\n\nThe Ninette Sanitarium for Consumptives is a Manitoba Government institution. The Manitoba Government are also installing this system at the new Provincial Gaol near Headingley, and the effluent is discharged into the Assiniboine river.\n\nThe situation is as follows: The Director of Sanitation, Department of Health at Regina, takes strong exception to our suggestion to construct a septic tank and disposal bed at the Lebret School, but suggests a system of sprinkling filters. Because of the heavy initial cost of installation and also operation, we do not approve of his suggestion. In submitting a third proposal, providing for the installation of a system of sewage disposal in use at Government Institutions in Manitoba and strongly endorsed by the Department of Health officials of the Manitoba Government, we hope that Mr. Murray will approve of the same and thus avoid any conflict of opinion over the matter.\n\nIt is not my intention in this preliminary report to go fully into the matter of the design of the two alternative systems for sewage disposal, nor into the subject of estimated costs. However, in the paragraphs following, the salient points in the design of each system...\nare outlined and the plans, accompanying this report, show considerable of the detail.\n\nSEPTIC TANK AND DISPOSAL BED:\n\nThe design of the septic tank and disposal bed, of necessity, had to conform to the limited difference in elevation available between the outlet from the school and the high water elevation of Lebret lake. Thus a shallow septic tank, in close proximity to the school was necessary, with a fairly long connecting line to the disposal bed. We desired to locate the disposal bed so that the completed surface would conform to the natural contour of the grounds and also so as to be away from tree growth.\n\nThe septic tank as shown on the accompanying plan, consists of the usual settling and syphon chambers and is to be constructed of reinforced concrete, the concrete baffle beans being designed to support the overhead structures. Provision is made for three manholes, one of which is to provide access for periodic removal of solid matter.\n\nThe settling basin is designed for a theoretical retention period of 24 hours for 10,000 gallons or double the anticipated average daily water consumption in the Institution. The syphon chamber is fitted with one 5\" Anthes syphon and is designed to discharge 2,500 gallons twice each 24 hours.\n\nIn drawing your attention to the plan showing details of septic tank, I would like to point out that if it is finally decided to utilize a septic tank with a disposal bed, full details will be shown of the construction details, including reinforcing required etc. It might also be pointed out that since the accompanying plan was prepared, alterations in design have been decided upon to ensure more even distribution in the settling basin, to permit a freer entry of air to the tank and to substitute a weir for the 6\" pipe opening between settling chamber and syphon chamber.\n\nIndian Affairs, (FG 1C, Volume 6320, file 660-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDetails of the proposed disposal bed are not being forwarded. The proposed bed will be 125' x 200' and will contain 6,272 lineal feet of field tile or 23 lineal feet for each inmate of the Institution. Crushed rock, gravel and sand will be used in the building up of the bed in order to ensure efficiency of results.\n\nRain water from the roof and drainage from the boiler room and the pump room will not be passed through either the septic tank or disposal bed, but will be outletted into the small creek as illustrated on the accompanying contour plan of the site.\n\nNo provision is being made for installation of any grease trap between the building and the septic tank as it is assumed that grease traps are a part of the plumbing installation covered by the general contract.\n\n**CHLORINATING SYSTEM OF SEWAGE TREATMENT:**\n\nThis system consists of the application of chlorine to the sewage before entering the main chamber which chamber corresponds to the settling chamber of a septic tank and has a designed retention period of 24 hours, also a further application of chlorine to the effluent prior to passing into the outlet pipe.\n\nThe accompanying plan showing \"Details of Chlorinating Plant\", shows fairly clearly the main features of the construction necessary. The tank constructed of reinforced concrete is rather similar to the ordinary septic tank and is sometimes erroneously referred to as a septic tank. The tank is divided into three chambers, which for convenience we will refer to as \"Inlet Chlorinating Chamber\", \"Main Chamber\" and \"Outlet Chlorinating Chamber\". The 6\" sewer pipe from the school discharges into the inlet chlorinating chamber, the dimensions of which are 5' - 0\" by 2' - 6\", with the bottom elevation of inlet and outlet pipe 2' - 0\" from the bottom of the chamber. The upper\nportion of the chamber is baffled to ensure even distribution and the lower portion is fitted with a coarse screen which serves the same purpose as the screen in the manhole at the entrance to the septic tank. A manhole provides access to the chamber and permits cleaning of the screen when necessary. Two 6\" outlet pipes connect with the two sections of the main chamber.\n\nThe main chamber corresponds to the settling chamber of a septic tank and as designed has outside dimensions of 19' - 0\" x 23' - 0\". This main tank is divided into two separate chambers each with inside dimensions of 8' - 0\" by 20' - 0\" and a mean depth of approximately 6' - 11\". The floor slopes slightly from either end to a sludge trough at the centre. Each chamber has been designed for a 24 hour retention period for 5,000 gallons and it is planned to have only one chamber in operation at one time so as to permit frequent removal of sludge. This sludge removal will be made by means of a sludge pump emptying into a suitable tank that can be placed readily on a waggon. Access to either chamber is provided by a common manhole in the centre of the tank and giving ready access for the removal of sludge. The chambers are baffled to ensure even distribution, also retention and the reinforced baffles are designed so as to carry the roof and to provide a 6\" air space below the roof. This air space is for insulation purposes.\n\nThe outlet chlorinating chamber as designed is 6' - 6\" x 4' - 0\" inside dimensions and 4' 6\" in height below the inner manhole cover. The 6\" pipe from the main chamber permits discharge onto a 4\" layer of properly sized crushed rock resting on a coarse screen which rests on an iron grill whose edges are embedded in the concrete walls of the chamber. The space below the screen is in the second chlorinating chamber and is of sufficient dimensions to ensure a retention period of at least 15 minutes between\ndischarges into the effluent pipe. A manhole provides access to this chamber and permits flushing and cleaning of the crushed rock and if necessary its replacement.\n\nA small shelter to house the chlorinator completes the layout. This shelter could be built anywhere on the roof, but preferably where shown on the plan. Galvanized piping 1-1/8\" diameter connects the chlorinator with the two chlorinating chambers and provides protection for the rubber tubing carrying the chlorine.\n\nThe initial application of chlorine takes place in the inlet chamber, chlorine being applied continuously at a specified rate unless a fully automatic chlorinator is installed, in which case chlorine would be only applied and in such quantities as required by the inflowing sewage. In the main chamber the process of chlorination continues, the chlorine penetrating the solid matters, rendering them odorless and harmless. It is possible some septic action also takes place in this tank, but it is in no sense a septic tank since septic action is retarded by the application of chlorine. There is free flow from the main chamber through the 6\" outflow pipe onto the crushed rock bed in the outflow chlorinating chamber. The purpose of this crushed rock layer is to separate remaining solids from the effluent and prevent them passing into the lake where their presence would be unsightly, although harmless. Naturally this rock bed requires occasional cleaning. An overflow pipe is provided to care for outflow in case the crushed rock bed becomes clogged and an air vent is also to be installed. Chlorine is also applied to the effluent below the rock screen, the application being continuous unless a fully automatic chlorinator is installed.\nESTIMATES OF COST:\n\nNo estimates have as yet been prepared of the costs of either of the two methods of sewage treatment outlined above. It is probable that the cost of construction of the chlorinating tank would be slightly more than the construction of the septic tank. Should soil conditions not prove favourable, the disposal bed to be used in connection with the septic tank will probably entail an expenditure of approximately $2,500. to $3,000., whereas the cost of the chlorinating machine installed could probably be carried out for $1,250. Should it be necessary to provide an outlet into deep water from the chlorinating tank, this would prove expensive. We hope to avoid the necessity for this. It is probable, therefore, that the cost of the septic tank installation would be $1,750 more than the other.\n\nA comparison of operation costs however are decidedly unfavourable to the chlorinating system. Little or no operation costs are involved in the case of the septic tank, other than the necessity of periodic removal of sludge. The daily cost of chlorine for the chlorinating system would probably be not less than 60 cents or about $230.00 yearly.\n\nREMARKS:\n\nThe writer, at the present time, is not prepared to state which system of sewage treatment would prove to be the most efficient at the Lebret School. We are quite confident that the septic tank and disposal bed that we have designed will prove very efficient and will result in an effluent comparatively free from bacteria and less dangerous than the water of Lebret lake. On the other hand we are not confident that the treatment of the sewage by chlorination as proposed, will be as easily operated or that the results obtained will be as satisfactory. Notwithstanding the efficiency of results claimed on behalf of the installation\nat Ninette Sanitarium, such literature as we have secured relating to the subject has not convinced us as to the efficiency of this method of sewage treatment.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Director of Sanitation of the Department of Health of the Province of Saskatchewan has expressed his disapproval of the proposed septic tank installation and inasmuch as it is our desire to secure approval of the Saskatchewan authorities for whatever sewage disposal system is to be installed, we have brought to your attention this proposal to treat the sewage by chlorination. This treatment is advocated by officials of the Department of Health of the Province of Manitoba and meets with their complete approval. Under such circumstances it might reasonably be expected that such endorseration would ensure the approval of the Saskatchewan officials. Whether such approval can be secured will only be ascertained by submitting the proposals to the proper officials at Regina. I would recommend that this be done without delay. If such approval is not forthcoming then it would be for the Department of Indian Affairs to decide whether we should proceed with the design of a sprinkling filter system of sewage treatment or to over-ride the objections of the Saskatchewan Department of Health and proceed with the construction of a septic tank and sewage disposal bed as outlined in this report.\n\nD.

I would suggest that the writer be authorized to discuss the subject with Mr. R. H.

The specifications simply call for pipe rail and the only elevation clearly shows a single rail.\n\nWe suggest as a compromise, so that we may be able to give him what he wants, that we furnish the double strand railing using 2\" outside diameter pipe in place of 2\u00bd\" as called for. This will furnish just as good a railing and is the size generally called for. Also that we be allowed to omit the two riser bars for the fire escapes as a further help in making up the extra cost of the double pipe. We cannot see that these bars are of the slightest value to the fire escape, to the contrary they furnish an obstruction which will tend to allow snow to collect on the treads. We have furnished fire escapes for a number of Indian school buildings and in all cases our work has been approved without these riser bars although they have always been mentioned in the specifications.\n\nOn our drawing number 1 returned by you, you have given a dimension of 16'-3 7/8\" from wall line to edge of door opening. In order that this opening line up with the windows this figure should be 17'-3 7/8\". Will you please check. Also we require distance centre line of column 67 to centre line column 68 and from centre line column 68 to face of brick wall. We forgot to ask for distance between brick walls where we bridge from one building to the other on the same drawing and wish you would furnish us with this dimension also.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDominion Bronze & Iron Ltd.\n\nF.

Gurney Orr Esq.\nArchitect.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nQu'Appelle Indian School, Lebret.\n\nI enclose herewith copy of a letter from the Dominion Bronze & Iron Ltd to Smith Bros & Wilson, and also send prints of their shop drawings No.1 of fire escape details, and No.5 of iron pipe handrails for stairs.\n\nTheir letter protests against my request for a second pipe rail as indicated in red pencil on the blue print, which they say is not specified, but which appears to me necessary for protection against people falling down the stair well.\n\nThe specification for fire escapes calls for two 3/16\" x 1\" riser bars at each step, not shown on the shop drawing but noted in red pencil. The argument of the subcontractors against using these does not carry much weight. However, they state that if permitted to omit them, and substitute 2\" pipe instead of 2 1/2\" specified for the railings, they will furnish the second rail I have asked for.\n\nIt will be noticed that the detail for fire escape stairs shows filler bars 1/4\" x 1/4\" instead of 3/16\" x 1/4\" which is a little heavier than specified, but the treads are only 6\" wide instead of 7\" specified. I am of opinion that the omission of the riser bars combined with the narrow treads will form a dangerous fall.\n\nShould you be disposed to concede the omission of the riser bars (which do not appear to have been used in former jobs) for the addition of a second rail on the interior stairs, it seems to me that the specification should be adhered to as regards the width and construction of the fire escape treads.\n\nYour opinion on this matter will be much appreciated.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nH.

In attempting to decide what brick to figure on for this particular job we were influenced by the fact that no light buff brick of the Dry Press method are made out west and any such brick from Eastern points are extremely expensive. We were further influenced by the fact that you state a price of $25.00 per M for the exterior brick for this same job and felt that we would not be justified in figuring on any brick more expensive than the exterior face brick.\n\nWe are sure that the Estevan Buff brick will give a well lighted and clean appearance to the stair wells and for the reasons stated above we wish to ask your approval of their use for this purpose.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSMITH BROS. & WILSON LTD.\nper\n\nGeo.

The specification calls for a 2\" main and it is to branch into two 1\" mains, one to each end of the building. We consider these mains altogether too small for the number of fixtures that they have to supply and we think that you should bring this matter to the attention of the Architect also.\n\nWe would be glad to know if you have any information yet, as to the disposal of the rainwater.

No outlets for this purpose appear to be shown.\n\nIt will be appreciated if a complete lay-out of the laundry equipment can be supplied, including the electrical requirements and detail of the drainage channel leading to the drain from the washer.\n\nAnother matter in connection with the laundry might deserve some attention, and that is the width of the doorway through which the machines will have to be brought in. The plan shows a door opening 5'-0\" wide.

Murray, Director of Sanitation of the Saskatchewan Department of Health, to Mr. Jow, our Acting District Chief Engineer at Winnipeg, who interviewed Mr. Murray on Jan. 28th and reached an understanding with him which appears to be satisfactory.\n\nIn his covering letter of Feb. 1st, Mr. Jow states:\n\n\"In his letter Mr. Murray confirms the arrangements made at the time of our visit. Mr. Murray is of the opinion that the sewage disposal bed will very soon after being put in operation cease to function efficiently and that the effluent will discharge directly into the lake. However, he states that his Department has no objections to the disposal bed in itself and if there is no effluent discharge into the lake it will be quite satisfactory, but if it is found that the bed is not efficient then the Department of Health reserves the right to insist upon another system of sewage disposal being installed.\n\n\"Regarding the last paragraph of Mr. Murray's letter, I might say that as regards the design of the septic tank, Mr. Murray's suggestions were constructive, will possibly add to the efficiency of the septic tank without added cost and the writer readily agrees to embody his suggestions in the final design and also to submit to him a copy of the plans before construction was proceeded with.\n\n\"I would request that you obtain from the Department of Indian Affairs, at the earliest possible date, their decision as to whether or not the installation of septic tank and the disposal bed is to be proceeded within accordance with the understanding reached with the Director, Division of Sanitation, and as outlined in his letter.\"\n\nI shall be glad to have your instructions in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector\n\nPer M.F.C.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie Esq.,\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

B. Gow,\nDominion Water Power Branch,\nDepartment of the Interior,\n706 Commercial Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your visit to this office on the 28th instant, I wish to confirm the discussion which we had on the matter of water supply and sewage disposal for the new Indian Residential School at Lebret.\n\nWater Supply.\n\nI understand that it is proposed to sink a well close to the lake shore at a point due west of the school and that water will filter through from the lake into the well and be pumped for use in the school.\n\nThere will be no direct connection from the lake to the well and all water consumed will be subject to natural filtration before entering the well.\n\nFurther, the water will be continuously treated by liquid chlorine.\n\nIt may be necessary to have a direct connection from the lake through a separate force main for fire protection purposes, but if this is provided separate pumps and supply mains will be used and there will be no cross connections between the emergency supply for fire purposes and the domestic supply for washing and consumption by the pupils and staff.\n\nIt should be pointed out that the location of this well should be as far removed as possible from any sewage disposal bed which is contemplated and the Department would like to see this well located even further to the north than the site shown on your plan, say, at a distance of at least 400 feet from the nearest point of the disposal bed.\n\nSewage Disposal.\n\nTwo schemes were discussed in connection with sewage disposal, preliminary plans for which were submitted. Scheme (a) shows a chlorination plant at the south end of the school building with a six inch effluent pipe discharging into the dry creek bed some 200 feet from the lake shore. Scheme (b) provides for a septic tank situated immediately south of the school with an underground disposal bed constructed of 4 inch field tile with no effluent pipe leading into the lake.\n\nIn both schemes the roof water and other clear water from the school is conveyed by a 6 inch pipe to the ditch about 150 feet east of the school and discharged into the creek bed.\n\nSo far as this 6 inch pipe for clear water is concerned this is satisfactory to the Department, provided that at no time any waste water which is at all offensive is\ndischarged into the creek and that the effluent is free from laundry and other wastes.\n\nRegarding Scheme (a), the proposal seems to be to retain the sewage in an underground tank and chlorinate before and after retention.\n\nThe intention is to prevent any septic action in this tank and precipitate the solids, the latter being removed from the tank at frequent intervals, the chlorinated effluent being discharged into the lake.\n\nThe Department is of the opinion that the quantity of chlorine necessary to treat the sewage in this manner would be very excessive; in fact it is doubtful if the school authorities would be prepared to maintain the dose required; the effluent would be unsatisfactory and would not be suitable for discharge as proposed. Even if sufficient chlorine were used the effluent might be discharged into a river which had a very large volume of flow but it would not avoid a nuisance in a quiescent lake.\n\nRegarding Scheme (b), the writer expressed the opinion to you when I met you at the site of the school last fall that an underground disposal bed would not prove satisfactory under the special circumstances at Lebret and I wish to repeat that view and place it on record. The level of the disposal bed will, of necessity, be just above the level of the lake and unless there is tile there can be little or no drainage of the effluent into the ground below the bed. If the ground above the tiles is prepared artificially with sand or gravel it will undoubtedly absorb a certain amount of waste liquid but this will gradually become water-logged and although there may be a limited amount of evaporation and lateral absorption it will only be a matter of time until the bed becomes completely saturated and the liquid finds its way to the surface and overflows into the lake.\n\nApparently this view is not held by your Department and you feel that at least an experiment should be made to see if this disposal bed will not function efficiently.\n\nI am directed to say that this Department has no objection to the disposal bed in itself and if there is no effluent discharged into the lake we will be quite satisfied, but if at any time it is found that this bed has become water-logged and that the effluent is reaching the lake through a direct channel the Department will require that the effluent be temporarily pumped from the septic tank and conveyed by wagon to some approved point of disposal on the land and a system of filtration immediately installed as originally recommended by this Department.\n\nRegarding the design of the septic tank, several details were discussed with you and I understand that the suggestions made will be incorporated in the final plans which are submitted for the approval of the Minister of Public Health before construction work starts.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) R. H. Murray,\nDirector,\nDivision of Sanitation.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have taken this matter up with the sub-contractors for the metal work and they suggest that a steel plate would have to be flanged for stiffness and would be noisy if kicked or struck; would be hard to fix at top or bottom edges; and they suggest a plain balustrade of 1\" square balusters at 5\" centres with channel top and bottom; the top channel fixed to 2\" Pipe Handrail and the bottom rail standing free between posts.\n\nThe Dominion Bronze & Iron Ltd. point out that the cost would be just as great for the steel plate as for this plain type of balustrade and we quote you the sum of Two Hundred and Fifty-two Dollars ($252.00) to supply and erect and paint the necessary balustrade as outlined above, for the two main stairs.\n\nShould steel plates be required, the total cost would be the same figure.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSMITH BROS. & WILSON, LTD.,\nper Geo.

M.S.\nFebruary 21, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nEnclosed you will please find in duplicate a blue print showing the details of the proposed piping for the water supply suction main and also the pipes and drains for the pump house addition, also outside storm water pipe connection and the outside sewer connection for the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School at Lebret, Saskatchewan.\n\nThe general plan shows the addition authorized to the school to house the pumping plant and auxiliary equipment required in connection with the water supply. The plan also shows the proposed location of the 3\" suction main water supply pipe line from the pump house addition to the westerly limits of the school building. There is also shown the location of the proposed floor drain connection between the floor drain in the pump house addition and the main drain as shown on the several school plans in the boiler room. This drain is necessary to provide drainage for flushing the pump house floor and also to care for waste from the water softener which it is proposed to install.\n\nWe have shown the proposed location of a 2\" cast iron pipe leading from the chlorinator to its connection with the storm water drain at the south portion of the laundry. The rubber tubing to carry the waste from the chlorinator will be passed through this 2\" pipe as it is essential that the chlorine solution does not come in contact with any metal piping. The blue print also shows the proposed drains outside of the building to connect between the sewerage pipe in the school and the septic tank and also between the storm water pipe in the school and the outlet towards the creek.\n\nThis blue print also shows a profile of the water supply suction main from the pump room to a point beyond the westerly boundary of the school building. It will be observed that it has been necessary to keep this main at least seven feet underground to prevent trouble from frost. Another section shows the 2\" pipe for the chlorinator hose from the point where it leaves the chlorinator to its junction with the roof drainage pipe at the southerly side of the laundry portion of the buildings. This section shows the pipe with reference to the floor of the boiler room and laundry room floor.\n\nWe have recently had correspondence with Mr. H. Dawson, Supervising Architect, Lebret School, with reference to the location of the outlet drains as they leave the school building. Under date of February 16th, Mr. Dawson intimates that the present intention with regard to sewage disposal\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power and\nHydrometric Bureau,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6329, file 660-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nis to leave the building; with one branch in a southerly direction near the east end of the kitchen and another from the girls' washrooms at the south end of the building easterly to join with the former, then to the sewage plant as required. Such an arrangement offers no difficulties but I fail to see any great advantage to the contractor in having two separate outlets. It will probably be found just as economical for him to concentrate upon one outlet to join up with the sewage pipe line; the location of which will be as shown on the accompanying blue print.\n\nIt will be observed that the proposed pipe lines necessary for the water supply suction main and for the pump house addition drainage passes under certain outer walls of the school and accordingly it will be necessary that these lines be laid before the construction of the walls and partitions of the building are very far advanced. I would ask, therefore, that you take up this matter with the Department of Indian Affairs and ask for their approval of the proposed lay out or for their suggestions if it is considered that a more convenient layout is preferable. Furthermore, in order to cooperate fully with the general contractor of the school and to minimize the cost of the installation of the water supply and sewage disposal systems, it would be advisable to give consideration now to the question of who is to make the installation of the water and sewage disposal systems. Undoubtedly the general contractor of the school is in a position to do this in the most satisfactory and most economical manner as he has the equipment and materials on the ground and the work can proceed in close co-operation with the general progress of construction.\n\nOnly two copies of this print are being forwarded at the present time but if the layout is approved by the Department of Indian Affairs we would be pleased to forward additional copies of the plan and also to forward copies of the plan to Mr. Benson, Supervising Architect of the Lebret School, for his use and also for the use of the plumbing contractor at the school, who is anxious to learn definitely as to the location of the outlet drain for the storm drainage and also the outlet drain that leads to the septic tank.\n\nReferring to the last paragraph, Page 77 of the Specifications, you will note that it states that all drainage from the laundry and kitchen shall be connected to the roof drainage system. Inasmuch as it now becomes necessary to pass all drainage from laundry and kitchen through the septic tank and not directly to the lake drainage or roof drainage system, this line in the Specifications will have to be altered to read that all drainage from the laundry and kitchen shall be connected to the 6\" main sewer main.\n\nDetailed plans relating to the pump room, septic tank and disposal bed are now practically complete and will be forwarded within the course of a few days, together with a written report outlining the proposed scheme and also giving tentative estimates thereof. At the present time we are awaiting the detailed results of analysis of samples of the water from the Lebret Lake being obtained from the Saskatchewan Department of Health in order to determine the capacity of the water softener that will be required. The non arrival of this data has delayed considerably the forwarding of the report to Ottawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing District Chief Engineer.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The latter store would be enlarged, and the bath room reduced to a narrow lavatory with one wash basin and one toilet to be used by visitors, or persons in the adjacent bedrooms.\n\nNo additional fixtures would be required, and the re-arrangement of them would fit in with the plumbing on other floors. There would, however, be some extra terra-cotta flooring.\n\nI enclose blue print of a rough drawing showing the suggested change, and a letter from the contractors quoting an extra charge of $44.00 for the work.\n\nIt was also suggested that the wash basin in the basement staff toilet under the Indian Room be moved to the other side of the partition into the store room.

D. B. Gow,\nMarch 12, 1935. Acting District Chief Engineer.\nREPORT\nON\nPROPOSED WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM\nFOR\nQU'APPHELLE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nAT\nLEBRET, SASKATCHEWAN.\n\nINTRODUCTORY:\n\nThe site of the new Indian Residential School at Lebret is in close proximity to Lebret Lake, an expansion of the Qu'Appelle river and one of the chain of lakes known as Fishing Lakes. The valley of the Qu'Appelle is quite deep with rugged hills rising abruptly from the flats adjoining the river and river expansions.\n\nIn general, after the spring freshets have passed, the volume of flow in this river is small and during the present cycle of dry years the flow in late summer is negligible and the water in the small river expansions becomes stagnant. The water being mostly surface, run-off is not excessively hard, but is more or less contaminated and is not considered safe, untreated, for drinking and cooking purposes.\n\nThe old Indian Residential School, located on the same site as the new school, obtained its water supply from Lebret lake. The water supply for drinking and kitchen use was pumped from a well, situated under the building, while water for other purposes was pumped through a suction main extending out into the lake. The water supply in the well was undoubtedly seepage from the lake, but being more than 250 feet away from the lake, seepage was slow and the water supply from this source was rather limited. The water main from the lake provided an ample supply for sanitary purposes, but this water at times contains an excessive amount of organic matter and if utilized unfiltered would impair the efficiency of chlorinating and water softening equipment.\nsurface of which will be 2' - 0\" below the pump house floor, necessitating three steps of stairway. Two windows, one at either end are provided for; the minimum width of opening to be 4' - 4\" to permit of the entry of equipment if necessary.\n\nII. - Intake.\n\nIt is proposed that none of the water supply be taken directly from Lebret Lake, but that a well be sunk in close proximity to the high water mark and used as the intake. The soil is apparently sandy and should this sandy soil persist to a depth of 4 or 5 feet below low water level, there would be a steady flow of seepage into the well. The water would be freed from suspended matter, algae growth, etc., thus eliminating any necessity for the installation of a filter in the school.\n\nThe questions of definite location, size and type of construction of the intake have received consideration but final decision must await the results of tests that can only be carried out after the spring break-up. If at all possible it is desired to avoid the extension of the suction main out into the deep water of the lake.\n\nIII. - Suction Main.\n\nIt is recommended that the suction main between the pump and intake consist of 4\" galvanized pipe and fitted with 4\" foot valve in the intake. Pending final location of the intake, a definite location cannot be shown for the suction main, but Plate No. 3 shows the proposed location from the pump house to the west main wall of the building and this portion of the line must be at least 7' - 0\" under-\nground to prevent frost danger to that portion of the line not located under the school building.\n\nIV. - Pumping System.\n\nIt is noted that the school building, while of fire-proof construction, is to be fitted with stand-pipes and fire hose on every floor. Due to the type of construction, any fire that broke out would in all probability be confined to a limited area so that the measure of fire protection to be afforded can be limited to the water requirements of one line of fire hose.\n\nIt is proposed to install a 5,000 gallon per hour (wine measure) self-oiling typhoon pump mounted on the same frame and V-belt driven by a 7\u00bd H.P. motor. This pumping equipment will provide a measure of fire protection, probably sufficient for the fire-proof nature of the structure. A much smaller pump and motor would suffice for supplying the ordinary water requirements of the school.\n\nThe capacity of the pumping plant is more or less important because of difference in initial cost and also because of the cost of operation. At Lebret, I understand there is a substantial connected load charge for each horse-power installed in addition to the cost of power used.\n\nV. - Pressure Tank and Pressure System.\n\nThe pressure tank will be of the usual dimensions 4' - 0\" diameter and 16' long and designed to be operated at maximum allowable pressure of 100 pounds. It will be mounted on concrete saddles and be placed along the west wall of the pump house. A small motor driven air compressor will be installed to maintain an adequate air pressure within the\npressure tank which will ordinarily be operated within a pressure range of 40 and 60 pounds. The action of this air compressor will not be automatic but the water gauge to be installed on the pressure tank will indicate when operation of the air compressor is required. Automatic starting and stopping of the motor-driven water pump will be controlled by the installation of an automatic pressure switch. The usual safety devices will be installed to prevent excessive pressure in the pressure tank in the event of failure of the pressure switch or lack of proper superintendence.\n\nIt is intended that the ordinary water supply for the Institution will all pass through the pressure tank, but for fire protection we are proposing to provide an auxiliary 2\" pipe line from the discharge pipe between pump and tank to the standpipe system in the school; the pressure tank being by-passed by means of a gate valve. This will permit a continuous operation of the pump and a pressure of 100 pounds on the fire hose in case of fire.\n\nVI. - Chlorination.\n\nTests made of the water from Lebret lake reveals sufficient contamination to render it unsafe for human consumption, so that treatment becomes necessary. It is proposed, therefore, to install a semi-automatic type of chlorinating machine using chlorine gas. All water used in the school will, it is proposed, be chlorinated.\n\nConsideration has been given to the type of chlorinator to be installed and it is recommended that a Wallace and Tierman machine be installed. While\nthe initial cost of machines of this make are considerably greater than other types, yet the efficiency of their machines and the servicing of the machines after installation, are considerations that are very important in connection with Indian schools.\n\nThe chlorinator will be connected with the water system on the suction side of the water pump so that chlorination will proceed while the pump is in operation. The supply of chlorine to the chlorinator comes from a chlorine cylinder in which the chlorine is liquified by pressure. It is proposed to install on the outlet connection between cylinder and chlorinator, an automatic device, electrically operated whereby the supply of chlorine gas from the cylinder is shut off immediately the pump stops pumping. This automatic control of the chlorine feed is a decided improvement over the types of chlorinators this office has previously installed. In previous installations there is a continuous passage of chlorine gas from cylinder to chlorinator and when the water pump was not in operation this chlorine gas is wasted and provision must be made for supplying water to absorb it and to get rid of the resultant highly chlorinated liquid, since this liquid will quickly eat away any metal piping. Since the water pump is usually in operation only 10% of the time, there is a great wastage of chlorine.\n\nAs a precautionary measure, however, it is proposed to include in our estimates the cost of the laying of a 1\" C.I. pipe line from chlorinator to the storm water glazed pipe line beyond the south wall of the building. Through this 1\" line will be passed\na \u00bd\" rubber tubing to carry away any drainage from the chlorinator. Should further inquiry and information reveal that this precautionary measure is not required, then the pipe line need not be proceeded with.\n\nVII. - Water Softening.\n\nThe Provincial Laboratory of the Department of Public Health, Province of Saskatchewan, in reporting on a sample of water taken from Lebret Lake in February, stated that it was 29.4 grains hard, that it contained a high mineral salt content but was suitable for use as a drinking water.\n\nThis water cannot be considered a very hard water but the main constituents comprising these 29.4 grains of hardness are such as to cause very hard boiler scale and similar trouble to that experienced at the Birtle Indian Residential School where within two or three years the high pressure steam boiler and hot water heater were burned out. It is recommended, therefore, that a water softener be installed at this Institution.\n\nIt is suggested that softened water be limited to the following services in the building:\n\n1. Steam heating system,\n2. High pressure steam boiler system,\n3. Hot Water Supply boiler system,\n4. Limited supply of cold water to laundry and kitchen.\n\nIt is impossible to estimate accurately what will be the daily average use of water in this school for purposes which it is suggested that softened water be supplied. On laundry days the use of such might run as high as 3,000 gallons, while the average use...\nwill probably exceed 1,500 gallons. It is proposed, therefore, to install a water softener that will provide 1,000 gallons of water with zero hardness per hour and with at least 6,000 gallons between regenerations. The water softener should consist of a double unit, utilizing the Zeolite method of water softening.\n\nThe installation of a water softener will necessitate one change in the ordinary water supply piping in the school and some additional piping. The only change in the ordinary water supply piping in the school, as covered by the general contract, will be to connect the supply line to the boiler room to the water supply pipe from the water softener and not to the main 2\" water supply pipe from the pressure tank. The additional piping required is a 1\u00bd\" feed line from the supply main to the water softener, and a 1\" feed line from the water softener from which shall be taken the soft water supply to the boiler room and the auxiliary cold soft water supply to the kitchen and laundry.\n\nVIII. - Pump House Drainage.\n\nTo provide drainage from the pump house it is proposed to provide for a floor drain in the pump house and connect the same by means of a 3\" cast iron drain pipe to the drain in the boiler room. Drainage from the pump house will consist of leakage from the pump, occasional flushing of pressure tank, backwash from the water softener and floor flushing waste.\n\nProvision is also being made in the estimates for discharging possible drainage from the chlorinator through a \u00bd\" rubber tube within a 1\u00bd\" iron pipe line.\nfrom the chlorinator to the 6\" glazed tile storm water drain at the south wall of the school. The location of this proposed line is shown on Plate No. 3 that accompanies this report. This pipe line is to be laid without sharp bends except below the boiler room floor, at which bend a removable cover in the floor permits access to the sharp turn shown there.\n\nWaste from the chlorinator is highly chlorinated and will destroy metal piping rapidly so must be passed through rubber tubing, the piping being for protection only.\n\nESTIMATES OF COSTS:\n\nIn considering the estimates of costs submitted hereunder, it should be borne in mind that uncertainties exist as to location and nature of intake and the method by which the work is to be carried out. It is also realized that officials of the Department of Indian Affairs are able to give a more accurate estimate of the probable costs, due to their wider experience with equipment required in Indian schools. The estimates given below are based upon the assumption that the work is to be done by the general contractor for the school.\n\nEstimates of Cost.\n\nI - Intake.\n\nTesting ------------------------ 75.00\nWell Construction -------------- 300.00 $ 375.00\n\nII - Suction Main.\n\nExcavation and Backfilling --- 200.00\nPipe and Fittings --------------- 250.00\nLaying Pipe --------------------- 60.00 610.00\n\nIII - Pumping System.\n\nPumping Machinery -------------- 675.00\nInstallation --------------------- 125.00 800.00\n\nCarried Forward: --------------- $1,785.00\nEstimates of Cost (Continued)\n\nBrought Forward: ------------------ $1,785.00\n\nIV. - Pressure Tank and Pressure System.\n\nPressure Tank --------------- 400.00\nAir Compressor -------------- 120.00\nPressure Switch -------------- 10.00\nValves, Fittings etc. ------- 75.00\nInstallation ----------------- 125.00 740.00\n\nV. - Chlorination.\n\nChlorinator --------------- 1,250.00\n2 Chlorine Cylinders and deposit on same --------- 75.00\nAutomatic Control --------- 150.00\nInstallation --------------- 25.00 1,500.00\n\nVI. - Water Softening.\n\nWater Softener -------------- 600.00\nAdditional piping and fittings -------------- 60.00\nInstallation --------------- 60.00 720.00\n\nVII. - Pump House Drainage.\n\nOrdinary Drainage --------- 75.00\nChlorinator Drainage ------ 125.00 200.00\n\nVIII. - Pump House Addition. ------------------ 1,250.00\n\nContractors' Profit 10% -------------- $6,195.00\nSupervision & Contingencies 10% --------- 681.45\n\nTOTAL COST:--- $7,495.95\n\nD.

(FG 10, Volume 6329, file 660-5, part 4)\nREPORT ON PROPOSED SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM, FOR QU'APPELLE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, AT LEBRET, SASKATCHEWAN.\n\nINTRODUCTORY:\n\nThe sewage disposal system in use at the old Indian Residential School at Lebret consisted of septic tank and disposal bed. In recent years the disposal bed was enlarged and a pipe line was laid out into deep water to carry off the effluent, but there were many complaints about the ineffectiveness of the system. An examination of the site led to the conclusion that the septic tank was too small to meet the requirements of the new school and that the location of the disposal bed was not satisfactory. Accordingly, it was decided not to use any portion of the existing system in connection with the sewage disposal system for the new school, now under construction.\n\nThe new Indian School at Lebret has been designed to accommodate 250 children and a staff of approximately 25. The average daily use of water in the school, will it is estimated, be 5,000 gallons and the sewage disposal system as designed for this school and outlined below, is based upon the estimated use of water and the school population.\n\nSEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM:\n\nGeneral.\n\nThe general contract for the erection of the school provides for the complete drainage of the building, of all foul water and sewage and also for the collection and carrying of the storm water drainage to the outside of the building. This report, therefore, deals with the disposal of the sewage and storm water.\nfrom the points where the contractor leads the 6\" sewer and the 6\" drain pipe to the outer wall of the building. Lebret Lake and other expansions of the Qu'Appelle River below are now being used by summer campers and of necessity the sewage disposal and drainage systems at the new school must be such that there be no offensive discharge into Lebret Lake.\n\nAccordingly, there can be no discharge of kitchen and laundry waste directly into the lake; it must be passed through the sewage disposal system, undesirable as such a course must be. Since the roof drainage, pump room and boiler room drainage contain nothing of an offensive nature, it is proposed to pass such drainage more or less directly to the lake.\n\nThe sanitary system can be divided into the two following divisions:\n\n(a) Storm Water and Boiler Room Drainage,\n(b) Sewage Disposal System.\n\nThese two divisions will be dealt with separately.\n\nStorm Water and Boiler Room Drainage:\n\nPlate No. 1 shows the proposed location of the drain pipe from the school to its outlet into the small creek to the south-east of the school. Plate No. 2 shows locations of auxiliary drains under the floor of the building, location of manhole, just outside the building and elevations of the storm water drain as it leaves the school. Plate No. 4 shows a detail of the manhole providing access to the connection between the 6\" C.I. drain pipe and the 6\" glazed drain pipe. The storm water drain from the school will be about 225 feet in length.\n\nThe storm water drain must also carry the\ncombined drainage from the pump room and the boiler room and also any drainage from the chlorinator.\n\nTo provide drainage from the pump room, a short length of drain is required to connect the floor drains in the pump house to the floor drains in the boiler room - location of this drain being shown on Plate No. 3.\n\nThere is a certain wastage of chlorine through the chlorinator and as even a very weak solution of chlorine may be very destructive of metal pipe, it may be necessary to lay a 1\u00bd\" cast iron pipe line from the chlorinator in the pump room to connect with the storm water drain at the manhole outside the building. A 2\" rubber tubing inserted within the 1\u00bd\" pipe line will carry the waste chlorine. Plate No. 3 shows the location of this auxiliary drain.\n\nSewage Disposal System.\n\nThe proposed sewage disposal system will consist of the usual septic tank and disposal bed. Plate No. 1 shows the location of the septic tank and disposal bed in relation to the school site. Plate No. 3 shows the profile of the proposed sewage disposal system with reference to school grade and the water level of Lebret Lake. A concrete manhole is shown a short distance from the school giving access to the connections between the cast iron drains and the glazed pipe lines carrying the sewage and the storm wastes. The provision of this manhole is suggested because of the possibility of the blocking of the sewer, either under the school building or between the building and the septic tank. This manhole will be made air tight to prevent escaping offensive odors so near an entrance to the building.\n\nThe design of the septic tank and disposal...\nbed of necessity, had to conform to the very limited difference in elevation between the outlet from the school and the high water level of Lebret Lake. Thus a shallow septic tank in rather close proximity to the school became necessary, with a fairly long connecting line to the disposal bed. It was desired to locate the disposal bed so that the completed surface would, insofar as possible, conform to the natural contour of the ground and also be away from tree growth.\n\nSeptic Tank.\n\nPlate No. 5 shows the general layout and details of the proposed septic tank. It consists of the usual settling and siphon chambers, constructed of reinforced concrete and with the baffle beams designed to support the roof and earth cover. Elevations, dimensions and reinforcing details are shown on Plate No. 5 so need not be specifically referred to here.\n\nA manhole provides access to the small chamber, 3' - 0\" x 3' - 6\" outside dimensions, into which the 6\" sewer discharges just prior to entering the septic tank. This small chamber is fitted with a coarse screen through which the sewage must pass before being discharged into the settling basin of the tank. The purpose of this screen is to prevent the passage into the tank of articles of clothing, boots, etc., and the manhole permits of access for periodic cleaning of this screen.\n\nThe settling basin is designed for a theoretical retention of 10,000 gallons for 24 hours or double the anticipated average daily water usage in the school. Access to the settling chamber for\nsludge removal purposes is provided by two manholes, one at either end of the chamber. The second manhole has been provided at the request of the Director of Sanitation, Department of Public Health of the Province of Saskatchewan, but it is in our opinion unnecessary since there is direct passage of air between the settling chamber and the manhole over the syphon chamber. From the intake or screen chamber the sewage will discharge through a 6\" pipe against a 2\" x 10\" plank, supported by stirrups from the plank cover; this plank acting as a disperser and aiding in distributing the sewage across the width of the tank.\n\nThe syphon chamber is to be fitted with one 5\" anthes syphon and is designed to discharge approximately 2,500 gallons twice every twenty-four hours. Access to this chamber is to be provided through a manhole located immediately above the syphon.\n\nFrom the syphon chamber the effluent is discharged through a 6\" glazed tile drain to the disposal bed. On the plan we have made provision for an air vent from this drain and also an overflow opening between the syphon chamber and this air vent.\n\nDisposal Bed.\n\nPlate No. 1 shows the proposed location of the disposal bed with reference to the school location, septic tank and the natural ground features. Plate No. 6 shows the general plan, sections and some details of the disposal bed. All elevations given are to the same datum as the school grade.\n\nThe disposal bed, as designed, is to be 200' x 128' and will contain 6,240 lineal feet of 4\" field tile or about 23 lineal feet for each inmate.\nof the school. The success or failure of the sewage disposal system at this Institution will depend very largely upon the efficiency of the disposal bed and the extent to which it prevents any direct passage of the effluent into Lebret Lake. The failure of disposal beds to function properly is usually due to unsuitable soil conditions, overloading and to careless laying of the distribution and feeder lines.\n\nAs will be noted from the detailed drawings, we have gone rather to the extreme in guarding against failure from such causes.\n\nOnly a casual examination has been made of the soil conditions at the proposed location of the disposal bed and the bed as designed is based upon the assumption that unfavourable conditions exist. Detailed examination of soil conditions may reveal more favourable conditions and permit of some modification in design that will tend to diminish the cost of construction.\n\nThe disposal bed will be entirely in excavation, as is shown by sections marked, A, B, C and D on Plate No. 6. Both the distribution line and feeder lines are to be laid perfectly level, the bottom elevation of the distributor line being 87.5 and the feeder line only slightly higher. The distribution line will connect directly with the discharge line from the septic tank and extends across the middle of the bed with Y connections every two feet alternately to the right and left to the 4\" feeder lines, as is shown on the detail drawing.\n\nIn preparation for the laying of the feeder line field tile, it is proposed to excavate trenches 18\" wide and 6\" deep, the bottom elevation of this trench\nto be 87.4. The field tile will be laid in this trench with bottom elevation approximately 87.6 and in a bed of crushed rock or washed gravel, completely filling the trench. The purpose of the crushed rock or gravel is for the dual purpose of preventing uneven settlement of the tile and to materially increase the distribution speed of the effluent from the distributor line. If the nature of the excavated material is found to be more porous than we anticipate, the width of this trench will be reduced to 12\". All joints between tile will be covered with tar paper to prevent entrance of soil into the tile. An 18\" layer of sandy clay or loam will comprise the upper portion of the bed - this material being hauled to the site if necessary. An air vent from the last feeder line will also be provided at the location shown on the plan.\n\nESTIMATES OF COST:\n\nConsideration has been given to the probable cost of the sewage disposal system outlined above. However, so many uncertainties enter into the construction of the disposal bed that the figures given below are subject to considerable error. Our estimates are based upon the assumption that the materials at hand are not suitable and more favourable conditions may be found upon examination, resulting in costs considerably below the estimates. The septic tank is considerably larger than those installed previously under our direction and the shallow type adds materially to the cost because of the reinforcing necessary.\n\nThe estimates given below are based upon the assumption that the work will be carried out by the general contractor for the school and in co-operation with the general contract. If any other arrangements\nare made a considerable increase in the estimates of costs should be made.\n\nEstimates of Costs.\n\nStorm Water Drain.\n\nExcavation and Backfilling,\n235' @ $1.00 ------------------------ $235.00\nManhole construction --------------- 75.00\n225' - 6\" glazed pipe -------------- 75.00\nHandling, Connecting & Laying ------ 25.00 $410.00\n\nSewage Line to Septic Tank.\n\nExcavation, 45 Lineal Feet,\nBackfilling -------------------------- 45.00\n90' glazed 6\" pipe ------------------ 36.00\nHandling, Connecting & Laying ------ 25.00 106.00\n\nSeptic Tank.\n\nExcavation, 230 cu. yds. @ .60y ----- 140.00\nReinforced Concrete, 55 yds. @ 25.00, 1925.00\n5\" Anthee Syphon --------------------- 40.00\nFittings & Installation of syphon ---- 80.00\nPlanking 2' x 1200' F.B.M. ---------- 50.00\nManholes, Material and Labor ------- 100.00\nAir Vent, Material and Labor -------- 40.00\nEarth Backfilling, levelling off, etc. 40.00 288.00\n\nPipe Line - Septic Tank to Disposal Bed.\n\nExcavation and Backfilling --------- 125.00\n6\" glazed pipe, 215 Lineal Feet ----- 88.00\nHandling, Connecting, etc. ----------- 28.00 235.00\n\nDisposal Bed.\n\nExcavation, 3000 cu.yds. @ 10y ----- 300.00\nExcavation, 250 cu.yds. @ 40y ------ 80.00\nCrushed Rock,150 cu.yds. @ 4.00 ---- 600.00\nSandy Clay & Boom ------------------ 1250.00\n625 cu.yds. @ 2.00 ----- 1250.00\n6\" glazed tile with 4\" Y's ------------ 78.00\n65 lengths @ 1.20 ------------------- 78.00\n6\" glazed 1/8 bends ------------------ 87.75\n6,500 Lineal Feet 4\" Field Tile, at 75\u00a2 ----------------- 487.50\nTar Paper ---------------------------- 5.00\nLaying Distributor & Feeder Lines --- 200.00\nSurfacing and Finishing --------------- 100.00 338.25\n\nTOTAL: .................. $6,446.25\nContractor Profit, 10% -------------- 644.62\nTOTAL COST:---------------------- $7,090.87\n\nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\nD.

I shall be glad, therefore, to be advised in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nEncl.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nMr. R.G. Orr,\nArchitect for Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Building,\nSparks Street,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of March 25th, re giving permission to use intermediate grade reinforcing steel for the Lebret Indian School. This job, as you know, was designed for hard grade steel and I do not think a change should be authorized. The tensile requirements for hard grade steel are much higher than for the intermediate grade, and, in my opinion, it is, by far, the best grade for building work.\n\nWhen the committee was writing the City of Toronto concrete building by-law, they seriously considered leaving out the intermediate grade entirely and it was only after strong representations had been made by the manufacturers that intermediate grade was inserted. This by-law gives intermediate grade a working stress of 18,000 lbs. per square inch, which is the same as structural grade (low carbon steel). Hard grade or rail steel bars are allowed a working stress of 20,000 lbs. per square inch.\n\nThere are a few building codes that give both intermediate grade and hard grade bars the same working stress of 20,000 lbs. per square inch. This, however, is not consistent with the tensile requirements of the two steels which are given in the same codes. These invariably recognize that hard grade steel is much better.\n\nIn the Lebret job, the change should not be permitted unless the area of steel in each beam, joist, slab or column is increased by at least 5%. This, in several instances, will crowd the steel in the member, i.e., the bars will be too close together to permit the concrete to pass between them satisfactorily and the bond between the concrete and the steel will be affected. This, of course, will weaken the member. It is possible that to overcome this crowding, the sub-contractor will place the steel in two layers. This should\n\nCONCRETE FOR PERMANENCE\nnot be permitted in any beam which has been designed with one layer of steel as this will seriously affect its strength. This condition can only be overcome by redesigning the member affected.\n\nIn view of all the foregoing factors, I would recommend that the sub-contractors be required to live up to the specifications. Hard grade steel is readily available in the West, but, as it is a better steel, it is naturally somewhat more expensive - about $2.00 per ton. This is probably the reason for asking for the change. You will note, however, that while this steel is about 5% more expensive, you use about 5% less. The sub-contractor in asking for permission to change undoubtedly figures on using the same tonnage which, of course, is to his advantage but to the disadvantage of the building.\n\nIf I can give you any further information on this subject, please do not hesitate to write me.\n\nI wish to acknowledge the receipt today, of a set of plans for the Qu'Appelle Hospital. I will get to work on these at once and will bring the plans, etc., down to Ottawa in about ten days. I trust this will be satisfactory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCANADA CEMENT COMPANY LIMITED\n\nper:\n\nRAO/R.\nMarch 29, 1935.\n\nMessrs.

Anderson's interview with you of the 15th instant.\n\nWe are offering for the Lebret Indian School an installation consisting of two (2) Vulcan Welded Steel Heating Boilers, complying with your specifications as to construction, capacity and size. These boilers will be built and tested to comply with the Canadian Interprovincial Regulations for the construction of Steam Boilers and Pressure Vessels (Saskatchewan approval and registration).\n\nAlso, two (2) \"Bros-Vulcan\" Screw Feed Stokers, size 500. This size is a little larger than required to develop the boiler rating called for in your specification. With the exception of the Motor and Fan Motor, which are of Canadian manufacture, the \"Bros-Vulcan\" Stoker is manufactured in our Winnipeg Plant. We guarantee that our Stoker will successfully burn Saskatchewan Lignite Coal, and will replace 'free of charge' any parts proving defective due to wear, faulty workmanship or material, during the first complete heating season.\n\nYou were informed by Mr. Anderson that a screw feed stoker of the size required for Lebret is now completed in our shop. It is being installed under a steel heating boiler for demonstration purposes.\nMr. R. Gurney Orr,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMarch 27th, 1935.\n\nPage No. 2.\n\nWe will advise you, by wire, as soon as this installation is in operation, and will be very pleased to have your representative call on us to examine the stoker under working conditions.\n\nThe pamphlet illustrating the \"Bros-Vulcan\" Stoker is now in the hands of our printer, copies will be mailed to you as soon as it is off the press. In the meantime we are mailing to you, under separate cover, a complete set of our catalogues on Boilers and Tanks, also prints illustrating some coal and ash handling equipment installed by us in recent years. In addition we manufacture and sell a vacuum steam jet Ash Conveyor.\n\nWe would like to take this opportunity of thanking you for the courtesy extended to our Mr. Anderson while in Ottawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nVULCAN IRON WORKS LIMITED,\n\nPer\n\nPresident.\nHN WINNIPEG MAN 1\n\nR GURNEY ORR\n\nDOMINION ARCHITECT DEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS BOOTH BLDG OTTAWA ONT\n\nSTOKER ERECTED UNDER BOILER IN OUR SHOP AS DISCUSSED BY THE WRITER WHEN IN OTTAWA STOP YOUR REPRESENTATIVE COULD INSPECT INSTALLATION UNDER OPERATING CONDITIONS AT YOUR CONVENIENCE\n\nVULCAN IRON WORKS LTD E ANDERSON.\n1371 Athol Street,\nRegina, Sask.\nMarch 28, 1925.\n\nMr. Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nQu'Appelle Indian School, Lebret\n\nI have to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, and note your approval of my suggestion as to the revised plan of main house addition, also that I may shortly expect to receive Mr. Ogw's completed plans of the sewage disposal and water lay-cut.\n\nI note your approval of the changes in the ground floor and basement staff toilets, and that drinking fountains are only required in the basement.

I advised the contractors on the 29th ultimo by telegram that the reinforcing steel was to be hard steel as specified, and that I could not approve of the change to intermediate grade. I thought it well to advise you and would ask that you take whatever steps you think necessary to be sure that the steel is of the grade specified.\n\nWith reference to the stokers I have approved of the screw feed stoker size 500 which is now being manufactured in Winnipeg by the Vulcan Iron Works. They guarantee this stoker to successfully burn Saskatchewan lignite coal, and will replace any parts proving defective due to wear, faulty workmanship or material during the first complete heating season. They have one of these stokers in their plant in Winnipeg and I have asked Mr. Gow to witness the tests that they are running on the stoker.\n\nI am sending you today under separate cover a copy of Mr. Gow's report on the water supply system and sewage disposal system for the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

They have been working on this for some time, and they have today advised me that they have one set up under a boiler at their plant, and are very anxious to have a representative of the Department see the same in operation. I would be very glad if you could arrange to see this stoker in operation, and let me have your comments.\n\nThere are two types of stokers available, that is the underfeed and the overfeed. From information that I have received I believe that the underfeed is the more satisfactory type for the Qu'Appelle School.\n\nI am taking the liberty of writing the Vulcan Iron Works today advising that you will get in touch with them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

The amount of the account herewith, $6.10, being deducted from this standing advance leaves an unexpended balance on hand of $43.90.\n\nMr. Gow's personal cheque in favour of the Receiver General for $43.90 is also enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nEncs.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nApril 8, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nThis will acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant with reference to the mechanical stoker to be supplied with the heating system at the Lebret School; the contract for which has been let to the Vulcan Iron Works of Winnipeg.\n\nOn the afternoon of April 6th, Mr. Ross of this office and the writer, visited the Vulcan Iron Works and saw a stoker somewhat similar to that to be installed at Lebret, in operation and also discussed the situation with Mr. Anderson, Sales Manager. As explained to us by Mr. Anderson, the situation is somewhat as follows:\n\nThe Vulcan Iron Works have received the order for the boilers and propose to equip these boilers with an underfeed mechanical stoker - the Canadian rights to which they have secured recently from an American concern. The Department of Indian Affairs have approved of the proposed type of mechanical stoker but have stipulated that it must be made in Canada. Accordingly, Mr. Anderson was concerned mostly in demonstrating that the mechanical stoker, or ones similar, are being made in the shops of the Vulcan Iron Works in Winnipeg.\n\nThey had an underfeed mechanical stoker set up in the plant supplying Souris coal to a boiler with capacity somewhat smaller than that of the boilers to be installed at Lebret. We were informed that the Souris coal appeared to be a somewhat better grade than was being utilized in their own heating system near by. The underfeed mechanical stoker appeared to operate very efficiently and both the stoker and the fan were being operated from the one motor, which was of 2 H.P. capacity. However, the motors to be installed in connection with the installation at Lebret will be 3 H.P.\n\nAs pointed out above, Mr. Anderson was rather insistent that we be satisfied that the Vulcan Iron Works were actually making these stokers in their own plants. Accordingly, we were taken around the various shops to see the making of the patterns, the casting of moulds and also the finished castings for parts of the stokers or ones of similar design. I am quite sure that your stipulation as to the origin of manufacture is being strictly adhered to.\n\nSaskatchewan lignite coal is now extensively used in Winnipeg for heating homes, apartment blocks, large\n\nR. G. Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\ninstitutions and etc. Some short time ago the Dominion Bridge Company installed several underfeed mechanical stokers in connection with the heating systems of several apartment blocks but these proved unsatisfactory when burning lignite coal. I am credibly informed that there are no underfeed mechanical stokers in operation in Winnipeg at the present time burning lignite coal satisfactorily. However, there are many overfeed stokers in operation giving highly efficient results with the same fuel. Probably the most efficient of these units is at the Agricultural College. It might be pointed out, however, that all these heating units appear to be of considerable more capacity than the boilers which it is proposed to install at Lebret. Mr. Anderson, when questioned on this subject, admitted that underfeed mechanical stokers in Winnipeg using lignite coal had proved unsatisfactory, but explained that much of the trouble was due to the use of improper grates.\n\nThe Vulcan Iron Works, as you state, have acquired the Canadian rights for the manufacture of both overfeed and underfeed mechanical stokers. It is their intention to recommend the underfeed stoker for small sized units and the overfeed stoker for units of large capacity. Mr. Anderson pointed out that the Vulcan Iron Works are guaranteeing satisfactory service from the underfeed mechanical stokers being supplied to Lebret for one year; that similar stokers are uniformly efficient in the northern part of Minnesota and Dakota in furnaces limited that they are far economical to operate, are quieter and require less attention than would the overfeed mechanical stoker.\n\nWith such a guarantee, it will be the responsibility of the Vulcan Iron Works if satisfactory service from the heating system is not secured at Lebret.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD. B. Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nR. Gurney Orr,\nDominion Architect Dept. of Indian Affairs, Booth Bldg.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nThe writer will be in Regina tomorrow calling on Contractors Lebet School.\nStop understand Mr. Gow's report was mailed to you Monday stop would appreciate it if you wire me at Saskatchewan Hotel your decision regarding stokers as per interview and our letter 27th ultimo.\n\nVulcan Iron Works, Ltd.,\nWinnipeg E.

Gurney Orr Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nQu'Appelle Indian School, Lebret, Sask.\n\nI beg to submit my third fortnightly report on the progress of construction at the above building as follows:\n\nDuring the week ending April 6th, three carloads of form lumber and scaffolding were delivered at the site, and on Monday the 8th inst., the contractors started a crew of carpenters and laborers on the job.\n\nProgress was delayed by a heavy snowstorm the following day. Ice had gathered on the concrete footings inside the wall forms which had to be removed by a steam jet before concrete work could be started. The forms were finally cleared and straightened and actual placing of concrete began on Monday 15th, continuing each day until the 20th, on which date the outside basement walls were completed all around the building except the fuel room.\n\nMeantime good progress was made with the construction of column and beam forms. Column forms were set in position around the north and west side of the main building, cols. 30 to 17 and the two rows of corridor columns from 22 to 30 and 34 to 41. The exterior beam forms were placed from col. 61 around the north end to col. 10 and all interior beam forms connecting the above-mentioned corridor columns.\n\nAll column steel was assembled ready for placing in basement columns except those in the chapel wing.\n\nReinforcing steel has been received for all of the ground floor slab, also shipment of miscellaneous iron for interior and fire escape stairs.\n\nI enclose test report of re-inforcing steel received from the Truscon Steel Company, stated to represent the shipment of steel for ground and first floors.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nH.

Dawson Esq.,\nSupervising Architect,\nLebret Indian School,\nLebret, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Lebret Indian School.\n\nWe submit the following items of changes to the Heating system for your consideration.\n\nWe will cover the hot water tank and heater with 1\" air cell block covering and an outside coat of asbestos cement, and the pipes between the heater and the tank with air cell pipe covering for the sum of One Hundred and Thirty Six Dollars ($136.00)\n\nWe will cover the High Pressure boiler in the same manner as the heating boiler for the sum of Twenty Six Dollars and Forty Cents ($26.40)\n\nWe will install extra heavy pipe in place of the standard pipe for the heating returns under the floor of basement for the sum of Thirty Three Dollars ($33.00)\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSMITH BROS. & WILSON LTD.\nper\n\nGeo. Johns,\nGeneral Superintendent.\n\nJ:L\nIndian School, Lebret,\nSask.\nApril 18, 1935.\n\nH. Gurney Orr Esq.\nArchitect.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nRe Qu'Appelle Indian School, Lebret, Sask.\n\nThere appears to be no asbestos covering specified for the hot water storage tank and heater, or for the high pressure laundry boiler, and in case you consider it advisable to have these covered, I have obtained estimates for these items.\n\nThe return heating pipes were placed under the basement floor, will be laid inside of 6\" drain tile, and standard iron pipe has been estimated for. For greater durability and to avoid early replacement, the contractors submit an estimate for substituting extra heavy pipe.\n\nI enclose herewith Smith Bros & Wilson's original quotation for these items in the following amounts:\n\nCovering hot water tank and heater. $125.00.\nHigh pressure boiler. $26.40\nExtra heavy return pipe. $32.00\n\nYour decision on the acceptance of these prices will be appreciated in due course.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.

Gurney Orr Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nRe: Qu'Appelle Indian School, Lebret, Sask.\n\nRegarding the construction of the north wall of the boiler room where it emerges above the roof slab of the fuel room, there seems to be a little disagreement between the general plans and the concrete details, on which I should like to have your interpretation.\n\nOn sheet No. 12 of concrete details, the plan shows the line of brick facing on east and west sides of the boiler room stopping short at the ends of the north wall, and the section of coal bunker shows the latter to be a 12\" reinforced concrete wall without any brick facing. This arrangement would show the brick 4\" wide at the ends of, and flush with the outer face of the concrete wall.\n\nThe right side elevation on sheet No. 6, however, shows this wall to be faced with brick from the top of the fuel room roof slab up to the coping. If this is done, it should be in addition to the 12\" concrete, making a total wall thickness of 16 inches.\n\nI am of opinion that the concrete wall should be 12\" thick as shown, to support the wide span of the boiler room roof but the contractors may claim an extra if the brick facing is added, as in its place does the wall show more than 12\" in thickness. I shall be glad to have your ruling on this matter as soon as convenient, as the stone coping will be affected for length, and the opening in the concrete wall for the north window of the boiler room also.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nH. Dawson,\nSupervising Architect, Lebret School.\nMay 1, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Dawson,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 18th with reference to the concrete wall in the boiler room, this wall should be 12 inches thick as shown and faced with brick to match up to other walls.\n\nWith reference to the asbestos covering for water storage tank, heater and high pressure boiler I do not think we will cover these at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. Gurney Orr.\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nHarold Dawson, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nc/o Qu'Appelle Indian Res. School,\nLebret, Sask.\nVulcan Iron Works Limited\nWinnipeg, Canada\n\nApril 15th, 1935.\n\nMr. R. Gurney Orr,\nDominion Architect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sirs\u2014\n\nWe understand that delivery of the boilers, for the above building, would be required about the middle of this month. As the writer had to go to Regina, he called on Messrs. Potts and Miller regarding the contract, and at the interview found that the General Contractor has changed his plans a little, and they do not want the boilers to go into the boiler-room until after the forms have been removed, so delivery will not be required for at least another month.\n\nWe might say this was not known by us until after the writer's interview on April 11th, and we had already wired you as per attached copy.\n\nIn our discussion with Messrs. Potts and Miller regarding this installation, they pointed out that as the school was in such an isolated position there might be times in the winter when, due to storms, the power supply would be cut off and this would count as an objection against the underfeed stoker. We believe the point raised merits consideration, but the question of power supply is an important factor with an overfeed installation which requires two motors for each boiler; one to drive the stoker and one to furnish forced draft under the grates. If the current was shut off, a small fire could be carried on the grates but hardly sufficient for the requirements. As you are probably aware, non-sifting grates, of our own manufacture and those supplied by other firms such as the Hulson and the Pyramid types, only have about 20 percent air space as compared with 45 to 50 percent on grates burning fuel with natural draft, so if the forced draft supply under the grates is cut off there will be very little coal burned.\nMr. R. Gurney Orr,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nApril 15th, 1935.\n\nRe: Lebret Indian School.\n\nPage No.2\n\nIt was also mentioned that, if the Department carried a supply of wood, it would be easier to burn wood than coal if an emergency, as mentioned above, had to be taken care of. It is, however, our belief that a safer arrangement would be to provide the stoker with an additional \"V\" belt and in case the power was shut off the stoker could be driven with an auxiliary gasoline engine. We would be glad to furnish the complete drive, including the two pulleys and the \"V\" belt, if this arrangement meets with your approval, and is considered necessary.\n\nWe enclose two blueprints of the boiler room layout, together with the specifications of the boiler and stoker equipment and two copies of our catalogues illustrating the stoker. Will you please examine these and return one copy to us, approved or corrected.\n\nIn connection with the controls we may say that we are supplying a combination unit, pressure control and low water cut off. The pressure control being called for in your specification, but the low water cut off is being supplied in place of a draft control. This type of control is usually furnished in the case of hand fired installations, but does not appear necessary in the case of a stoker fired unit.\n\nWhile shipment of the boilers will not be required for another month, as stated above, we would like to ship the stokers with the boilers, so as to save freight. This does not leave us any too much time to complete the stokers and we would therefore like to have your approval as promptly as possible.\n\nIf any changes are found necessary would you kindly advise us by wire, which would save at least a couple of days.\n\nTrusting the blueprints and specifications will meet with your approval, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nVULCAN IRON WORKS LIMITED,\nPer\n\nP.S.

This will be very inconvenient; the Senior boys will have to use the same entrance as the Junior boys and pass through their playground while coming to and from their own playroom. It will be very confusing especially to the Sisters in charge of the Junior boys, and it will be difficult to entirely prevent the older ones from jesting the small ones, which means that much of the good results of having them separated will be lost.\n\nThere are also several picnics on the school grounds during the summer, I might mention the Civil Servants annual picnic in particular. The men will use the senior boys' playroom for a dressing room when going for a bath in the lake, (this is a privilege we have always given them) and they will also use the boys' toilets. This will be very disturbing to the small boys and a great inconvenience to the Sisters in charge if they have to go through the small boys' playground on the East side of said building to reach the lake. The same would be true of visiting hockey and baseball teams who would use the senior boys' playroom as a dressing room.\n\nI am asking you as a special favor to have a door put in the North side of the Senior boys' recreation room, or in the East end of the building. I regret that I did not mention the above reasons at the time of your visit when the plans were discussed, as they did not occur to me at that time. If your objection was on account of the extra expense I would be willing to pay the extra cost out of our per capita grant, as I do not think it would amount to very much.\n\nTrusting you will give this your favorable consideration, an early reply will greatly oblige me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nR.G.Crr, Architect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nGL/FE\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gurney Orr Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nQu'Appelle Indian Residential School, Lebret.\n\nI beg to submit my fourth fortnightly report on the construction of the above building for the period ending May 4th, as follows:\n\nBasement wall forms have been stripped and damp-proofing applied all around the building.\n\nConcrete work was placed in all columns and beams and on ground floor slab of main building, and formwork constructed for columns, beams and part of slab of kitchen and laundry wing.\n\nFuel room walls and roof slab have been placed, and preparation made for the addition of the pump room, according to the revised plans approved by yourself and Mr. D.B. Gow.\n\nSome other forms were removed from under ground floor slab at the north end of the building, and the soffits smoothed and cement filled where required.\n\nWork was interrupted on Wednesday and Thursday May 1st, 2nd, by wet weather.\n\nColumn and beam forms were being made up for the first floor and are now well ahead of job requirements.\n\nA certain amount of work has been done in pulling down old rubble walls along the west front of the building down to foundation level, and backfilling, this being done to keep the labourers employed when not needed on other parts of the work.\n\nThe use of removable steel pan forms appears to involve a good deal of extra carpenters' work and other labour necessary to make a slightly job of the exposed concrete, and together with the rental and freight charges to and from distant shipping points, seems to offset largely the saving effected on lath, plastering, and permanent steel pan forms.\n\nI mention this in case you are contemplating their use on any other work under your control.\n\nEnclosed please find two photos taken on April 20 and two taken on the 4th inst: indicating to some extent the progress made. A complete view of the building in one picture is hardly possible at present, owing to surrounding obstructions.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nH.

Also the exact power required is not stated. In figuring this quotation, we allowed for a total of 12 H.P. single phase. In checking up with the heating contractor and looking at the laundry motor at the school, we find that the total is 19 H.P. We are advised by the Montreal Engineering Company who operate the power line that for this amount of power 3 phase is to be provided.\n\nTo make the necessary changes we have prepared an estimate as follows:\n\nIncrease in size of power service and sub-feeders to allow for 19 H.P. in place of 12, Forty-two Dollars and Thirty-five Cents, $42.35\n\nProviding 3 phase instead of single phase for power circuits requiring 3 pole switches and a separate power service into the building, Fifty-five Dollars and Forty-five Cents, $55.45\n\n$97.80\n\nThe following is a list of motors provided for:\n1 - 10 H.P. for Laundry (this motor, switch and starter are now at the school.)\n1 - 2 H.P. for refrigerator compressor.\n1 - 2 H.P. circulation pump.\n2 - 3 H.P. stokes and blower motors.\n3 phase, 60 cycle, 220 volts.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSUN ELECTRICAL COMPANY LIMITED,\nper (Signed) J.

Gurney Orr, Esq.\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:-\n\nQu'Appelle Indian School,\nLebret, Sask.,\n\nI beg to submit my fifth fortnightly report on the progress of the above building for the period ending May 18th.\n\nThe holiday on May 6th was followed by two days of wet weather leaving only three working days during that week, with the exception of this interruption, good weather has continued throughout the period.\n\nThe whole of the concrete for ground floor and roof of boiler room has been placed and the steel pans removed from under.\n\nFormwork was erected for the greater part of first floor of main building and concrete work done for the first floor slab over the boys class rooms, finishing to the boys stairway at 3:40 p.m. on the 13th.\n\nThe two stairways and front entrance steps have been concreted with steel safety nosings fixed at the time of pouring. The formwork for these stairs is now completed up to the first floor level.\n\nThe Electricians have followed up the formwork with their conduits and outlet boxes placed in position also plumbers and steamfitters have located sleeves for pipes prior to concrete work being done.\n\nBackfilling and grading to the south end of the building have been done as far as possible.\n\nThe column and beam forms to support the second floor slab are practically all ready for erection.\nRegarding electrical requirements, the Montreal Engineering Company intend to service the building with three (3) phase power, and it will be necessary to provide facilities for its use. I enclose herewith copies of two letters from the Sun Electrical Company to Messrs Smith Bros & Wilson, Ltd., relating to this matter, and advising that the extra cost of providing for three (3) phase current instead of single phase specified will be as follows:\n\n(1) Increased size of power service to 19 h.p. $42.55\n(2) Providing three (3) phase power instead of single. $55.45\n(3) Providing three (3) phase service and switch for Pump house equipment $123.60\n\nAs the electricians wish to complete their order for material on this work as soon as possible, I should be very glad if you will confirm this expenditure at your early convenience.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nH.

Kindly keep the cost of the additional brick work separate in order that consideration may be given to it as an extra.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nSmith Bros. and Wilson,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (FG 1C, Volume 6329, file 660-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nR. Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Lebret Indian School.\n\nSome time ago the question of the construction of the North wall of the Boiler Room was discussed between Mr. Dawson and ourselves. At that date we were agreed that the section of the wall on Sheet 12, also the plan of the walls on Sheet 12 being the only plan and section covering this item of work, clearly shows the wall to be concrete with the Veneer on the side walls finishing at the North corners. In fact, when estimating this job we took exactly the same view of the matter and figured this wall as concrete only.\n\nWe have now received a letter from Mr. Dawson with copy of your letter of May 1st in which you state: \"This wall should be 12 inches thick as shown and faced with Brick, etc.\"\n\nThis wall is now 12\" thick of concrete and adjacent to it is the Coal Room showing 4 feet above Grade in concrete, and the Pump Room showing approximately 8 feet above Grade in concrete.\n\nThis North wall is also facing on the Coal Storage Roof and close to the coal delivery holes, where there is liable to be considerable dirt and dust.\n\nWe had arranged for a chase in the North wall so that the Face Brick would return 13\" around the corner to make a bond and obviate a straight joint between the brick and concrete.\n\nShould a further 4\" Face Brick be required, it would have to be carried on the slab over the Fuel Room, and would have 17\" wall above and 12\" wall below the slab.\nR. Gurney Orr, Esq.\n\nWe believe the intentions of the Drawing Sheet #12 will be fulfilled and a good job be made by having 12\" Concrete wall with the veneer returned around the corner 13\", and we respectfully ask for your reconsideration of this question.\n\nShould you still require the wall to be 12\" Concrete and 4\" Face Brick, we trust you will see the justice of an extra to cover the cost of the additional thickness of wall involved.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSMITH BROS. & WILSON, LTD.,\nper\n\nGeo. Johns,\nGeneral Superintendent.\n\nJ/B.\nMay 10th, 1935.\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nPumps & Softeners Limited, Manufacturers of pumping equipment and water softeners, London, Ontario, are anxious to submit quotations on the water supply system for the Indian Residential School at LeBreton, and for the proposed hospital at Fort Qu'Appelle.\n\nIf the installation of these systems is not included in the general contract, but is undertaken by the Department, please see that the firm I have mentioned is given an opportunity to submit quotations.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nH. Dawson Esq.,\nSupervising Architect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nLebret, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Lebret Indian School.\n\nWe have examined the drawings as outlined in your letter of May 24th reference drainage work for the above job and we propose to install the End Manhole as suggested in your letter and 6\" Rainwater to the Coulee as shown on drawing and at the same time put in the 6\" Domestic up to Manhole No. 2, so we quote:-\n\nComplete installation of Rainwater drain and Chlorinator drain (except rubber tubing) and hand hole with cover and frame on Chlorinator drain line. Floor drain in Tank Room, connect Rainwater and Domestic sewer to Manhole No.1 and carry Rainwater only to Manhole No.2 complete with two Manholes as shown on drawings and carry Rainwater from Manhole No.2 to the Coulee for the sum of $652.00.\n\nWe have figured on Manhole No.1 as shown 2'6\" x 4'0\" inside but on account of the bend we have figured Manhole No.2 to be 3'6\" x 4'0\" inside.\n\nWe advise while the trench is open that Domestic Sewer be carried from Manhole No.1 to Manhole No.2 approximately 70 lineal feet and if done at the same time the extra cost would be $55.00\n\nWe further suggest for your consideration that the top set of Plank covers be omitted and a 6\" Reinforced Concrete Slab be used with Cast Iron Cover and Frame. The lower set of planks would still be used for frost protection. The additional cost would be $17.00 per Manhole or a total of $34.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSMITH BROS. & WILSON LTD.\n\nper\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gurney Orr Esq.\nArchitect.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nQu'Appelle Indian Residential School,\nLebret, Sask.\n\nAs the plumbers are now working on the drainage system within the building, it seems desirable that the rainwater drains be completed according to Mr. Gow's plan, in order to get rid of the storm water during general construction.\n\nI have therefore handed Mr. Gow's drawings Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 to the contractors to enable them to give a quotation on this part of the work, which quotation is enclosed herewith.\n\nNo. 1 manhole referred to in the quotation is that shown on the above-mentioned drawings, and No. 2 manhole is an additional one, which I suggest as being necessary at the junction of the main sewer, and one which will leave the building in an easterly direction from the girls' basement washrooms.\n\nIf you agree with me that this work should be done at the same time as the drainage included in the general contract, I shall be glad if you will confirm the quotation at your early convenience. The prices quoted appear to be reasonable.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nH.

Gurney Orr, Esq.\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nQu'Appelle Indian Residential School,\nLebret, Sask.\n\nI am favoured with your letter of the 15th inst., authorising the construction of a direct outside entrance to the Senior Boys' playroom, and have given the necessary instructions to the contractors.\n\nReferring to a proposal to install a second W.C. next to the night toilet in the Boys' Dormitory, on which an estimate was submitted to you with my letter of December 12th last, and not approved, The Rev. Father Leonard has put forward an alternate suggestion, which he and the Rev Sister Superior would like to have carried out.\n\nThey would dispense with the toilet room on the ground floor next to the store adjoining girls' stairway substituting a bedroom with basin only, and leaving the store room as originally shown on your plans. The W.C. fixture intended for this location could then be used in the Boys' Dormitory and enclosed with steel door and partition. As this dormitory, being occupied by the smallest boys would be in charge of a sister, and not of male supervisors, a private W.C. is considered to be necessary.\n\nThe cost of this change would be $36.50 instead of $106.00 as quoted in item four (4) of Smith Bros. & Wilsons' letter of December 12th.

Replyng to your letter of the 23rd with reference to the direct outside entrance to the Senior Boys' play room and the proposal to install another W.C. next to the night toilet in the boys' dormitory, I beg to say that the changes suggested in your letter are approved.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

B. Gow, of the Dominion Water Power Branch, Winnipeg, was asked to make a survey and report with recommendations for the proposed systems.\n\nThis report has been received, and it is recommended that the water for this building be taken from the Lebret Lake by means of a well sunk in near proximity to the high water mark of the Lake. The water will seep through from the lake to the well and from this it can be pumped to the school. The installation of this system includes a pump house, intake, suction main, pumping system, pressure tank and pressure system chlorination and water softening. Mr. Gow's estimate of the cost is $7,495.25.\n\nThe sewage disposal system will consist of the usual septic tank and disposal bed. The design of the septic tank and disposal bed of necessity has to conform to the very limited difference in elevation between the outlet from the school and the high water level of the Lake. Thus a shallow septic tank in close proximity to the school becomes necessary. The system as designed has the approval of the Director of Sanitation of the Department of Public Health of the Province of Saskatchewan. The estimated cost is $7,046.00.\n\nMr. Gow states that these estimates are based upon the assumption that the work will be entrusted to Smith Bros. and Wilson, General Contractors for the school. If any other arrangements are made a considerable increase in the estimate of the cost should be made.\n\nWill you please advise if Mr. Gow may be instructed to have this work carried out by the Contractors for the school?\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nR. Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Lebret Indian School.\n\nSince the receipt of your letter of March 13th in reference to Brick for Staircase Walls, we have been trying the various brick manufacturers in the West to see what could be done to get a buff Pressed Brick.\n\nAs we stated in previous letters, we know of no company in Western Canada making a brick to entirely meet the strict interpretation of the specification. We have, however, decided to submit for your approval a Dominion Fire Brick Company Face Brick which is Buff in color and has a fine rag face.\n\nThis brick is similar to those used by us on the new C. N. R. Hotel at Saskatoon, except that the color is of a lighter shade, and it is a very durable brick.\n\nWe previously mentioned that we were influenced in our price on these brick by the fact that the outside face brick were to cost $25.00 per M., and expected to be able to get approval of a brick within this price range for the Staircase Walls. However, the time is getting close to when we shall require the brick, and we are offering an expensive sample brick for this work in the hope that the matter can be disposed of.\n\nThe Dominion Fire Brick & Clay Products Limited will not make this brick in a smooth face. We will appreciate an early reply, as brick work will be starting next week and this work should follow up with the rest of the job.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSMITH BROS. & WILSON, LTD.,\nper Geo.

CL.\nJabreht, Saskatchewan\n\nOur Winnipeg Office have forwarded us a copy of your letter of May 8th, together with copy of a letter from Hessner, Smith Brothers and Wilson, dated April 30th, to Hessner, Potts & Miller, having reference to the WINTER Specialties for the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, at Lebret, Saskatchewan, and note quotation from letter received from Mr. H. Benson, Supervising Architect.\n\nWe guarantee, provided the WINTER Specialties for which we have the order, are installed, to circulate steam thoroughly through every radiator without noise. The vacuum pump, accumulator tank, control valves, and necessary electric equipment, radiator and drip traps, packless radiator valves, shall be of our manufacture and we guarantee that this equipment is capable of being able to circulate steam through every radiator with a vacuum of 4\" of mercury in steam mains, and a pressure difference of 1/4 to 4\" of mercury between steam and return piping. (The pressure difference between the steam and return piping will vary between 1/4\" and 4\" of mercury, depending upon the heating requirements in the building, due to the outside temperature.) We shall agree to check the heating plant to satisfy ourselves that our product can function as required, and shall be prepared to give the necessary service and supervision to the contractor to ensure proper installation of our product, and shall assist in making a final test of the system.\n\nWe would point out that paragraph 60 on pages 97 and 98 of the specification to which Mr. Benson refers, is written around the DUNHAM Differential System, which operates on 20\" of vacuum, and in order to obtain the economy with the DUNHAM Differential System, this vacuum is necessary. With our system it is not necessary, as the method that we employ is different from the Dunham. They increase their vacuum in order to reduce the temperature in the radiators. We reduce the quantity of steam supplied to the radiators, to obtain equally efficient results. The system that we are offering is the type of system that is accepted generally as the equivalent of the system offered by the Dunham Company. The Dominion Public Works Department and other Departments of the Dominion Government are accepting the system that we are offering as the equivalent of the Dunham sub-atmospheric system.\n\nSince we received your letter, we have interviewed Mr. R. Gurney Orr, the architect for the Department of Indian Affairs, and he has assured\nDear Sirs:\n\nAs that it is not the intention of this specification to confine the apparatus to that of one manufacturer. Any equipment that will produce equivalent results and economy to that specified will be acceptable to him, and that is exactly what the system we are offering will do, and we have no hesitation whatever in guaranteeing this.\n\nTrusting that this will give you the information that is required, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBAULING MACHINES LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nCC.

Dawson, Supervising Architect,\n1371 Athol Street,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe plans and specifications for the Heating System on the above job called for a Differential System of Heating. The guarantee called for and asked for by the Department is for a system to circulate steam and operate under a vacuum of 20\" in steam mains and a pressure differential of 1\" between steam and return mains, and that the manufacturers shall give the necessary service to see that proper installation is made by the Contractors, and that the system operates as called for. When we were advised that Potts & Miller had secured the contract, we at once got in touch with them.\n\nThis was in November 1934. We received a letter from Potts & Miller November 16, in which they stated that they had not used our price for material on this job. November 29, they wrote that the material they figured on was accepted by the Department, and that they had seen this information in writing.\n\nOn April 2, 1935, Potts & Miller wrote stating that Smith Bros. and Wilson had not made any request to the Department for change in type of heating system specified, but had a letter from Darling Bros., Montreal, stating that they had interviewed the Department, and had been advised that their material would be accepted. In the same letter they state that on March 8, 1935, they requested through Smith Bros & Wilson approval of the Webster Equipment, and received a reply that was satisfactory to them.\n\nOur Company have had this matter up with Mr. Gurney Orr, who suggested that we write you fully and give you all particulars. You in turn would take the matter up with the Contractors.\n\nMr. Orr tells us that he has not yet received any request from the Heating Contractors for any change in the type of system as called for in the plans and specifications. Mr. Orr was called on by the\nMessrs Smith Bros & Wilson Limited.\n104-5 Donahue Building.\nRegina.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nre Qu'Appelle Indian School, Lebret.\n\nReplying to your letter of the 6th inst; when you submitted a list of Webster heating specialties for the approval of the Department, I am advised that the Department is prepared to accept specialties for the Webster system, providing the results obtained are in accordance with the specifications.\n\nYours truly\n\nH.

Gurney Orr Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nQu'Appelle Indian Residential School,\nLebret, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nOn March 6th I received from Smith Bros & Wilson a list of Webster Heating Specialties which their sub-contractors, Potts & Miller proposed to use at this building, and submitted it to you for approval with my letter of March 7th, to which you replied on March 13th, stating that the Department is prepared to accept Webster System material, provided the results are in accordance with the Specification.\n\nFor your information I enclose copies of the correspondence relating to this matter from that date, consisting of:\n\n(1) Letter from me to Smith Bros & Wilson, March 18, 1935\n(2) \" \" C.A.Dunham Co. to me, April 22\n(3) \" \" me to Smith Bros & Wilson, \" 26\n(4) \" \" Smith Bros & Wilson to me May 8\n(5) Copy Darling Bros Ltd. guarantee to Potts & Miller Ltd., referred to in (4) April 2\n(6) Copy Darling Bros Ltd. guarantee to Engineers & Plumbers Supply Co., Ltd., handed to me by Potts & Miller, and dated May 16\n(7) Letter from C.A.Dunham Co to me, May 29\n\nIn discussing with Potts & Miller the matter of a guarantee of economical and efficient performance of the Webster System, on receipt of your letter of March 18, they then assured me that there would be no doubt about such a guarantee being obtainable, and this assurance is supported by the Darling Bros letters of April 8th and May 16th.\n\nPotts & Miller stated that although the Specifications indicated a Dunham system, such not being mentioned by name, they had a right to conclude that other systems offering equal efficiency would not be ruled out. They informed me that the Dunham quotation to them was unreasonably high, on this job, compared with prices they had received on other occasions when Dunham's were competing with other specialties. They also stated that they had found renewal costs to be less with Webster goods than with Dunham's and that these facts influenced them in figuring for Webster goods in their estimate.\n\nAs Dunham's have admitted the authorship of the heating layout I wish to state emphatically that it may be an effective instrument of salesmanship, but it has given us a lot of trouble on the job. The position and size of most of the basement radiators have had to be changed, because many of them collided with the location of projecting wall columns which they had ignored.\n\nIndian Affairs. (EG 1C, Volume 6329, file 660-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n2.\n\nReturn pipes where shown on the walls below windows in the basement have to be fitted around the column projections with many elbows, tending to slow up the circulation; radiators are shown on upper floors where they would block up access to fire escape doors, and in one case there are three sets of risers and returns directly in front of one class room blackboard.\n\nFinally, I would say that a number of architects in Regina, who have the best interests of their clients at heart, no longer allow either Dunhams or any other maker of heating specialties to have a complete walk-over by adopting their special specifications, without at least considering competitive systems, (and I do not think that your own practice would be otherwise,) or without permitting alternative bids to be brought forward.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nH. Dawson,\nSupervising Architect, Lebret School.\n\nEnclosure.\nTo Winnipeg Office\n\nRe Lebret Indian School.\n\nWe have your letter of May 13th re the above with attached copy of letter from Smith Bros. & Wilson of date May 11th.\n\nThe whole trouble with this job appears to be that removable florestyle are being used for a purpose for which they were never intended. We gather that the joists these tiles are being used to form, are to be left exposed in the completed building.\n\nNow removable florestyle were never designed for use on finished work such as this. They are used on buildings of this nature only when a suspended ceiling is to be used below the joists, or on factory and loft buildings where a rough finish is quite good enough. On the Lebret school, wood forms should have been used and should have been figured on from the first, as these would produce the finish required.\n\nIn regard to the condition of the tiles shipped, we can assure you that these tiles were in excellent shape for the class of work for which they are generally used, and have no hesitation in saying that they were in better condition than the tiles generally supplied by ourselves and others for jobs in Eastern Canada. As these tiles were to be shipped to this west, we made a point of seeing that only first class tiles were shipped. The fault lies not with the tiles, but with the use to which they are being put\u2014a use for which they were never intended.\n\nHowever, in order to overcome the problem at this time, and to make these tiles produce a sufficiently satisfactory job, we suggest that the Contractor cover the tiles with tar paper or building paper after they are placed and before placing concrete. This will serve to smooth out uneven places at the joints and ribs, and by brushing up the concrete after stripping should give a satisfactorily finished job. We attach sketch showing our suggestion.\n\nWe trust this procedure will eliminate the trouble and produce the required finish without undue expense.\nMay 11th, 1935.\n\nMessrs. Truscon Steel Co. of Canada, Ltd.,\nRoom 912 Boyd Building,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nRe: Lebret Indian School.\n\nIn answer to your letter of May 1st and copy of letter from your Montreal Office.\n\nWe are using the layout as described in your blueprint and are taking plenty of costly trouble to get some reasonable looks to the job.\n\nHow we can make the corrugated ends of the tile nest together we don't know, because the tile are 3 feet long and our spans are all odd lengths requiring the tile to lap as much as 2 feet over the next.\n\nThese tile shipped to us are many of them a ghastly mess and haven't seen a die for many years; quite a number of the square end pans are still in the pile as delivered last fall and can be inspected. They will not all be required until we pour the Chapel roof.\n\nMr. Smith, Mr. Lord and the writer looked these tile over yesterday and for a rough warehouse job they could possibly just get by if there was no inspection, but for the type of building required and specified they are in very bad condition.\n\nWe are hammering out the worst kinks and trying to whip them into something like their true shape, but the result is far from fair, and the work will require a lot of patching before it looks like a job.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSMITH & ROSS & WILSON LTD.\n\nGeo.

These can be smoothed off to some extent by the use of a pneumatic tool, and the contractors have expressed their willingness to do their best in this way to reduce the irregularities.\n\nAnother objectionable feature is the discoloured appearance of the concrete caused by rust and oil stains off the florestyle.\n\nNo doubt this will bleach out to some extent as the concrete dries, but I fear there will be an unpleasant contrast between the exposed concrete ceilings and the white plastered walls, possibly involving the need of a sprayed finish of cement paint, Dureseal, or similar material.\n\nAll reinforcing steel has been delivered, all window frames, sash weights and a shipment of wall tile. Face brick is under\nshipment and I understand that the contractors intend to start brickwork about the 10th inst.\n\nThe steamfitter also states that the heating boilers will be here on the same date.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nH.

We gather that the joists these tyle are being used to form, are to be left exposed in the completed building.\n\nNow removable floretyle never were designed for use on finished work such as this. They are used on buildings of this nature only when a suspended ceiling is to be used below the joists, or on factory and loft buildings where a rough finish is quite good enough. On the Lebret school, wood forms should have been used and should have been figured on from the first, as these would produce the finish required.\n\nIn regard to the condition of the tyle shipped, we can assure you that these tyle were in excellent shape for the class of work for which they are generally used, and have no hesitation in saying that they were in better condition than the tyle generally supplied by ourselves and others for jobs in Eastern Canada. As these tyle were shipped to the\nwe made a point of seeing that only first class tile were shipped. The fault lies not with the tile, but with the use to which they are being put, or use for which they were never intended.\n\nHowever, in order to overcome the problem at this time, and to make these tiles produce a sufficiently satisfactory job, we suggest that the Contractor cover the tiles with tar paper or building paper after they are placed and before placing concrete. This will serve to smooth out the uneven places at the joints and ribs, and by bushing up the concrete after stripping should give a satisfactorily finished job. We attach sketch showing our suggestion.\n\nWe trust this procedure will eliminate the trouble and produce the required finish without undue expense.\"\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nR. B. Chrysler, Esq.,\n605 Northern Ontario Bldg.,\nBay and Adelaide Sts.,\nToronto, Ont.\nMr. R.G. Orr,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI regret very much that you are having trouble with the removable pans at the Qu'Appelle school job. This condition has arisen simply because the Truscon Steel Company have not lived up to the specifications nor to decent construction practice. You have undoubtedly noticed in Mr. John's letter where he says many pans were a \"ghastly mess\" and that they might possibly just get by for a rough warehouse job, \"if there was no inspection\".\n\nAs for the Truscon Steel Company's comment that these type were being used for a purpose for which they were never intended\" that is nothing but so many words. I would note that in 1927, the Truscon Steel Company provided pans for the Star Building in Toronto and their pans were refused on the job as being in disgraceful shape. They then put a metal mould on the job and straightened and trued the pans till they passed inspection. This resulted in a very presentable job which I would be glad to show you any time in Toronto. It has been my experience that the Truscon Steel Company will not do any straightening or truing up of pans unless they are forced to.\n\nI would like to mention one other job - The Robert Simpson Company's customers parking garage - built last year in Toronto. On this job the Pedlar People provided the pans and an exceptionally fine job was obtained. This can also be seen any time. The Pedlar People, through Mr. Dawson, a structural engineer of Toronto, submitted a price for supplying this same set of pans to Smith Bros. & Wilson. Had their tender been accepted, I am satisfied that none of this trouble would have developed as they always true their pans up after every job and so keep them in shape.\n\nAs to the solution of the trouble, I would suggest that Mr. Dawson refuse to let them use any more pans until they comply with the specifications, which distinctly state, under Metal Forms, paragraph 2, that - \"All metal forms shall be true to catalogue shape on delivery at the job and shall be oiled before using. They shall be accurately trued up on a metal mould, cleaned and oiled before re-use. No distorted or damaged metal forms shall be used on the work at any time.\"\n\nCONCRETE FOR PERMANENCE\nMr. R.G. Orr\n\nToronto, June 12th, 1935.\n\nIf this clause is lived up to, you will obtain a job you will be proud of.\n\nIn regard to oil and rust stains, would say that the latter would be entirely avoided if the pans were clean, as required by the specifications. I have never had any rust stains from pans on any job which I have done in the past, as rusty pans were not accepted. Oil stains will bleach out entirely if clean oil is used properly. Clean mineral oil should always be used and applied lightly. There should not be any free oil on the surface of the metal. The purpose of the oil, of course, is to prevent the concrete sticking to the metal and the thinnest film will do this and will cause no stain. If, however, a small pool of oil is left in a dent in a pan, the concrete will undoubtedly be stained and the stain will show for a considerable time.\n\nI think Smith Bros. & Wilson might have used more care in accepting bad pans last fall. They could have obtained a decent set or had the present set properly trued up during the Winter and so avoided all the present trouble.\n\nI would like to note, in conclusion, that this type of construction, i.e., no plastered ceiling, is not a freak or a new idea as the Truscon Steel Company imply, but is a fairly common procedure. I have already noted two examples in Toronto and there are many others in all parts of both Canada and the United States. In Boston, many schools have concrete joist ceilings, exposed where two-way joists were used. The pans in this case were square domes and it is much more difficult to get straight joists with this type than with the one-way type.\n\nThe whole question boils down to the fact, that to get a good job, good materials, good pans and good construction methods are necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCANADA CEMENT COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nper:\n\nRAG/R.\n\nIndian Affairs. (EG 1C, Volume 6329, file 660-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nJune 13, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Dawson,\n\nI have your report of June 6th with reference to the progress of the Qu'Appelle School, and am very much surprised that the Contractors accepted the pans for the concrete as supplied by the Truscon Steel Co.\n\nThe present trouble they are having arises from the fact that the Truscon Steel Company have not lived up to the specifications, which provide that \"all metal forms shall be true to catalogue shape on delivery at the job and shall be oiled before using. They shall be accurately trued up on a metal mould, cleaned and oiled before re-use. No distorted or damaged metal forms shall be used on the work at any time\".\n\nFrom inquiries I have made I have been advised that on one large building erected in Toronto the pans provided by the Truscon Steel Company were refused on account of being in a disgraceful shape. They then put in a metal mould on the job and straightened and trued up the pans until they passed inspection. The result was a very presentable job and quite satisfactory.\n\nWith reference to the oil and rust stains I would say that the latter would be entirely avoided if the pans were cleaned as required by the specifications. Oil stains will bleach out entirely if clean oil is used properly. Clean mineral oil should always be used and applied lightly. There should not be any free oil on the surface of the metal.\n\nIt would appear that Smith Bros. and Wilson should have used more care in accepting these pans, and they should be instructed that until they are properly trued up, in accordance with the specifications, they are not to be used further on the job, and this must be done to your entire satisfaction. This type of construction is in fairly common practice at the present time, and there are many examples in different parts of Canada with the open joists which have proven very economical and satisfactory. In order to get good results however it is absolutely necessary that good materials, good pans, and good construction methods be employed.\n\nHarold Dawson, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nQu'Appelle Indian Res. School,\nLebret, Sask.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\nJune 21, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have for attention your letter of the 18th instant with reference to the Qu'Appelle Indian School at Lebret and enclosing a copy of a letter from the Department of Indian Affairs relating to the same subject.\n\nReferring to the third paragraph of your letter, you state:\n\n\"The actual basis on which the work would be undertaken would be proven cost plus 10% and the written offer which you are to obtain from Smith Brothers and Wilson should contain an undertaking to carry out the work on that basis\".\n\nI would like to have it made quite clear whether or not the contractor is to be allowed 10% profit on the cost of the materials and equipment. Personally, I consider that the contractor is entitled to 10% profit on the cost of the building materials required but not on the cost of such equipment as Chlorinator, Chlorinator Cylinders, Automatic control for the chlorinator, Water Softener, Pressure Tank, Air Compressor, Pressure Switch and Pumping Machinery.\n\nWhile it is true in our estimates of cost submitted with the reports on the Proposed Water Supply and Sewage Disposal systems we figured 10% contractors' profit on such equipment, yet I believe the contractors' profit on such equipment should be limited to the cost of handling, installing and incidental fittings. The contractor is unable to purchase such equipment to better advantage than the Government and it is preferable that such equipment be ordered through the Government Purchasing Agents or others acting for them. It is only fair, however, that the contractor should be allowed 10% profit on the cost of all materials for the sewage disposal system.\n\nI would appreciate the Department's view on this subject at the earliest convenience. As soon as the above information is received, arrangements will be made to have the rain water drain laid out and also to have the contractor's estimate of the cost of the water supply and sewage disposal systems.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Gurney Orr Esq.\nArchitect.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nQu'Appelle Indian Residential School, Lebret.\n\nEnclosed please find a list of equipment in the old laundry building here, also three cuts of machines which the Sister Superior asked me to forward to you, and which she thinks would be necessary.\n\nThe old machinery is all belt-driven from the shafts enumerated in my list, and the power taken from the 10 h.p. motor. Whilst none of this equipment appears to have been in use since the former school building was burnt down, I am informed that it was in use up to that time.\n\nThe washer and the extractor appear to be in good condition.\n\nIn considering the equipping of the new laundry it would seem advisable to provide for individual motor drive for the several machines, in view of the high cost of electric service in this locality. If individual motors were used, it is likely that the present machines would need some alteration to adapt them for that purpose, and an inspection of them by a machinery expert would be advisable.\n\nWhen installing a large machine like the Two Roll Flat Work Ironer, it may be necessary to ship it in sections and assemble it inside the laundry as the net size of the laundry doorway opening is 4'-11\" x 6'-5\", allowing for 5'-0\" wide by 6'-6\" high doors. The height is restricted by the depth of the re-inforced concrete beam supporting the concrete roof slab.\n\nThe old ironer and drying racks are in need of some repairs, and the steam boiler would need re-tubing before it could be used, but, having a new steam boiler in the building, I apprehend that this old one would not be put into service.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nH.

Gurney Orr Esq.\nArchitect.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nQu'Appelle Indian Residential School,\nLebret, Sask.\n\nI beg to submit herewith my eighth fortnightly report on the progress of this building for the period ending Saturday June 29.\n\nOn Monday the 17th, six bricklayers started on the outside walls at the north end of the building, and this work has proceeded continuously throughout the period under review. Six more bricklayers were added to the crew on the 26th, and when work ceased at noon on the 29th, the outside walls had been raised to the ground floor level, all around the main building, except that part between the girls' entrance and the connecting passage to the kitchen wing. The north wall of the kitchen and scullery was also brought up to the same level.\n\nThe south section of the roof slab over the main building was placed on Wednesday the 16th, and concrete floor in the north end of the main basement, comprising boys' wash rooms and recreation rooms on the 22nd.\n\nThe concrete walls of extension for pump room were poured on the 25th, and the roof slab on the 26th. A first coat of bracc waterproofing was applied to the top of this slab on the 28th.\n\nThe plumbers completed their roughing-in below the basement floor from the centre to the south end of the main building, and the work was inspected when under smoke test on June 21st, by Mr. Halek, the Health Officer in this district for the Provincial Government. The work was passed, trenches filled in, and the south end of basement, comprising girls' wash rooms, recreation rooms and junior recreation room, levelled up in preparation for under-filling and concrete work.\n\nThe steamfitters have set the heating and high pressure boilers in place, steam mains and return lines in basement are fixed, except where the latter have to be placed under floor, and a number of steam risers roughly set in position from basement to first floor.\n\nElectricians are well ahead of the other trades, in regard to the placing of conduit, outlets and panel boxes.\n\nThree carloads of stone trim have been delivered, which are practically the complete requirements.\n\nSix carloads of face brick, four carloads of hollow tile, and three carloads of common brick have been delivered.\n\nThe sheet metal and roofing contractor has brought all\nthe metal-clad doors for the stairways, and the frames for the ventilating registers to the building.\n\nCement finishers are working on the concrete ceilings with air-compressor chiecls, and trowelling up where necessary, the rough joints left by removal of metal forms.\n\nNo time has been lost during this period by weather, which has, in a general way, been fine and summer-like.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nH. Benson,\nSupervising Architect, Lebret School.\nLebret, Sask.,\nJune 22nd, 1935.\n\nR. Gurney ORR, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nQu'Appelle Indian Residential School\nLebret, Sask.\n\nRegarding the rooms which are to have terrazzo floors there is some misunderstanding of the requirements on which I find it necessary to ask for your interpretation.\n\nThe notation headed \"Floor Finishes\" on Basement Plan, Sheet #3, calls for terrazzo in the Kitchen and Girls' Recreation Rooms, but makes no mention of the Scullery or Junior Recreation. The Contractors have apparently estimated on the basis of these two rooms having cement floors, but the Sister Superior informs me that she requested they should be terrazzo.\n\nWhen the contractors figured on the use of red quarry tile in the kitchen and scullery, I was under the impression that it was to replace terrazzo in both places, which caused me to agree with the suggestion of a terrazzo cove in place of the glazed brick cove specified, at a saving of $44.00 over glazed brick Terrazzo cove, combined with glazed brick and a cement floor, does not seem appropriate, and the difficulty might be met by providing terrazzo in the scullery which would then suitably match the kitchen in all respects. I shall be glad to know if you favour this idea.\n\nWhether the Junior Recreation Room should be terrazzo or cement finish is a matter of interpretation of the plans and specification, and under Clause 16, Page 9, your decision should rule.\n\nReferring to the cement floor finish, as specified on Page 19, the mixture called for is one part of Portland cement, two parts of fine aggregate, and two parts of pea gravel graded between \u00bc\" and 3/8\" in size, and not over 4\u00bd Imp. gallons of water per sack of cement.\nThis is a 1:4 proportion, whereas the C. E. S. A. standard specification recommends \"the mix shall not be leaner than 1 part Portland cement and 3 parts of aggregate,\" where the top surface is subject to wear. I call this to your attention because the contractors inform me that the mix you specify was used at Lestock School and was not very successful.\n\nThey wish to get the basement floors laid shortly, to allow bricklayers to erect tile partitions thereon, and for the same reason are anxious to know when the chlorinator drain, and suction pipe under the main building can be laid, in connection with the water supply system.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

It appears to me however, that being subject to the same usage as the stairways, which are specified to be faced with pressed brick, the entrances should be similarly treated.\n\nThis letter is to instruct you to have the entrances finished with face brick to match the stairways, the difference in cost to be adjusted, as compared with hollow tile and the plaster finish originally specified.\n\nYours truly\n\nH.

In connection with this interior brick facing, the notation on the Basement Plan, Sheet No. 3, shows the outside wall of the vestibule leading to the girls' stairway to be 4\" brick and 8\" tile.\n\nAs the vestibule walls will be subject to the same wear as the stairways, I think they should also be brick lined, and have issued instructions to the contractors to that effect. I enclose copy of my letter to them and trust that this will meet your\n\nIndian Affairs.

Dominion Day being a public holiday, there was no activity until Tuesday the 2nd inst. when the bricklayers crew was increased to twelve men, and four more were added on the 8th. This part of the work has progressed without interruption, the outside walls being carried up as uniformly as possible all around.\n\nThe stone copings of laundry parapet wall were set on the 11th and on the boiler room walls on the 12th. The chapel walls and Indian room were completed up to the roof beams. The boiler stack was carried up to the level of the chapel roof slab, and the walls of main building from ground floor up to first floor beams, around the north half of the building, and up to sill level for the remaining part of this floor, by the 13th inst.\n\nStonework of the main entrance was erected up to the arch springing, and the arch stones set in place.\n\nWindow frames were placed by the carpenters ready for the bricklayers to build in, all around the ground floor walls, where not built above sill level. They also set a number of rough bucks for door frames in the basement, and formed the wood roof over the laundry.\n\nNecessary steelwork of fire escapes has been built into place as the brickwork proceeded.\n\nConcrete floors have been laid in the basement of the main building, with the exception of a strip left out for excavation of water main trench, and cement topping has been laid thereon where other finishes are not needed.\n\nCement finishers have completed work on concrete ceilings of ground floor, and about fifty per cent of similar work done on the first floor ceiling, following up air chisel operators smoothing off rough places left by removal of forms.\n\nThe plasterer brought his equipment to the job on the 12th and a carload of hardwall plaster was delivered on the same date. A start on the plaster work will be made as soon as tile partition work in basement can be erected for him to work on, a car of 4\" tile having been delivered here today.\n\nMr. D.B.Gow visited the site on Wednesday and Thursday, 10th and 11th, staking out location of septic tank and disposal field, and making trial borings for location of intake, and of subsoil conditions on the disposal field. He had seen Messrs Smith Bros & Wilson in Regina, and, I understand, advised them that the\nwater and sewage disposal construction could be started on a percentage basis.\n\nHe also stated that I would be receiving instructions from Ottawa regarding this work, but up to this time I have had none.\n\nFurther to your letter of the 3rd. inst; I have obtained from Messrs Smith Bros & Wilson the enclosed quotation on providing terrazzo floors for the hallways and junior recreation room, and for the additional cost of enriching the finish on cement floors to a 1-2-5 ratio instead of the 1-2-2- ratio specified.\n\nThe prices quoted are\n\n(1) For richer cement mix. $650\n(2) For Terrazo in scullery $140\n(3) \" \" Junior Recreation $210\n\nThese prices appear reasonable, and I shall be glad to have your confirmation of them in due course.\n\nI am also favoured with your letter of the 9th. inst; enclosing copy of your communication to Stanley Brock Limited, regarding the laundry machinery. I hope their representative will visit the work soon, as a lay-out of the laundry equipment is necessary to enable us to provide for electrical connections, washer drainage, and grades in the floor finish, all of which are being held up for the time being.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nH.

Several borings were driven on the location of the proposed site of the disposal bed and a boring was also taken near the water's edge to determine whether or not water could be obtained in suitable quantities by means of a well.\n\nThe boring upon the well site was driven from elevation 89 as shown on the plans, to elevation 80 and it was determined that an ample supply of water could be obtained by means of a well to be driven from contour 93. Instructions will be forwarded to the Supervising Architect with respect to the location and type of well which is to be constructed.\n\nSeven borings taken on the site of the proposed disposal bed reveal soil conditions decidedly more favourable than was anticipated. In consequence it is considered that it will be necessary to use any other materials except those available on the site. It is not proposed to use crushed rock nor is it proposed to haul any sandy loam for the top covering as these materials are available at the location of the proposed site for the disposal bed.\n\nIt is quite probable that our estimate for the construction of the well will not be exceeded by the cost of actual construction, and our estimates for the construction of the disposal bed are considerably in excess of what it is anticipated the actual cost will now be. A little later we will forward you a plan showing the location of borings taken and also showing the nature of soil conditions as they were found to be.\n\nI might point out that we also took borings at the site of the proposed new hospital at Fort Qu'Appelle so as to be in a position to proceed with plans and estimates for the water supply and sewage disposal systems that will be required at that Institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. B. Gow,\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nActing District Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water Power and\nHydrometric Bureau,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the water supply and sewage disposal systems at the Qu'Appelle Indian school at Lebret, I enclose herewith copies of three letters from Mr. Gow which deal with various aspects of this work. Please note that Mr. Gow wishes action to be taken by the Department of Indian Affairs on two points as follows:\n\n1.

Gow, Esq.,\nActing District Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau,\n706 Commercial Building,\nWINNIPEG, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Your File No. 27716-M.\n\nIn answer to your letter of July 16th, 1935, reference Sewage and Water for Lebret Indian School.\n\nWe present the following estimated prices on Sewage:\n\n(1) Storm water drain and sewage line to septic tank. - Five Hundred and Thirty Dollars ($530.00).\n(2) Septic tank. - Nineteen Hundred and Fifteen Dollars, ($1,915.00).\n(3) Pipe line. - Septic tank to disposal bed. - Two Hundred Fifty-six Dollars and Fifty Cents ($256.50).\n(4) Disposal bed. - Three Thousand, One Hundred and Three Dollars ($3,103.00).\n\nand the following on Water Supply:\n\n(1) Well construction. - Four Hundred and Eighty-seven Dollars ($487.00).\n(2) Suction line - pump room to well. - Seven Hundred and Eighty-eight Dollars ($788.00).\n(3) Pump house drainage - Ordinary to chlorinator drain. One Hundred and Forty-eight Dollars ($148.00).\n(4) Pump house additions and alterations. - Nine Hundred and Two Dollars ($902.00).\n(5) Installation of pressure tank, pumping apparatus, electrical connections, chlorinator and water softener. - Six Hundred and Fourteen Dollars ($614.00).\n\nThe figures are net estimate cost, and require 10% added for gross estimate purposes. This will then total Nine Thousand, Six Hundred Thirty-nine Dollars and Eighty-five Cents ($9,639.85).\n\nWe should point out that the 4\" Suction line is figured only 180 lin. ft. from front of School building to well, or a total of 288 lin. ft. of Pipe Line.\n\nWe should further point out that in item 5 of Water supply we have figured on 3\" line from tank to main school supply. This was necessary, as the school supply had been changed to 3\" since contract was awarded, and when you order the tank, please arrange for 3\" connections.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Johns\",\n\nGeo. Johns,\nGeneral Superintendent.\n\nJ/B.\nJuly 24, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nAs requested in the third paragraph of your letter of June 18th - Your File 40782-W - I am enclosing herewith an estimate prepared by Smith Brothers and Wilson of the probable cost of the water supply and sewage disposal systems for the new Indian School at Lebret, insofar as such costs cover the work in which that firm is interested. You will note that the estimate does not cover the cost of the pump house equipment.\n\nI would point out that Smith Brothers and Wilson did not have access to the estimates or cost prepared by this office but they were requested to furnish their estimates for the different subdivisions so as to permit of a comparison with those estimates submitted from this office. You will note that in general the estimates of cost, as prepared by Smith Brothers and Wilson, do not vary greatly from those prepared in this office. One of the major differences was in connection with the cost of the pump house addition and alterations but this can be explained by the fact that the pump house addition was considerably modified after the date of the submission of our estimates.\n\nIn our opinion Smith Brothers and Wilson have estimated considerably too high for the cost of the disposal bed in view of the more favourable soil conditions which were ascertained by borings. I also consider that they have estimated rather highly on the cost of installing of pressure tank, pumping apparatus, electrical connections, chlorinator and water softener.\n\nWe have not yet received quotations from firms for the cost of the pump house equipment but are prepared to stand by the estimated cost as furnished in the report. Such being the case it would appear as if the original estimate of about $14,800, will be ample to carry out the work as contemplated.\n\nI would draw to your attention the last paragraph of Smith Brothers and Wilson's letter in which they state that all estimates are based on doing the work before frosty weather and that the work should be proceeded with at the earliest possible date. Furthermore, some of the equipment which is required for the pump room will take several weeks to deliver so that it is essential that we be furnished with\n\nJ. T.

Stonework at the centre of the west front was set up to the second floor.\n\nTile partitions have been erected in the basement of the main building, and about half of the gypsum block partitions on the ground floor, one car-load being used. This part of the work is now waiting a further shipment of blocks, en route from Winnipeg.\n\nCement floor finish has been laid in the south half of the main building on the ground floor, and in one class room at the north end.\n\nThe rain water drain has been completed from the building to the watercourse in accordance with Mr. D.B. Gow's plan, two manholes have been constructed and domestic sewer laid and covered from the building to a point near the location of the proposed septic tank.\n\nThe plasterers have been working on the basement walls and partitions of the main building, and the boys' washrooms and recreation rooms have received the finishing coat.\n\nAll the formwork up to the roof level has been taken down and air compressor operators have followed up with smoothing form joints and finishers patching the concrete as necessary.\n\nWall brackets and landing frames for the fire escapes were set and built in as the brickwork proceeded, up to the second floor level.\n\nMaterials for asphalt roofing are on the site, and all roof areas at lower levels than that of the main building are practically ready for the roofer to work on.\n\nPlumbers and steamfitters have continued roughing in for heating, drainage and water lines, and are now up to the second floor with the bulk of their risers and stacks.\nThe electrician has all wiring pulled for the ground floor lighting and a considerable part of the basement.\n\nNo delay has been experienced through bad weather, but it has been very hot and humid, with noon temperatures rising to 90 and 95 deg.

They also built the gypsum block partitions enclosing the sacristy, finished the ground floor partitions and about half the partitions on the first floor.\n\nThe plastering in the basement of the main building is almost completed, also the south half of the ground floor, and the north half about ready for the putty coat. No plastering has yet been done in the laundry, or the chapel, or above the ground floor.\n\nThe 4\" suction main having been installed where it passes under the building, that part of the basement which had been left open was filled in, watered, tamped, and the concrete floor laid so that the cement finish could be continued in the basement.\n\nCement finish has been completed on all the ground floor where called for, and in the first floor dormitories at the south end of the building.\n\nThe chlorinator drain and pump room floor drain have been installed, with the necessary access chambers in the former, and the trenches filled in, so that the kitchen and laundry floors can be laid and finished. Urinal fixtures have been placed in the boys' wash-rooms, and the floors made ready for the terrazzo finish. As these fixtures are located near one of the column footings it was found necessary to raise them on a step to avoid cutting into the footings for drain connections. An extra order has been given to the contractors for the additional concrete, and the terrazzo riser to match the terrazzo floor, to meet this condition.\n\nThe radiators have been delivered and the steamfitters have got some of them set in place in the basement.\n\nThe roofing contractor has laid and gravelled the roofs over the boiler room, chapel, laundry, Indian Room, south-east class room, sun room and rear entrances.\n\nThe carpenters have set grounds for blackboards in the class rooms, window frames and rough backs for walls and partitions in advance of the bricklayers and fitted and hung sash in all the basement windows.\n\nThe electricians have installed the heavy feed cables, switches, panels and control boxes where called for and are\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is included in dotted lines on the block plan shown on your drawing No. 2 and occupies a considerable area of what will be the girls' playground. It has been used as a dump for surplus material during the building operations and when the old walls were pulled down, the rubble was cast into it. Some of the earth from the septic tank and the disposal field can be hauled there, but more may have to be taken in. I estimate the cost to do this at approximately $250, if done before hard frost.\n\nThe statement enclosed does not take into consideration any of the work done on the sewage disposal and water supply project, the total cost of which Mr. Gow placed at $14,600.\n\nI trust that this will supply the needed information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

When this is received I will advise you immediately regarding the painting.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nHarold Dawson, Esq.,\nSupervising Architect,\nQu'Appelle School,\nLebret, Sask.\nIndian School, Lebret,\nSask. September 10-1936\n\nR.Gurney Orr Esq.\nArchitect.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nQu'Appelle Indian Residential School,\nLebret, Sask.\n\nRegarding the exposed concrete joists and ceilings here, the contractors have made an acceptable job of smoothing and trowelling with cement, but the lightness and general appearance would be much improved if these surfaces were given a white finish. This is particularly true of the chapel which is an important part of the institution, the staff rooms, and of some rooms in the basement, where the windows are a long distance from the opposite inside walls, and where an increased reflected light would be valuable.\n\nI have obtained from Smith Bros & Wilson the enclosed estimate for applying two coats of Brandram-Henderson Sun-Flex on all the concrete ceilings except that of the boiler room, amounting to $2,922.00. Whilst this seems a large amount, it is on the basis of the moderate price of 30\u00a2 per square yard of surface, and I believe the Department would be well advised to have the work done at the present time if possible, as it would give a permanent finish that would not need renewal or redecoration for several years.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you on this matter as soon as may be convenient.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nH. Dawson,\nSupervising Architect, Lebret School.\n\nEncl.\nHarold Dawson, Esq.,\nSupervising Architect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nLEBRET, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Lebret Indian School.\n\nWith reference to the removable pan ceilings.\n\nWe have gone into the painting of these ceilings with washable distemper, and we wish to quote you as follows:\n\nThoroughly clean off and prepare all surfaces and paint in two (2) coats of Sunflex, as made by Brandram-Henderson Ltd., and apply as per manufacturers' specifications\u2014scope of work to include all concrete ceilings throughout entire building (except boiler room ceilings). This work would cost the sum of Two Thousand Nine Hundred and Twenty-two Dollars ($2,922.00).\n\nWe think this work should be done, and it could be more readily done before all the painting and trim work is completed, and for this reason would much appreciate an early decision.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSMITH BROS. & WILSON, LTD.,\nper\n\nGeo. Johns,\nGeneral Superintendent.\n\nJ/B.\nIndian Industrial School,\nLebret, Sask.,\nSept. 14th, 1935.\n\nLetter # 10817.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI wish to draw your attention to the appearance of the ceilings of the new school, as I understand that there is no provision in the plans to have them painted at the present time. They are badly discolored from the rust of the pans, etc., and present an unsightly appearance not in keeping with the rest of the building. Even the cement, were it not discolored, would scarcely harmonize with the white walls.\n\nI would respectfully urge the necessity of having these painted before the building is completed, since it would cause considerable inconvenience to have it done after the school was occupied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nR.G.Orr, Architect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont..\n\nFB.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We purchased two units, and these have been working very satisfactorily.\n\nAs you know, our water is very hard. According to analysis it is a trifle harder than Regina water. By correct operation we are able to maintain a consistent degree of softening. We have had this system now for fifteen years and have found it very satisfactory, and functioning according to the manufacturers' guarantee.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. H.

The total of the account is $8,281.72.\n\nAs you are aware, this work was started on April 19th, 1935 and only recently completed. We presented a progress estimate on August 31st, 1935, together with a letter of explanation, but to date have not received any letter in reply.\n\nDue to the long time that we have carried these expenditures on this work, we would appreciate an early settlement of the account.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSMITH BROS. & WILSON, LTD.,\nper\n\"Geo.

Smith Brothers and Alison Limited, Regina, covering the cost of work done and materials supplied in connection with the installation of the water supply and sewage disposal systems at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School at Lebret, Saskatchewan.\n\nThere are also enclosed, in duplicate, copies of the letter from the Contractors submitting this statement to Mr. Dawson, Supervising Architect for the Department of Indian Affairs. Mr. Dawson's letter forwarding the statement to this office I would request that the three copies of the statement with the original signature of Mr. Dawson be forwarded to the Department of Indian Affairs together with one copy of the correspondence transmitting the statement.\n\nYou will note that the cost of the installation of the water supply and sewage disposal systems amounts to $8,248.85. The original estimated cost covering this work, as prepared in this office, was $10,472.37. However, at that time we assumed that very adverse conditions would be experienced in connection with the construction of the disposal bed. At a later date test borings taken revealed very favourable conditions and accordingly the cost of the disposal bed was greatly reduced. The estimated cost, as submitted in August by the Contractors, covering this work was $9,629.85 which statement was prepared after the results of borings had been given to them showing favourable conditions at the site of the disposal bed.\n\nI would draw to your attention the fact that while this work was carried out under the direction of this office, yet the supervision of the work of the Contractor was in charge of Mr. Dawson, Supervising Architect, and an employee of the Department of Indian Affairs. Consequently this office does not take any responsibility whatever for the account as submitted by Messrs. Smith Brothers and Alison Limited. Mr. Dawson, Supervising Architect, has approved of the statement of account as submitted. It is possible that the Department of Indian Affairs might request that this office procure its approval of the statement of account. If so it will be necessary for an official from this office to proceed to Regina and examine the time sheets, pay rolls, original invoices and cost data of the Contractors.\n\nI would suggest that the Department of Indian Affairs be asked to give immediate attention to the matter.\n\nJ.

Before signing same I would like to have your advice on this matter. Will you kindly advise me what you estimate the monthly cost will be. Do you think that these rates are reasonable? If not will you please take the matter up with the company and endeavour to get us better rates. In this connection I may say that I could not get any better rates myself, from them.\n\nAccording to our estimate the monthly cost will be approximately $200.00 per month, this will represent a very large increase in our costs for light and power as in the old school this only averaged about $40.00 per month, and considering that we always have a small deficit each year you can see that this increase will seriously affect our financial position. I may add that we have cut down considerably on the number of lights originally installed but our estimate was based on the lights as they are at present. The power charges will amount to half or more of the above total according to our estimate.\n\nWill you kindly go into this matter and return the contract to us at your earliest convenience, together with your recommendations.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nFB.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTo Truan-Traer Coal Co., Ltd.,\nEstevan, Sask.\n\nJan. 21st, 1936.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| 1936 Jan. 11 | To one carload coal for the new school 69,210 lbs. @ $1.10 per ton | $ 38.07 |\n\nInvoice attached\n\nTOTAL $ 38.07\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs.

G. Leonard,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Industrial School,\nLebret, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Accounts #38F & #39C Lebret\n\nWe acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 17th, with reference to the bills rendered for the above services.\n\nMay we explain that these bills covered a period of 36 and 35 days respectively and this is no doubt the reason why you were unable to arrive at our figures. Service #38 was connected on November 30th, and the bill for this service covered the period November 30th, to January 5th, or 36 days, while Service #39 was connected December 1st, and the bill on this service covered the period December 1st, to January 5th, or 35 days. The amounts of these accounts were computed as follows:\n\nAcct #38\nConsumption 639 K.W.H. @ 5\u00a2 - 31.95\nS.C. = 36/30 of $28.00 - 33.60 $65.55\n\nAcct #39\nConsumption 258 K.W.H. @ 10\u00a2 - 25.80\nS.C. = 35/30 of $10.40 - 12.14 $37.94\n\nWe trust this explains the matter satisfactorily.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMONTREAL ENGINEERING CO., LTD.,\n\nPer.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We cannot figure out just how you based your charges. According to our proposed contract the service charge for light should only be $7.50 based on the demand of 7\u00bd K.W. (as listed on the invoice) and 258 K.W.H. @ 5\u00a2s which amounts to $12.90; this would mean a total of $20.40 for the light instead of $37.94 as billed. The power account appears also to be too high, 629 K.V.H. X @ 5\u00a2 would amount to $31.25 which with the service charge of $28.00 would only amount to $59.25 whereas you have billed us for $65.55. I may add that as far as the power charge is concerned the above rate is your regular charge as well as that of our proposed contract.\n\nWill you kindly advise us how you arrived at your figures. On what basis did you figure the service charge for lighting? And what rates did you charge for lighting and power? We would appreciate an early reply.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMontreal Engineering Co., Ltd.,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nFB.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTo Montreal Engineering Co., Ltd.,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nJan. 22nd, 1936.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| 1936 Jan. 5 | To lighting charges for the new school, Dec. 1st 1935 to Jan 5th 1936, as per attached invoice. | $87.94 |\n| 5 | To power charges for the new school, Nov. 30th 1935 to Jan. 5th 1936, as per attached invoice | $65.55 |\n\nTotal: $153.49\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(stop) Good spring good farming land and a lake as well.\"\n\nWriting\".\n\nMr. Morrison tells me that he and Father Therien, the Rev. Principal, selected the site mentioned in my telegram, some two years ago, and it is situated where the best farming land on the reserve lies. There is a level piece of table land in close proximity to a lively spring, and with excellent drainage from school site away from the river valley. The Inspector estimates that the school site would be approximately 50 feet higher than the spring, and it would be an easy matter to have a storage reservoir at the spring and pump water to the school buildings. The water was tested for softness by the Reverend Sisters of the school and they were very much pleased with its quality. It is very soft and is pure spring water.\n\nThis site will be approximately four miles from where the present school is located. It is about thirty-three miles north from the Town of Lloydminster. Mr. Morrison tells me that the Principal very strongly favours this site, and I would recommend that the choice be approved.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSigned.\n\nW. M.

For the fencing of that section either Mr. Turner or myself could see to it. We could employ some of the Indians to do the fencing as there are some amongst them that have done the same already and with satisfaction. We have all the posts on hand ready to be used. As for the breaking I believe that we should break the surrender in less than 75 acres and it can easily be done as the most part of the land is open except a few bushes here and there. We could easily get Indians to do the work either by using a tractor or horses. The breaking should be done not later than the beginning of June.\n\nI humbly submit that the Honourable Deputy makes his intention known about these two questions either to Mr. Turner or to me at his earliest convenience.\n\nI remain Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned J.

C. Indian Residential School, I now enclose a resolution of the band setting aside approximately 640 acres of land to be used by the Department of Indian Affairs for educational purposes only. Unfortunately, the Onion Lake Reservation has never been subdivided, but the Agent has been able to give a fairly good description of the land, and it is anticipated that at some later date the exact boundaries of the section can be determined. A surveyor would be required to do this. I understand that the section which has been selected is a very fine one, most of the land being excellent for farming and the soil the finest on the reserve. There is also an abundance of hay and pasture land for the stock, with access to water. The spring mentioned in former correspondence is within the boundaries of this section, and I understand that the church authorities are very much pleased with the location.\n\nRev. Fr. Therien would like to have the buildings erected so that they would not face due south but with a slight turn to the West. I think, however, that this would be a mistake and that they should face straight south and be in line with the roads and the boundary lines.\n\nThere is one Indian, Albert McKay, No 77 of the Onion Lake Band, who has 17 acres of land fenced and plowed on this particular section, and I think he should be recouped for his improvements. I should be glad if the Department would send me a cheque in favour of this man for $120.00 to pay for breaking and fencing 17 acres of land in another part of the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSigned W.

Indian Residential School at Onion Lake, I will give you my opinion on the several items in the order as they appear in your letter.\n\nITEM NO. 1. Building and furnishing camp. $1,200.\n\nIn the first place the specifications call for the school to be erected on the Onion Lake Indian Reserve, and that the bidders were supposed to visit the site of the proposed work and make up for themselves as to the existing conditions. The buildings referred to as bunk house, cook house, office for the company, also office for the Inspector did not cost them $200.00 altogether and then they got a fair price for them when they were through with them and in my opinion it would have cost them far more if they had rented buildings.\n\nITEM NO. 2. Mailing water. $1,200.\n\nThere is a lake about 200 yards from where the school site is and a fine spring about 150 yards from the building, and if Mr. Hudson had taken the interest in the work he should have done he could have put up a small gasoline engine and a pump at the spring and could have supplied all the water required for the work and also for drinking purposes. This spring is at present supplying all the water required for the school, and as for Mr. Turner saying that the water was right at the site he was correct. And in all my conversation with Mr. Turner he never mentioned any other site than the one where the school is located, and the water is far better.\n\nITEM NO. 3. Difference in cost of gravel. $1,200.\n\nAll the gravel used in the building did not cost them more than $1.25 per yard as most of it was procured within a mile of the job and when the pit run out they hauled from another pit from which they paid $1.25 per yard for hauling and 20 cents to the owner. The reason the Government had to pay $1.75 for gravel was on account of most of the teams were out harvesting. Mr. Hudson put their trucks at hauling gravel and they made eight trips per day with each truck from the farthest pit.\n\nITEM No. 4. Mailing lumber and camp supplies.\n\nThe price charged for hauling lumber from Onion Lake was $3.00 per thousand, and the amount of lumber they received from Onion Lake was approximately 30,000 feet but the balance of 125,000 feet lumber nearly about 90,000 feet they saved money on the hauling as the new school is about 7 miles closer to the Railway than the old school site, and the above applies to the Camp Supplies.\n\nReferring to the change of site they never mentioned anything to me about it till about the time the contract should have been completed and in talking with the Agent Mr. Turner at Onion Lake and also the authorities at the St. Anthony's School they told me that they had never considered having the school erected at the old site in Onion Lake.\n\nThere are some conditions that existed in the handling of the work in connection with the erection of the school which was anything but good management, and I feel sorry for Mr. Brown as any loss which has occurred through the way the work was handled will have to be borne by him, but of course it was his own fault as he should have known the man he was sending there to handle the work.\n\nI hope that the above explanation may be of assistance to you in deciding re the claim referred to, and in reference to the first clause of your letter of regret in having to trouble me in regard to the particulars, I am only too pleased to give you any assistance possible in getting the matter\n\nIndian Affairs.

Under such circumstances to put the system into operation at this time is only inviting trouble and we would not be at all surprised to hear that the sewage has now backed up into the Institution.\n\nThe sewage disposal system complete will take about 20,000 gallons after which, if the disposal bed is not open, the sewage must back up into the building.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD. B. Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Father Lennard,\n\nOttawa, March 16, 1936.\n\nReferring to your telegram with regard to the water supply I beg to say that I have been in communication with Mr. Gow, and I guess there is nothing we can do until the spring, when I think it will be necessary to run the water pipe out into the lake. This matter will be given immediate attention as soon as weather conditions will permit.\n\nI have today received the following letter from Mr. Gow with reference to the sewage disposal system; he is quite right in his contention, and I would ask you therefore to keep a close watch and exercise care.\n\n\"It was with considerable surprise that I learned yesterday from your telegram - re water shortage at the Lebret School - that the building had not been occupied all winter. Since the school has not been in operation the disposal bed has not been kept open and of course the ground over the same is completely frozen. Even a partial operation of the school would not have prevented this freezing. Under such circumstances to put the system into operation at this time is only inviting trouble and we would not be at all surprised to hear that the sewage has now backed up into the Institution.\n\nThe sewage disposal system complete will take about 20,000 gallons after which, if the disposal bed is not open, the sewage must back up into the building\".\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

(RG 1C, Volume 6329, file 660-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, March 16, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Gow,\n\nI have your letter of the 11th with reference to the sewage disposal system, and in reply I beg to say that there has been many delays in getting the furnishings for this building due to causes over which we had no control.\n\nThis has delayed the opening of the new school.\n\nI am passing on the information contained in your letter to Rev. Father Leonard and asking him to use every care possible.\n\nWith reference to the water supply system it would appear that the only solution would be to extend the intake out into the lake, and I would be glad if you would drop me a line and let me know when you think this work could be undertaken, and give me some idea, if possible, of the cost.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nYou have already been acquainted, I am sure, with the fact that the Lebret School has been officially opened and that all the children are now in attendance.\n\nLast December when I had occasion to take up with you the matter of compensation to the Reverend Oblate Fathers of the Lebret Scholasticate and Seminary, you suggested that the fairest way to proceed was to charge a nominal rent for the time the boys were housed in the Seminary. We then agreed that the sum of $100.00 per month could be considered, if not in the light of full compensation, at least as sufficient remuneration to enable the Oblate Fathers to repair that portion of the building occupied by the boys of the School.\n\nYou will no doubt recall that the old Lebret School was destroyed on or about November 13 and that the boys were immediately received by the Oblate Fathers in their Seminary. It was on the 25th of March 1936, I understand, that the new School was occupied. The children, therefore, lived at the Scholasticate for a little more than forty months. I am enclosing an Invoice in triplicate dated March 19th for $4000. which will cover the 40 months of occupancy at the rate of $100. per month.\n\nAs the Oblate Fathers have to proceed forthwith with the repairs to their Seminary, your kind attention to this matter will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJOP:L\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 1C, Volume 6329, file 660-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nI have for attention your letter of March 16th with reference to the water supply at the Lebret Indian School and note that you consider the only solution to the problem is the extension of the intake out into the lake.\n\nIt is unfortunate indeed that the well has failed to yield adequate supply of water but I am inclined to believe that the supply will increase with the thawing out of the ground so that there will be no immediate need of the extension of the intake. In my opinion the extending of the intake out into the open water of the lake should only be undertaken as a last resort. The lake is quite open and bottom appears muddy and moderate winds cause the water to become quite dirty. Furthermore there is undesirable algae growth and the water takes on an offensive odor. It would be undesirable to install a filter-ling plant and the algae growth in the water would then seriously interfere with the operation of the filter and also of the chlorinating machine. The water supply would always be objectionable from this source. Again the laying of an intake out into any such body of water, to be laid so as to be safe from frost penetration, is usually very expensive and very frequently is accompanied by much grief. We had our own experience at the Geraldine Jeffery Indian School at Kenora and I am also of the opinion that the intake at the R. C. Indian School at Kenora is broken at one or more connection thus giving cause to the complaints that sand is being pumped at the present time. There was also the experience of the Oblate fathers in extending the water main at the school near Winnpegosis. The writer has been watching fairly closely the efforts of the Town of Kenora in extending an intake out into the Lake of the Woods. Their initial attempt last summer, under the direction of Winnipeg Engineers, resulted in the line breaking at two or three places and it was decided to postpone the laying of the line until it could be lowered from the ice. New pipe was purchased and an effort was made to lower the pipe from the ice. It now lies at the bottom of the lake in several pieces and it has been decided to attempt to lay the line again under open water conditions. As you are aware, it was because of such conditions in the lake water and also on account of the difficulty of laying pipe lines out into deep water that we were willing to take considerable chances on the surface well proposition at Lebret.\n\nBefore deciding to extend the intake out into the lake, I think it would be advisable to explore further the possibility of securing an adequate water supply to a well by seepage from the lake - this to be done by means of borings taken at different points in the vicinity of the intakes etc. It might also be advisable to give consideration to the drilling of a deep artesian well. These borings can be taken as soon as the frost is out of the ground and inquiries can be made regarding the possibilities of an artesian well and the probable cost of the same.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.

School,\nLebret, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI have for attention your letter of July 7th with reference to the inadequate water supply at the Qu'Appelle Indian School at Lebret, Sask. However, on that date Mr. W. H. Wallace of this office and myself were at Lebret investigating the situation.\n\nThe present source of water supply for the school is a well 6' diameter, sunk to elevation 80.9 at a spot about 150' from Lebret Lake, the present water level of which is approximately 85.0. Previous to digging the well, borings were taken and these indicated favourable conditions for steady seepage from the lake. The quantity of water secured from the well, while considerable, was insufficient for the school's needs last November a trench was excavated from the well for 95 feet toward the water's edge; the depth of the trench being reported to be the same as the bottom of the well. This trench was filled with gravel for a depth of 4' from the bottom. This expedient increased the water supply but severe winter conditions curtailed the seepage into the well to an extent that caused a severe water shortage at frequent intervals during the winter.\n\nIt is essential that an adequate supply of water be available for the operation of this school. However, from the very first it has been our objective to secure an adequate water supply without resorting to direct pumping from Lebret lake. Extending an intake out to a sufficient depth of water presents many difficulties and involves a large expenditure of money. Again the lake water frequently gets stirred up and becomes dirty, algae growth is extensive and the water itself becomes warm and gives off an offensive odor.\n\nWe have given consideration to the laying of a gravity main from 6' depth of water to the well, also to laying a pumping main from the present main in the well to a 6' depth of water. We have also given consideration to the sinking of a well 150 to 200 feet at the school, to the deepening of the present well and also to the excavation of an additional well. We had Messrs. Smith Brown & Wilson prepare us an estimate of the cost of pumping directly from the lake and also the cost of drilling a well 150 feet. Their letter is attached.\n\nWe are of the opinion that had the trench been extended last November to the water's edge and to a depth level with the bottom of the well and back filled with gravel and clay on top that a sufficient supply of water would have been obtained. Therefore we consider that the trench be extended to the water's edge and be put down to elevation 80.0, be back-filled to a depth of 5 feet from the bottom with gravel and covered with clay or loam. Backfilling is important in order to prevent frost.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6329, file 660-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI am not prepared to give an estimate of the probable cost of such work since difficulties with water, quicksand etc., will be encountered. The distance is only 35 feet and the width of trench at the bottom should not be less than four feet. The job might involve an expenditure equal to or more than the cost of drilling a 150' well.\n\nThe walls of the trench must be supported, pumping equipment will be required but I believe Mr. Wright at present at Fort Qu'Appelle, could supervise this job, rent the necessary equipment, purchase timber necessary, have gravel hauled etc., and thus render unnecessary the engaging of a contracting firm with their heavy overhead costs.\n\nWhatever proposition for securing additional water is decided upon, I would suggest that it be pushed to completion before autumn.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.

Cow, Esq.,\nDominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\n706 Commercial Bldg., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Lebret Indian School.\n\nReference Lebret water supply, we have estimated to do the following work:\n\n1. Excavate from existing well to lake approximately 160 lin. ft. and connect pipe line to present 4\" water line and backfill same.\n\n2. Excavate lake bottom out from shore 175 lin. ft. to depth below water of 6 feet.\n\n3. Lay 4\" AntheaCast Iron water pipe from well to a point in the lake totalling 335 lin. ft., with Intake Fitting and Valve at the end.\n\n4. Install additional Intake Screen over the intake and stone mound approximately 10' x 10'.\n\n5. Drive 3\" plank sheet piles both sides of pipe line from edge of water to a point 175 feet out into the lake with 6\" x 6\" walings and 1\" iron tie rods. These two rows of sheet piles to be 10 feet between and the whole crib filled with rock from the shore to a point 175 feet out.\n\n6. Cover the remaining 200 feet of pipe beyond the crib with rock 4 feet by 2 feet as a protective cover.\n\n7. Connect present line in well so that well water is valved off from the suction line but can be opened up if required.\n\nThe above we estimate would cost $6,580.00.\n\nWe also estimate to drill well 150 feet deep through bottom of present well and install 150 feet of 8\" casing including necessary shoe at bottom of casing for the sum of $450.00.\n\nWe have no assurance that this well would increase the water supply sufficiently nor have we any guarantee that water will rise to the present well level. So if the well is drilled it will probably be necessary to install a deep well pump to lift the water to the present well and provide power continuously for this purpose. It may also be advisable to install a small pump house over the well to house the equipment.\n\nIf you think some of the items we have enumerated are not necessary or can be cut down in quantity we would be pleased to do the work on the same cost plus basis as the other work has been done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSMITH BROS. & WILSON LTD.\nper\n\"E.

Wallace and the writer visited the Qu'Appelle Indian School and accompanied by the engineer made an examination of the water supply and sewage disposal systems. The principal of the school was away in Winnipeg and due to the summer vacation, the institution was pretty much shut down. The question of water supply is dealt with in another letter and this letter will serve to draw to the attention of the Department of Indian Affairs some conditions at the school that demand attention.\n\nOriginally our plans called for one single sewer line from the building to septic tank and a single storm water drain and while both were to be laid in the same trench as far as possible, yet there was to be no possible way of the contents of either escaping to the other. The Resident Architect authorized the contractors to insert in both lines in the manholes two Y's thus exposing the contents of the Y's. Unfortunately the Y's were not provided with screw plugs. Consequently some time after the system was put into operation the screen at the entrance to the septic tank became clogged with old clothes, boots, etc., not being cleaned periodically, and the sewerage backed up to the nearest manhole where it overflowed through the open Y's into the storm drain. The outlet of the storm drain was blocked, probably frozen, but the line became plugged with sewerage. The sewerage then backed up into the septic tank and when the blockage was broken through the open Y's and eventually the blockage was discovered in the school. The sewage even backed up through the 1/2\" pipe housing the 3\" chlorinator drainage tubing, filling the two inspection chambers. The screen to the septic tank was cleaned but nothing has been done towards opening up the storm water drain, cleaning the filth from the manholes and from the inspection openings along the chlorinator drain. All storm water now passes through the septic tank and disposal bed.\n\nExamination of the pump room showed it to be dirty, untidy and the floor cluttered up with tools, paint cans, bags of salt and debris. The windows, ordinary and storm, were thoroughly sealed and no ventilation allowed. The machinery shows neglect.\n\nThe Saskatchewan Department of Health reported the water supply unsafe for drinking without treatment, so a chlorinating machine was installed. The Company making the installation set it in operation and instructed the engineer. It was then shut off and has not been in operation. Upon being closely questioned the Engineer offered several explanations, such as the Company promised to send silver nipples and extra hose but did not, the chlorinator used too much water etc.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power and\nHydrometric Bureau, OTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 1C, Volume 6329, file 666-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCompany provided the extra silver nipples and 100 feet of extra hose free of cost and the wastage of water is not excessive. That no epidemic of typhoid was experienced amongst the Indian children speaks well for their hardihood, for the staff drink water hauled from a well in the village, the water from which is not contaminated.\n\nA water softener was installed primarily to eliminate the rapid corrosion due to hard water usually experienced with the heating system, high pressure steam boiler and the water heater. Unsoftened water is used entirely in the water heater, although we intended it was to be entirely soft water. The Engineer explained he had been told to shut off the soft water as too frequent regenerating of the softeners was being experienced. Apparently the water softener is being inefficiently operated.\n\nThe unfortunate consequences of having unqualified inexperienced and insufficient engineers in some of the Indian Schools are very evident at Lebret. It is not the fault of the individual as he probably knows little or nothing about the machinery installation and is required to do much outdoor work as well.\n\nThe School is now mostly empty and affords the opportunity of carrying out the following necessary work and having instructions issued so that difficulties will not be experienced later.\n\n(1) The Chlorinating Machine must be in operation continuously and if there is a District Medical Superintendent, he should visit the school weekly to see that chlorination is effective. A second cylinder of chlorine should be supplied the school.\n\n(2) The storm water drain must be cleared, even though it be necessary to dig down to it. The outlet should be lowered and protected from freezing so readily.\n\n(3) The two manholes on the sewer line must be thoroughly cleaned and flushed. The Y's must be provided with screwed plugs and the plugs put in place. Covers are worthless as has been experienced.\n\n(4) The chlorinating drainage line must be flushed out and the inspection chambers cleaned.\n\nInstructions should be issued the Principal that softened water exclusively must be used in the heating system and hot water heaters and that a 95% softened water supply must be used in the high pressure steam boiler. If these instructions are not complied with, the soft water piping to laundry and kitchen should be removed.\n\n(6) The Principal of the School should be instructed that the screen in front of the entrance to the septic tank requires frequent cleaning and that the septic tank should be cleaned at least annually.\nThe equipment of the school and its operation should be in charge of a qualified and competent engineer whose time would be fully devoted to operation and maintenance.\n\nThe cleaning up of the storm sewer, the manholes and chlorinator drain is very urgent and important and should not be entrusted to the School Management. It should not be necessary to engage a plumbing firm. Mr. Wright who was Superintendent for Messrs. Smith Brothers & Wilson on the Hospital Job at Fort Qu'Appelle, is unengaged at present, resides at Fort Qu'Appelle and with the aid of two or three men could quickly put things in first-class condition.\n\nPossibly the Indian Inspector at Regina could undertake to arrange for and see that the work outlined above is carried out. Periodic inspection of this school will be advisable and unless a good reliable engineer is placed on the job, trouble may be expected with the operation of much of the equipment installed.\n\nIn closing I might mention another objectionable feature noted at the school, although it is possibly outside the scope of our activity at the School. The constant dripping of the condensation on the uncovered cold water pipes throughout the basement, in class-rooms, etc., is ruining the floors, the linoleum, etc., and is very objectionable. Covering of these pipes is worthy of attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. B. Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith two letters dated July 20th from Mr. Gow; one deals with the sewer line and storm drain and the other with the water supply at Qu'Appelle Indian School. See your letter of July 6th reference 114-0-5.\n\nWith respect to the drainage you will observe that the trouble has arisen mainly through lack of reliable supervision, and that extensive cleaning operations are necessary.\n\nDealing with the matter of the water supply, Mr. Gow recommends that the trench excavated last November be extended to the waters edge of Lebret lake but is not prepared to give an estimate of the probable cost because difficulties with water, quicksand, etc. will be encountered. He suggests that Mr. Wright, who was superintendent on the construction of the Indian hospital at Fort Qu'Appelle, could supervise the work at less cost than engaging a contracting firm.\n\nYou will observe that both matters require early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nEncl.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, July 28th, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nThe Department is much concerned with a report recently received regarding the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. I desire to direct your personal attention to the following:-\n\n(1) Sewer line from building to septic tank and storm water drain:-\n\nIt has been found that the screen at the entrance to the septic tank has been allowed to become clogged with old clothes, boots, etc. As a result, the sewerage backed up to the nearest manhole, where it overflowed into the storm drain. Nothing has been done towards opening up the storm water drain nor cleaning the filth from the manholes and from the inspection openings along the chlorinator drain.\n\nTo overcome this, the Department requires that the screen in front of the entrance to the septic tank be cleaned at least once a week and the septic tank cleaned at least annually. The storm drain must also be cleared and the two manholes on the sewer line must be thoroughly cleaned and flushed.\n\n(2) Pump room:-\n\nExamination of this room showed it to be dirty and the floor cluttered up with tools, paint cans, etc. The windows were thoroughly sealed and no ventilation allowed and the machinery showed neglect.\n\nThe Department expects that all unnecessary articles in this room be removed at once and the room itself, as well as the machinery, should be kept in the very best possible condition.\n\nChlorinating machine:-\n\nThe water is unsafe for drinking without treatment and,\n\nRev. M. de Bretagne, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Indian Res. School,\nLebret, Sask.\nto overcome this, a chlorinating machine was installed. It is found that the machine has not been kept in operation and, as a result, the children have been drinking impure water. If this condition is allowed to continue, an outbreak of typhoid is almost inevitable.\n\nThe chlorinating machine must be kept in operation continuously and the Department is issuing instructions to the Medical Superintendent, Dr. Simes, to examine the water periodically in order to ascertain if it is safe for drinking purposes. The chlorinating drainage line should be flushed out and the inspection chambers cleaned.\n\n(4) Water softener:\n\nA water softener was installed primarily to eliminate the rapid corrosion due to hard water usually experienced with a high pressure heating system. It is found that unsoftened water is used wholly in the water heater, although it is intended that soft water should be used entirely.\n\nThe Department must insist that softened water be used exclusively in the heating system and hot water heaters and that a 95% softened water supply must be used in the high pressure steam boiler. Unless this is done, the heating system will be ruined within a short time.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will give the above matters your personal attention. You should assure yourself that the engineer is fully competent to handle the machinery that has been installed in the Qu'Appelle School. The Department cannot hold itself responsible for damage done to the system if such damage is caused by carelessness or incompetence of the engineer.\n\nI may add that immediate steps are being taken to provide an adequate water supply at the Qu'Appelle School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

To date we have had no instructions with respect to this work but it may be possible that instructions have been issued by the Department of Indian Affairs through other sources to have this matter attended to. However, it is my desire at this time to draw to your attention the necessity of having this work carried out before the school is again put into operation and if no arrangements have been made to date to have the work done, I would strongly urge that authority be given us by radio or telegraph, immediately to have the work completed while Mr. Rose is at the site.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.

Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nLeFret Sask.\nAugust 22nd 1936\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Yours 114-0-5 - 17th ins.\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of same as well as the one dated July 28th and wish to bring to your information that I much regret not to have given any answer to your first letter, but probably when you would have listened to my explanations you will understand the difficulties we have presently to face with.\n\nAs you probably know, I am just recently appointed Principal of this School, and before being capable of forming any judgment on the capacity of my staff, I needed a little time. Moreover by the sharp answers given to our Engineer by the author of the report you received, I thought to have a certain right to think that it was prudent before speaking on behalf or against him to see if no exaggeration had crept in.\n\nSome days before receiving your letter I had the pleasure of having the welcome visit of the Secretary, Mr McKenzie himself, who benevolently asked me what I figure would be better for the water question. And by this very fact, I thought that his kind promise of helping me would, at his return, dispose the Department on my favor. Because, I have to say here, that I saw a certain connection between the shortage of water supply and certain reproaches made for instance on account of not using the chlorinating machine, what said our engineer would cause loss of chlorine gas when the pump would operate with automatic start and an empty well.....\n\nOn the time being Mr Rose was sent by Mr Gow to give us more water. His work is nearly completed but cannot give any satisfaction. It consists in digging a little further the shore of the lake that is very shallow and will have a lower level in the coming winter. It will freeze again and does not give the required amount of water any way. Mr Rose claims that he cannot do more, for such are the instructions he received.\n\nIn the presence of this fact I have to conclude\nthat a serious step should be taken to give us the most necessary supply of such a large institution and this as soon as possible.\n\nBut may I suggest before consulting my own provincial religious authority that probably Brother Gauthier would supervise and direct such a work at a far lower cost and with the same efficiency as any contractor. The Department appointed him in Camperville some years ago where he laid a 3000 ft pipe. Here it is required an extension of a few only, the pump being installed already, I do not think possible that the price of material required and the cost of work would amount so much. But of course I do not take the responsibility of this advice if the intention of the Department is different.\n\nTo the second item mentioned in yours July 28th, I beg to inform you that instructions were given the Engineer about the sewer line. Here again he partly accused the contractor who obliged him to let some holes opened the storm drain being frozen.\n\nI gave instructions about the required order of a pump room, of the chlorinating machine with the restriction of the engineer's above mentioned remark.\n\nAbout the water softener, the two remarks of our Engineer are that he mentioned to the Inspector that a third tank be added as well as a gauge in a way that he might use softened water in the water heater and be able to follow the density of his water.\n\nAs a conclusion I wish to assure the Department that I intend to do in new charge the same effort that I have done in Fort Frances for the betterment of the School. I have lost much time since I am here for the sake of recruiting and this not in neglecting the building itself. At my own expenses I have covered all non painted floors with varnish specially made for preventing cement dust so noxious to the lungs. I wish to do more inside and outside to cooperate with the Department for improving this beautiful School. Today not to postpone my answer I have answered from my bed where I lay sick.\n\nAbout the engineer I have to say that I would see in the very near future what to do and if necessary to provide for another.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. M de Bretagne O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nRe: Water Supply - Qu'Appelle Indian School.\n\nMr. J. T. Rose has returned from Lebret after carrying out further work in connection with the water supply.\n\nIt was definitely determined that the seepage into the present well is not from the lake and that the soil conditions along the lake shore in that vicinity are such that there can be no infiltration into a well from the lake itself. Such seepage as occurs is evidently from springs arising in the hills. This seepage is insufficient for the needs of the school.\n\nIt is unfortunate that these conditions were not previously determined. Borings taken early in 1935 in the vicinity of the well showed no clay but gravel, sand and quicksand with the water at the same level as the lake. Borings attempted at the shore line were impossible because of the coarse nature of gravel encountered.\n\nPlease refer to our letter of April 2nd last to Mr. R. Gurney Orr, in connection with the water supply. It would now appear that as a last resort we must extend the intake out into the lake. Soundings have been taken and it was found that the lake bottom is very even and that an intake line approximately 550 feet in length will be required from the connection at the present well.\n\nPlease refer also to the estimate of cost supplied by Messrs. Smith Brothers & Wilson covering the laying of an intake from the well 535 feet into the lake. Their estimate covers pretty much what would be involved in extending the intake, but the depth of water obtainable 535 feet from the well at present lake level would not exceed 5.0 feet. At 600 feet from the well the depth of water is 6.0 feet and 650 feet from the well the depth of water is 7.5 feet. It would not be feasible to extend the pipe line to secure 7.5 ft. depth of water as lake elevations lower than the present can be expected. We do not consider covering of the pipe line beyond the cribwork essential.\n\nWe consider that Smith Brothers & Wilson Limited estimated cost is probably excessive, even if the line is extended to 950 feet. The pipe line is quite exposed at this point and there is a long wind sweep from the west with the result ice piles up on the shore. Protection must be provided against this condition. We can, however, prepare detailed drawings of the layout required.\n\nThe water situation at the school is acute and an augmented supply is essential this Autumn. We do not consider this lake a satisfactory source of water supply but there is no reason-\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nable alternative except a deep artesian well and such a source is in unlimited quantity. We investigated a spring a mile away but consider the quantity of water available from it inadequate and the expense involved in piping same excessive. The Director, Sanitary Division of the Department of Health, Saskatchewan, informed the writer over a year ago that he would not approve of and would object to the scheme pumping directly from the lake.\n\nShould the Department of Indian Affairs decide to proceed with the placing of this intake it should be authorized and laid at once before freezing weather interferes.\n\nOur draughtsman is away in Northern Manitoba at present so we are unable to prepare detailed plans of what is essential in connection with the intake. However, we will endeavour to have same available for construction purposes when the work is authorized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. B. Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nAugust 28, 1926\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith a letter from Mr. Gow, dated the 25th instant, in further reference to the water supply at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School at Lehret. From this you will see that Mr. Gow is now of the opinion that the only way to obtain an adequate supply of water is by direct pumping from the lake. He recommends the laying of an intake from the well for about 950 feet into the lake and suggests that action must be taken at once to have the pipe laid before freezing weather interferes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

This statement gives the names of those employed, the classification of the labor, the hourly rate of pay and the total amount due. This work was in connection with the cleansing out of the storm sewers, manholes and etc., and also extending the trench in an endeavour to secure additional water. This trench excavation was discontinued as soon as it was definitely ascertained that additional water could not be secured from that source.\n\nThese men have not been paid and I would ask that you take this matter up with the Department of Indian Affairs and arrange either to have the money forwarded to this office for issuing the cheques or have the cheques issued at Ottawa and forward to this office.

Speedy action required owing to great inconvenience arising from chlorine gas when well is dry.\"\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nThe Dominion Water Power Branch,\nDepartment of Interior,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nYour letter of September 1st enclosing copies of two letters from the Department of Indian Affairs re work at Indian Schools is acknowledged. The writer of the letter did not correctly interpret the contents of the two letters received from the Department of Indian Affairs and accordingly the letter is very confusing. The two letters from the Department of Indian Affairs relate to distinctly separate projects.\n\nIt is noted that the Department of Indian Affairs authorizes the extension of the water intake out into the lake at Lebret, Saskatchewan and advises that previous instructions contained in their letter of August 24th should be followed with reference to the employment of labor.\n\nWe are now preparing working drawings covering what is necessary for the carrying out of this work. However, I wish to point out that the laying of this intake involves unwatering work, cribwork construction, driving sheet piling, laying pipe, etc. Heavy equipment is necessary and men of experience must direct the work. Accordingly the work should be carried out by a good firm, such as Smith Brothers & Wilson Limited on a cost plus profit basis, and we will make reasonable allowance for usual equipment. This office will undertake to furnish the working plans, arrange with a contracting firm to carry out the work, maintain a representative on the job to check labor and material costs, to see that the work is done in accordance with the plans and to test the intake for leaks upon completion.\n\nThe preparing of working drawings will take some days and we will accordingly continue with their preparation and will await definite instructions from the Department of Indian Affairs as to what reputable firm or firms in Regina we shall contact and also shall await information as to the financing of the work.\n\nThis work should be under way by the middle of this month so that an early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.

R. Paget, General Contractor of Winnipeg and Regina, for the installation of this pipe line in accordance with Mr. Gow's recommendation.\n\nMr. Gow has been asked to submit the accounts received from time to time, duly certified, in the usual manner. In addition to the construction costs there will be the living expenses of our inspector referred to in my letter of the 28th and I shall be obliged if you will arrange for an advance of $300, to be made available for Mr. Gow in the usual manner, to cover these expenses and some items of expense which have already been incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nDr. H. W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nIn connection with the construction of a new water intake for the Appalai Indian Residential School at Lebret, I am informed by Mr. Gow that he has been investigating the most suitable method of having this work carried out and recommends that arrangements be made for that purpose with Mr. J.R. Paget, General Contractor of Winnipeg and Regina.\n\nMr. Gow has been in touch with Mr. Paget and discussed the proposed design of the intake with him and his superintendent in Winnipeg. Both these gentlemen are quite familiar with conditions at Lebret and in Mr. Gow's opinion the firm of J.R. Paget is specially equipped to construct the intake expeditiously and is prepared to take special precautions for the protection of the pipe line against ice pressure conditions.\n\nSome weeks ago the price for the construction of the intake as then proposed was obtained from Messrs. Smith Brothers & Wilson of Regina, the price being $6,520. The intake as now proposed is approximately double the length of the one considered by Smith Brothers and Wilson and is of a much more stable type of construction. Mr. Paget offers to carry out the work for a total cost of $6,641. This amount covers the placing of the intake and the heavier construction work proposed by himself, the details of which have all been decided upon and should include a satisfactory result.\n\nMr. Gow states that he has received frequent complaints about the delay of supplying additional water at this school and speedy action is required. Mr. Paget is willing to start work immediately and Mr. Gow is of the opinion that the price is reasonable. It is arranged that Mr. J.T. Rose of our Winnipeg office will act as inspector for this work and will see that the plans are carried out. It is expected that the total cost of this work to the Dominion Indian Affairs will be about $7,000, this to include the expenses of our inspector, items of expense already incurred and expenditures necessary to make alterations to the pumping equipment resulting from the new intake.\n\nI beg......\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 1C, Volume 6329, file 660-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI beg to concur in Mr. Gow's recommendation and to request authority from the Department of Indian Affairs to enable the offer of Mr. J.H. Paget at the fixed price of $6,641 to be granted. It is desirable that this authority should be given as soon as possible so that the work can be started immediately in view of the near approach of cold weather.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\nDear Mr. Johnston:\n\nIn connection with the water intake construction at Lebret, Saskatchewan, we were advised by Mr. J. A. McCowan of Summerberry that Lebret is not in his constituency. Accordingly, I consulted Mr. Jackson, Private Secretary to our Minister, who at the time was occupying his office in the Dominion Public Building, opposite ours on the fifth floor. He instructed us to get in touch with the Honourable Mr. Gardiner's Secretary in Regina and be guided by his recommendation as to the contractor to employ.\n\nMr. J. R. Paget, General Contractor of Winnipeg and Regina was recommended to us as a result of a visit to Regina by Mr. J. T. Rose. We contacted Mr. Paget and discussed our design for intake with him and his Superintendent in Winnipeg. Both these gentlemen are quite familiar with conditions at Lebret and consider our proposed layout and protection on the right bank not sufficiently strong to withstand the ice pressure conditions that would be experienced at that point. I believe that the firm of J. R. Paget are specially equipped to construct the intake expeditiously and also I appreciate their objection to our proposed layout as we have repeatedly been warned about the ice pressure at the proposed intake location.\n\nMr. Paget stated that while this job was a comparatively small one, nevertheless it was one that required special knowledge of conditions and also special supervision and he furthermore stated that he had been requested by influential parties at Regina to take this job and carry it through to a successful conclusion. However, Mr. Paget refuses to have anything to do with the contract on a cost plus basis, stating that 10% on the cost of material and labor would not yield a sufficient return to warrant his firm bothering with the contract and furthermore that on such a contract from the Government there were demands at Regina that under no circumstances could considerably the contractor's net profit. Mr. Paget was asked if he would do the job on a straight contract basis and reported that he would and he submitted a price of $6,841.00. This amount covers the placing of the intake and the heavier protection proposed by himself; the details of which have all been decided upon. The proposed construction will insure a first-class job.\n\nThe intake as now proposed is approximately double the length and much more stable type of construction than that quoted upon by Messrs. Smith Brothers & Wilson of Regina, some weeks ago; their price being $6,520.00. We are firmly of the opinion that the J. R. Paget Company should be given the contract at his stated price. For reasons that must be fairly obvious this office cannot undertake to carry out this job ourselves, although we might be tempted to do so were it not so late and freezing weather will soon be with us.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nare receiving frequent complaints about the delay in supplying additional water at the Lebret Indian School and speedy action is required. The contractor will start work immediately and is taking all the risk and I am quite sure that the contract is quite fair. Mr. J. T. Rose will be our inspector on the job and will see that a good job is carried out. I am also quite convinced that our Minister would approve of the contract insomuch as the Honourable Mr. Gardiner is quite anxious that Mr. Paget do the work.\n\nI would request, therefore, that you take this matter up immediately with the Department of Indian Affairs officials and if possible have their approval of the awarding of the contract to Mr. J. R. Paget at the fixed price of $6,643.00. We would like to receive this approval by wire on Monday so that work can be started immediately.\n\nAlthough we have not drawn up new plans, the new layout is quite definite and plans will be drawn up. In the meantime we will draw up an agreement with specifications, covering what is to be done and thus be fully protected.\n\nThe cost of the work to the Department of Indian Affairs will be approximately $7,000.00 - the additional amount above the contractor's price being for expenses of our Inspector, items of expense already incurred and expenditures necessary to make alterations to the pumping equipment resulting from the new intake.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. B. Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nSept. 28, 1956.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 28th with reference to the installing of the water intake pipe line for the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School at Lebret, I would ask you to instruct Mr. Gow to arrange immediately with Mr. J.E.

B. Gow, Acting District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau, Winnipeg, in which he asked me to undertake to have a relief valve installed in the discharge line of the water supply system at the Qu'Appelle School. He enclosed a blue print showing where this valve was to be installed. I at once got in touch with Messrs. Paulin and Swayze of this City and requested them to obtain the valve. They carried out my instruction, but could not obtain a valve in Winnipeg or Regina of the size required and had to send to Toronto for one. When the valve came to hand they sent their man to Lebret to install it, but he found upon checking over the plant that the relief valve had been put in when the discharge line was installed in the first instance. It was therefore necessary to return the relief valve and Messrs. Paulin and Swayze are entitled to compensation for their time and expense.\n\nThe account was sent to Mr. Gow and was evidently forwarded to our Department, who returned it to him for further particulars (See Dept. letter No. 144-0-5, dated Sept. 2nd, 1936). Mr. Gow has asked me to obtain the particulars and submit the voucher. I am enclosing the voucher together with a letter of explanation from Messrs. Paulin and Swayze addressed to Mr. Gow, also receipt from the Engineers and Plumbers Supplies. I would recommend that this account be paid.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nW.

This motor was supplied upon our requisition for the water supply system at the Qu'Appelle Indian School at Lebret, Saskatchewan. The new motor is now installed and is said to be working satisfactorily.\n\nWith the construction of the new water intake out into Lebret Lake, it was necessary to reduce the capacity of the pumping equipment. It was decided, therefore, to install the above mentioned motor in place of the 7\u00bd H.P., 1800 R.P.M., 220 volt, 3 phase, 60 cycle Squirrel Cage Induction Motor. The manufacturers would not accept the old motor on the purchase price of a new motor so that we now have on hand the other motor. It is in first-class condition and can probably be used in the future at some other Indian School.\n\nWe recently took up with Captain Edwards, Indian Agent at Kenora, Ontario, the matter of utilizing this motor at the Sioux Lookout Indian School in connection with their existing system that is now necessary there because of the recent fires. We were informed, however, that it did not fit in with their requirements. It is our intention to have this motor stored at the Indian Hospital at Fort Qu'Appelle, Sask., for the present.\n\nI would ask that you forward this invoice of the Canadian General Electric Company to the Department of Indian Affairs with the request that payment be made at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.

If, however, you require further information pertaining to this freight charge, we would be very pleased to furnish same on receipt of this request from you.\n\nWe trust you will give this reply your immediate attention, as we are anxious to have last year's accounts taken care of in full as quickly as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMARSHALL-WELLS CO.

This account amounted to $96.00 and, in addition, there was an item of $13.85 for freight. Father Plourde stated in his letter that the freight receipt could not be secured and that the Qu'Appelle School would pay this item. Under these circumstances, we forwarded Marshall-Wells Company a cheque for $96.00.\n\nThey have written today in connection with the item of $13.85. In view of the promise made by Father Plourde as mentioned above, I would appreciate if you would forward to Marshall-Wells Company a cheque for the freight in order that the matter may be finally closed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

We had intended to forward them a cheque for $13.85 as soon as we had been advised that the Department had paid the balance, as promised you by Father Plourde.\n\nTrusting they will not inconvenience you by further correspondence, and thanking you for your kind co-operation in this matter,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. M. de Bretagne, O.M.I.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nJanuary 25, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, in quadruplicate, the account of J. R. Paget, General Contractor, covering the cost of the construction of the water supply intake at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School at Lebret, Saskatchewan. The account is for $6,540.00 and is in accordance with arrangements made last September with Mr. Paget and with the approval of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe work was carried out in accordance with the details shown on a plan recently forwarded you. Mr. J. T. Rose of this staff was present on the work during the construction to safeguard the interests of the Department and I am assured by him that a satisfactory job has been done. There remains, however, to be placed about 70 yards of rock on the top of the earth filling - only about 30 yards being placed to date. It is difficult to locate a suitable supply of rock at the present time; the ground being covered with deep snow and it would be more convenient to complete this portion of the work in the spring. We have arranged with Mr. Paget, therefore, that the sum of $100.00 is to be retained by the Department of Indian Affairs until such time as this protective layer of rock is placed. I might say that the cost of supplying and laying this rock has been let by contract for $1.00 per yard.\n\nThere is also enclosed a letter, dated January 19th, from the Chairman of the Women's Compensation Board of the Province of Saskatchewan, authorizing me to make such settlement with Mr. J. R. Paget for any monies due him with respect to Lebret Indian School Contract up to the date of the 19th of January. I would point out that all work covered by the contract, with the exception of the 70 yards of rock, was completed before the end of December so that the letter from the Compensation Board is full authority to make full settlement.\n\nWe have no written agreement with Mr. Paget covering the carrying out of this work and no specifications were drawn up.

(RG 10, Volume 6320, file 660-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, February 16, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your 40782-W of the 4th instant, enclosing Mr. Gow's letter of the 25th ultimo, together with an account from Mr. J. R. Paget in connection with the construction of the water supply intake at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School.\n\nMr. Paget's account reads \"To cost of Lebret water supply pipe line intake, as per my letter of 25th September, 1936 - $6,640.00\".\n\nWe do not appear to have received a copy of the letter apparently written by Mr. Paget to Mr. Gow and the Representative of the Treasury wishes to have this letter in order that it may be attached to the account. I would appreciate if you would obtain same and forward it to me.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nController,\nDominion Water and Power Bureau,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nFebruary 19, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nI have for attention your letter of the 17th instant with further reference to the account of J. R. Paget, covering the construction of the water intake at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School at Lebret, Saskatchewan. As requested, we are enclosing a copy of Mr. Paget's letter of September 25th.\n\nAt the time Mr. Paget submitted this letter, we considered that his offer was subject to an interpretation different from that which he had in mind, with respect to his reference to Sales Tax. However, we were not able to contact Mr. Paget prior to writing our letter of September 26th to you in which we stated that Mr. Paget offered to do the work for $6,640.00, which included an item of $109 for rip-rap. We were quite aware that Mr. Paget's estimate of $110.00 to cover Sales Tax was quite unrealistic and we were also quite sure that what Mr. Paget had in mind when he offered $6,531.00 was based upon the assumption that he would not have to pay Sales Tax. However, knowing that the Contractor would have to pay Sales Tax, whatever it was, we proceeded on the assumption that the offer would stand at $6,531.00.\n\nIn January Mr. Paget submitted an account for $6,750.00 as per his letter of September 25th. It was pointed out to him, however, that from a legal interpretation of his offer of September 25th, he was only entitled to $6,530.00 but as we had interpreted his offer at $6,640.00 and had received approval from Ottawa for that amount, we would approve an account for that amount only. Mr. Paget finally consented to this arrangement.\n\nThe writer must admit that the arrangements made with respect to this contract, while regular, were rather loose, but would point out that our design covering construction had to be entirely changed after consultation with Mr. Paget and his Construction Superintendent, and as we were anxious to get the work underway, we authorized him to proceed without detailed drawings. We did, however, have very definite arrangements with Mr. Paget covering the work that had to be done, the quality of materials to be used and the degree of supervision that would be provided. An engineer from this staff was kept continuously on the job and I must say that the work done and the material supplied were in every way satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. B. Gow,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nEncl.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nController,\nDominion Water and Power Bureau,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of February 16th regarding the account of Mr. J.R. Paget for the construction of the water supply intake at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, I enclose herewith the original letter from Mr. Paget to Mr. Gow, dated September 25th, 1936, with 2 copies of the same which may be attached to the account. There is also enclosed a letter from Mr. Gow, dated February 19th, which explains the figures used in determining the amount due Mr. Paget.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

Specific instructions were issued some time ago that payment could not be made for expenditures for which authority had not been previously granted. I am inclined to feel that, if payment is made in this case, it will mean that our instructions will be ignored in future.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, March 30th, 1937.\n\nDr. H.W.

Father Plourde explained to him the manner in which these expenditures were incurred. He realized that the work should not have been done without first having received specific instructions from the Department. The Minister agrees with this principle, but in view of the circumstances in this case he thinks that the Department would be justified in paying the accounts, but he would like you to definitely advise Father Plourde that this will be the last time the Department will pay accounts of this kind where authority for doing the work has not been received from the Department.\n\nC.W.

As we had discussed this matter several times I agreed with him, particularly as he was doing the most important of the items mentioned with school funds.\n\nI, and apparently the Principal, overlooked the fact that I was to report back to the Department and he proceeded with the fence.\n\nThe vouchers for the work were forwarded yesterday.\n\nI am very sorry for this oversight and fully realize I should be censured for it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

Robertson, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nFederal Building,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the enclosed voucher for fencing I have used the entire appropriation of the Department for this purpose as I considered this work to be of the first importance in order to protect our garden, lawns, young trees and shrubs from village cows and other stray animals which have already done some damage to the trees and shrubs last year; also to protect the school property from trespassers, especially the village boys.\n\nI may also add that I have already done much of the painting and repairs, for which the appropriation was granted, out of the school funds. In view of these facts I trust that the Department will pass the enclosed account for payment without further questioning.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. M. de Bretagne, O.M.I.\n\nFB.\nEnc.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., Aug. 9th, 1937\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nI beg to attach Voucher #120 for $1125.00, together with the Principal's letter of explanation.\n\nFather de Bretagne discussed this matter with me and I am satisfied the use of the money in this way was in the best interest of the Institution, particularly as he has done the important repairs and painting from school funds.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nIn the appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year an amount of $1125.00 was provided for repairs and equipment required at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, Lebret, Saskatchewan (Electoral District of Melville).\n\nFor your information I attach copy of letter sent to Dr. T. E. Robertson, Inspector of Indian Agencies, on May 20th. As no reply had been received from Dr. Robertson, another letter was written to him on August 7th. A copy of this letter is also attached. A copy of his reply, dated August 10th, explains what action he took in the matter.\n\nWe are also in receipt of an account for $1125.00 covering the cost of fencing purchased from the Frost Steel and Wire Company, Limited, Hamilton, Canada.\n\nYou will notice from the correspondence attached to this memorandum that no specific authority was given to purchase the fencing. Apparently, both Dr. Robertson and the Principal believed that the fencing material was required this year.\n\nUnder the circumstances I would appreciate receiving the Minister's approval for paying the account.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nSeptember 3, 1937.\n\nDr. H.W. McGill,\n\nI note from your memorandum of the last instant that fencing required for the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, Lebret, Saskatchewan, was purchased direct, without authority from Ottawa.\n\nAs the order has already been placed and the goods delivered, there is little we can do but approve the payment of the account. However, Dr. Robertson should be cautioned to not let anything of this nature occur again.\n\nActing Deputy Minister.\n\nIndian Affairs.

But if I would be able to use all the rain water, coming from our roofs in larger cistern, in our hot water system much savings would be made in the future in the pipes and boiler of the kitchen.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

When Mr. Hoey last visited this school he emphasized the necessity of the girls being trained in the care and management of poultry. The chicken house that had been used up to a few years ago was a very old building and unfit for its purpose. With the materials provided in the enclosed list the building will be put in first class condition.\n\nThe above list has already been forwarded to Mr. Robertson, your Inspector for Saskatchewan. I understand that he approves of it. My purpose in writing the present letter is to urge upon you the necessity of immediate action so that these repairs will be completed before the children come back in September.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJOP:LS\n\nJ.

Plourde, O.M.I., has forwarded the attached list of building materials which he states are required for repairs to the building which will be used as training center in domestic science at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School.\n\nOn the occasion of my recent visit to the school I remember that you showed me the building which you intended to use for this purpose and I was under the impression that very little expenditure, if any, would be necessary to put it in good condition for the purpose for which it is intended.\n\nAs you are no doubt aware an amount of $1000.00 was provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and new equipment at the Qu'Appelle School and if the lumber and cement requested on the attached statement were secured no other amount would be available during the balance of the current fiscal year.\n\nI would appreciate your reviewing the attached list and also giving the matter further consideration with a view to determining if the proposed expenditure on this building could be greatly reduced.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir: Re: your letter #114-0-5 Aug. 25.\n\nI beg to inform you that, in answer to the above mentioned letter, the building material concerned therein was not only for the repairing of the building to be used as a training center in Domestic Science, because I pointed out to Reverend Father Plourde that we needed to fix the Chicken Coop, an old building which I showed you. We also need to improve the ventilation of the Cow Stable for the health of the Dairy Cows and to avoid to us every year some expense to fix the sidings that puff out and every winter are spoiled by the condensation of the stable which is too poorly isolated; to fix as well the hired men's quarters that are in very bad condition and so cold that they cannot be used in the winter time.\n\nSo I did not think that the amount of $943.20 for which your authority was asked in Father Plourde's letter was too high. If your desire is that most of those expenses for which estimates were given last fall for the present fiscal year be postponed, I am ready to obey your orders or suggestions, but I had understood that you wished to see us train the children in the care of poultry raising.\n\nMoreover, I had already taken on my own current money the expenses incurred by the moving and the necessary improvements of the slaughter house.\nFor this as well as for the other improvements or repairs that I am constantly making, I did not claim any reimbursement. My policy is to ask help from your Department only to assist me to carry on these expenses with a little share taken by each of us.\n\nConsequently, I followed your suggestion and reviewed the list of materials sent to you, and propose that you authorize us for an expenditure of the amount which you think suitable to help us, for instance; the sum of $95.00 for the chicken coop; $95.00 for the training center in Domestic Science; another $95.00 for the hired men's rooms and the balance for these repairs will be afforded by me.\n\nWe will leave the work at the stable for another year as well as the engineer's home.\n\nI expect that this plan will receive from you your kind consideration, and that I will be able to improve our needs without taxing too much the amount of $1000.00 that the Department has appropriated for the current year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM. de Bretagne,\nC.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 6, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo I have carefully noted your explanation regarding the list of building materials requested for use at the Qu'Appelle Residential School.\n\nI forwarded you the list of materials in my letter of the 25th ultimo but you did not return it with your letter. Please send it back to me and arrangements will be made to purchase the articles shown on that list.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev.

It is in very bad shape, the dough coming out through the crevices and worn-out points. The machine is not worth repairing\u2014in fact it is impossible to repair it.\n\nThe Principal informed me that he placed a dough mixer in the 1938-39 Estimates and he asks me to make my best effort to secure one for him, as in addition to its leaking, the rust detaches itself and gets mixed up in with the dough.\n\nIf funds are available, I would recommend that this be supplied.\n\nAn estimate on dough mixer is attached. This estimate has been furnished by the Fletcher Manufacturing Company, 877 Dundas Street, Toronto 8, Canada. The machine described would answer this purpose.\n\nI would also draw your attention to the fact that the mixer suggested has a motor attached. This would do away with using a gas engine in a room close to fire and thus reduce the fire hazard.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nfor Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nJR/FMc\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am informed that it was damaged beyond repair. It was only with great difficulty that it was used up to the present time. It should also be stated that the mixer had been in use for over 20 years when the school was destroyed by fire. Father de Bretagne has asked several firms to repair this mixer and none of them were willing to undertake the job.\n\nIt would therefore seem that a new mixer is required and I hope that you will be able to supply one in the immediate future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Be sure that I will settle immediately that question with that Company.\n\nAfter reception of your letter I have checked the files and found that when I was in France last winter a bulb for Tungar lamp had been ordered and was never paid. When the General Electric claimed payment from you last August you have indeed sent me a letter about their accounts, but I did not follow your demand to return to you these accounts for payment after having signed them, because one was wrongly addressed to me instead of Lestock School and the other because I could not trace its origin having been ordered by somebody else than me during my absence and I did not want to see you paying any wrong account.\n\nWishing that these explanations be sufficient I would appreciate that you accept my apologies about the trouble I might have been the cause of.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nRev.
