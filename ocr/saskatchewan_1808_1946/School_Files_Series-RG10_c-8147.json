In the past two years this school has had an attendance larger than the number provided for in the estimates and payment in full has always been made until now. When I wrote to you on the 16th February, 1870, about the estimates for the current year, I pointed out that the average attendance at that time was 48.\nWinnipeg,\n\nSir,\n\nAs you were informed, the temporary mission was not before you at the time when the estimates were being prepared, but this accident we hope does not hinder it impossible to pay now the grant that has been so well earned. It is but $60 per capita at the best, and thus it seems to act down without action (for it practically amounts to that since the larger grants had been paid during previous quarters) and the balance left after personally the cost of carrying on the school, is not to be thought of. We by this letter to urge our representations to them of the Commissioners, and to urge that the necessary amount of money be provided.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAndrew B.

The actual number on the roll for this Dept. was 56 pupils with an average attendance of 32.66 but the grant was only paid for the number last mentioned.\n\nThe amount paid for the Dept. 24 was $4414.25 being for the average attendance on 42 pupils which was 27.73.

Territories for school purposes, possible to provide at $60 per capita for 50 pupils at the Crowfoot School during the remainder of the fiscal year; and have therefore to inform you that you may authorize that number of pupils to be admitted, on the understanding that the Dept will pay at the usual rate of $60 per capita, based on the average attendance shown by the quarterly returns from that school.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\nThe Rev. Andrew B. Laird\nWinnipeg\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd inst., relative to the propriety of this Office granting of the per capita allowance of $60.00 to more pupils than the number estimated for in the estimates of the Deptt. for the fiscal year, which were voted by Parliament in regard to which matter you state that you have heard from the Indian Commissioner for the N.W. Territories that he has written to the Deptt. to provide the means, if possible, for an additional number of children to be paid for at the above rate.\n\nIn\nTo reply I beg to inform you that I have this day advised the Indian Comm. that it will be possible to provide for 50 pupils at the per capita rate above stated at the Crowfoot Boarding School for the balance of the current fiscal year and that he may authorize that number to be admitted on the understanding that the Debt will pay the usual per capitiation grant on the average attendance shown by the quarterly returns received from the institution.\n\nYr Obt Slt\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 2nd inst: enclosing, for report, various requests made by the Presbyterian Church, to enable it to carry on its educational work among the Indians during the fiscal year 1891-'92, embodied in a letter from the Rev. A. B. Baird, and in reply to report as follows:\n\n1st. $1700.00 for completion of school building at Crowstand.\n\nIn connection with this it is observed that Mr. Baird states that the Supt. General promised a grant of $1000.00 and that it is found that the new building will cost $2700.00, also that the Church has already expended $2700.00 in the erection of buildings for this school. This being so, the additional grant of $1700.00 if allowed, will represent a contribution, on the part of the Department, of one half the cost of buildings, or the proportion of the cost of buildings for schools of this class, which I have recommended in my suggestions for the government.\n\nThe Deputy of the\n\nSupt. Gen'l of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\ngovernment of Indian schools, to be borne by the Department, and I would therefore beg to recommend the grant to its favourable consideration.\n\n2nd. Birtle for new building and purchase of land in connection $10,000.00. This sum I have included in my Estimates, because, although to recommend a grant for more than half the buildings would be inconsistent with the rule hereinabove referred to, I am led to believe there is some special understanding with regard to this school, between the Superintendent General and the Church.\n\n3rd. Increase of number of pupils to whom per capita grant is given in the Industrial Schools so as to make the number equal to the probable average attendance, for Crowstand, 75; Round Lake, 55; Muscowetung or Lake's End, 40; File Hills, 30; Birtle, 30; Portage la Prairie, 12; Edmonton, 12.\n\nI have placed opposite the numbers asked for by the Church, those which I think provision should be made for.\n\nWith regard to this, it may be observed that these schools are not Industrial, but belong to the class of Boarding schools on or contiguous to Reserves.\n\nAs Department is aware, fault has had to be found\nwith overcrowding at Crowstand school, and it is not considered that including the new building, there will be proper accommodation for more than 50 pupils, therefore I am unable to recommend that more than that number be provided for in the estimates.\n\nIt has to be remembered too that the substitution of these schools for Day schools on Reserves is a measure still in the tentative stage, and that the Department can not be expected to at once provide for the boarding of all the children who could be secured.\n\nIt seems moreover that in calculating upon the probable attendance at these Boarding schools, sufficient allowance has not been made for the necessity, and difficulties in the way of filling the Industrial School, about to be opened in this neighborhood.\n\nShould this school prove the success which is hoped, the Department would doubtless see fit to enlarge its accommodation, and it would be far better policy to direct our efforts to getting as many children as possible into it, where they would enjoy, among other superior advantages, that of being at a greater distance from their Reserves, than would be the case were they at the Boarding schools.\n\n4th. That the per capita grant be increased from $60 per annum to at least $75.\n\nWith regard to this I beg to inform the Department that in a letter addressed to me by the Rev. Mr. Baird, on 7th inst.: he requested permission to withdraw this request.\nrequest, and to substitute the following, viz:\n\n(a) That the Birtle and Crowstand schools be raised from the rank of schools receiving $60 per caput, to that of schools receiving $100 per caput, as is the case with the schools at Elkhorn, St. Paul's &c., and along with this, of course, that they be required to meet the conditions required of such schools.\n\n(b) That our other schools which receive now $60 per caput, namely, Lake's End (i.e., Muscowetung's), Round Lake and File Hills, receive, in addition, a grant towards the payment of Teacher's salary, to the amount of $300 per annum, for any number of pupils under 25, and an addition $300 if the number exceeds 25.\n\nThe object in making this change of request is said to be to enable the proposed increase to follow the lines along which the Department is already acting, and so avoid the establishment of an altogether distinct class of schools.\n\nWith regard to the original and alternative proposition, I beg to remark that I am unable to recommend that the Birtle and Crowstand schools be raised to the rank of those receiving a per caput grant of $100.\n\nThe force of the argument that there is too great a difference between the $60 and the $100 grant cannot be admitted, because the first cost of instituting the branches of trade instruction required, in return for the higher grant, seems to be lost sight of, also that much more is exacted in other directions, such as better clothing and a larger staff of Teachers.\nThe intention in giving a grant of $300 towards the salary, as proposed in my suggestions already referred to, was to provide for the payment of tuition given to day scholars, for whom the boarders' per capita grant made no provision, and I can not resist the feeling that it would have been well to have limited the assistance to boarding schools off Reserves to $60 because all the Denominations now have Industrial schools, to which children can be sent for higher education, nor do I see why the Department should bear the whole cost of the maintenance of the Boarding schools.\n\nSince however the Superintendent General has decided that the grant for boarders in schools on Reserves where day scholars attend shall be $60 per annum, and the fixed salary for the Teacher shall be $300 in addition, it does seem that in order to preserve equality of treatment between such schools and Boarding schools off the Reserves receiving the $60 but no Teacher's salary, some new plan has to be devised. After much consideration I have decided to suggest, with a view to meeting the altered circumstances, the following change of my suggestions as already laid before the Department, viz: that all Boarding schools on or adjacent to Reserves receive the $60 grant.\n\nThat for payment of Teacher's salary the per capita grant of $12 as provided under the old Orders-in-Council, be reverted to, and that this be given irrespective of the $60, whether for boarders or day scholars attending boarding schools.\nThis would do away with the objection that the fewer the boarders the larger the per capita grant proportionately becomes through the allowance of the fixed Teacher's salary of $300 per annum.\n\nThe following will show the application of the comparative methods of payment.\n\n10 pupils at $60 & salary of $300,-allowance of $30 per cap.\n12 do. do. 75 do.\n15 do. do. 70 do.\n20 do. do. 65 do.\n10 $30 do. do. 90 do.\n12 do. do. 85 do.\n15 do. do. 80 do.\n20 do. do. 75 do.\n\nOn the system now proposed all Boarding schools would receive $72 per cap.\n\n10 pupils at $60 & salary $12 per cap,-allowance of $72 per cap.\n12 do. do. 72 do.\n15 do. do. 72 do.\n20 do. do. 72 do.\n\nwhich is almost the sum asked for by the Church authorities.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nCommissioner.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa 9th April 1871\n\nMemorandum\n\nThe second paragraph of the Indian Commissioner's letter of the 31st ultimo is by no means clear, and in order to understand what he wishes to convey to the Department it is necessary to refer to the letter from the Rev. Dr. Baird.\n\nThe facts appear to be that the Presbyterian Church finished, at its own cost, one school building at Crowfoot for which the sum of $2700.00 was expended. This building did not afford the necessary accommodation, and the Superintendent General seems to have promised Dr. Baird that\n\nTo the Deputy Minister of Indian Affairs\nthat $1,000 would be provided by the Department toward the construction of the new building. It appears now however, that this new building which was originally intended to be two stories in height would not afford the accommodation necessary owing to the increase in the number of pupils, and Dr. Reid states that the church committee were induced by officers of the Indian Dept. and by the necessity to add another story to the building, which cost, when finished, $2,700. (the same amount as the original cost) and Dr. Reid now wishes to receive the sum promised him by the Committee $1,000 and a further grant of $700 in all $2,700 and thus the cost of both buildings will be borne in equal proportions by the Government and the Church authorities.\n\nWith\nWith respect to the Commissioner's table of the cost per capita, in the four cases last cited in his letter, the calculations appear to be correct.\n\n\\[10 \\times 60 = 600 + 10 \\times 12 = 120 = 720 \\div 10 = 72.00\\]\n\n\\[12 \\times 60 = 720 + 12 \\times 12 = 144 = 864 \\div 12 = 72.00\\]\n\n\\[15 \\times 60 = 900 + 15 \\times 12 = 180 = 1080 \\div 15 = 72.00\\]\n\n\\[20 \\times 60 = 1200 + 20 \\times 12 = 240 = 1440 \\div 20 = 72.00\\]\n20th April 1891\n\nMemorandum\nTo the Deputy Minister\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nIn answer to the\nMinister's Inquiry as to the\neffects the change in the\ncapitation grants to\nboarding schools in Manitoba\nand the North West Territories\nwill affect the estimates of\nthe current year if carried out\nin the manner indicated by\nthe Indian Commissioner, the\nfollowing facts are submitted:\n\n1.

Andrew B. Baird, one of the Joint Commissioners of the Synod of the Presbyterian Church in Manitoba and the North West Territories, submitting a copy of a communication made by him to the Indian Commissioner at Regina, in which he makes certain suggestions in respect to additional assistance which it is considered by the Presbyterian Church should be given them to enable them to carry on the educational work with Honourable Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nwhich that Church has charged itself among the Indians, during the next fiscal year.\n\nThe undersigned also submits herewith, a letter of the 31st ultimo from the Indian Commissioner, reporting upon the application made by the Presbyterian Church for additional grants through Mr. Baird; first, with regard to the $7500 asked for completion of the school building at Crow's Head, Coles Reserve, Treaty 4, the Rev. Mr. Baird states that it will cost $17,000 in addition to the $10,000 which he says the Superintendent General promised him towards the completion of the building and that the Church has already expended $2,500 on the buildings at that point. He, therefore, applies that this amount of $7,500 be estimated for and paid by the Department.\nDepartment to equalize the cost of the buildings between the Church and the Department when the buildings are completed being $2,700 each, and the total amount to the gross sum of $5,400.\n\nThe undersigned concurs in the view of the Indian Commissioner, that this proposition is a fair one, and should be acceded to by the Department.\n\nThe second proposal made by Mr. Board is, that a new building for the Boarding School at Birle be erected and land purchased in connection therewith, at a cost of $10,000. The Indian Commissioner states that he had included this sum, for the above purpose, in his estimates, inasmuch as he had been informed that there was some special understanding respecting the schools between the\nThe Superintendent General and the Presbyterian Church.\n\nThe third proposition made by Mr. Baird is that the number of pupils at the various Boarding schools to whom a per capita grant is given be increased so as to make the number admissible there to equal to the probable average attendance.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner recommends in the case of all Boarding schools, excepting two, namely those at Lake's End (formerly Muscowpetung) and Birtle (which are recommended both by Mr. Baird and by the Commissioner) for 40 and 30 pupils respectively, a reduction in the number of pupils asked for. For instance: at Crow Island Mr. Baird asks for 75, and Mr. Reid recommends 50. At Round Lake, Mr. Baird asks for 65, Mr. Reid recommends 42.\nAt File Hills Mr. Baird asks for 30, Mr. Reid recommends 12.\nAt Fortage Laprairie Mr. Baird asks for 12, Mr. Reid recommends 10.\nAt Edmonton Mr. Baird asks for 12, Mr. Reid recommends 10.\n\nMr. Reid bases his recommendations on the amount of accommodation that can properly be given at the several institutions and which he thinks would be sufficient for the numbers recommended by Mr. Baird, and that the reduced numbers are as large as the buildings will accommodate. The Indian Commissioner further states that the substitution of Boarding schools for Day schools is still in the tentative stage, and the Department should not be expected, therefore, to at once provide for the boarding of all children who could be secured.\n\nWith\nWith regard to the foregoing reasons given by Mr. Reed for not allowing the number of pupils asked for by Mr. Baird, the undersigned considers that his first reason is a sound one; for, as alleged by him, there is not sufficient accommodation for the additional pupils asked for by Mr. Baird, permission to increase the number of resident pupils to that applied for by Mr. Baird should not certainly be granted; but he can not agree with the second reason therefore, as the undersigned holds that the Department should be prepared to provide for as many Indian children at the Boarding schools as can be obtained, and as are suitable for being received thereat.\n\nThe third reason given by Mr. Reed for not allowing a greater number at the various Boarding schools is probably also...\nalso worthy of consideration, namely, that the Presbyterian authorities have not in their calculations as to the probable attendance at the Boarding schools, taken into account the recent establishment of the Industrial school at Regina, in regard to which Mr. Reed very properly remarks that, if it should prove a success, the accommodation thereof should be enlarged, and the efforts of the Department directed to obtain as many children as possible for it.\n\nThe fourth proposition made by Mr. Baird is, that the per capita grant at the Boarding schools at Berilo and Elwoodland be increased from $60 to $100 per annum, the rate paid at the schools at St. Paul's, Elkboro, &c., and that the other Boarding schools in receipt of $60 per caput, namely, those\nthose at Lake's End, Round Lake, and Ojib Hills, receive in addition $300 per annum each towards the teacher's salary, for any number of pupils under 25 and an additional $300 if the number exceeds 25. In connection with this proposition the Indian Commissioner remarks that he is unable to recommend that the schools at Birch and Crowstand be put upon the same footing as regards capitation allowance, as the schools at Elk Horn, St. Paul's, etc., inasmuch as at this latter class of schools branches of instruction in trade are required and better clothing and a larger staff of teachers than are expected at schools such as that at Birch and Crowstand. The Indian Commissioner further remarks in connection with\nwith the proposition to pay at\nthe other Presbyterian Boarding\nschools, a salary to the teacher,\nbesides the fuel and rent allowance,\nthat a precedent for doing this\nhas been established in connection\nwith schools of the semi-\nBoarding type on Reserves where\nDay scholars also attend, and\nthat it would seem proper,\nin order to preserve equality\nof treatment between the latter\nschools and the Boarding schools\non the Reserves, which receive\nthe $60 grant but no teacher's\nsalary, that some new plan\nshould be devised; and he sug-\ngests that all Boarding schools\non or adjacent to Reserves, be-\nsides the $60 capitation grant\nfor boarders, be allowed $12\nper pupil, as was formerly\nthe case with the ordinary\nDay schools, on the average\nattendance, so whether the pupils\nare Boarders or Day scholars.\nthat attend the Boarding schools. This, he states, will do away with the objection that the fewer the boarders the larger the per capita grant proportionately becomes through the allowance to the teacher of a fixed salary of $300 per annum.\n\nIn connection with the two systems last referred to, the Indian Commissioner submits a comparative statement, and according to the method now recommended by him for adoption, the amount that would be received at the various Boarding schools, whether on or off Reserves, both as regards per capita and salary allowance, would be dependent upon the number of pupils boarding thereat, as shown by the returns received from those schools.\nThe per capita allowance would be the same at each institution, namely, $172 per annum.\n\nThe undersigned is favorable to the system of payment proposed by the Indian Commissioner and he begs to recommend the adoption of the same.\n\nF.

The minister of justice directs me to refer you to the similar case of the late Chief Indian Orphanage at Monctonville. It appears that the object of your department in this case is the same as it was in the case of the grant made in aid of that institution.\n\nViz.:\nViz., to ensure that the property shall not, without the consent of the Superintendent General, be dedicated to other uses than those at present contemplated. If this be so the minister thinks that, unless some special reason to the contrary exists, the plan of securing this object which was adopted with reference to the Orphanage at Kenleyville had better be followed in this case, i.e., when the letters patent for the site of the building are issued a condition should be inserted in them providing that the lands shall not, without\nwithout the consent of the Superintendent General, be issued for any purpose other than that of an Indian Boarding School.\n\nHave the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

VanKoughnet Esq.\nDeputy Chief General of Indian Affairs\nCertified Copy of a Report of a Committee\nHonorable the Privy Council, approved by\nHis Excellency the Governor General in\nCouncil, on the 27th June 1891\n\nOn a Report dated\n8th June 1891, from the\nSuperintendent General\nof Indian Affairs stating\nthat application has\nbeen made by Presbyterian\nChurch authorities for\na Contribution from Govern-\nment Funds of $1000\ntowards an addition to\nits buildings at Crooked\nnear Cote's Reserve, in the\nDistrict of Assiniboia,\nN.W.T which are used\nfor an Indian Boarding\nSchool.\n\nTo the Honorable\nThe Minister Superintendent\nGeneral of Indian Affairs\nSchool.\n\nIt is stated that the building erected by the Church some years ago cost about $3500 and that the present addition will cost about the same amount. The object of the enlargement is to provide additional accommodation, the present buildings being inadequate to properly accommodate all the resident pupils. The necessary funds for the required contribution can be provided from the school vote for the current year without crippling the...\nthe other calls which may be made upon it.\n\nThe minister therefore recommends that authority may be given for the payment to the authorities of the Presbyterian Church of the $1000 referred to so soon as they may have submitted to the Department of Indian Affairs receipted vouchers showing that that sum at least has been expended by them in the erection of the contemplated building.\n\nThe minister further states that the necessary security on the property for\nfor the grant will be taken,\nas has been done in other\nsimilar cases. The attached\nletter from the Department\nof Justice indicates the\nmanner in which the sec-\nurity will be taken.\n\nThe Committee advise\nthat authority be granted\nas recommended.\n\n[Signature]\n\nClerk of the Privy Council\nIt will be necessary, as specified by the order in Council, that the Authorities of the Presbyterian Church who have the work at Cornwall under their control shall furnish the Vouchers for the Expenditure of that amount. It was intended that the grant should be made from 1890-91 but it depends altogether upon when the work has been done whether the course can be followed. If the work was done before the 30 June the surplus funds for 90-91 can be utilized but if not the charge must be made to 1891-92. I anticipate no great difficulty in providing funds from 91-92 or if necessary and the only action at present is to have the Church provide the proper vouchers.\n\n[Signature]\n\n13/7/191\nSir,\n\nReferring to my letter of 31st March last, and Department's reply thereto, of 24th April, have I the Department's authority to advise all concerned that the method of computation for the Payment of combined Day and Boarding Schools, will be after the manner suggested in letter from this office above referred to?\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner.\n\nThe Deputy of the\n\nSupt.

H. Forget, Esq.,\nAssistant Commissioner of Indian Affairs\nfor Manitoba and the North West Territories,\nRegina.\nall will go on as it should do.\n\nThese are matters in which the exercise of a little tact on the part of Agents should, without difficulty, exact what is really necessary, and yet avoid friction.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) Hugh Ross.\nSir,\n\nI beg to call your attention to the following remarks made by Dr T.A. Patrick in Appendix \"C\" of his report to you of the 18th ultimo, being a report of an inspection of the premises of the Crowfoot Mission School made during his recent visit to the Fort Pelly Reserve in October last, and I have to request that you will use your best endeavours to see that the necessary steps are taken to have the defects complained of remedied.\n\n\"Boys Dormitory - Dusty and untidy but somewhat better than when last inspected.

An examination of the pipe will certainly disclose rotting sewage soaked wood and evidence of the escape of slope from the pipe into the surrounding soil especially beneath the floor of the building. The existence of the sink and sewer in its present state during weather so all warm is a menace to the health of all occupants of the building. That part of it connected with the house should be immediately removed together with any soil beneath the floor which has been contaminated by leakage from the pipe. The rest of the sewer should be removed next spring at latest.\n\nWater Supply. This hauled from the Assiniboine river in barrels. Barrels were clean. This water is generally filtered if used for drinking. The filter used is constructed so as to pass the water through a sponge and some gravel. The filtering may clarify but will not purify impure water. This river appears to be the only available supply at present. Its relative purity depends on the season of the year, and any occasional sources of contamination. As it flows through a comparatively unsettled country the presumption is in favour of its being free from that commonest of water conveyed infection Typhoid. When there is reason to suspect any contamination it should be boiled before being used as drinking water.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy of the Supt Genl.\n\nOf Indian Affairs.\nOttawa 20th Novr 1893\n\nRevd Sir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith copy of a letter addressed to Mr W.E.Jones Indian Agent Fort Pelly embodying certain remarks made by Dr Patrick in his report of an inspection of the Crowstand Mission School which is conducted under the auspices of your Society.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy of the Supt Genl.\nOf Indian Affairs.\n\nRevd A.B.Baird B.D.\nWinnipeg Man.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of our letter of the 8th instant, enclosing Voucher No 1814 R in favour of Dr T.A.

H.G. Baird Esq.\nManitoba\nMay\n\nFeb. 8th 1894\n\nDear Mr. Baird,\n\nI have just been informed by our Agent at Fort Pelly that the Principal of the Crow Creek Boarding School at Cote Bay when buying beef from Indians pays them partly in provisions at a reasonable advance over the market value on each cow, tapering off, charging 10% profit, that the balance is given them in Charity Clothing. Would it not be arranged that articles purchased from Indians might be paid them in cash or if this is not possible that an advance be made, when the price is high.\n\nThe Agent also states that Mr. Wright who was a good Superintendent has been replaced.\nreplaced by a brother of the Principal who is said to be a mechanic, but as the boys are not being taught any trade, the Report cannot see what practical benefit a mechanic will be to the School.\n\nIn what budget days it would appear that frequent change of Teachers has had a bad effect that the Principal does not devote sufficient time and attention to the advancement of the pupils under his charge.\n\nMuch mischief has ensued in view of the complaints which reaches us, that strenuous efforts should be made to send more children to the Regina Industrial School.\n\n[Signature]\nTo the Deputy Supt. Gen. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMy last mail brought me a letter from Prof. Baird in which he requests me to answer charges made against me by Mr. Agent Jones. Mr. Jones says that in paying Indians for beef, I do not give them cash and that I make exorbitant profits on my goods. To begin with, I may explain as I did very fully to Inspector...\nWadsworth during his visit to the school last spring, that since coming here I have never been able to purchase anything on a cash basis. When I came here I was at great expense, having to purchase an outfit of farm implements, horses and other things for use in and about the school for which there was not grant from city, Church or Government. So that until the present time although I have put every dollar that I have received salary and all except my bare living expenses into school financing, I have not been able to pay.\nIndians or anyone else cash. But I was quite ready to give them orders on any of the traders and the traders are willing to wait three months for the cash. My only reason for giving the Indians 'credit' was that they asked for it and preferred it to orders. And when I gave them goods I felt that I should not go very much below the traders prices. I therefore charged fifty cents per pound for Black Tea and Two Dollars and seventy-five cents per sack for flour, Strong Baker's Brand. The price of the tea is the\nregular retail price in Yorkton. I am told that some of the traders up here charge a good deal more. As for the flour Mr. Jones himself in paying the Indians for work charges at the rate of three dollars for the same brand of flour, and all the traders around here and at Pelly charge at least the same amount. As for the clothing sent by the ladies of the W.F.M.S., most of our missions now act on the principle that Indians when able should pay for it. I do not see that it makes any difference whether we receive\nfor it labor, or wood or beef.\n\nNow as to the beef, I refused two good offers of beef last fall from ranchers in this vicinity in order to give our market altogether to our Indians. I have given the Indians a cent a pound more than I was offered my beef for last fall.\n\nThe Agent thanks me for this by giving to you the false and very unfair statement which you quoted to Prof. Baird.\n\nFor your own satisfaction I will now give you a statement of the beef that I have purchased from Indians this winter with a list of the goods he given for it.\nDec 9th 1894 - McBurnie\n\nOr by 405 lbs Beef @ 5\u00a2  $20.25\nOr to Order on Mr. Jones 5.00\n\" John Beverley 4.00\n\" 1 sack Flour 2.75\n\" 1 lb.

The woman could have taken all in order but she preferred the above arrangement and I do not mind giving it the widest publicity.\nDec. 26th Mrs Robert Kelly\n\nOr by 1/8 lbs Beef 5.90\nOr to 1 lb. Tea .50\n\" 5 lbs Sugar .50\n\" 3 lbs Rice .25\n\" 4 lbs Apples .50\n\" 3 bars Royal Crown Soap .25\n\" 3 yards Clot .50\n\" 5 yds Grey Cotton .50\n\" 5 yds Flannelette .40\n\" 1 Flannel Shirt .50\n\" Order on E.A.W.R. McKenzie 1.00\n\nI got some beef from Chief Cota but it was an exchange for other beef that I had lent him. I also got some from Mr. Friddle but as he does not require a permit I do not suppose that\nThe details of my exchange with him would be of interest. I think that this is the whole history of my beef trading.\n\nThis is a very unfair charge and I think Mr. Jones should have made more careful inquiry before making it. I am quite satisfied that I have acted quite honestly, and now, I am satisfied that the gain has been more on the side of the Indian than on mine. It is also a very serious charge and I hope that the whole matter will be sifted and settled.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.W. Whyte\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter containing complaints made by the Agent at Fort Pelley against the Principal of the Crowstand Boarding School.\n\nIn the matter of the charge about selling provisions and clothing to the Indians, in some cases at a considerable advance over the market value, I may say that I wrote to the Rev Mr Whyte and he, misunderstanding my instructions, sent his reply direct to you instead of transmitting it through me. Upon that point therefore I say nothing further.\n\nYour letter goes on to say - \"The Agent also states that Mr Wright, who was a good practical man, has been replaced by a brother of the Principal, who is said to be a Machinist; but as the boys are not being taught any trades, the Department cannot see what practical benefit a Machinist will be to the school.\" In reply I have to say that Mr Wright has been promoted to the charge of the school at Rolling River and Mr J.S. Whyte who takes his place at the Crowstand, was appointed as being a practical farmer. He was, I am told, trained on a farm in his boyhood and the days of\nHis young manhood, and is thoroughly competent to act in the position in which he is engaged as Farm Instructor. The fact that he is a competent Machinist should not operate to his disadvantage, since he spends a portion of his time in teaching the boys the use of tools.\n\nThe Agent complains of the frequent change of teachers. We confess that the changes have been frequent, and that they cannot but have had a harmful effect upon the school; but much as we deplore them, we are powerless to prevent them, and we can only hope that they will be much less frequent in the future.\n\nThe Agent also complains that the Principal does not devote sufficient time and attention to the advancement of the pupils under his charge. By our instructions the Principal, who is a Clergyman, is appointed as Missionary to the Indians on the Reserve. His duties are assigned to him by us, and by our instructions he is to give all the time that is required to his work as a Missionary. His duties as Principal involve merely a supervision of the school and a direction of its general policy. We have appointed a teacher, a matron, a farm instructor and an instructress in sewing to do the detailed work in the management of a school which has about thirty pupils; and it does not seem to us that any fault need be found with the Principal on the ground alleged.\n\nIn the further matter of the question of sending more children\nAt the Regina Industrial School, I have only to say that our instructions to the Principal and his staff are to transfer as large a number as possible to that Institution.\n\nIn view of the fact that so many charges of a personal character are made against the Principal of the school - some of them in regard to duties which he was never expected to perform, and others involving statements which he seems able to disprove - is it not possible that such charges have their foundation in personal animus, rather than in a single hearted desire for the welfare of the Indians?\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Deputy Sup't General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, ONT.\nW. E. Jones Esq.\nIndian Agent\nFort Reliance\nN. W.T.\n\nApril 13th 1894\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of a letter from Mr. Red W. Baird of the Presbyterian missionary society of Winnipeg in regard to certain complaints made by you respecting the management of the Government Boarding School & Mr. White Principal of that mission.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nSchool Branch\n\nPoveshell School\nKamack, July 20th 1894.\n\nThe Dept. Sup't Gen. J. Indian Affairs\n@ Ottawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nA few days ago Mr. Jones showed me a communication from the Department giving a statement of the money sent me for each child by which it appears that for any over the number thirty-five only a very small amount is given. I had always been under the impression that the limit of thirty-five applied to the average attendance and Mr. Jones himself thought...\nso and had led me to believe\nthat such was the case.\nHowever I think the Department\nhas made a mistake in including\nNo 52 Robert Kitchenovia\nwho was reported as\ndischarged in the return\nfor the quarter ending\nDec. 31st 1893. I think I\nshould receive something\nfor a child who would take\nhis place. I spoke to Mr. Jones\nabout this but he said the\nDepartment never refunds\nanything in a case of that\nkind. I can hardly believe\nthis to be true and I therefore\nam writing you on the subject.\nMr. Jones even spoke as if it were a compliment on his part toward me to let me know anything about the communication and the children in school who were not drawing any allowance for board.\n\nAnd I may say here that this is a sample of the way Mr. Jones acts toward me on most occasions. Sometimes he is even insulting. Lately I have felt compelled to appeal to our committee on account of his abuse on the 8th of June last when in the presence of his Clerk, he told me that he would not accept my statement nor\nwould he believe me in my affidavit. I suppose the Deputy knows that Mr. Jones has charged me before with a general term, with misappropriation of funds, making untrue statements about school work, play & attendance, ill-health & over-charging Indians, want of desire to keep school premises in order etc. The Inspector looked into a number of things that Mr. Jones made complaint about and I think that his report is decidedly in my favor. In almost every case Mr. Jones' complaints have been quite misleading.\nIn the matter of school attendance Mr. Jones has, so far as I know, done very little to get children to attend or to keep them in attendance. Of the twenty seven children admitted to the school since I came here only one that I know of was procured through Mr. Jones' assistance. Mr. Jones has often talked against the school in the presence of Indians and in cases of sickness he has more than once advised parents to keep their children at home. In spite of his advice however some of these have been brought back to the school.\nMr. Jones always declares his friendliness toward the school but I feel that both his words and actions are very often such as to hinder rather than advance the interests of the school.\n\nAsking your kind attention to these matters,\n\nI remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nO.

We have a large and efficient staff of teachers at this school. We have been at a great deal of expense in the erection of buildings that will not be necessary if the proposed change is made. The record of the school is an excellent one, and it has always loyally contributed its share of pupils to the Regina School, as many as forty-five pupils having been transferred from it to Regina.\n\nI cannot help thinking that the proposed change is a mistake, and that, if carried out, will prove injurious to the best interests of the Indians in the Neighbouring Reserve.\nAnd I cannot but regard it as a wrong done to the Church that is engaged in carrying on this work.\n\nI sincerely hope that this proposed reduction will be reconsidered, and that the step will not be taken.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThomas Hart\nWinnipeg, Man.,\n11th April, 1896.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant containing the information that in the Estimates now before Parliament the number of pupils provided for at the Crowstand Boarding School has been reduced from thirty to twenty.\n\nWe have received this information with very great surprise and disappointment, and I am instructed by our Committee to protest strongly against the proposed reduction.\n\nThe grant for thirty pupils has been made for the last seven or eight years and there never has been the faintest suggestion that the Government did not think the money well expended. I need only now refer to the recently published report of the Department of Indian Affairs to show that in the opinion of the Inspector, Mr. Walsworth, the school is now being efficiently carried on, the staff intelligent and enthusiastic, the premises in good\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina.\ngood and orderly condition and the school enjoying the confidence of the Indians.\n\nFrom the same report it appears that there are now forty-two children from the Swan River Agency in the Regina Industrial School. Of these, considerably over thirty have been pupils in the Crowstand Boarding School, from which it appears that it is not surpassed by any school in the Territories as a feeder for the Regina School.\n\nWe ask therefore, both in the interests of the Regina School and in the interests of the Crowstand School, the efficiency of which is seriously threatened, that the proposed reduction be not carried into effect.\n\nI am instructed to say that the making of such reduction without longer notice and without giving any reason, appears to the Committee in the light of a breach of faith; and assuming as we do that the reduction has not been made at your suggestion, we ask you to co-operate with us by writing to the Department at Ottawa and giving such reasons as seem most forcible to you, to show why the proposed reduction should not be carried into effect.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nsgd.

I enclose a list of material which I think will satisfy our needs at present.\n\nMight I also request you to supply with the following\u2014a Globe\u2014a map of the Dominion of Canada\u201410 each No. 1, 2, 3 &c.

Agent Jones. This extension could be put up for about $350.00. It would cover a cistern which is now in position, would provide needed wash room and an outside approach to the second and third flats. The present stove way is in the middle of the building near the furnace and would be almost sure to be useless in case of fire.

The escape, which should have a substantial railing, should start from a platform on the upper story and continue to a second landing on the first story and be carried on to the ground at an opposite angle.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\n\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs:\nRev: Sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th inst: and in reply I beg to say that the school material and kindergarten outfit asked for for the Crowland Boarding school will be ordered from the Government Stationery Office, but I regret to say that the Department has no funds available from which a grant could be made for the proposed extension to the main building to which you refer. It has already contributed $1000 to these buildings on the understanding that the government was to obtain an equal interest in the site on which the buildings are located, but no such transfer has taken place so far, and it is not the policy of the Department to expend money on buildings in which it has no interest. It would therefore be well for you to ask the assistance of the Church authorities towards making the necessary additions. With regard to the present stairway which you state would be unsafe in case of fire, I beg to say that an outside fire escape should once be put up, which should lead from the upper windows to the ground with a landing at the first story, and if the Church authorities cannot find the necessary funds, the work will be done by the Department, as it is very necessary that proper protection in case of fire should be provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

I can assure you that while the rebuilding is going on they will have no facilities for teaching or housing the children, I would therefore most respectfully ask that you grant the Principal's request.

I took up the clue and found that the son of the deceased chief Cote had obtained the liquor for the boys, I followed up the case against two white men of Kamsack, a Doukobor and three Indians and I sincerely hope the Justices will give them their just deserts.\n\nIt seems to me that the school authorities should be able to prevent the possibility of such scandalous occurrences.\n\nJ.A.J.

Mr. McWhinney goes after the boys and in one or two instances has tied ropes about their arms and made them run behind the buggy from their houses to the school. The Indians say that the children are not dogs and that there is danger in the running affecting their health and so there is. I told Mr. McWhinney to stop this at once and he asked me what method he would adopt. I suggested that he obtain your consent to remove one or two of the worst offenders to another school and if this is done I think there will be a change.\n\nThe Principal has also experienced trouble with young men and boys entering the dormitory of the larger girls at night. He has had new fastenings put on the windows and does not expect any further trouble from this source.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\nW.M. Graham,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, July 15, 1907.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nA further report has been received on the Crow-stand Boarding School, in which it is stated that the Principal has been experiencing unusual trouble with his boys of late, who have been running away. The method, however, that he has adopted for putting a stop to this practice is, to put it mildly, most indiscreet. It is stated that Mr. McWhinney goes after the boys and has, in one or two instances, tied ropes about their arms and made them run behind the buggy from their houses to the school. The Indians naturally object to this treatment and say that their children are not dogs and their health is likely to be affected by this running.\n\nMr. McWhinney was advised to stop this procedure at once and he asked what other method he should adopt. From this and the previous report on this school, the purport of which was communicated to you on the 13th inst., the Department is inclined to question the advisability of Mr. McWhinney's being continued in charge of the school. It would like you to give this matter your serious consideration and report the result.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. R.P.

I have already asked our Western Committee in Winnipeg, Rev. Dr. Farquharson, Secretary, to investigate the matter which you reported a short time ago, namely, giving of whiskey by some of the larger boys to the girls of the school, and we have the assurance of the Western Committee that they are taking the matter in hand. We shall also ask this Committee to investigate with regard to the difficulty Mr. McWhinney is experiencing in retaining the boys in the school. I have no doubt but that the Western Committee will investigate the matter thoroughly and will take what action seems necessary in the interests of the school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nActing Secretary\n\nDict. M.B.A.\nDear Mr. Macquarrie,\n\nYour letter is in hand, asking for a full statement of the recent misconduct of some of our pupils in conjunction with graduates from the Reserve. My reason for not speaking of this before was simply my distaste for putting the disgraceful affair on paper, and besides, I did not see that any good could come from so doing. If you had come up, I had intended telling you about it as I also intended telling Mr. Fraser at the next meeting of Presbytery. I do not want you to think I had any desire to conceal anything from the Committee which they had a right to know. I shall give you a full statement of the matter, and if any further investigation is needed, I shall be only too glad to give any assistance I can in the hope that the Committee may give me some assistance in preventing any recurrence of the matter.\n\nTo get at the beginning, it will be necessary to go back before my time. The fall before I came to Crowfoot, a number of the larger girls got out of their dormitories a number of times, meeting outside with several young men from the reserve. One of these was a graduate from our school. One was a graduate of Regina who was working here as farm instructor. The others were young married men from the Reserve. The leaders among the girls were a graduate of Regina who was working in the offices, and I think also an Indian girl who was living here as the adopted daughter of Mr. Gilmore. The young men who were concerned were forbidden to come on the school grounds again while Mr. Gilmore was here. His adopted daughter was sent to a friend at Suitulula and the other girl was discharged.\n\nAbout a year after I came here, some of our own boys and girls succeeded in getting their windows open and getting out, the girls going to the boys dormitory and the boys going to the girls two or three times before they were caught. I employed such means as punishment and individual talks as I thought best to make them see the wrong they had done, and to keep them from doing it again. Since then, extra precautions have been taken to guard against any more trouble. The windows were blocked so that they could only rise a short distance, while the stops were actually nailed on. The doors also were kept locked. The Indian boy or girl, as\nyou may know, yields easily to any impulse or desire and from twelve upwards their passions are peculiarly strong. Thus, although we have seen many pleasing signs of improvement occasionally there would be outbreaks of a restless spirit in some. But on the whole we had much reason to be pleased with the apparent growth of a better moral tone. Last winter was perhaps the most free from anything disagreeable in the conduct of the girls and boys of such a period that I have known since coming here.\n\nOn April 1st, I sent home two of the larger boys to work preparatory to being discharged. They came to the school occasionally during the week and always on Sunday to Sunday School, and also to the evening meeting. Nothing suspicious could be noticed in any of their conduct.\n\nAbout the middle of May, Mr. Blowett, the Indian Agent heard from a young Indian in his employ that something was wrong at the School. Next day, he was able to give me more particulars, and I at once proceeded to investigate. About the beginning of May, two young men from the reserve came to the school one night, and went up to the little girls dormitory, but when they found only little girls they went down again. They told this to the two boys who had just gone home from school, and started them thinking about doing the same. On Sunday night, May 5th, after all the staff were asleep, the two school boys from home accompanied by one of our boys from his own dormitory went up the fire escape to the girls window with a couple of knives and other things, which they passed to the girls, asking them to open the window. Either the girls could not, or would not do it, and the boys went away. The girls had tried or made pretense of trying to open the window. By Thursday following, the boys had got possession of a screwdriver and with it, loosened their own windows, and then passed it to the girls who also loosened theirs, so it would open easily. That night, four of our largest school boys went up to the girls dormitory and stayed for a time. Next night, Friday, May 10th, two boys from the reserve came and went up. One of these was the one who had been deep in the trouble in Mr. Gilmore's time and the same that had gone up to the little girls dormitory a few weeks before. The other was one of the boys I had sent home. This fellow fellow, Campbell Shingosch by name,\nhad a bottle of whisky in his pocket. He gave it to the girls and three\nof them drank some of it. My own opinion is that this having the whisky there,\nwas merely an accident. He did not come up for the purpose of bringing\nit or giving it to the girls. The other boy, Wallace Shingoose and Freddie\nGoto the other boy whom I had sent home came the next night, Saturday, and went\nup to the same dormitory. On Monday night following, four of the girls went\nout and went around to the boys dormitory. The next day I discovered\nthe trouble and of course there was no more.\n\nNow you will ask what has been done to the guilty parties.\nThose who were pupils of the school including the two boys who had gone\nhome to the reserve, I punished. I wanted to get a heavy sentence passed\non the young fellow who had brought the whisky because he is a bad case,\nbut the Agent allowed him to go free on condition of his giving certain\ninformation which led to the conviction of a white man in Massack who had for\na long time been supplying the Indians with whisky. I intend forbidding\nhim to come on the school property for a certain term. I would have liked\nvery much to have prosecuted for house breaking and make an example of him,\nbut dreaded the publicity it would give.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, Mr. Graham, the Inspector of Indian\nAgencies was here and I gave the whole account to him. I suppose it was\nthrough his report it reached the Department.\n\nSince this occurred, I have taken extra precautions to\nprevent any more trouble and everything has been well lately.\n\nIn conclusion, let me repeat what I said before, that I\nshall be pleased to give any necessary assistance to any investigation the\nCommittee may desire to make. I might say too, that Presbytery meets\nhere next week, and I shall lay the whole matter before Mr. Fraser, and the\nother members of the Presbyterial Committee.\n\nI thank you for your kind words of sympathy, and assure\nyou that none of you can know the sore disappointment this whole affair\nhas been to every member of our staff.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs: School Files.\n(RG 10), Volume 6027, File 117-1-1, part 1)\nThe Presbyterian Church in Canada.\n\nOffice - Suite 9\nBank of Hamilton Chambers\nSuite 212 Kennedy Block\n317 Portage Ave\nWinnipeg\n\nJ.D.

I might state that the Committee had no intention of making Mr. Heron's appointment a permanent one, but even if a change were to be made as speedily as possible, it might take a little while to look out the right man for the position.\n\nI will write again after the meeting of the Committee.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJames Farquharson\nSecretary.\nThe Presbyterian Church in Canada.\n\nOffice: Suite 9\nBank of Hamilton Chambers\nSuite 215 Kennedy Block\n317 Portage Ave\nWinnipeg\n\n2nd August, 1907.\n\nRev. Dr. James Farquharson\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary of the Department\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, ONT.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nTwo letters complaining against the management of the Crestand Indian School, are now in my hands; and the Committee of the Synods of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, have appointed a Committee to investigate both matters. The Committee desires me to write requesting you to forward to us copies of the correspondence you have had in connection with the matters. If you do so, it would help the Committee very much in the investigation. We want the whole truth whatever it may be to come out and will do our very utmost to see that it shall come out. Can you help us to this extent?\n\nYours truly,\n\nJames Farquharson\nSecretary\nSynodical Indian Mission Committee\nOttawa, August 7, 1907.\n\nRev. Sirs:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 2nd inst., asking for copies of the correspondence in connection with the complaints against the management of the Crowstand Indian Boarding School I beg to say that the cases referred to were first brought to the notice of the Department in a report on the Pelly Agency, made by our Agent on June 3, last, who, under the heading of \"Temperance and Morality\" said:\n\n\"I regret to say that the drink traffic is still very much in evidence. I discovered that some of our young men (all graduates) had been going in the vicinity of the Crowstand school, so I informed Principal McWhinney, who at once began to investigate, with the result of finding that with the aid of those inside (pupils) the young fellows had been getting into the girls' dormitories and that whiskey had been taken to the girls. I took up the clue and found that the son of the deposed chief Oote had obtained the liquor for the boys, I followed up the case against two white men of Kamsack, a bookbinder and two Indians and I sincerely hope the Justice will give them their just deserts.\"\n\nRev. James Parkehamson, D.D.,\n517 Portage Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Department's Inspector, who visited the school on the 37th June makes the following remarks in his report:\n\n\"The Principal has been experiencing unusual trouble with his boys of late, who have been running away, but I think he has not adopted a wise method for stopping this, in fact, some of the Indians own ing children came to me to complain. Mr. McWhinney goes after the boys and in one or two instances has tied ropes about their arms and made them run behind the buggy from their houses to the school. The Indians say that the children are not dogs and that there is danger in the running affecting their health and so there is. I told Mr. McWhinney to stop this at once and he asked me what method he would adopt. I suggested that he obtain your consent to remove one or two of the worst offenders to another school and if this is done I think there will be a change.\n\nThe Principal has also experienced trouble with young men and boys entering the dormitory of the larger girls at night. He has had new fastenings put on the windows and does not expect any further trouble from this source.\"\n\nThe Secretary of the Foreign Mission Committee, Toronto, was written to on both these matters, and the correspondence received from you shows that you have been advised of the contents of both these letters.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nSecretary.\nThe Committee appointed to enquire into the complaints made by the Indian Department against the Crostland Indian School, met in the Crostland School on Thursday, 8th August, 1907.\n\nThe letters from the Department on Indian Affairs were read and considered. In the opinion of the Committee, these letters should have been accompanied by a copy of the correspondence on which the Department based its complaints, and the names of some parties on whom the Committee appointed to investigate might have called for a statement of facts. Nothing of this kind having been done, the only parties to whom the Committee could apply for information, were the members of the School staff and the Indian Agent.\n\nThe Committee questioned every member of the staff who was within reach, (it being the season for holidays the Teacher and assistant Matron were absent) and had a conversation with the Indian Agent, and found that all were agreed as to the facts regarding the pupils and ex-pupils of the School going to the dormitories of the girls at night. The letter of Mr. McWhinney to the Secretary of the Synodical Indian Mission Committee, dated July 8th, copies of which were sent to the Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs and the Secretary of the Foreign Mission Committee contains all the information the Committee has received, save the opinion expressed by the Indian Agent that such conduct had been going on from time to time during the Winter.\n\nThe Committee learned that a similar occurrence had taken place at the School before the appointment of Mr. McWhinney, the present Principal, and that one of the culprits in the present instance was involved in the former. The Committee learned further from various sources that like occurrences had happened at other Schools.\n\nThe Committee found that the Principal and every member of the staff were deeply grieved at the occurrence, and that the precautions taken to prevent such consisted in having the bedrooms of the members of the staff, (with the exception of that of the Principal who occupies a separate building) close to the dormitories of the boys and girls, the doors of the dormitories locked and the windows so blocked that they could not be raised high enough.\nto permit a child to crawl through. Indeed, the only further precaution anyone could suggest, was to bar the windows with iron rods\u2014a precaution precluded by the danger of fire. The success with which plots of various kinds have been planned and carried through, not only in Indian schools but in schools of all nationalities, compels the Committee to require further evidence before acquiescing in the statement of the latter from the Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs, that the scandalous occurrences reflect seriously on the management of the Institution. The Committee regrets the occurrence exceedingly but does not think there is any blame attaching to the Principal or the staff who did advise him.\n\nComplaints regarding Mr. McWhinney's method of bringing truant boys back to the school.\n\nThe Committee questioned Mr. McWhinney regarding the complaint that he had on one or two occasions in bringing truant boys back to the school, tied a rope to their arms, fastened the rope to his buggy and so compelled the boys to run behind the buggy; and was told that the following are the facts of the case:\n\nThe ringleader of the boys in the case out of which the complaint arose had run away from school four times last year and four or five times this year, and in each case he had induced one or more smaller boys to accompany him; that in the case referred to in the complaint, he had induced two to accompany him, one about his own size and one smaller; that Mr. & Mrs. McWhinney had followed them in the buggy and found them about eight miles from the school in company with the father of the two smaller boys; that Mr. McWhinney told the boys that they must go back with him, that he would take the smallest of them in the buggy, but, as there was not room for all in the buggy, the two larger boys would have to run behind; that arranged thus, all went well until, approaching a bluff half a mile from the starting point, Mr. McWhinney noticed that the boys were preparing to escape; that Mr. McWhinney then stepped, brought the boys to the buggy, tied a rope loosely round the arm of each and drew the rope...\nover the back of the buggy and the seat, but did not fasten it to the buggy in any way; that Mr. McWhinney had not thought of thus tying the rope to the boys until he was face to face with the danger of the boys running away from him after he had found them and thus impairing the discipline of the School.\n\nMr. McWhinney admitted that he had asked Mr. Graham, (whether in the terms quoted in the letter of the Secretary of the Indian Department or not, he was not sure) as to what else he could do; but so far was he from refusing to take Mr. Graham's advice that the question was put with the desire of getting advice; that Mr. Graham did advise him not to tie the boys behind the buggy again, but to get the Indian Commissioner's permission to transfer the unruly boy to a distant school whence he could not get home; and that he, (Mr. McWhinney) had, acting on this advice, requested and got the Commissioner's permission to transfer the boy to another school, and that so far, the threat to do this had proved sufficient to keep the boy at school.\n\nThe Committee agree with the Indian Department that boys should not be brought back to any school tied with ropes, not because to do so is necessarily either cruel or wicked, but partly because to be seen bringing back boys tied thus is all but certain to lead to complaints of cruelty; and even more, because such a practice is in danger of degenerating into cruelty. Whether any particular case is actually wrong, must be determined by its circumstances. There is no doubt of the danger to which the boys would be exposed if the ropes had been made fast to the buggy as well as to the boys; but the ropes were not fastened to the buggy. The Committee can see no cruelty in making boys walk, or even run for reasonable distances. The distance these boys partly walked and partly ran behind Mr. McWhinney's buggy was between seven and eight miles; they could, and did help themselves along by clinging to the buggy; and Mr. McWhinney assured the Committee that the horses trotted slowly when they did trot and that they walked a considerable part of the way.\nThe Matron also gave the Committee the assurance that the boys were none the worse for their experiences behind Mr. McWhinney's buggy.\n\nThe Committee therefore believe that there was no wrong done on this occasion, and it is satisfied, and believes that the Department should be satisfied, with Mr. McWhinney's assurance that this method of securing the boys should not be tried again.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee is convinced that the management of the Crowstand School has been on the whole excellent, and that the School is at present in very good condition.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\n[Signature]\nJames Fraser\nConvenor.\n\nA statement made by Mr. McWhinney regarding the bring back of the truant boys is attached to this paper.\nMr. McPherson's statement regarding\nThe bringing back of the Truant Boys.\n\nGeorge Enkwayas has for at least two years given great trouble by his frequent attempts to run away from the School. In this, he has been encouraged by the sympathy of his parents, and the fact that they make much of him on his return to his home. I have talked both to the parents and to the boy, reasoning with them both as to the wrong and folly of such conduct. This boy's offense is always aggravated by his inducing one or more smaller boys to accompany him in his truancy, and thus exposing their health as well as his own to serious danger, they, often setting out at nights or on wet days, to go a distance of ten miles.\n\nHe ran away at least four times last year and four or five this year. The usual punishment inflicted was whipping. I tried to get his father to punish him but failed. Usually they would bring him back when he went home. I tried to persuade his father to some form of co-operation by which the boy's truancy might be stopped. Shortly afterwards, the boy ran away again, and as on other occasions, persuaded two boys, one about his own size and one smaller, to accompany him. I drove up to the Reserve to look for them. About eight miles from the School, I met the three boys accompanied by the father of the two smaller boys and at once told the boys that they must go back to school with me. As my wife was along with me, there was not room for all in the buggy, so I took the little boy into the buggy and told the two others that they must run behind. At first they were not tied in any way. After going a little distance, while drawing near a bluff, the boys showed unmistakable signs that they were going to make a break for liberty. I stopped and tied a rope loosely around one arm of each and threw the other end of the rope over the back of the buggy and over the seat. The rope was not tied to the buggy in any way. Thus we proceeded to the school, the horses walking or trotting slowly, so that the boys could follow without danger of hurting themselves in any way. Some of the Indians saw us going home and at once reported that the boys were tied to the buggy.\nWhen Mr. Graham the Inspector was here a few weeks later, two Indians complained to him about the matter. He asked me for a statement of what had happened and I told him as it is set down here. He agreed that the boys should be punished and that discipline must be maintained, but advised me not to do anything like the foregoing again, as it might create dissatisfaction among the Indians. This, of course, was my own intention when I saw how the Indians felt. I asked him what method he would advise in dealing with such cases, and he advised me to request the Indian Commissioner to permit me to transfer the boy to some school at such a distance that the boy could not go home from it. I have done this, and the Commissioner has consented to the transference if it should be necessary to take this step. I told the boy and his father about this, and since then, there has been no trouble.\n\nIn answer to questions, Mr. McWhirter said, \"The tying of ropes on the boys' arms and making them run behind the buggy was not intended as a punishment but as a preventative against running away. I asked the boys several times while on the way to school if they were tired, and one of them answered that they were not.\"\nThe Presbyterian Church in Canada.\n\nOffice Suite 9\nSuite 21, Kennedy Building\n317 Portage Ave\nWinnipeg\n\nRev.

Dr. Farquharson, Secretary of the Committee appointed by the Indian Mission committee of the Synod of Manitoba and Saskatchewan to visit the Crowstand school and enquire into its management, has under date of the 16th inst., forwarded a report of this committee, from which it would appear that they exonerate the Principal from the scandalous occurrences that lately took place at that school.\n\nI cannot help expressing the opinion that in their anxiety to whitewash Mr. McWhinney they have used very lame arguments, the principal one being that such occurrences have taken place at other schools. Two wrongs do not make a right, and in my opinion these happenings were preventable with ordinary care and discipline.\n\nThe explanation regarding the Principal's treatment in bringing back deserters is a lame excuse, as there was no occasion for his taking his wife along in the buggy, as she no doubt took up sufficient space to have accommodated the boys that were tied behind.\n\nDr. Farquharson concludes by stating that they sincerely hope that the report will be satisfactory.

I am sorry that my answer in this matter has been delayed considerably beyond the time anticipated. At a meeting of the Committee held a short time ago, I was instructed to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. McLean's letter. While recognizing that the conclusion of your Department was different from that to which our Committee had come to, the Committee was of the opinion that from the letter received, what the Department looked upon that letter as an end of the matter.\n\nIf your Department desires our Committee to do anything else than what has been done, I trust you will write and let me know. There is no doubt in the minds of our Committee that Mr. McWhinney is a very capable and energetic Principal of the School, rather is there any doubt in the minds of the Committee that all was done that could reasonably be expected to be done to prevent such occurrences as those which we all regret at the Crowstand School. In the meantime, I can add nothing to this except possibly refer you to reports some time ago in which this matter was gone into in the way from the standpoint of our Committee. Your letter will be submitted to the Committee on the very first opportunity.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files (RG 10, Volume 6027, File 117-1-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nI beg to say that Rev. W. Mc Whinney, principal of the Crowstand Boarding School has asked me to request you to allow him the privilege of building a telephone line from the School to Kamsack, across the surrendered portion of Cote Reserve. The line will be on the school property until it reaches the Canadian Northern Railway track, from there it will run parallel to the railway line and four feet on the outside of the railway fence, from the south side of the surrendered portion of Cote Reserve to Kamsack.\n\nAbout 1\u00bd miles of the line would be on the surrendered portion of Cote Reserve and the balance would be on School property and on the Road Allowance formerly surrendered to the Government of Saskatchewan.\n\nI cannot see any objection to the line passing through this portion of the reserve providing that the posts are of sufficient height to allow of traffic passing underneath it when roads are opened up. No doubt the telephone would be\nbe a great benefit to Crowstand School and as soon as the line is built from this Office to Kamsack it would give us direct connection with Crowstand.\n\nUnless the Department has some other reason for not allowing the line to pass through the reserve I would suggest that the request be granted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nW.G.

Taking up the clue, he found that the liquor had been supplied by white men at Kamsack.\n\nOn receipt of this report the Department wrote to the Secretary of the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church, requesting him to have a searching enquiry made as to how such a state of affairs could exist in this school and directing that strenuous measures should be taken to prevent their recurrence. The Acting Secretary of the Committee, in acknowledging this letter, stated that he would see that the matter was investigated.\n\nOn the 4th of July a similar report was received from Mr. Inspector Graham, who in addition referred to the trouble the Principal had been experiencing with boys who had been running away and complaining with his method of bringing them back, which was by tying them behind his buggy. The Indians objected to this mode of procedure and the Inspector told the Principal that it should stop at once. The gist of Mr. Graham's report regarding runaways was also communicated to the Secretary.\nof the Foreign Mission Committee, who was asked to give\nthe matter his serious consideration and report the result.\n\nIn this letter the Secretary was informed that\nthe Department was inclined to question the advisability\nof Mr. McWhinney's being continued in charge of the\nSchool. The Indian Commissioner was informed of the\nDepartment's action on the Inspector's report. An\nacknowledgement of the last letter to the Secretary of\nthe Foreign Committee was received, in which it was\nstated that the Western Committee would be asked to\ninvestigate the matter thoroughly and take such action\nas seemed necessary in the interests of the school.\n\nOn July 24 the Secretary of the Western Com-\nmittee forwarded a copy of the Principal's letter to\nhim, giving a full explanation of the scandalous co-\noccurrences at the School and describing what he had done\nto prevent their recurrence.\n\nAnother letter was received from the Secretary\nof the Western Division of the Foreign Committee, stating\nthat both charges in connection with the Crowstand\nschool would be investigated, which was followed by two\nletters to the same effect, the last one dated the 2nd\nof August, making a request for copies of the correspond-\nence the Department had in connection with these matters.\nCopies were sent as requested, but they did not reach\nthe Committee before the investigation took place.\n\nOn August 30 the Committee appointed to\ninquire into these matters made their report, which\nalthough exonerating the Principal was not accepted as\nsatisfactory.\nsatisfactory by the Department, which wrote the Secretary to say that it was of opinion that the facts elicited at the enquiry showed laxity in administration of the school and that the method of dealing with truants displayed a serious error in judgment. No reply having been received to this letter, the Department again wrote stating that it had been awaiting an acknowledgement of its letter, which it considered called for an answer, as the conclusions arrived at by the Department were not in accordance with those of the Committee. This letter was answered to the effect that there was no doubt in the minds of the Committee that Mr. McWhinney was a very capable and energetic principal of the school and that all was done that could reasonably be expected to prevent such occurrences as those which they all regret at the Crowstand school and concluded by stating that the Department's letter would be submitted to the Committee on the very first opportunity.

The method,\nhowever, that he has adopted for putting a stop to this\npractice is, to put it mildly, most indiscreet. It is\nstated that Mr. McWhinney goes after the boys and has,\nin one or two instances, tied ropes about their arms\nand made them run behind the buggy from their homes to\nthe school. The Indians naturally object and say that\ntheir children are not dogs and their health is likely\nto be affected by this running.\n\nMr. McWhinney was advised to stop this pro-\ncedure at once and he asked what other method he should\nadopt. From this and another report, on this school,\nthe purport of which was communicated to you on the 13th\nult., the Department is inclined to question the advan-\ntage of Mr. McWhinney's being continued in charge of\nthe school.

Dr. McKay,\nSecretary of the P.M.C. of the Presbyterian Church,\nToronto, giving a statement regarding the scandalous\noccurrence at the Crowstand Boarding School, was sent\nto the Synod's Indian Mission Committee in Winnipeg,\nwith instructions that the Committee should enquire into\nthe matter. Immediately upon its receipt, the Committee\ndirected me to write Mr. McWhinney, the Principal of the\nschool, for an explanation. On the arrival of Mr.\nMcWhinney's reply the Committee met and the following\nmotion was passed:\n\nThat the Secretary be instructed to transmit\na copy of Mr. McWhinney's letter to the Indian Department\nat Ottawa and also to the P.M.C. of the General Assembly;\nand to assure the Department that the Committee is following\nup the steps taken by the Principal of the school in\nthat it is appointing a Committee to investigate all the\ncircumstances in connection with that occurrence, with\npower to impose whatever further penalties may be deemed\nnecessary, to enquire into the precautions needed and to\ndirect\ndirect that such may be taken. After the Committee investi-\ngates, I will write you again.\n\nHoping that the steps taken may meet your approval.\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nJames Farquharson\n\nSec'y. of Committee.\nKamsack, Sask. July 8th 1907.\n\nDear Dr. Farquharson,\n\nYour letter to hand, asking for a full statement of the recent misconduct of some of our pupils in conjunction with graduates from the Reserve. My reason for not speaking of this before was simply my distaste for putting the disgraceful affair on paper, and besides, I did not see that any good could come from so doing. If you had come up, I had intended telling you about it as I also intended telling Mr. Fraser at the next meeting of Presbytery. I do not want you to think I had any desire to conceal anything from the Committee which they had a right to know. I shall give you a full statement of the matter, and if any further investigation is needed, I shall be only too glad to give any assistance I can in the hope that the Committee may give me some assistance in preventing any recurrence of the matter.\n\nTo get at the beginning, it will be necessary to go back before my time. The fall before I came to Crowstand, a number of the larger girls got out of their dormitories a number of times, meeting outside with several young men from the reserve. One of these was a graduate from our school. One was a graduate of Regina who was working here as farm instructor. The others were young married men from the Reserve. The leaders among the girls were a graduate of Regina who was working in the school, and I think also an Indian girl who was living here as the adopted daughter of Mr. Gilmour.\n\nThe\nThe young men who were concerned were forbidden to come on the school grounds again while Mr. Gilmour was here. His adopted daughter was sent to a friend at Suitaiula and the other girl was discharged.\n\nAbout a year after I came here, some of our own boys and girls succeeded in getting their windows open and getting out, the girls going to the boys dormitory and the boys going to the girls two or three times before they were caught. I employed such means as punishment and individual talks as I thought best to make them see the wrong they had done and to keep them from doing it again. Since then, extra precautions have been taken to guard against any more trouble. The windows were blocked so that they could only rise a short distance, while the stops were securely nailed on. The doors also were kept locked. The Indian boy or girl, as you may know, yields easily to any impulse or desire and from twelve upwards their passions are peculiarly strong. Thus, although we have seen many pleasing signs of improvement occasionally there would be outbreaks of a restless spirit in some. But on the whole we had much reason to be pleased with the apparent growth of a better moral tone. Last winter was perhaps the most free from anything disagreeable in the conduct of the girls and boys that I have known since coming here.\n\nOn April 1st, I sent home two of the larger boys to work preparatory to being discharged. They came to the school occasionally during the week and always on Sunday to the Sunday school, and also to the evening meeting. Nothing suspicious could be noticed in any of their conduct.\n\nAbout\nAbout the middle of May, Mr. Blewett, the Indian Agent, heard from a young Indian in his employ that something was wrong at the school. Next day, he was able to give me more particulars, and I at once proceeded to investigate. About the beginning of May, two young men from the reserve came to the school one night, and went up to the little girls dormitory, but when they found only little girls they went down again. They told this to the two boys who had just gone home from the school, and started them thinking about doing the same.\n\nOn Sunday night, May 5th, after all the staff were asleep, the two school boys from home accompanied by one of our boys from his own dormitory went up the fire escape to the girls window with a couple of knives and other things, which they passed to the girls, asking them to open the window. Either the girls could not, or would not do it, and the boys went away. The girls had tried or made pretence of trying to open the window.\n\nBy Thursday following, the boys had got possession of a screwdriver and with it loosened their own windows, and then passed it to the girls who also loosened theirs, so it would open easily. That night, four of our largest school boys went up to the girls dormitory and stayed for a time. Next night, Friday, May 10th, two boys from the reserve came and went up. One of these was the one who had been deep in the trouble in Mr. Gilmour's tame and the same that had gone up to the little girls dormitory a few weeks before. The other was one of the boys I had sent home. This older fellow, Campbell Shingosesh by name, had a bottle of whiskey in his pocket. He gave it to the girls and three of them drank some of it. My own opinion is that his having the whiskey there was\nwas merely an accident. He did not come up for the purpose of bringing it or giving it to the girls.\n\nThe other boy, Wallace Shingosch and Freddie Cote the other boy whom I had sent home came the next night, Saturday, and went up to the same dormitory. On Monday night following, four of the girls went out and went around to the boys dormitory. The next day I discovered the trouble and of course there was no more.\n\nNow you will ask what has been done to the guilty parties. Those who were pupils of the school including the two boys who had gone home to the reserve, I punished. I wanted to get a heavy sentence passed on the young fellow who had brought the whiskey because he is a bad case, but the Agent allowed him to go free on condition of his giving certain information which led to the conviction of a white man in Kamsack who had for a long time been supplying the Indians with whiskey. I intend forbidding him to come on the school property for a certain term. I would have liked very much to have prosecuted him for house breaking and made an example of him, but dreaded the publicity it would give.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, Mr. Graham, the Inspector of Indian agencies was here and I gave the whole account to him. I suppose it was through his report it reached the Department.\n\nSince this occurred, I have taken extra precautions to prevent any more trouble and everything has been well lately.\n\nIn conclusion, let me repeat what I said before, that I shall be pleased to give any necessary assistance.\nassistance to any investigation the Committee may desire to make. I might say, too, that Presbytery meets here next week, and I shall lay the whole matter before Mr. Fraser, and the other members of the Presbyterial Committee.\n\nI thank you for your kind words of sympathy and assure you that none of you can know the sore disappointment this whole affair has been to every member of our staff.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Signed) W. McWhinney,\nPrincipal.\nPresbyterian Church in Canada\nForeign Mission Committee\n(Western Division)\n\nToronto July 29th, 1907.\n\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying again to your letter of June 13th,-\n116741/1, permit me to say that I am in receipt today\nof a letter from Rev. Dr. Farquharson, Winnipeg, Man.,\nSecretary of our Western Committee, enclosing a copy\nof a letter from Mr. McWhinney from the Crowstand school\ngiving an account of his difficulties in connection with\ndiscipline in that school. Dr. Farquharson assures me\nthat a committee has taken steps to visit the school and\ninvestigate thoroughly the cause. He also states he is\nsending a copy of the principal's letter to your Depart-\nment. I have no doubt but that you have this copy before\nyou at the present time. We shall investigate both\ncharges in connection with Crowstand school and as I\nstated in my letter of the 23rd inst., such action will\nbe taken as is warranted by the finding of the Committee.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA.B. Armstrong\nActing Secretary.\nThe Presbyterian Church in Canada.\n\nWinnipeg, 28th July, 1907.\n\nJ.-D. McLean, Esq.,\nDepartment of the Interior of\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nyours of July 18th regarding further trouble at Crowstand Indian school has been sent on to me by Mr. Armstrong, who is acting at present as Secretary of the F.M.C. in Toronto. I am very sorry to learn of these difficulties which you refer to. The Synodical Indian Mission Committee will have another meeting just as soon as it can be convened; and your letter will be submitted to the Committee and I have no doubt that either the sub-committee appointed to investigate the matter of the boys getting into the girls dormitories, will be instructed to enquire into this other matter as well; although it is quite possible that the Committee may see fit to change the personnel of the sub-committee somewhat. Your letter also of the 7th June, or rather a copy of it came to hand today, having just been forwarded from Toronto. Your recommendation that the management of the Regina school be changed will also be considered by the Committee at once. I might state however that the Committee had no intention of making Mr. Heron's appointment a permanent one, but even if a change were to be made as speedily as possible, it might take a little while to look out the right man for the place. I will write again after the meeting of the Committee.\n\nYours truly,\nJames Farquharson\nSecretary.\nThe Presbyterian Church in Canada\n\nWinnipeg, 2nd August, 1907.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary of the Department\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nTwo letters, complaining against the management of the Crowstand Indian school, are now in my hands; and the Committee of the Synods of Manitoba and Saskatchewan have appointed a sub-committee to investigate both matters. The Committee desires me to write requesting you to forward to me copies of the correspondence you have had in connection with these matters. If you do so, it would help the Committee very much in the investigation. We want the whole truth whatever it may be to come out and will do our very utmost to see that it shall come out. Can you help us to this extent?\n\nYours truly,\n\nJames Farquharson\nSecretary\nSynodical Indian Mission Committee.\nOttawa, August 7, 1907.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 2nd inst., asking for copies of the correspondence in connection with the complaints against the management of the Crowstand Indian Boarding School I beg to say that the cases referred to were first brought to the notice of the Department in a report on the Pelly Agency, made by our Agent on June 3, last, who, under the heading of \"Temperance and Morality\" said:\n\n\"I regret to say that the drink traffic is still very much in evidence. I discovered that some of our young men (all graduates) had been going in the vicinity of the Crowstand school, so I informed Principal McWhinney, who at once began to investigate, with the result of finding that with the aid of those inside (pupils) the young fellows had been getting into the girls' dormitories and that whiskey had been taken to the girls. I took up the clue and found that the son of the deposed chief Cote had obtained the liquor for the boys, I followed up the case against two white men of Kamsack, a Doukobor and two Indians and I sincerely hope the Justices will give them their deserts.\"\n\nThe\n\nRev. James Farquharson, D.D.,\n317 Portage Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Department's Inspector, who visited the school on the 27th June makes the following remarks in his report:\n\n\"The Principal has been experiencing unusual trouble with his boys of late, who have been running away but I think he has not adopted a wise method for stopping this, in fact, some of the Indians owning children came to me to complain. Mr. McWhinney goes after the boys and in one or two instances has tied ropes about their arms and made them run behind the buggy from their houses to the school. The Indians say that the children are not dogs and that there is danger in the running affecting their health and so there is. I told Mr. McWhinney to stop this at once and he asked me what method he would adopt. I suggested that he obtain your consent to remove one or two of the worst offenders to another school and if this is done I think there will be a change.\n\nThe Principal has also experienced trouble with young men and boys entering the dormitory of the larger girls at night. He has had new fastenings put on the windows and does not expect any further trouble from this source.\"\n\nThe Secretary of the Foreign Mission Committee, Toronto, was written to on both these matters, and the correspondence received from you shows that you have been advised of the contents of both these letters.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nSecretary.\nTHE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, IN CANADA.\n\nWINNIPEG, 16th August, 1907.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe report of the sub-committee appointed by the Indian Mission Committee of the Synods of Manitoba and Saskatchewan to visit the Crowstand School and to enquire about the management of the School, as requested by your Department, was considered at a Meeting of the Committee held recently and I was instructed to send you a copy of the report, which I now enclose, and to state that the Committee after full consideration of the said report, agreed on motion by Dr. Patrick and seconded by Dr. DuVal to adopt the report; hence the report becomes that of the full Committee.\n\nI should explain that your kind letter enclosing the correspondence your Department had had about the matters complained of at Crowstand did not come into the Committee's hands until after its visit to Kennebec. We are none the less indebted to you however for your kindness in sending the copies of the correspondence. We sincerely trust that this will be satisfactory too.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJames Farquharson,\nSecy. of Committee.\nThe Committee appointed to enquire into complaints made by the Indian Department against the Crowstand Indian School, met in the Crowstand School on Thursday, 8th August, 1907.\n\nThe letters from the Department of Indian Affairs were read and considered. In the opinion of the Committee, these letters should have been accompanied by a copy of the correspondence on which the Department based its complaints, and the names of some parties on whom the Committee appointed to investigate might have called for a statement of facts. Nothing of this kind having been done, the only parties to whom the Committee could apply for information, were the members of the School staff and the Indian Agent.\n\nThe Committee questioned every member of the staff who was within reach (it being the season for holidays the teacher and assistant Matron were absent) and had a conversation with the Indian Agent, and found that all were agreed as to the facts regarding the pupils and ex-pupils of the School going to the dormitories of the girls at night. The letter of Mr. McWhinney to the Secretary of the Synodical Indian Mission Committee, dated July 8th copies of which were sent to the Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs and the Secretary of the Foreign Mission Committee, Toronto, contains all the information the Committee has received, save the opinion expressed by the Indian Agent that such conduct had been going on from time to time during the Winter.\n\nThe Committee learned that a similar occurrence had taken place at the School before the appointment of Mr. McWhinney, the present Principal, and that one of the culprits in the present instance was involved in the former. The Committee learned further from various sources that like occurrences had happened at other schools.\n\nThe Committee found that the Principal and every member of the staff were deeply grieved at the occurrence, and that the precautions taken to prevent such consisted in having the bedrooms of the members of the staff, (with the exception of that of the Principal who occupies a separate building) close to the dormitories of the boys and girls, the doors of the dormitories locked and the windows so blocked that they could not be raised high.\nEnough to permit a child to crawl through. Indeed, the only further precaution anyone could suggest, was to bar the windows with iron rods\u2014a precaution precluded by the danger of fire. The success with which plots of various kinds have been planned and carried through, not only in Indian Schools but in schools of all nationalities, compels the Committee to require further evidence before acquiescing in the statement of the latter from the Secretary of the Department on Indian Affairs, that the scandalous occurrences reflect seriously on the Management of the Institution. The Committee regrets the occurrences exceedingly but does not think there is any blame attaching to the Principal of the staff.\n\nComplaints regarding Mr. McWhinney's method of bringing truant boys back to the School.\n\nThe Committee questioned Mr. McWhinney regarding the complaint that he had on one or two occasions in bringing truant boys back to the School, tied a rope to their arms, fastened the rope to his buggy and so compelled the boys to run behind the buggy; and was told that the following are the facts of the case:\n\nThe ringleader of the boys in the case out of which the complaint arose had run away from school four times last year and four or five times this year; and in each case he had induced one or more smaller boys to accompany him; that in the case referred to in the complaint, he had induced two to accompany him, one about his own size and one smaller; that Mr. and Mrs. McWhinney had followed them in the buggy and found them about eight miles from the school in company with the father of the two smaller boys; that Mr. McWhinney told the boys that they must go back with him, that he would take the smallest of them in the buggy, but, as there was not room for all in the buggy, the two larger boys would have to run behind; that arranged thus, all went well, until approaching a bluff half a mile from the starting point, Mr. McWhinney noticed that the boys were preparing to escape; that Mr. McWhinney then stopped, brought the boys to the buggy, tied a rope loosely round the arms of each and drew the rope over the back of the\nbuggy and the seat, but did not fasten it to the buggy in any way; that Mr. McWhinney had not thought of thus tying the rope to the boys until he was face to face with the danger of the boys running away from him after he had found them and thus impairing the discipline of the School.\n\nMr. McWhinney admitted that he had asked Mr. Graham (whether in the terms quoted in the letter of the Secretary of the Indian Department or not, he was not sure) as to what else he could do; but so far was he from refusing to take Mr. Graham's advice that the question was put with the desire of getting advice: that Mr. Graham did not advise him not to tie the boys behind the buggy again, but to get the Indian Commissioner's permission to transfer the unruly boy to a distant school whence he could not get home; and that he, (Mr. McWhinney) had, acting on this advice, requested and got the Commissioner's permission to transfer the boy to another school, and that so far, the threat to do this had proved sufficient to keep the boy at school.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the Indian Department that boys should not be brought back to any school tied with ropes, not because to do so is necessarily either cruel or wicked, but partly because to be seen bringing back boys tied thus is all but certain to lead to complaints of cruelty; and even more, because such a practice is in danger of degenerating into cruelty. Whether any particular case is actually wrong, must be determined by its circumstances. There is no doubt of the danger to which the boys would be exposed if the ropes had been made fast to the buggy as well as to the boys: but the ropes were not fastened to the buggy. The Committee can see no cruelty in making boys walk, or even run for reasonable distances. The distance those boys partly walked and partly ran behind Mr. McWhinney's buggy was between seven and eight miles: they could, and did help themselves along by clinging to the buggy: and Mr. McWhinney assured the Committee that the horses trotted slowly when they did trot and that they walked a considerable part of the way.\n\nThe Matron also gave the Committee the assurance that the boys were none the worse for their experience behind Mr. McWhinney's buggy.\nThe Committee therefore believe that there was no wrong done on this occasion, and it is satisfied, and believes that the Department should be satisfied with Mr. McWhinney's assurance that this method of securing the boys would not be tried again.\n\nIn conclusion the Committee is convinced that the management of the Crowstand School has been on the whole excellent, and that the School is at present in very good condition.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nJames Fraser. Convener.\n\nJames Farquharson.\n\nA statement made by Mr. McWhinney regard the bringing back of the truant boys is attached to this paper.\nMr. McWhinney's statement regarding\nthe bringing back of the truant boys.\n\n(written to his dictation)\n\nGeorge Kakewayas has for at least two years given great trouble\nby his frequent attempts to run away from the School. In this, he has been\nencouraged by the sympathy of his parents, and the fact that they made much\nof him on his return to his home. I have talked both to the parents and to\nthe boy, reasoning with them both as to the wrong and folly of such conduct.\nThis boy's offence is always aggravated by his inducing one or more smaller\nboys to accompany him in his truancy, and thus exposing his health as well\nas his own to serious danger, they, often setting out at nights or on wet\ndays, to go a distance of ten miles.\n\nHe ran away at least four times last year and four or five this\nyear. The usual punishment inflicted was whipping. I tried to get his\nfather to punish him but failed. Usually they would bring him back when he\nwent home. I tried to persuade his father to some form of co-operation\nby which the boy's truancy might be stopped. Shortly afterwards, the boy\nran away again, and as on other occasions, persuaded two boys, one about\nhis own size and one smaller, to accompany him. I drove up to the Reserve\nto look for them. About eight miles from the School, I met the three boys\naccompanied by the father of the two smaller boys and at once told the boys\nthat they must go back to school with me. As my wife was along with me,\nthere was not room for all in the buggy, so I took the little boy into the\nbuggy and told the others that they must run behind. At first they were\nnot tied in any way. After going a little distance, while driving near a\nbluff, the boys showed unmistakable signs that they were going to make a\nbreak for liberty. I stopped and tied a rope loosely around one arm of each\nand threw the other end of the rope over the back of the buggy and over\nthe seat. The rope was not tied to the buggy in any way. Thus we proceeded\nto the school, the horses walking or trotting slowly, so that the boys\ncould follow without danger of hurting themselves in any way. Some of the\nIndians saw us going home and at once reported that the boys were tied to\nthe buggy.\nWhen Mr. Graham the Inspector was here a few weeks later, two Indians complained to him about the matter. He asked me for a statement of what had happened and I told him as it is set down here. He agreed that the boys should be punished and that discipline must be maintained, but advised me not to do anything like the foregoing again, as it might create dissatisfaction among the Indians. This, of course, was my own intention when I saw how the Indians felt. I asked him what method he would advise in dealing with such cases, and he advised me to request the Indian Commissioner to permit me to transfer the boy to some school at such a distance that the boy could not go home from it. I have done this, and the Commissioner has consented to the transference if it should be necessary to take this step. I told the boy and his father about this, and since then, there has been no trouble.\n\nIn answer to questions, Mr. McWhinney said, \"The tying of ropes on the boys' arms and making them run behind the buggy was not intended as a punishment but as a preventative against running away. I asked the boys several times while on the way to school if they were tired, and one of them answered that they were not.\"\nOttawa, September 4, 1907.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 16th ult., forwarding a copy of the report of the sub-committee appointed by the Indian Mission Committee of the Synods of Manitoba and Saskatchewan on the management of the Crowstand Boarding School, I beg to say that the Department is of opinion that the facts elicited in this enquiry show laxity in the administration of the school and that the method of dealing with truants displays a serious error in judgment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean.\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. James Farquharson, B.D.,\n317 Portage Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, October 14th., 1907.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nIn connection with the report regarding the management of the Crowstand Boarding School, forwarded under cover of your letter of August 16, last, you were informed that the Department is of opinion that the facts elicited in this enquiry show laxity in the administration of the school and that the method of dealing with truants displays a serious error in judgment.\n\nThe Department has been awaiting an acknowledgment of this communication, which it considers called for a reply, as the conclusions arrived at by the Department are not in accordance with those of your committee.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

I am sorry that my answer in this matter has been delayed considerably beyond the time anticipated. At a meeting of the Committee held a short time ago, I was instructed to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. McLean's letter. While recognizing that the conclusion of your Department was different from that to which our Committee had come to, the Committee was of the opinion that from the letter received, the Department looked upon that letter as an end of the matter.\n\nIf your Department desires our Committee to do anything else than what has been done, I trust you will write and let me know. There is no doubt in the minds of our Committee that Mr. McWhinney is a very capable and energetic Principal of the School, neither is there any doubt in the minds of the Committee that all was done that could reasonably be expected to be done to prevent such occurrences as those which we all regret at the Crowstand School. In the meantime I can add nothing to this except possibly refer you to our reports sent some time ago in which the matter was gone into in detail from the standpoint of our Committee. Your letter will be submitted to the Committee on the very first opportunity.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJames Farquharson\n\"Indian Affairs: School Files (RG 10, Volume 6027, File 117-1-1, part 1)\"\n\nINDIAN DEBAUCHERY.\n\nWild Times on the Kamsack and other Reservations.\n\nGirls' School Broken into and Inmates made Drunk and maltreated \u2014 Whites and Halfbreeds took a Hand in the Orgies.\n\n(Special Despatch to the Globe)\n\nWinnipeg, Nov. 28. \u2014 Unscrupulous whites, bad halfbreeds and Indians in search of excitement, have been debauching the Indians on the reservations at Kamsack, Keyes and Pelly, forcing the Dominion Government to take action and institute wholesale prosecutions. Debaucheries have been indulged in which have left some participants lying in the bush in an incapacitated state for two days at a time. The Indian School was broken into, and the occupants of one of the girls dormitories have been intoxicated and assaulted by a band of young roughs, and gambling and vice have been rampant at Kamsack where the Indians, whites and halfbreeds have indulged in wild and disgusting orgies. These are facts obtained by the Department of Indian Affairs, which placed the matter in the hands of the Canadian Detective Agency.\n\nMr. Charles Driver, the local superintendent, despatched a detective to the scene of the alleged trouble, with the result that some forty odd prosecutions are taking place, while a report has been received by the Department showing that the state of affairs was deplorable. As far as information has been received there have been twenty-three convictions. After working for some time the detective collected sufficient material to convict a large number of offenders, and the Department decided on stamping out the evil at once. Notice was sent to the reserve that a \"give-away\" dance, and Indian dance, that usually results in excesses and vicious freedom, would take place at Kamsack on November 21. All the suspects therefore were counted on attending, and when they did there was a wholesale raid by the police who worked from early morning of Thursday and the greater\npart of the following day, in placing the men they wanted under arrest.\n\nOn Saturday morning the court was opened at 10 o'clock, and many fines and sentences were imposed. A man who ran a butcher shop there was sent to jail for nine months, and fined $900.\nOttawa, November 28, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nIn a news item contained in the Toronto Globe, of yesterday, on Indian debauchery reference is made to an Indian school, presumably the Crowland.\n\nYou will remember that the attention of the Presbyterian Church authorities was called to reports received by the Department reflecting on the discipline of this school, which led to an enquiry by the Indian Mission committee of that church. The report of the committee endeavored to clear the Principal of any blame, but the Department did not agree with the committee's finding and wrote Dr. Farquharson to that effect, who replied that the Principal was a very capable and energetic man, who had done all that could reasonably be expected to prevent such occurrences, but that the Department's letter would be submitted to the Committee on the very first opportunity.\n\nThis letter was dated the 18th ult. and nothing has been heard from the Committee since then. Their attention should be again called to this matter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of No.\n\nWith further reference to my letter of Nov. 6th/07, and your telegram of Nov. 15th/07, re the Telephone line from Crowstand, I beg to say that on the 5th inst., when Mr. McWhinney asked me to write you, I advised him to follow road allowances and I thought there would be no objections from you, but that I could not even give permission to him to build on the road allowances until I had the Department's consent. He however, I find, went on erecting poles along the C. N. R. line, across the surrendered part of Cote's Reserve, expecting you to grant him permission and wishing to have the poles in before the ground was frozen too hard. As soon as your telegram of 15th inst. reached me I notified Mr. McWhinney of your decision. He had at that time, I find, reached a road allowance, having already crossed the surrendered part of Cote's Reserve intervening, and so continued the line to Kamsack saying that he would take up the matter with Mr. Inspector Graham when next he came here. I beg therefore to make this report to you so that you may advise me directly or through Inspector Graham at his next visit.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nCanadian Pacific Railway Company's Telegraph\n\nALL MESSAGES TAKEN BY THIS COMPANY ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS\n\nIt is agreed between the sender of the following telegram and this Company that the said Company shall not be liable for damages arising from failure to transmit or deliver, or for any error in the transmission or delivery of an intended telegram, when such error arises from error of speed, or from any cause beyond the control of the Company.

Until recently I applied to the department through our agent Mr. Blevett for permission to put in poles and run the line along the outside of the railway fence from our school property until it reached the road allowance granted by the department to the local government. This is the most direct route as you know and would not interfere with the land value in any way. In fact I think it would add to it as it would afford the opportunity to any settler also to have telephone connection. I was in haste to get the poles in before the ground froze up and asked the department to wire their answer. To my surprise they refused the request unless the line were placed on road allowances. Now as you know these roadways are not open and it would mean I would have to run the line\nCrowstand\nIndian Boarding School\nRev. W. McWhinney,\nPrincipal\n\nHamsack, Sask., 190\n\nabout three miles around two sides of a triangle instead of one and a half miles on one side. Also this three miles would be through thick bluff and two or three ravines a great part of the way. This would almost double the cost of installing. I feel sure if the Department understood the situation and that no harm would be done by the line along the railway they would readily grant the request. Might I then ask your assistance in this matter of bringing to their attention the reasonable nature of my request so that they may change their decision. I would like if this could be done speedily so I could complete this part of the line before the frost goes too deep. Hoping you may be able to secure this for me I am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nW.

Crowstand School:\n\nIn my report of last May, I mentioned this matter, the facts are as follows:- My laborer told me that boy graduates of the school were getting into the windows of the school into the dormitories with the girls and that the girls also climbed out of the windows and went into the bush with the boys on several nights. I at once reported to Principal McWhinney and he found it was only too true, also that one boy took liquor into the school. I found that Fred Cote, a graduate had supplied the liquor and he was tried and convicted and fined; and he informed on the bartender of the Russell House at Kamsack, who was convicted and fined $50.00 and costs by a local J.P.\n\nAs far as the charge of burglary being laid, the Principal did not wish to do so on account of the Publicity of a Supreme Court case.\n\nThere is no truth in the statement that the girls were outraged; but it is not hard to surmise what would happen if Indian boys and girls of 16 to 18 years of age got together at night either in a dormitory or in the bush.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.O. Blissett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nSouth Saskatchewan Inspectorate,\nBalcarres, Sask. Dec. 3rd, 1907.\n\nSir:\n\nIn my last report on the Pelly Agency I dealt with the matter of Indian boys breaking into the girls' dormitories at the Crowstand school. I feel satisfied that there has not been a second attempt to gain admittance to the dormitories.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nInsp. of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIndian Commissioner\nfor the Northwest Provinces and Territories.\n\nWinnipeg, 3rd December, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 28th ultimo, mentioning that the Toronto Globe of the previous day had contained a news item relating to Indian debauchery and making special mention that an Indian School was broken into and the occupants of one of the girls' dormitories given intoxicants and debauched.\n\nThe School referred to, as you surmise, is Crowstand Boarding School, but the newspaper reports were a gross exaggeration. Indeed the affair was mentioned by Mr. Agent Blouett in his report for May last, and by Mr. Inspector Graham in his report on said School dated the 4th July following.\n\nUpon the receipt of your letter, as I saw nothing about the School affair on the list of convictions, I called upon the Detective Bureau to make a special report on the so-called outrages at Crowstand. A copy of this report is placed herewith.\n\nAs the affair was an old one, and had already been investigated by the Church authorities and reported to the Department by the Agent and Inspector, I did not expect the Detective to take up that matter. But the Agent and the Principal of the School appear to have told him about the scandal, and yet did not follow up the matter by laying information. Since they did not prosecute a\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\ngreat mistake was made by some one in giving exaggerated information to the newspapers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n(Copy)\nWinnipeg, Man., Dec. 2, 1907.\n\nHon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nRe Crowstand School.\n\nAs per your request Operative No. 16 reports that while at Kamsack he received information from Mr. Blewett, the Indian Agent, that on or about the 15th. of May 1907, some boys gained entrance to the Crowstand School by climbing up a fire escape and entering the girls' dormitories. Mr. Blewett also informed Operative that he had informed Mr. McQuinney, Principal of the School. Operative asked if Mr. McQuinney had done anything in the matter, and Mr. Blewett replied in the negative, and added that the guilty parties should have been arrested.\n\nOn the 14th. of November last Operative interviewed Mr. McQuinney, who corroborated the statements made by Mr. Blewett, and added that he had got statements from the girls with the names of those who broke into the School, the guilty parties being Campbell Levright, Wallace Lingush and Fred Cote.\n\nMr. McQuinney stated that the evidence of the girls was that these three came into their room on the date mentioned with a bottle of whiskey, and remained there for the rest of the night.\n\nOperative asked Mr. McQuinney if he wished the guilty parties prosecuted, and he replied in the affirmative.\n\nOperative then interviewed Campbell Levright who admitted breaking into the school in company with the other two mentioned, and also to having a bottle of whiskey which was given to the girls.\nLater, in conversation with Mr. McQuinney, the latter asked Operative if he was going to take the case up, and Operative said that he thought that the information should be laid by Mr. McQuinney, who could produce the evidence that he had from the girls, and Operative could, if desired, conduct the case. Mr. McQuinney then said that he thought that it had better drop as prosecution would mean the trio being sent to Yorkton for trial, and McQuinney gave Operative the impression that his primary reason for not prosecuting was that he wanted to avoid being brought into it himself. Mr. McQuinney stated that it would mean a lot of exposure, and he thought that by this time the three of them had got a pretty good scare. Mr. Blewett and Mr. Crawford were present during this conversation.\n\nRespectfully submitted\n\nCanadian Detective Bureau Ltd.\n\nPer (sd.) C.

July 5th 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nFor some years past I have been getting permission from the Indian Commissioner at Winnipeg to give our pupils their summer vacation in August instead of July. There are many reasons why this is better in the case of our school. Therefore I would request that you grant permission for this change to be made this year also.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nW. McWhinney\nOttawa, July 10, 1809.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 5th inst.,\nI beg to say that the vacation at the Crowstand Boarding School may be taken in August instead of July.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

I find it in good working order and am sure it will prove of much service to me.\n\nW. McWhinney\nto have her at home and I think this would be the best thing for her.

Francis Caldwell pupil No II41s now 17 years of age and will be due for discharge next spring. In several ways his influence has not been good of late upon the smaller boys. He is one of those who has been sick at home with measles and I think that it would be better that he be allowed to remain at home and work with his father until the time of his discharge. I would retain my control over him and see that he spent his time in a profitable way. This I think would be decidedly for the good of the School and would be just as profitable to the boy. I would therefore recommend this for your approval.\n\nPerhaps I should explain that for several years past with the approval of the Indian Commissioner at Winnipeg our School has been taking its holidays in August instead of July. We find this to suit our case much better.\n\nHoping the foregoing may meet with your approbation,\n\nI Am,\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nIndian Department,\n\nOttawa, Can.\nSir,\n\nI beg leave to acknowledge the receipt of the booklet entitled, \"Games and Calisthenics\", and to say that I think it can be made very useful in our Indian Schools. For several winters past we have been giving considerable attention to the matter of calisthenics, but this booklet will aid us very much in this.\n\nThe following are a number of matters to which I wish to call your attention.\n\n1. While our pupils were home on holidays measles broke out on the Reserve and when the 29th of August came, which was the day set for their return, some had not apparently come in the way of infection, others had taken them and had not quite recovered, while others were quite recovered. I consulted with the Agent Mr Blewett and Dr Wallace and together we agreed upon the following: - All pupils who had not had measles and as far as we knew had not come in the way of infection and all who had completely recovered should return to school. 2. All who were sick or had been in the way of infection were to remain at home until all danger of their imparting the disease was over. Notwithstanding all our care five cases have developed since their return and there may be more. There are ten pupils yet at home whom I do not think it would be wise to bring back until the danger of infection is over.\n\n2. Julia Kitchemonia pupil No. 056 has had a great deal of trouble with her eyes during the last couple of years. We have treated them as carefully as possible but whenever she attempts to use them for sewing or in the class-room they get bad again. Her Grandfather Chief Kitchemonia wishes\nOttawa, September 14, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, and in reply to that portion in which you deal with the outbreak of measles on the reserve I beg to say that the action taken by you on the recommendation of the Agent and medical attendant is approved. The Department trusts that you will be able to keep the outbreak within the school within bounds and that all the children will soon be restored to their usual health.\n\nThe ten pupils referred to may remain at home till the danger from infection is over and, when forwarding your quarterly return, you will be good enough to give full explanations thereon, showing the cause of absence in the case of these pupils.\n\nThe other matters referred to in your letter will be dealt with in separate communications. I may add that, for the purpose of filing, it would be a great convenience to the Department if you would deal with only one subject in each of your letters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. W.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. W. W. McLaren,\nSupt. Presbyterian Schools,\nBirtle, Man.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of May 16th 1911,\n\nI beg to say that a few days ago one of Cote Band Indians, Pierre Cadotte, reported to me that his sister-in-law who was at Crowstand School had told his wife that the boys at the school (pupils who had graduated but were working at the school or visiting there) had been getting in with the girls nights again. I made inquiry of John Shingoose Sr. who was in the Office at the same time and he also verified Cadotte's statements, naming Frank Cote, John Cadotte and Robert Brass as the boys and Ada Severight, Charlotte Razor and Nora Papequash as the girls in the case. I at once called Mr McWhinney on the phone and told him of the circumstances but he had not heard of anything wrong having happened; however on asking the girls he found the report to be true, and has no doubt before now reported to the Department himself. I very much regret this state of affairs again occurring so soon as it has a very bad effect on the children and makes it doubly hard to get pupils to enter the school.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept.of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 24, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Agent Blewett has reported to the Department the recurrence of disgraceful conduct on the part of certain pupils at the Crowfoot Boarding School. It is said that certain boys (pupils who had graduated or were working at the school or visiting there) had again been getting into the girls' dormitory at night. The Agent states that the Principal has admitted the truth of the report.\n\nI have to ask you to visit the institution and make a thorough enquiry, with a view to ascertaining whether there has been laxity in the management and, if so, where the fault lies.\n\nKindly make your enquiry exhaustive, so that the Department may take such action as may be deemed necessary to prevent the repetition of such occurrences.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the above date and number and in reply would say that the matter referred to came to my notice while visiting Pelly Agency.\n\nI note that you say the Agent states that the Principal has admitted the truth of the report. This is entirely different to what the Principal gave me to understand when I was enquiring into the case. In fact, I was led to believe that nothing very serious had taken place and that the ex-pupils in question had not gone into the dormitories at all; and that the report in circulation was a gross misrepresentation in every particular. Mr. McWhinney said that the ex-pupils in question were seen in the basement by the Matron, talking to some of the larger girls. I could not see that there was any great wrong in this, and Mr. McWhinney assures me that he investigated the matter most thoroughly and this is all that took place. He added that he dismissed the ex-pupils.\n\nOn the other hand the Indians, the principal of whom\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nwhom is Joe Cote, say that the circumstances as reported by the Agent are true. Of course I know that Cote has very little use for Mr. McWhinney and wants to see him removed, and anything he says should be corroborated.\n\nI was just about writing a report on this matter when I received your letter and intended advising you to have the Agent summons the supposed guilty parties before him and if there is sufficient evidence they should be punished.\n\nYou ask me to investigate and ascertain whether there has been laxity in the management and if so where the fault lies. Of course you are aware that the Principal does not live in the school, but has his residence two or three hundred yards from it. There are times when the Farming Instructor, whose duty it is to look after the boys, is away and three or four ladies are left alone in the building with all the children. There are a great many changes in the position of Farmer and it is not natural to expect a man who is only there for a short time to take such an interest in this branch of the work as the Principal should have. I think perhaps there is a little weakness here. Then again, the building is poorly laid out for securing proper oversight of the pupils. The guests staff, with the exception of the farmer, sleep in the main body of the building in rooms opening from either side of a hall at the end of which is a door leading into another hall, off of which are\nare the two boys' dormitories and the farmer's bedroom. If the farmer should not be in his room you can see that a great deal could go on without the knowledge of those in the main building. On the occasion of my last visit I found huge padlocks on the doors and the Principal carrying the keys. The children were locked in these rooms at night like animals. I instructed the Principal to not lock the doors of these rooms but the doors of the main house. Situated as these dormitories are a fire could gain great headway before the children could be released, especially when the responsible head is one quarter of a mile away.\n\nI think Mr. McThinney is unwise in taking the chances that he does, situated as he is, by employing Indian labour and letting them sleep in the house when he is not there himself. One of the men he had engaged on this occasion is a character unfit to be trusted.\n\nIf the Agent is instructed to proceed with the case and sufficient evidence is obtained to convict, and punishment meted out, I think it will perhaps have a lasting effect. I think also that the Principal might be told that when he engages Indian labour, especially ex-graduates of suspicious character, he must arrange to have them sleep outside the buildings. This is all I can suggest in the matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nof Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, November 9, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report of the 31st ultimo in reply to official letter of the 25th of that month in which you were instructed to make a thorough and exhaustive inquiry into the report of the disgraceful conduct of certain pupils and ex-pupils of the Crowstand Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the report which you have seen fit to forward cannot be taken in satisfaction of your instructions and I have to request that you will at once make a full inquiry and report the result to the Department, in order that the necessary action may be taken. Assuming that there is truth in the reports which have already reached the Department the matter is considered of grave importance as this is not the first occasion upon which occurrences of this kind have taken place at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.

W. W. McLaren,\nSupt. of Presbyterian Indian Missions.\nBirtle, Man.\nSir,\n\nI desire your permission to allow the pupils of our School one week of holidays between Christmas and New Years. They would go home on the 23rd of December and return on New Year's Day. This is simply following out the custom that has been in vogue for several years.\n\nI Am,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nRev. McWhinney\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Can.\nSir,\n\nIn accordance with instructions contained in your letter above quoted I beg to say that I have just returned from the Pelly Agency and Crowstand school, where I went to make further enquiries into the alleged ill-conduct of certain pupils and ex-pupils of the school. I have made a thorough investigation and little if anything is to be added to what I have already reported. The meeting that took place between the ex-pupils was in the basement of the school at a time when the general work of the school was still going on and as nearly as I could find out it was about 7 o'clock in the evening early in October, when it would not be very dark. The male ex-pupils had on different occasions been working in the basement and the girl pupils who had or had not business there were seen talking to these boys. I have read the Agent's report to you on the matter, and it would certainly appear from it that something serious had taken place, and I have no doubt that the Indian, Pierre Cadotte, mentioned in his report, made statements that made the Agent believe such to be the case. However, I was able to see this woman and she told me that all she knew was what her daughter, who is a servant in the Agent's house, had told her. When I questioned the girl she denied ever have told her mother anything of the kind. This denial took place.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nplace before the mother. Another old woman who was supposed to know something about the matter was brought to the school by me to tell her story, but all the evidence she gave was hearsay. I questioned the Chief and the man Jno. Siigoose Sr., referred to in Mr. Blewett's letter and all they knew was what they had heard these women say. I questioned all the girls and learned nothing more than that they had been speaking to the boys in the basement when they had been working. I also saw the three boys who were supposed to be implicated in the matter and they stoutly maintained that nothing wrong had taken place.\n\nI believe there was too much haste in reporting the matter to you. Had a full enquiry been made of Mrs. Cadotte, the woman mentioned in the Agent's letter, it would have been found that there was room to doubt her statements. Mr. McThinney was also hasty at first when he admitted to the Agent that there was serious wrong doing going on. After making further enquiries he learned that reports had been exaggerated but by this time the Agent's report had gone forward.\n\nI again warned Mr. McThinney that he could not be too careful in watching these girls and residents preventing if possible their meetings in the basement.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, December 13, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant reporting the result of your inquiries into the alleged ill-conduct of certain pupils and ex-pupils of the Crowstand Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that had you acted on the instructions first sent you it would have been more satisfactory to all concerned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the pupils of the Crowstand Boarding School may be granted one weeks holidays between Christmas and New Years as usual. The return should show that this leave was authorized by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. W. McWhinney,\nPrincipal,\nCrowstand Boarding School,\nKamsack, Sask.\nExtract from Agent's Report on the Crowstand Boarding School for the month of February. Original on File 116741-7\n\nThe principal, Mr McWhinney, after talking with the Indians, is going to try to get the church to consent to have their new school built on the Cote reserve, so that it may be used as a day school for those near enough, and a boarding school for any too remote to walk in daily.\n\nSgd. W.G. Blewett,\nIndian Agent.\nMr. D. C. Scott,\nSupt. Of Indian Education\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Presbyterian Association of Indian Mission Workers expect to hold their annual Convention here at our School during the last week of July. Last year we invited you to be at our meeting in Winnipeg but you were not able to go so. Now this year both on behalf of our School and on behalf of our Association I would give you a very hearty invitation to be present. I am certain you could be of great assistance to us and it would be a good opportunity for you to get in touch with the workers and see many of the perplexing questions more from their standpoint. I do not say this as we have any particular axe to grind but simply that an all-round benefit might accrue to the cause of Indian education.\n\nYou will remember that Rev R. P. MacKay D. D. spoke to you last fall about certain changes I was proposing in view of the rebuilding of the School here. Briefly they were these:- Instead of building a large new boarding School I advised building a small boarding School on the centre of the Reserve including a day-school department in connection with it. All pupils who were too far away to attend as day pupils, all pupils who had not proper homes, all recruits for the first year or two should be boarding pupils. The purpose of having the small pupils or recruits attend as boarding pupils at first is that they may get a grounding in English. In the past this has been the weak point in the day-school system. Then all pupils who were\nnear enough and had spent the proper probationary period as boarding pupils should attend as day pupils.\n\nThe following are the reasons which led me to recommend this course:\n\n1. The Indians are becoming more and more insistent in their demands for a day-school.\n\n2. The homes here in a large number of instances have reached a stage when they are able to care for their children as well as the average white home.\n\n3. The parents would be benefited by the added responsibility.\n\n4. A home of even fair quality can do more for a child than the best institution.\n\n5. Now when changes are to be made is the time to choose such a course as will be best for the average family.\n\nI have intended to lay this plan before you ere this but was waiting until our Church Officials should show signs of accepting it. Gradually I think they are coming round to it. You see this would involve some special arrangements with the Department and for this reason I would like to have you at our Convention where the matter will no doubt come up in some form.\n\nHoping to have a favourable reply from you I Am,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCrowstand Indian Boarding School\n\nRev. W. McWhinney\nPrincipal\nOttawa, June 8th, 1912.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of June the 1st. It would give me great pleasure to be present at the meeting of Indian Mission Workers in Winnipeg but I fear that it is impossible for me to go West this summer. However, I will not give a definite negative reply and I will endeavour to be with you if it is at all possible.\n\nYou will be interested to know the outcome of the debate regarding the future of your school work on the Qu'Appelle Agency. You may be sure that the Department will give sympathetic consideration to any plans that you may see fit to recommend.\n\nWith kind regards, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. W. McWhinney,\nKamsack, Sask.\nOffice of the\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, 2nd October, 1912.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nat Pelly I went up thereon the 30th September.\n\nThey make many complaints about Mr McWhinney, Principal of Crowstand School and say that his practice and his preaching do not coincide to any great extent and that for that reason his work is not as satisfactory as should be.\n\nI would suggest that if it has not already been done an Inspector be sent up to investigate and send in a report and with your permission will send Mr Inspector Semmens.\n\nYours etc.,\nGlen Campbell,\nChief Inspector.\nPer L.L.\nOttawa, December 20, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to communicate with the western authorities of your church with a view to ascertaining what consideration has been given to the question of either making repairs to the present Crowstand Boarding School building or erecting a new one either on the present site or on the Cote Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. A. S. Grant, D.D.,\nSupt. of Home Missions of\nthe Presbyterian Church,\nToronto, Ont.\nKamsack, Sask. March 18th 1913.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAccording to your request I here submit my report of the conduct of the two boys Alfred T. Mooseau No. 142 and Louis Severight No. 141.\n\n1. Both boys gave considerable trouble last year by playing truant.\n\n2. On the thirteenth of last June after several acts of truancy Alfred Mooseau made two attempts in one day (while I was absent) to burn the School by setting fire to the frame work in the basement. I disciplined him severely at the time for it and he promised he would never do the like again.\n\n3. On Feb 13th and again on March 2nd Louis Severight broke into our store rooms and stole articles therefrom. On one of these occasions he was accompanied by Alfred Mooseau.\n\n4. On March 4th these two boys accompanied by another boy broke into an unoccupied house belonging to a farmer who lives near the School and stole several articles therefrom.\n\nAfter this act I warned Louis Severight that any further misconduct of this kind would result in the case being reported to yourself and the police. I also told his father and asked him to talk to the boy.\n\n5. Last Sunday March 16th when I returned from my work on the Reserve at six o'clock I found neither of these two boys were in the School for supper. When I rung the bell for our evening meeting at 7.30 they did not appear. But while all the larger pupils and the staff were in the class-room these boys went\ninto the basement and set fire to the frame work using some gasoline which they had secured to insure the success of the undertaking. Fortunately we discovered the smoke just in time to get it put out. Had it gone for a few minutes longer all the School would have been destroyed besides seriously endangering the lives of a number of little girls who had gone to bed in that particular part of the building. As soon as the fire was put out a search was made and these two boys were discovered around the buildings. Their mitts and their clothing smelt strongly of gasoline and they made no attempt to deny what they had done. After some questioning they admitted that their object was to destroy the School so they could all go home.\n\nFrom the foregoing it appears quite evident that one or both of these boys should be sent to a reformatory for several years. To send them home would not do as this would be just what they are wanting. Neither would it do to send them to a reformatory for a few months as at the end of this term they would return home and this again would satisfy their schemes.\n\nIn conclusion I may say I have tried every means to show these boys the folly of their conduct and the wrong as well, but reason, kindness and punishment seem to have all failed.\n\nHoping that some speedy action may be taken to dispose of this matter, I Am,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nTo Mr W. G. Plewett,\nIndian Agent, Kamsack, Sask.\nSir:\n\nre Alfred T. Mooso & Louis Sovereign of Crowstand School, Kamsack.\n\nOn the 19th inst. I received the following telegram from Mr. W. G. Bluet, Indian Agent, of Kamsack. \"Two Indian boys have twice set fire to school. Are locked up and will be committed, having admitted crime. Please advise to which industrial school boys should be committed so as to avoid detention in common jail.\" I immediately replied as follows: Will take charge of boys. Hold until receipt of letter. As result of those telegrams I have today received the magistrates' order transferring these boys under our Children's Protection Act to my charge as Superintendent of Neglected & Dependent Children and under section 12 of the same Act they are today being transferred to the Industrial School for the province of Manitoba at Portage la Prairie. The Saskatchewan Government has arranged with the Manitoba Government to take charge of boys at the school at the rate of $3.50 per week and as Mr. Bluet notifies me in respect to their maintenance there that he \"will arrange with the Indian Department re this at Ottawa\" it would I think facilitate matters if you would make payment direct to the Manitoba Government for these boys, rather than have it\npaid to my office and transferred by me to the Manitoba Government. Any information that you may require, I should be very glad to give you if possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent.\n\nThe Secretary Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nP/B.\n\nSee report from Principal below\nOttawa, April 9, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your communication of the 25th ultimo in reference to the committal to the Portage la Prairie Industrial School of two Indian boys from the Crowstand Boarding School at Kamsack, Alfred T. Moosoo and Louis Severight.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is prepared to pay the usual fee for the maintenance of these two boys while at the school. Accounts should be rendered in duplicate and should be sent to Mr. W. G. Blewett, Indian Agent, Kamsack, Sask., who is being instructed to forward them to the Department for payment upon receipt. I would ask you to be kind enough to instruct the authorities of the Portage la Prairie School to take this course with their accounts. Payments will be made quarterly at the end of June, September, December and March of each year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. Spencer Page, Esq.,\nSupt. of Neglected and Dependent Children,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, April 9, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. S. Spencer Page has advised the Department of the committal to the Portage la Prairie Industrial School of Alfred T. Mooso and Louis Severight from the Crowstand Boarding School. Since the receipt of his letter your report with Mr. McWhinney's report of the case has come to hand.\n\nThe Department has informed Mr. Page that the Portage la Prairie School should forward their accounts at the end of each quarter in duplicate to you for certificate and transmission to the Department. The rates charged are $3.50 per week. This amount will be paid from the funds to the credit of the Cote Band. You will be good enough to inform the fathers of the boys and the band to this effect. This may lead to these parents making an endeavour to better control their children and also prove a warning to others.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. G. Blewett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nSir,\n\nIn the ten years I have been principal of Crowstand I have had very little trouble as a rule in recruiting for pupils. But during the last few years there has been a persistent agitation for a day-school and as a result it has taken more persuasion to get the parents to send their children in to school when they were at the required age. As you are no doubt aware I have recommended to our Church that a new school be built on the Reserve which will combine the features of a day and boarding school. The Indians have expressed themselves as satisfied with this but they seem to think this change can be brought about in a few weeks or months. Some of the meddlesome ones have been giving us considerable trouble for some time by talking to the children and stirring up discontent with the present school. This was what caused us to have such an epidemic of truancy last fall and which led to the transfer of several pupils to other schools.\n\nDuring the past winter it led to two boys trying to burn the school. Last summer one of these boys made a similar attempt. This spring there are a number of pupils who should come into school but I expect I may have considerable trouble to get them in. They want to wait until this school is closed and the school on the reserve is opened. I don't believe in coaxing these people to put their children in school. It makes them think they are conferring a favour instead of receiving one. Neither do I want to ask the agent to employ compulsion if it can be avoided. Now I think the following course by the Department would be of great service to us and of benefit to these people as well.\n\nLet a letter be sent to the Chief\nand head men of Cote's Reserve telling them that until another School is established it is their duty to support the Schools they have. Let them understand that this will not in any way hinder the new school being built. Warn them against this continual habit of fault finding and causing discontent amongst the pupils. Call their attention to the harm it has done in the past and that a continuation of such a course can bring no good but only more harm. Instruct them to see to it that all children seven years of age or over must be put in school at once\u2014either here or elsewhere.\n\nSuch a letter sent through the Agent Mr Blewett would I think do an immense amount of good. Remember I do not ask the Department to instruct them to put their children into our School but simply that according to the regulations they must be sent to School. A great deal of this trouble has been caused by the Chief being dissatisfied with me. I have always treated him right but have refused to let him run me as he wanted. Last summer I arranged a meeting between these men and some of our leading church officials to give them an opportunity to say anything they had to say. Chief Cote after agreeing to be there played absent. The two Headmen were there but the only fault they found with me was that I had advised them not to crowd in too large numbers into a house where one of these same men was sick and that I had advised that the young children should be kept away as much as possible from around a dying consumptive. They claimed I was interfering with them caring for the sick. When I asked Chief Cote why he had not been there he said that he was afraid the officials were not friendly towards him. I mention these things to show the petty conduct of these men. I told these same\nOfficials of our Church that I would be quite satisfied to resign if they saw fit, but they insisted on my remaining here as in their opinion there was no sufficient grounds for my leaving.\n\nNow I should be very much pleased if such a letter be written at once. It would let the Indians see that the Department was standing by the Schools. It might be as well to not say from what source this information has come.\n\nHoping this may meet with your approval, I Am,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nW. McWhinney\n\nTo The Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa, May 14, 1913.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo in reference to the recruiting of pupils for the Crowstand Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Agent Blewett will be asked to use his influence with these people.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. W. McWhinney,\nPrincipal,\nCrowstand Boarding School,\nKamsack, Sask.\nOttawa, May 14, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Rev. Mr. McWhinney, Principal of the Crowstand Boarding School, in which he states that he has found it almost impossible to recruit children for the boarding school. One reason advanced by the Indians is that they are waiting until the school is established on the reserve.\n\nAs the Department has not come to any decision with regard to the establishment of another school, it is desired that you will communicate with these Indians and inform them that the Department will expect them to send their children either to the Crowstand or some other residential school. The Department hopes that action along this line by you will result in the indifference of the Indians being overcome. I shall be glad to hear from you in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. G. Blewett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, 10th May, 1913.\n\nSir,-\n\nI enclose herewith for your information and report thereon copy of a letter of the 30th ultimo, which the Department has received from the Rev. Mr. McWhinney, Principal, of the Crowstand Boarding School, relative to beef which he purchased from an Indian named Howard Wolf, of Cote's Band. You will observe that he states that owing to beef being unfit for use the Indian was called upon to refund the purchase money, part of which only has been repaid.\n\nKindly observe that Mr. McWhinney requests that the money therein referred to be applied toward liquidation of the debt on the school. Your report and recommendation in this matter is desired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. G. Blewett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nCrowstand Indian Boarding School,\nRev. W. McWhinney, Principal,\n\nKamsack, Sask, April 30th, 191\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn December 17th in the year 1910 I bought a carcass of beef from an Indian named Howard Wolfe of Cote's Band, and paid him therefor $24.35. This beef was sold to me under the usual permit form by which Indians receive permission for sale of their produce. This beef was for use in our School and when we came to use it we found it was not good. The first we cooked gave off a peculiar odor like burned bones. When the matron reported this to me I ordered one of the men to cut up another quarter and see if it was the same. When he attempted to do so a sort of matter ran out of one of the joints. I ordered that no more of it be used and sent word to the Indian to come and take it away. I also notified Mr. Agent Blewett of the occurrence, and asked him to collect $22.00 of a refund from the Indian. This has been very difficult to do and so far I have been able to get only $7.00 of it.\n\nLast fall when Mr. Agent Taylor was in charge this Indian sold two oxen and fifteen dollars of it was retained to purchase a heifer. This heifer has not yet been purchased and the money is still in the Agent's hands. Now what I want to ask is if this money could not be applied to wipe out this old debt to our School. We have been out of our money quite long enough and if this opportunity passes it is hard when another will arise. I might say that this Howard Wolfe is a young unmarried man and the purchase of the heifer does not seem so important as it would be in some other cases. Also the unavoidable way as far as I was concerned in which the debt occurred should be considered. Hoping you may see your way clear to instruct the Agent accordingly, I am Your respectfully,\n\nW. McWhinney.\nReferring to your letter of 14th inst No. 116741/1, I beg to say that I have tried to urge on the Indians here the benefits gained by sending their children to a training school, and have pointed out to them that they are very much indebted to the Department for giving them a free school and home for the children. I have not only been very unsuccessful in getting any results in the way of pupils to enter Crowstand School, but I have made many of the Indians more at me and that much harder to get to work on their land, because they say the Principal is not doing good work and that I am backing him up so that I too must be wrong. These Indians are intelligent in one sense, but are too easily swayed by outside influences, in preference to Departmental instruction. I must say that there have been far too many desertions from Crowstand School the last year, and far too many girl graduates from school turning out prostitutes, and boys becoming drunken loafers. When I urge on an Indian to send his child to school, he at once refers to this and asks me if I want his child to become like that, and it is very hard to refute his arguments and get him to see otherwise. I have done my best in this work, but there seems to be some influence, unknown to myself or the Principal, at work against us.\n\nOn receipt of the above quoted letter, I went into the subject again, with the Indians and they said that they were willing to send their children to school but not so long as Mr. McWhinney was there as principal, because they\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nthey said he had too much work to do, as a clergymen and could not look after the children as he should. There is some truth in this and it might be better for Mr Mcwhinney personally, for the school in general and for all concerned if he had the church and school work separated. Mr Mcwhinney told me that the Department had agreed to build the new boarding school proposed for this agency, and if it does build why not also appoint a principal to manage it and let Mr Mc Whinney handle the church work in this agency? Mr Mc Whinney has always seemed to take great interest in all matters for the Indian's benefit, but the fact remains that there is a retrograde in the school's progress the last year, and its influence is felt here as I have stated above, because I have backed the principal. Personally I do not believe that many pupils will go to Crowstand school especially from Cote Reserve, unless forced to do so. I will however do what I can to get more recruits for the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\n437943\nOttawa, June 20, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo in further reference to matters in connection with the Crowstand Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Chief Cote has been written to and informed that the Department expects him to give the school all the support he can instead of aiding and abetting the Indians in their constant fault finding.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.

McLellan\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. O. Blewett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI beg to say that I have, with the aid of Mr Bradford, acting Principal of Crowstand School, finished the investigation of happenings at that school in March and May last and herein give chief particulars.\n\nFrom statements of five of the larger girls, signed by these girls in the presence of witnesses, I find that during March last H. Everett, then farmer at the school, entered the girls dormitory alone on two nights and spent some time in the company of two girls in separate beds. A few nights after this, Everett, with five boys from the Reserves adjacent, entered the same dormitory and spent about half an hour there, each boy (except one who had no girl) got into bed with the girls. The girls deny that any immoral acts were committed, but in the case of three older ones, I doubt the truth of this. About the same time seven boys of the school pupils got out of their dormitory on two nights and climbed up the fire escape to the girls dormitory, but the girls say they did not get in, the boys also said the same, but by removing a piece of lath fastened on under the window by a small nail, they could easily have entered. (One boy afterwards told the Indian Police that they had often been in the girls dormitory nights). In May last, from statements signed by Harriet Papequash and Clara Fiddler, Everett had these two girls, separately in his private room, and locked the doors and had sexual intercourse with them. The Indian Police reported this to me while Mr Mc Whinney was sick but I did not care.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, Ont.\ncare to act till he was well enough to leave on furlough. I found after that he knew of the irregularities and had dismissed Everett, so that before I had definite facts to proceed on, Everett had left this district. I have had the Principal lay an information and have issued a warrant for him and will try to bring him to justice. I would like advice as to what I had better do regarding the Reserve men who were in the school with Everett that night. The girls in question are 14 and 15 years old.\n\nAs soon as the Cote Indians heard about this, when their children came home for holidays on Friday last, they had a meeting and decided to ask the Department to reconsider the Day School proposition, stating that they did not want to send their children back to Crowstand School again. They all agreed to ask for the Day School, except one man, that is all who were present, the list presented to me contains 18 names for and 1 against.\n\nThis unfortunate affair will make it doubly hard to get pupils for Crowstand School and I doubt very much if any will go except we apply the authority granted in the School Regulations.\n\nThere are, belonging to Cote Band, altogether some 50 children of School age.\n\nThe School Building at Crowstand is not at all suitable for good, safe and healthy work and if the Boarding School is to be continued a new school should be built at the earliest possible moment, before more serious things happen.\n\nI wish to express my appreciation for the splendid help given me all through this investigation, by Mr Bradford, who is doing his best to keep a good school at Crowstand.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, Aug. 8th, 1914\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith, for your information a copy of a letter received by the Department from Mr. Agent Blewett reporting the result of his investigation of the happenings at the Crowland Boarding school last spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Somerville, D.D.,\nAgent, Western Section,\nPresbyterian church in Canada,\nConfederation Life Bldg.,\nToronto, Ont.\nWith further reference to the matter of the trouble at Crowstand School, I beg to say that a warrant was issued for H. Everett, ex-farmer at the school and it is necessary for us to establish, beyond a doubt, the age of the two girls in question. I beg therefore to ask that as my copies of Annual pay-lists were all burned in the Office fire last winter, the Department send me the Pay-list for this Agency, covering the years, 1897-98-99-1900-01 & 02, so that I may have proof of their ages. These can be sent by registered mail and I will return them in the same way after we use them, it will thus save so much work making copies, and Courts often object to Copies being submitted. The police have received information of Everett's present whereabouts, from the Acting Principal, and will go for him as soon as they get the authority to go into Manitoba.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nJ.

We have always looked upon Mr. McWhinney as one of the most careful of all the men in charge of Indian work, and I am deeply grieved at the result of the investigation.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn Somerville\nOttawa, 19th August, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 3rd instant, I beg to state that copies of the annuity pay sheets of the Belly Agency for the years 1897, 1898, 1899, 1900, 1901 and 1902 are being sent you by registered mail.\n\nThe Department cannot forward the original books, as they are bound with those of the other Agencies in the West and all of them are frequently required here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. G. Blewett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn receipt of the report of your Agent, Mr. Blewett, I wrote to Mr. McWhinney, Principal of the Crowstand School, and sent on the report to him. I have just received the enclosed reply. It is clear from this report that your Agent is taking action against the parties on the strength of the investigation made, and Mr. McWhinney is returning shortly to the School. I am sure he will do all in his power to have this matter cleared up. You will see by his letter what he says in regard to the situation. He certainly is one of the best men that we have in Indian work, and it would be a great loss to our work if we had to lose him. I do not see that there is anything we can do from here.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions\nPresbyterian Church in Canada.\nMaxwell, Aug 15, 1914.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI came over here from Walkerton yesterday afternoon and on arrival found your letter of the 11th re misconduct at Cowanand School with the Agent's report enclosed. The following is my statement of the affair alluded to in this report.\n\nOn May 22nd last, I had occasion to go up to Mr. Everett's room to see him regarding some of the work. When I knocked at his door he opened it and asked me to come in. I saw at once something unusual was wrong and he then proceeded to confess to me that he had been having unlawful intercourse with some of the girls in his room. He was led to confess this by the fear that the other young man had already found it out and was likely to make it known. I asked him a few questions and then told him he must leave on the train that night. My reasons for taking this course were (1) I was only out of bed a few\n(2)\n\nI was unable to undertake the serious task of making any investigation. I had found from past experience that in such a matter the brunt of the prosecution would fall upon me. (2) Mr. Everett had always shown himself to be a young man of high honor and principle. He was young and acted foolishly and thoughtlessly sometimes but otherwise had been trustworthy. When he told me of what he had done he was completely overcome with shame. I felt that it was a case of a well meaning young man who had fallen in a time of weakness and to prosecute him would only ruin his life and give publicity to a matter that I hoped might otherwise be kept quiet.\n\nHis own conscience I felt would be the best punishment for him and for all concerned. Besides I had no evidence except his own confession.\n\nWith regard to his being in the dormitory, I know nothing about this. I am satisfied that the statement made by the boys that they were often in the girls' dormitory is untrue. I do not think any of the schools take so much care as we do at Crowfoot to see that the windows are made safe against anyone\ngetting out or in. My arrangements in that regard were so very secure that a few years ago Mr. Inspector Graham insisted that in case of fire it was a source of danger to the pupils and asked me to relax some of my precautions. The statement that the girl window could be opened by removing a piece of lath fastened by a small nail is a mistake. None of the windows could be opened as easily as that.\n\nAs the Agent says, the building is not such as to make such occurrences impossible. But it is well known that we have used every effort to have new buildings and nothing has been done. Yet when the like of this happens, the blame falls not on those who have neglected to put up suitable buildings but on the staff who are doing all that any set of people can do to make things safe. Of course some will blame me for keeping such a man as Mr. Everett. As I said before he seemed an honorable young fellow. Once or twice I had heard things which reflected upon him and I at once probed them to the bottom and found\nnothing in them. The ladies on the staff also looked upon Mr. Everett as all right in this regard at least.\n\nI cannot tell you how mortified and cast down I was when I found this matter out last May. But on account of my then state of health I had to, as far as possible put it out of my mind. Now this letter he brought it all back again with promise of difficulties with the Indians when I return. Occurrences like this happen occasionally I believe in every Indian boarding school. In our case these are always reported while in other schools the agents there take the view that no good can come of reporting them and they are kept quiet. Indian boys and girls have strong sexual passions. They know of cases of loose conduct on the part of their own fathers and mothers and they think lightly of these offenses. In boarding schools where there are both sexes the temptation is strong because of their seeing each other every day.\n\nThe burden of this responsibility of\nKeeping things right has been a heavy one and it was this which made me advise the semi boarding and day school to put more of this responsibility upon the parents. The best remedy of all is separate schools for boys and girls.\n\nYou ask me what to advise in this matter. Apparently the Agent has thoroughly investigated the matter. I do not know whether he intends to blame me or not but we can detect at least a shadow of that. All that I can advise would be to press upon the Department the great need for them carrying out their promise and take steps at once to build the new school. In the meantime if the Indians do as the Agent say they intend and refuse to send their children, the Department must bring pressure to bear or we must close up for the time.\n\nIf there is any other information or help which I can give let me know and I shall cheerfully give it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW. Newlin\nMaxwell, Aug. 20, 1914,\n\nDear Dr. Grant,\n\nYour letter in reply to my report on the Crowland trouble reached me last night. Under ordinary circumstances it is almost certain I should have not only reported the trouble to you in Toronto but have instituted proceedings against Everett. But as I pointed out before my health was in such a condition that I wanted to take a course that would relieve me of all possible worry. In the past I have not hesitated to push matters such as this to the limit, but in return have not, as I know, received any credit from the Department for so doing, while locally I have been blamed for being over zealous. In view of these facts I did what at the time seemed to me best. It needs to be remembered too that the information I had did not show Everett to be so deep in wrongdoing as it now appears he was.\n\nThese troubles, lamentable.\nas they are, have been occurring more or less for many years, before as well as since I came in charge. In a properly built school this danger could be very much lessened. In our present school I do not know of any change that could be made that would be of much value. I have been thinking deeply over the best course for the future and the following is what I would advise.\n\n1. Get the Government immediately to build a day school in a central location that would accommodate fifty pupils.\n\n2. Close Browntown School and rent the property until time improve or a suitable sale can be made.\n\n3. If it be found later that a residence for boarding pupils is needed, that can be erected then. The building of a day-school would simply be the first step in carrying out any plan of a Boarding and Day School.\n\n4. This should be done at once to have it in operation by winter. We can't carry on the boarding school if any considerable number of our pupils do not come back.\n\nI do not know if you are\naware that Miss Hope Laver, our teacher, was called home suddenly to Wolford about two weeks ago, by town trouble. In view of her early resignation she thought if I could get another teacher she would not return. I have been on the trail of several but have not secured one yet. Then too I do not want to take a teacher out from here until I know what is going to be done about closing the school or keeping it going. In any case if I find a suitable teacher I shall refer her to you that you may satisfy yourself as to her credentials.\n\nHoping to hear from you before I leave here as to what you think of my plan, I am\n\nYour Sincerely,\n\nW. McWhitney\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing another letter that I have just received from Mr. McWhinney, and you will see what he recommends as to the future work there. Let me know whether or not the Government will entertain the idea of proceeding with a building at once.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAndrew Grant\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 21st ultimo, No. 104, re irregularities at Crowstand School, I beg to say that I am pleased to learn, on final hearing in court, from the girls concerned, that the reserve boys were not in the dormitories as formerly reported, but were trying to get in only. This was told the court, by the girls after they had been home for a week, and as it was on oath we must believe it, although Mr. Bradford and myself thought in the case of all but two there were doubts, however we accepted it and hope it is true. The case of the Farmer at the School, Mr. Everett, was sustained, but we were handicapped by his having left before we had facts to hold him, and we have not been able to locate him. Mr. McWhinney has written me stating that Everett confessed to him before he was dismissed, that he had immoral relations with the girls in question, but being unwell at the time and hoping the young man would be benefited by this lesson, he sent him from the school and closed the matter up.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW.G.

Ryan-Hinney\n(Principal)\nOffice of The Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nSouth Saskatchewan Inspectorate,\n\nBalcarres, Sask., Sept. 5th, 1914\n\nRef.: Your Letter\n\nI beg to submit the following report on\nthe Crowstand Boarding School, which I visited\non the 31st of August, 1914.\n\n1. The Principal, Mr. McWhinney, who has been\nquite ill all summer, had just returned to the\nschool the day I visited it.\n\n2. The pupils who had been away for their\nsummer vacation had not yet returned to the\nschool although it was just about time that\nthey should be back.\n\n3. It is needless for me to make any\ncomments about the buildings as they are in\nabout the same condition as when I last reported\nto you.\n\n4. In going through the institution I found\neverything clean and in good order.\n\n5. I regret to bring the following matter\nto your attention.\u2014On my arrival at the\nreserve the Chief and a large number of the\nIndians of Cote Band asked for an appointment\nwith me and I met them the following day.\nThey had strong complaints to make about Mr.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMcWhinney and his staff regarding the management of the school. They think that the Principal does not take proper precautions to ensure the safety and well-being of the young girls entrusted to his care. They referred to past cases and particularly to a recent one when one of his staff, Mr. Everett, was found to be conducting himself in a most improper manner with the girls. A full report on this matter was sent to you by Mr. Blewett and it is unnecessary for me to go into details. The Indians think that Mr. McWhinney had no right whatever to allow Mr. Everett to escape punishment for the offences with which he is charged. They think Mr. McWhinney should have been the first to see that he was punished, and say that if he had reported the matter to the Agent they believe he would not have been allowed to go unpunished. A number of the children who were at this gathering refused to send their children back to school as they say a great deal is going on that should not be tolerated, and instanced this case and others.\n\nThere is no doubt that Mr. McWhinney is very much interested in the welfare of the pupils entrusted to him but he seems to have been unfortunate and has had a great deal of trouble of this kind. I believe that if he had reported this matter to the Agent and allowed the\nthe law to take its course the Indians would not feel so strongly against him as they now do. Mr. Blewett has had a warrant issued for the man's arrest and if he is found I have no doubt that he will be convicted and punished, and the Indians will feel that the Government has done all they could to bring the offender to justice.\n\n7. The financial standing of this institution is good, as usual. A detailed statement of the transactions for the last year is herewith enclosed.\n\n8. The Indians are pressing for a Day School. I shall bring this matter before you in another letter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInsp. of Indian Agencies.\nSeptember 19th, 1914.\n\nDear Dr. Grant,\n\nReferring to your letters of the 19th. and 22nd. ultimo with enclosure and to our recent conversation regarding the Crowland Boarding school, I beg to say that having given this matter careful consideration I have come to the conclusion that it would not be well to continue the co-education of the sexes in this school any longer, and for this reason it has been decided to return the girls to their parents so that their mothers may be in a position to look after them until other suitable arrangements can be made for their education.\n\nThe school may be kept on for boys exclusively and Mr. McWhinney is being instructed to discharge all the girls and return them to their homes.\n\nI feel constrained to say that I cannot accept the responsibility of in any way condoning Mr.\n\nRev. Andrew S. Grant, D.D.,\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nMcWhinney's treatment of the Everett incident. It appears to me that he can no longer be of great use at Crowstand as the Indians have no confidence in his management of the school, and I would suggest that he be sent at an early date to some other field of work. When we were considering these matters together, it was suggested that he might go to File Hills, and I would be glad if you would consider that transfer.\n\nYou have difficulties to overcome in the selection of the principals of these schools to which I do not wish to add in any way, but my conviction as to the situation at the Crowstand school is firm.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMr. D. C. Scott,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nYour letter of September 19th received. Mr. McWhinney has rendered splendid service at the Crowstand Reserve,\u2014perhaps better than any other Principal that we have had, and it seems rather drastic that he should be removed for this one act in connection with the farm instructor. However, since you have decided to return the girls to their homes, I suppose it is hardly worth our while keeping up that Boarding School, and I am writing Mr. McWhinney to ask him if he will take charge of the File Hills School, and will let you know as soon as I hear from him.\n\nI think that this matter of the Church maintaining these Boarding Schools will have to be gone into very carefully. It seems to me that the Government ought to be entirely responsible for the maintenance of these.\n\nHave you any suggestions to offer as to the lines on which the school for boys at Crowstand should be conducted? If\nMr. D. C. S.\n\nso, I would be pleased to hear from you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nAndrew Grant\nGen. Supt. of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada.\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\nSir,\n\nI beg leave to report that I have returned to my duties as principal of the Crowstand Boarding School, reaching here to begin my duties on Sept. 1st.\n\nReferring to the report which you received from Mr Agent Blewett I am pleased to report that practically all the children have returned to school. When I returned they were awaiting some decision by Mr Inspector Graham. After talking the lamentable occurrence in which my farm instructor was concerned last spring and hearing my statement he told the Agent to tell the Indians to bring the children back to school. I had a meeting with the leading men a few days afterwards and almost all were willing to be quite reasonable and send the children back. One man, Iavio Shingosch felt it incumbent upon him to take a different course from the others and said he would wait until he heard what the Department were going to do about building a day school. If it was not going to be done soon then he would bring his children back. He may change his mind however and do as the others have done. I told them of the recommendation I had made to the Department through Dr Grant of Toronto to build a day school at once and let them try it. Later if necessary (and I think it would be) they could add a small boarding school as an auxiliary to the day school. What these Indians would like is some definite statement as to when either a day school or a semi-boarding and day school can be built.\n\nI should be pleased to hear from the Department as soon as possible as to what we may expect in regard to new buildings. I am well aware that\nThe present times are unusual on account of the war but if you could give us some definite information as to what we may expect it would perhaps satisfy the Indians.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon, I Am,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nTo The Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Can.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have just received a letter from Dr. A. S. Grant of Toronto saying that the Department had notified me to return the Indian girls in our School to their homes. That is, a letter from the Department to Dr. Grant had stated that I had been notified to do so. I have not yet received such a letter and neither has the Agent received any such notice. If this is the wish of the Department then the boys will have to be sent home too, as we cannot maintain our School on a grant earning list of perhaps twenty pupils.\n\nIf this is done I would like to ask if it is the intention of the Department to accede to our request and build at once the new School for which we have been asking for so long. If these children are all sent home to their parents for the winter, the problem of their keep will be one that will need to receive attention from the Department, as times are likely to be hard. No better time could be chosen than the present to do building. It could be done cheaper than at any time for the last few years on account of the large number of idle men. It would be a patriotic act in the present time of stress in providing work for a number of Indians and white men who would otherwise be idle.\n\nI might say in conclusion that the Indians themselves do not want their children sent home unless there is another school provided to take the place of this one. At least this is what I would gather from what they have said to me.\n\nHowever I am ready to do whatever the Department may desire in the way of closing up. Hoping to hear from you very\nCROWSTAND\nINDIAN\nBOARDING SCHOOL\nREV. W. McWHINNEY\nPRINCIPAL\n\nKamsack, Sask.,\n\nsoon as to what is to be done as until this is known preparations for winter supplies must remain at a standstill.\n\nI Am,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nTo The Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Can.\nSeptember 30th, 1916.\n\nDear Doctor Grant -\n\nSince the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, I have given the matter of discharging the girls from the Crossland Boarding School further consideration. I may say at the outset that the action proposed in my letter of the 18th instant was not taken.\n\nIt is not my desire to do anything that would embarrass the Church in its work among these people. I feel, however, that, notwithstanding Mr. McWhinney's past services, which was always recognized and appreciated, I cannot condone his conduct in the Everett case. But it was not this alone that led me to suggest a new field for him. For some time past complaints have been received and it is quite evident that Mr. McWhinney has lost the confidence of the Otoe Indians. I am of opinion that only a change of management will restore their confidence.\n\nIf Mr. McWhinney would take up the work at Pine Hills and a new staff were placed in charge at Crossland\n\nRev. Andrew S. Grant, D.D.,\nToronto, Ont.\nthe aversion of the Indians may be overcome and the school regain the favourable standing it had for so long.\n\nSteps will not be taken to carry out my first proposal until I have heard from you again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nKamsack, Sask.\nOct. 1st, 1914\n\nSir,\n\nWe the undersigned Chief and some of the band members of Cole Indian Reserve, do this day venture to approach you in some matters important regarding the affairs of the Indians and also about the present school at Crow Stand and the school to be.\n\nWe hear that the Indian Department has given instructions to the Principal at Crow Stand\nSchool to send the girls home\nand keep the boys at the school.\nNow, we the said band of Indians\nof Cote Reserve would like to\nknow what the Indian Department\nare going to do about those\nchildren (girls) whether they\nare intending for those girls\nto remain at home and thereby\nlose a lot of what they would\nlearn if they remained at\nschool and whether the Indian\nDepartment wishes to give a day\nschool on the Reserve.\nWe the said band of Indians\nof Cote Reserve acknowledge\nthe fact that we want our\nchildren to be educated.\nAnd it is the intention of the Indians of Cot\u00e9's Reserve to write to the Indian Department on the views of some of the pupils that have attended these schools in different forms.

C. Scott,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nYours of September 30th received. Immediately on receipt of it, I wrote to Mr. W. McWhinney, and offered him the position, and also told him of the decision to return the girls from the Crowstand Boarding School to their homes. I enclose a copy of his reply. This will explain Mr. McWhimey's position in the matter. I do not think that he would accept a position at the File Hills School. Therefore, it would not be possible to carry out the suggestion of your recent letter.\n\nI have had very elaborate correspondence from Mr. Sweet, complaining about his treatment, and his discharge from that school, but the unfortunate thing is that, so far, I have not been able to secure a satisfactory man to take charge of the work. It looks as though we might have to continue him there for another year, and give him a longer notice of withdrawal. I would like to know what you think about this.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\nKamsack, Sept. 24th, 1914.\n\nDear Dr. Grant:\n\nYour letter today was something of a bolt from the blue, saying that the Department had said that they had notified me to return the girls to their homes. As yet I have received no such notice but no doubt it will come along in time. I have also asked the Agent and he has received no intimation of any such action.\n\nI have written the Department since receiving yours, telling them that if the girls are sent home the boys will have to go too as we cannot maintain a school building such as this on a grant earning list of twenty pupils or thereabouts. If they are going to begin building at once, it puts a different face on the matter, but they give no assurance of this. They could not build at a cheaper time as there are plenty of men wanting work and it would also supply work to some of the Indians who otherwise will be hard up this winter. Moreover, it would be a patriotic act to start such a work at the present time. The greater part, if not all these Indians will be anything but pleased to have their children sent home and no other school provided.\n\nNow, as to File Hills, as the matter at present appears, I am very unwilling to go there for the following reasons:\n\n1. The action of the Department in closing this School is in a sense a way of saying that I cannot run this School properly and if this is their attitude I would not want to take charge of another School where the plan of the school building is such that it would be very much harder to maintain proper\nconduct between the sexes.\n\n2. I am informed that there is no satisfactory residence for a Principal apart from the school.\n\n3. There is no place anywhere within reasonable distance where my own children could go to school unless they went to school with the Indian pupils, and anyone who has had experience in this work knows that this is not desirable. I have as much real fondness for the Indian children as anyone, but I feel I must safeguard the welfare of my own two little girls.\n\n4. I feel that I am in a better position as far as my own standing and influence is concerned to do good work as a missionary among the Indians here than I have ever been before and therefore I feel that I should stay.\n\n5. If the school is built I would like to be here to work out the plans I have formed.\n\nNow Dr. Grant I do not want you to think that I am writing this letter in a spirit of shirking or selfishness. I would be delighted to take this position simply because you wish it, and to help you out, but these considerations I have named are not to be lightly set aside.\n\nI shall likely write again when I hear from the Department. I would like to know just what they mean when they say \"better to have some change\".\n\nHoping that affairs here and at File Hills also may straighten themselves out satisfactorily, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW. McWhinney.\nIn view of the need of purchasing winter supplies immediately would you please inform me by return lettergram what the purpose of the department is concerning the future of the crowstand school ten days ago I wrote you on this same matter but have had no reply.\n\nW. McWhinney.\nOTTAWA, October 6th, 1916.\n\nRev. T. McWhinney,\nKensett, Sask.\n\nGreenland school will be conducted for both boys and girls during the coming winter and purchases may, therefore, be made accordingly.\n\n(Signed, Dept't Ind.)\n\nDuncan G. Scott.\nOctober 8th, 1914.\n\nDear Dr. Grant -\n\nI have your communication of the 3rd instant in further reference to the Crossfoot School and wish to let you know how matters now stand.\n\nOn the fifth instant I received a telegram from Mr. McWhinney stating that he wished to have a definite understanding as to the future of the school as he wished to make arrangements for his winter supplies, and I telegraphed him that the school would be conducted as at present during the coming winter and he could, therefore, make his purchases accordingly.\n\nAs I stated to you in my last letter, I have no wish to be harsh in this matter, but on the contrary my desire is to be helpful to the church in its educational work. We are aware that Mr. Sweet has not been a success as Principal of the File Hills School and the Department is cognizant of the fact that Mr. McWhinney's usefulness to the Cote Indians has been so impaired that it is doubtful if he can ever regain their confidence. For that reason I am sure that a change in\n\nRev. A. S. Grant, D.D.,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nprincipalship is absolutely necessary.\n\nI have been giving further consideration to the future of this school and have been in communication with Mr. Inspector Graham, and we are both of opinion that the final solution is a semi-boarding school on the Reserve.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMr Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThrough a letter received from Dr A. S. Grant, H.M. Superintendent, I have learned the following:\n\n1. You regard my action in regard to the Everett affair as inexcusable.\n2. You seem certain that I have lost the confidence of the Indians on these Reserves.\n\nIn regard to the first of these questions, I suppose you have seen the explanation of my course which I sent to Dr Grant in August and which I also stated to Mr Inspector Graham when he was here after my return to work. I admit that looking at the matter now my action might be called weak. But let me tell you that if most men had been in my position at that time they would have refused to take any part in the management of the School and let it run as it pleased until my substitute arrived. I should not have been bearing any responsibility at all at that time, considering the illness I had just come through, but I tried to do what I could to keep everything going right until my substitute Mr Bradford arrived. In view of this I think it most unfair that I should be judged so harshly for not showing the firmness which has usually marked my management. But aside from this many reasons could be given to justify what I did. Mr Bradford, who was acting Principal during my absence, and whom Mr Blewett commended for his help in the investigation has told me since I came back that if the matter had been left as I settled it, it would have been better for all. Others here in a position to understand\nthe whole circumstances are of the same opinion. No man can justly accuse me of neglecting to protect the Indian from the whiteman. I could point to instance after instance where I have been more active in securing justice for the Indian than the employees of the Department. Therefore without fear of contradiction I can say that in this matter I will take second place to no one. Notwithstanding all this I frankly admit that my action might be construed as weak in this instance, but I claim it was amply excused by the condition of my health.\n\nIn regard to the second matter I admit that there have been times in the past when such a statement would have been at least partly true, but at the present time it is without foundation. Never in all the years that I have been at Crowstand has my hold upon these Indians been so great or their attitude towards me so cordial. In regard to the past it must be remembered that I came here a few months before the advent of the railway and the influx of the white people. The second year the town of Kamsack was started on the Reserve and in my efforts to warn and protect the Indians from the unscrupulous white I sometimes earned the ill-will of both. The Indian at that time could not see that I was acting for his good. I admit too that like most people I made mistakes at times, but it was usually by being too zealous in the interests of the Indians. I think most whitemen may be excused for occasionally making mistakes in dealing with Indians. Then for the last few years there has been a group of men, of whose existence the Department is well aware, who have made no secret of their aim to get the Indians to surrender their land in order that their financial schemes might be advanced. I have op-\nposed these men and as a result they have tried for several years to injure myself and our School in the eyes of the Indians. I stated this fact before Mr Graham and Mr Blewett on the 31st of August last. You are aware Mr Scott that these men have tried to hinder the building of our new School for which we have been asking for years. But I am pleased to say that in the face of all this I have at the present time the confidence of these people as fully as any man could very well expect. As soon as these people learned that I was returning to my work at the first of September every child was eager to return to School and the people were willing to send them. None were more pronounced in showing this good feeling than Chief Cote who has so often opposed me in the past.\n\nIf conditions at File Hills were suitable for my own family, and the Department and the Church wished me to go there under ordinary conditions I should like to accommodate them, but I would never consider going for the reasons you have given, viz., that I have failed here. Rather than do this I would quit Indian work altogether, much as I desire to remain in it for the good I think I can do.\n\nIn the foregoing I have spoken plainly and I think it should be plain that my action in the Everett affair does not deserve the condemnation you have given it, and also that I still have the confidence of the Cote Indians.\n\nI Am,\n\nYours Respectfully\n\nW. McWhinney\nMr. D. G Scott,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing a letter that was enclosed to me from Mr. McWhinney, and, if his position is correct, I think that we ought to allow him for this year at least to remain where he is, especially in view of the fact that it is almost impossible for us to find a man, and he evidently will not go to File Hills. I have just received a telegram from Mr. Sweet, in which he says that the stables were burned down, loss estimated at $500.00, and loss to us $500.00, on account of fodder destroyed. I am afraid, from present appearances, it will be necessary for me to continue Mr. Sweet for the balance of this year. Let me hear from you as to what you think about this.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions\nPresbyterian Church in Canada.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nI beg to call your attention to the following extract from Mr. Agent Blewett's report on the Crowstand Boarding School for the month of October, last:\n\n\"Dormitories fair, play rooms dirty, water closets dirty. Many pupils dirty and poorly clad. Miss Gilmour's retirement from this school seems to have started it on the downward grade and now it is not fit for children to stay in under its present conditions, which, I think, can be improved somewhat if the Principal and staff make the effort to do so.

H. Edmison\nExcerpt:\n\nWinnipeg, 1054 Grosvenor Ave.,\nNov. 5th, 1914.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIn my trip West, last fall, I visited the Pelly agency, and saw Dr. Tran, but he was busy, and W. G. Bluet was away, officially, (but I saw them afterwards,) so I visited the Crowstead school, alone, and, if you remember, in my report then, I did not recommend it very highly, and my opinion of it now, it is even worse than then, when I made my recent inspection, October 28th.\n\nThe school is an old building, run by the Church, with Rev. Mr. McWhinney as Principal. He, Mr. McWhinney, said, when I was leaving, the other day, that he supposed that I would make a report, and I told him yes, but I could not say anything to recommend the institution, and he replied, no, that he could not expect anything else, as he knew that it was not up to the standard, but that he had asked a number of times for a new school, and did not feel like spending money on the institution, as it was. As far as I am concerned, as your Inspector, I may say, without exception, that it is the worst residential school I have had to visit, for the Department, as yet. The building, according to what I have been led to believe, has to be kept in proper repair, by the Church, and I cannot see that anything whatever, has been done to keep it such. It is in the most dilapidated condition.\n\nWhile visiting the wash-rooms, I found both in the boys' and girls', they were very unsanitary.\nIn the boys' wash-room, there were only three old, rusty, dented basins, for the whole class to use, and no individual towels.\n\nThe dormitories, by no means, were kept up to the standard. The water, which had been used for washing, was thrown out close to the school, with no proper drainage from it.\n\nThe building did not have screens for the windows, and the flies were very numerous, and had free access for entrance.\n\nThe children were healthy enough, but looked uncared for and not decently clad, and in going through different parts of the institution, I went to the store-room, and found sufficient clothing there to clothe the whole reserve efficiently.\n\nFrom hearsay I do not consider that the moral conditions are what the Department expects, and in my opinion, if I may be allowed, I would like to suggest that the whole boarding school be entirely done away with and that a good day school, with a suitable supervisor, be established, and that a fairly good hospital should be built there also for the care of the sick. I think, in Dr. Tran, you have a good medical man.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nO. I. Grain,\nMedical Inspector,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nNovember 28th, 1914.\n\nDear Dr. Grant -\n\nReferring to official letter forwarded to you on the 18th instant, and previous correspondence in connection with the Crossland Boarding School, I beg to say that a report has just come to hand from the Medical Inspector, Dr. G. I. Grant, of Winnipeg, who visited this school on the 28th ultimo. I regret to have to say that Dr. Grant's report confirms and emphasizes previous reports as to conditions at this institution.\n\nWe are of course aware that the building is far from satisfactory, but the Medical Inspector states that no attempt whatever has been made to keep it in any repair. He found the wash-rooms unsanitary, and especially mentioned the boys' wash-room in which he found three old rusty, dented basins for the whole class room to use and\n\nRev. Andrew S. Grant, D.D.,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nno individual towels.\n\nThe dormitories were not kept up to the standard, and the water which had been used for washing had been thrown out close to the school with no drainage facilities to carry it away. The windows were screenless and attempt was made to keep out the flies, which were very numerous.\n\nIn speaking of the health of the children the Doctor states that they appeared healthy and look uncared for and were not decently clad, although there was stored in the institution sufficient clothing to clothe the Indians of the whole Reserve.\n\nWhile, of course, no blame can be attached to the staff for the unsatisfactory building any more than that small repairs might be made, there would appear to be no doubt that the management of the school has of late been very insufficient.\n\nI thought that you should be advised of the general tenor of the Medical Inspector's report, as I know that you are now dealing with the question of the management of this institution.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDy. Supt. Genl.,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,-\n\nYours of Nov. 25th to hand re Crowstand Boarding school. Sorry to learn that Dr. Grain found things in an unsatisfactory condition. I am sending on the letter to Dr. Grant who is at present in the West. It is possible that he may be able to visit the school before he returns.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/EB\n\nJ. H. Edmison\nEdmonton, Alberta,\nNovember 20th, 1914.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAssist. Deputy Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYours of November 12th, forwarded to me here at Edmonton. I am forwarding the same to the principal of the Crowstand school with instructions to have these matters attended to.\n\nI beg leave to state that your Department promised us two years ago, a new school, and I have written you several times about it as it is impossible to keep this present building in a sanitary condition and the fault is the Department's, not ours. If you want a certain standard maintained in these schools, it is up to you to see that the buildings are put in proper shape.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDecember 2nd, 1914.\n\nDear Dr. Grant -\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, written from Edmonton in reference to the Crosstown School.\n\nI note your statement that the Department promised to erect a new school at this point. There does not appear to be any record of a promise and in this connection I would refer you to official letter of the 30th June, 1913, and to my letter of March 17th, 1914, last, in which I stated that the scheme of expenditure for the next two or three years had been outlined and that the needs of the Crosstown School were not overlooked. It is impossible to make a definite promise of an expenditure such as would be entailed in the erection of a new building in advance of parliamentary appropriation. I can only repeat what has already been said that I am not losing sight of the needs of this school, which will be provided for as soon as funds are obtained for the purpose.\n\nRev. Andrew S. Grant, D.D.,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nI am sure that you are aware of the heavy demand upon us and will fully realise that it is impossible to do all that we wish without spreading the expenditure over a few years.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Dr Grant,\n\nYours of recent date with enclosures from the Indian Department and your reply came to hand last night. Truly these Judas friends of mine are staying by me. Only, one has thrown off the mask at last.\n\nI shall deal with the various items in the report as follows:\n\nThis report is evidently based upon a visit made by Indian Agent Blewett Oct. 21st in company with Dr Tran of Kamsack and Dr Graham, Chief Medical Officer for the Department.\n\n1. On the morning of that visit I was most strongly impressed with the evident purpose of Mr Blewett to find something amiss. I attributed this to the fact that he was displeased with me at that time because I had at the request of some of the Indians drawn out a petition for them to circulate in opposition to the exchange of the present Reserve for another. I suggested sending this to the Department through Mr Blewett, but they objected saying they would not trust him to send it. Their reason for saying this evidently was that they knew he had been using his influence to get the Indians to agree to the exchange, and therefore would not want this petition to go in.\n\n2. The statement in regard to the Dormitories is unfair as I claim these are always in first class condition, being scrubbed every week.\n\n3. The statement that the children were poorly clothed is false, unless he bases his statement on the fact that as nearly as I remember one little boy had lost his garter and his stocking was down. Sometimes a person might come along and see boys or girls with torn garments. We all know\nclothing will tear and wear out sometime. But as soon as this is noticed it is at once changed. What more could be done?\n\n3. The statement that the children were dirty is also false. The pupils are bathed every week and are made to wash under oversight of some member of staff at least three times a day. But we know that when children are playing they may be clean now and in five minutes be dirty. Any reasonable person should allow for this.\n\n4. The wash-rooms are kept in as good condition as can very well be expected considering the condition of the buildings. They are carefully swept every day and scrubbed from time to time as necessary. But they may be clean one day and if there is a little dampness the mud comes in and the floors are dirty again. I remember the morning of this inspection that the wash basins were not as clean as they should have been, but when hard water is used in washing the soap sticks very easily and makes them look dirty. Usually they are cleaned up every morning but on that particular morning the boy who should have done this had neglected his work and there had not been time to have this set right.\n\n5. The only really just cause of complaint was the boys water closet which I admit was not in cleanly condition, but anyone who has had to do with any school where outside closets are used knows that it is very difficult to keep them in good condition. I had been unusually busy about that time and the cleaning up of this closet had been overlooked. It was attended to directly afterwards.\n\nLet me say further that for two or three years Mr. Blewett has not\ngiven our School any inspection worth the name unless when he came in company with the Inspector Mr Graham. He comes occasionally counts the names on the register and that is about all. Allowing for the condition of our buildings I claim the condition generally was as good as usual with the exception of the boy's closet. Yet I have not heard of any adverse reports in the past. In fact his annual reports, which are the only ones I have seen have been quite complimentary as a rule.\n\nFor the last three years at least we have expected each winter that by another year we would have a new building. On this account we have refrained from spending any money on repairs except what was the most necessary to tide over the short time we expected to be using the buildings. In this way the character of our buildings have been certainly on the downward trend, but I deny that the work has been lowered in quality except that during the past autumn we have been disturbed to some extent by the reports that the School was to be closed and by the fact that I have been unable as yet to obtain a permanent teacher since Miss McLaren left in August. It would be well for the Indian Department to realize however that several other things animate and inanimate on the Pelly Agency have been on the downward trend in a most decided way for the past few years.\n\nI hope the foregoing explanation may be satisfactory. I have not tried in what I have written to make any counter attack on the Indian Agent. Anything which I have said which may reflect upon him has come out incidentally in defending my own position. I have always tried to work in harmony with the Agent and to support his\nauthority with the Indians. Where I could not approve I have if possible kept silent. I am sorry that Mr. Blewett has seen fit to make this attack upon our School as it will make our relations less pleasant in the future.\n\nI Am,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nRev. W. McWhinney\nRegina, Sask. Nov. 30, 1914\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing a letter that I have received from the Principal of the Krowstend Indian School, in reply to my request that he should give us an explanation of the conditions that were reported by the Inspector against the school. My impression at the present time is that because of adverse reports of this kind the probability is that we will not enter into any new contract with the Government regarding Indian Boarding Schools in the West. If a man like Maclean cannot give satisfaction, then I want very strongly to tell you that I do not think that we can find a man who will; and my own impression is that the standard in these schools that we have is quite as good, if not better, than in many of the schools under the care of others.\n\nMy own deliberate opinion is that the Government is not on the right lines at all in these boarding schools. They are wasting the public money.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDy. Supt. Genl.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,-\n\nYours of Dec. to hand re Crowstand School.\nDr. Grant is in the West yet. I am hoping he has found time to visit this school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/EB\n\nJ. H. Edmison\nDecember 9th, 1914.\n\nDear Dr. Grant -\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo, in further reference to the management of the Crowland Indian Boarding School with enclosure from Mr. McWhirter.\n\nSince writing you on November 15th I have sent a further report on the institution to headquarters in Toronto from Dr. Grain, our Medical Inspector, which corroborates the report made by Mr. Blissett, the Agent, that was drawn to your attention.\n\nI note your remarks that you are of opinion that the Government is not on the right lines in its policy respecting boarding schools. I should be very pleased indeed to have your views, as I am always anxious to give sympathetic consideration to any suggestions made with a view to improving our system. I am quite aware of the importance and difficulty of the problem and welcome helpful information.\n\nRev. Andrew S. Grant, D.D.,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\ninformation from those, who like yourself, are in a position through experience to help in the solution.\n\nIn conclusion I wish to refer to Rev. Mr. McWhinney's remarks regarding Mr. Blosset's attitude. Mr. McWhinney appears to look upon Mr. Blosset's report as an attack upon his school. Why he should do so I am at a loss to understand. Mr. Blosset's report is confirmed by that of Dr. Grain, but I hope an improvement will be shown as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDec. 11, 1914\n\nMr. D. C. Scott,\nDy. Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nYours of Dec. 9th received, also your letter dealing with the Medical Inspector's report of Crowstand.\n\nYou refer to my statements in a previous letter regarding Indian Boarding schools. I am fast coming to the conclusion that the proper place to educate these Indians is in day schools on their own reserves, and that alongside of these we should carry on our mission work, the Government being responsible for the schools. The cost of equipping and maintaining these boarding schools, in my judgment, is hardly justifiable either on the part of the Government or the Church. My opinion at the present time is that the Church will not enter into any contract with the Government again, unless the bulk of the cost of maintaining the schools is borne by the Government.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nAndrew S. Grant\nDecember 15th, 1914.\n\nDear Dr. Grant,\n\nI have to thank you for your letter of the 11th instant and for your expression of opinion as to the place of day schools in our educational system. On several reserves, principally in Saskatchewan, we have tried what we call \"the improved day school system\", with a considerable degree of success where we have been able to obtain the services of properly qualified teachers. We engage, preferably, a man and his wife, the former to take charge of class-room work, and the latter the teaching of domestic science to the girls at the school and general field matron work on the reserve.\n\nThere are, however, reserves on which the Indians are so located that it is almost impossible to obtain regular attendance at the day schools without which no reasonable degree of success can be attained.\n\nRev. Andrew S. Grant, D.D.,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nI may state that I have received sketch plans for the proposed new building on the Cote Reserve and these are now under consideration by our architect. I am not in a position, however, to state definitely when the work can be undertaken, as all will depend upon funds that are made available.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nKamsack, Sask., April 11th, 1914\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI understand that the plans for the proposed Semi-Boarding and Day School for Cote's Reserve are now prepared. If all convenient I should be much pleased if you could send me at least a rough draft of the proposed buildings.\n\nI would also add that the sooner the work can be gotten under way the less will be the cost for labour. If the coming summer is favourable for a good crop in the West labour will be very hard to obtain after the First of August.\n\nHoping that you may be able to accommodate me with a copy of these plans, I Am,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nW. McWhinney\n\nTo Mr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Can.\nApril 16th, 1915.\n\nDear Mr. McWhinney -\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, and under separate cover am sending you a blueprint of the proposed semi-day and boarding school building. I may say that it has not been definitely decided to proceed with this work this year.\n\nI am informed that there are only sixteen children for enrolment in the boarding school, and I cannot see how the financial needs of an institution could be met with such a small number, unless the church would be prepared to assist, which according to Rev. Dr. Grant it is not.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. W. McWhinney,\nPrincipal,\nCrowfoot Indian Boarding School,\nKamsack, Sask.\nDear Mr Scott,\n\nYour letter of the 16th Inst. has come to hand. Please accept my thanks for sending the plan of the proposed school. I sincerely hope nothing will be allowed to hinder the work being proceeded with this season. There are no doubt difficulties in the way but these will have to be met and solved in any case and will be just as easy or easier now than later. I am well aware that this is something of a new venture but I think that Indian workers in the past have been too unwilling to break new ground in order to find solutions for the difficulties which we all admit. I do not think the general tone of educational, moral and religious work was ever so promising as it has been lately. I believe therefore that this combination of the two kinds of schools is the only arrangement which will meet the present needs. It is an experiment I admit, but I have great confidence that it can be made a success.\n\nI think the financial problem can be met quite successfully. But if we get the results the Department should be willing to make the grant suitable. I have always held that it was a mistake to ask the schools of different sizes to live on the same per capita grant. The smaller schools cost more per pupil than the larger schools. Therefore most principals try to get their attendance as high as possible, although it is generally admitted that the small school which can be run on the lines of a home does better work in building character than the large institution. If this size of School does a better grade of work their grant should be so increased as to make it possible for them to make ends meet.\nI do not know upon what basis you make grant to the day schools, but I infer you make a grant to the teacher's salary and also allow a sufficient sum to give the pupils a warm mid day meal. I find each that at the present time it costs approximately fifteen cents a day to board our pupils. The mid day meal where meat is used costs more than the other meals of the day, so that about seven cents would be a good allowance for this meal per day per pupil. The following statement would show something about where we would stand.\n\nReceipts:\nPer capita grant for 16 pupils at $125 each - -$2000\nGrant of 7 cents per meal for 30 day-pupils\nfor 210 school days - - - - - - - - - - 441\n\nExpenditure:\nMaintenance of 16 Boarding pupils per year $800\nMeals for 30 day pupils 441\n$2441 $1241\n\nExtra Labour Fuel and Light etc. $1200\n$2441 $2441\n\nI am assuming that the Department will pay all or nearly all the teacher's salary and the Church will pay the balance and also the salary of Principal, matron and if necessary an assistant matron. Dr Grant must have meant that the Church would not contribute towards the other running expenses of the school. If this should not prove enough I think it would be quite in order for the Department to raise the per capita grant for boarding pupils to $140 per year.\nThe amount necessary for fuel and light is very uncertain. We could not very well arrive at that until we tried the plant.\n\nI think however that we should be able to handle the financial problem and it should not hold back the work. If a school is not built this summer we shall have to close up when the cold weather comes next fall. The basement of the present school is in such a condition that it is not fit to use during the cold weather. I understand an amount has been placed in the estimates for this building and it should not be allowed to go for anything else. There are between fifty five and sixty children of school age that should attend this school when built and it would be very unfair to have them remain out of school next winter because of the delay in getting this work underway.\n\nI shall write Dr Grant in regard to the part the Church will take in the financing and I sincerely hope that there will be no further delay in this much needed school building.\n\nI Am,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nTo Mr Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nRe: Crowstand School\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nPlans have been prepared for combined Boarding and Day School at the Cote Reserve, with accommodation for 24 pupils and Staff, and class-room accommodation for 56 pupils. The building contains all other necessary accommodation meeting Department's requirements for Boarding Schools.\n\nWith a minor re-arrangement of plan and placing a story over the class-room wing, the dormitories will provide accommodation for 40 pupils if this should be found necessary, and children taken into the school from other points than on the Cote reserve.\n\nThe preliminary plans were submitted to Inspector Graham, who now states that 16 pupils only are available as boarders at this school, and the Principal estimates that there will be in attendance 30 day pupils, but, as the Department\nDepartment will pay the salary of teacher and actual cost of mid-day meal, this need not be considered in figuring the cost of operation.\n\nIf 16 pupils only are available, the income of school at $100 per capita the earning power of school will be, $1600.00\n\nProduce farm and garden, $1000.00\n\nCost of heating, lighting building and pumping water, etc., $600.00\n\nFood for pupils and Staff, 16 pupils, and family and staff of 5 equals 21, at 25\u00a2 per diem per capita for 210 days, $1102.50\n\nClothing, 16 children at $10 each per year, $160.00\n\nPrincipal's salary, $1000.00\n\nMatron, Cook, and Assistant @ $400 each, $1200.00\n\nTotal expenses, $4062.50\n\nDeficit, $1462.50\n\nProviding the earning power of the school from farm and garden is equal to the estimate as above, the church authorities will have to provide for this annual deficit or this extra cost met by the Department.\n3.\n\nUnless the Presbyterian church is willing to undertake this financial outlay, it would appear undesirable to erect a boarding school for the pupils available, as the cost of maintenance in a school such as this, requires at least 45 pupils to meet the cost of management.\n\nAn improved day school will entail no extra expense beyond the charge for teacher and mid-day meal, which would have to be added to the cost of combined school, except extra cost of mid-day meal to pupils attending in excess of the 30 pupils estimated.\n\nIn my opinion, the Department should not incur the expenditure required to build the combined boarding and day school, unless at least 40 pupils are available, and would recommend that an improved day school be erected as being under the circumstances in the best interests of the Indian on this reserve as well as the Department.\n\nArchitect.\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reference to previous correspondence in connection with the proposed combined day and boarding school for the Oote Indian Reserve I beg to say that, after careful consideration, the Department has decided that it would not be justified in putting up a school of this class on this reserve, as the cost of maintenance and management could not be met out of the per capita grant and in view of your statement that your church would not be prepared to assume the deficits that would be sure to arise. To afford educational facilities for the children on this reserve the Department will erect a building which will meet the requirements of the improved day school system.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. A. G. Grant, D.D.,\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am sorry to have to report that three large boys and a smaller one, pupils in our school, have been guilty once more of the offense of forcibly opening their dormitory window and going out at night and spying on the girls' window and in the same manner forcing and entering there. They admit trying to have sexual connection with the girls but from all the evidence we can gather they did not accomplish their object.\n\nMr Agent Blewett and myself have gone into the matter carefully and find they could be sent to jail for the offense but hesitate about sending these boys into prison surroundings. Two of them have been concerned in such wrongdoing before and have been thoroughly warned before of the penalties attached. Instead of sending them to prison we thought it might be better for the future of the boys and for all concerned to transfer them to other schools. We would suggest sending one to Brandon, one to Elkhorn and one to Battleford, providing the principals of these schools and the Department approve. Otherwise these are pretty good boys.\n\nI am writing you at the Indian Agent's suggestion to ascertain what you would advise in this matter, and shall be pleased to hear from you as speedily as possible.\n\nAs an indication of the care we have taken to prevent such occurrences the boys had to use a hammer and chisel to open the windows.\n\nI Am,\n\nTo The Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nW. McWhinney\nOttawa, May 22nd, 1915.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to enclose a copy of a letter received this morning from Rev. T. McWhinney, Principal of the Crowstand Boarding school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. A.S. Grant, B.B.,\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nMr. D. C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott;-\n\nI am in receipt of a letter, file No. 116741-1, in which the decision of the Department is given in regard to the erection of a combined Day and Boarding School on the Cote Indian Reserve.\n\nPersonally, I think that this decision is a wise one, and question very much the wisdom of multiplying unnecessarily these Boarding Schools, although the proposed plan of combining the boarding and day school was a step in the right direction; yet, I am strongly of the opinion that a system of day schools on the Reserves, coupled with mission work carried on among the Indians, is the better plan. The only thing is that steps ought to be taken at once to have this decision put into effect, as the present buildings are not fit for use for another year. We will have to give notice to the staff, as, under your present arrangements, I suppose they would not be required.\n\nASG/EG.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAndrew Grant\nMr. J. D. McLean,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McLean:\n\nI have yours of May 22nd, with copy of a letter from Mr. McWhinney enclosed. It seems to me that it would not be a good thing to send these boys to other schools to cause trouble there, but, as this is their first offence, it might be well to give them the benefit of the law. However, I suppose the Department will deal with this matter as they see best. I have not had any word about this from the Principal of the School.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions\nPresbyterian Church in Canada.\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\nOttawa, May 31, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 25th instant I beg to say that the Department agrees with you that it would not be wise to have the boys referred to in Mr. McWhinney's letter of the 17th instant, a copy of which was sent you, transferred to another school and, as it is not considered advisable to take legal proceedings against them, the Department will instruct Mr. McWhinney to have discharged from the Crowstand Boarding School at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. A. S. Grant, D.D.,\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, May 3, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant reporting that you have had trouble with some of the boys in your school, who forced an entrance into the girls' dormitory.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department does not consider that it would be advisable to have these boys transferred to another school nor to prosecute them, but it wishes to have them discharged from your school at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. W. McWhinney,\nPrincipal,\nCrowfoot Boarding School,\nKamsack, Sask.\nOttawa, May 31, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant in reference to the proposed erection of an improved day school on the Cote Reserve and, as this will necessitate the closing of the boarding school, the staff should be notified that their services will not be required after the 30th of June and the boarding school should be closed on that date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nI. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. A. G. Grant, D.D.,\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nMr. D. C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nAs soon as I received your letter notifying us that the Boarding School at Crowestand would be closed at the end of June, I wrote to Mr. McWhinney informing him of your decision, and then had to leave at once for the General Assembly. On my return, I took the matter up with the Women, and they took the position that you cannot close one of our Boarding Schools without consulting us, and they insist that the semi-boarding and day school, as recommended by Mr. McWhinney, and agreed upon by you, should be built, as children that are now in the Boarding School would be lost to us if we dropped to a Bay school. They also contend that this Boarding School ought to be kept open until the other school is ready for use, and that the grant must be continued, as the salaries of those employed will have to be paid, and longer notice than this is necessary before they can be let go. I think that the grant should continue for at least another quarter, if the school is to be closed, as we have our\nengagement with our workers to consider. In the light of this, I would like to know from you what you are prepared to do.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions\nPresbyterian Church in Canada.\nJune 22nd, 1915.\n\nDear Dr. Grant,\n\nI have your communication of the 14th June with reference to the Crowstand Boarding school. I note your statement that the Woman's Auxiliary have expressed their mind in this matter.\n\nThe contract under which the school is operated is signed by the Rev. Dr. MacKay. It provides that six months' notice should be given in case of the annulment of the contract owing to nonfulfilment of the conditions. You therefore, have a right to six months' notice.\n\nIs the Woman's auxiliary thoroughly conversant with the trend of the late correspondence? I think if they had copies of the reports which we have received and copies also of letters interchanged between us, they might not be averse to the contemplated motion.\n\nWhen I went into the question of a semi-day and boarding school, I saw clearly that it could not\n\nRev. A. S. Grant,\nSuperintendent, Board of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nbe conducted without financial loss to the church; this is what you wish to avoid and I was not prepared to say that the Government would give larger grants.\n\nI do not wish the Woman's Auxiliary to think that I am forcing this school to be closed, and I am willing to reconsider the whole matter if they have any suggestions to make. It seems to me that if they understood the conditions at the Crowstand school, they would agree that the morals of the girls would be better safeguarded by their mothers, than by the present lodging arrangements in the building and by the discipline of the institution.\n\nI have asked for tenders for a new day school building on the reserve, but of course will not let them until we see some further light.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMr. D. C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nYour letter of June 22nd received, in reference to the Crowetand Boarding School. You state that the contract under which these Boarding Schools operate is signed by Dr. McKay. When this contract was made, the Indian work was under the Foreign Mission Committee, but it is now under the Home Board, as you know. Under these circumstances, I understand we are entitled to six months' notice before closing a school. We have our staff on our hands, and you notified us on the last of June that the School would close on the 30th. Now, this is not sufficient notice to enable us to readjust matters. If you are prepared to give us the six months' notice, and we will be entitled to the present grant for that time, then we can give our staff due notice, and arrange accordingly.\n\nI understand you are going on at once with the erection of the Day School. It has occurred to me that, if any of the pupils\nthat are there require to have the advantages of a Boarding School, we might place them in some one of our other schools.\n\nI am writing the Principal of the School to wind up the business there, and notify the members of staff that this Boarding School is to close. I hope there will be no delay in getting the Day School ready for the autumn work.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions\nPresbyterian Church in Canada.\nJune 25, 1915.\n\nDear Doctor Grant,\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd of June, with reference to the Crowstand boarding school; we are quite prepared to give you six months' notice from the 1st of June; it would hardly be possible for us to pay you the six months' grant and that is not contemplated by the contract, however, we will not be disposed to drive any hard bargain in this matter, and you can count on the grant for the September quarter. This should give you ample time to get rid of the pupils and the staff, and you should be able also to close without financial embarrassment.\n\nThe tenders for the day school on the Cote reserve are receivable up to the 22nd of July; I am inclosing you the advertisement slip.\n\nI believe there is plenty of room in the File Hills boarding school for any children who should not be sent back to the reserve from the Crowstand school.\n\nRev. A. S. Grant,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nMr. McWhinney and Inspector Graham should be able to arrange this without difficulty; I will write to Mr. Graham on this subject today.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nJune 25, 1915.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI have had some correspondence with Rev. Dr. Grant regarding the closing of the Crowstand boarding school, and it occurs to me that there might be some pupils who should not be sent back to the reserve and who might be transferred to the File Hills boarding school. Kindly co-operate with Mr. McWhinney in disposing of these pupils in their best interests.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M.

Scott,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have just returned from the West, and during my trip I visited the School at Kamsack and found there was no sign yet of any school building for Indian work being erected, and that no contracts had been let, and that there were no materials on the ground. I decided that we would keep the boarding-school open until the end of November, so that we would be able to hold the children on the Reserve, and instructed our Principal, Mr. McWhinney, accordingly. I have just received a letter from Mr. McWhinney, dated Aug. 26th, in which he states that Mr. Graham was been in communication with you, and that you have stated that the school was closed, not to be reopened. My contention is that that communication should have been to me, and not to Mr. Graham, and this school will be reopened, and continue open until the end of November, and I have authorized the Principal to govern himself accordingly, and make arrangements with his staff. We will expect the per-capita grant covering that period, and I am writing to give you\nMr. D. C. S.,\n\nnotice to that effect, as in no case would it be good business for us to let the children scatter without any provision being made, especially in view of the fact that the building was not under way, and the time for the reopening of the school was near at hand. It seems to me that this is the only thing that can be done under the circumstances, and hope it will meet with your approval.\n\nI note what you say in your letter of Aug. 25th, regarding the File Hills School and its Superintendent. We have several men who are far better qualified all round for the supervising of this school than is Mr. Gibson. As you are aware, it is not farmers only that we want, but men who are able on educational and religious grounds to conduct the work of the School.\n\nI was very much pleased with my visit to the Protagon la Prairie School. The equipment there is everything that could be desired; the School is full of pupils already, and the crop this year is second to none in any part of the West.\n\nThere are several matters that will have to be gone into very soon in connection with this Indian work, and I hope to be able to have an interview with you before long in regard to these matters.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nASG/EG.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, August 30, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram of the 27th instant, which reads as follows: \"Have you authorized the reopening of Crowstand school certain Indians object to send children back rush answer am leaving tonight\".\n\nIn reply I beg to confirm the following telegram sent you on the 27th: \"Crowstand school is not to be reopened\".\n\nThe Department has written to Mr. Solomon Cote, one of the headmen of the Cote Band, and the Acting Indian Agent, Mr. Christiansen, informing them that it is not the intention of the Department to re-open this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I wired the Department for information and received the above quoted telegram and letter. On receipt of the telegram I met Mr. McTinney and informed him that you had said the school was not to be re-opened. I also told the Indians what you had said.\n\nTwo days ago I received a letter from Mr. Christianson saying there was a widow on Cote reserve, with two children, who should be attending school, as she was unable to provide for them.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nthem. I wired Mr. Christianson to bring them to the File Hills school and yesterday I received the following reply:\n\n\"Favel children going to Crowstand school.

At the time of your writing, the contract for the new day school on the Cote Reserve had been let to the Wodger Construction Company, of Winnipeg. Their contract calls for the completion of the building by the 1st of December.\n\nThere was evidently some misconception about closing the boarding school, as it was not my intention to vary in any way the understanding we had arrived at.

I have agreed with Dr. Grant that the pupils should be sent back pending the opening of the day school on the Gota Reserve. I enclose you herewith a copy of my letter to him. What should have been conveyed by the telegram is, that there was to be no permanent reopening.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. H.

I am glad to know that the contract has been let for the school, and that the building will be ready by the 1st of December, as we have arranged to keep the Boarding School open until that date, so that our pupils will not be scattered. Attempts have been made by Catholics and others to secure the pupils, and, if there are any who wish to go to Boarding Schools, we ought to be able to send them to File Hills rather than have them scattered in the schools of other denominations, when we have brought them this far on the way. We will require the per capita grant for the number of pupils that are actually in the Boarding School until the time it closes, and not any longer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAndrew S.

As you will have noticed, we are asking for tenders for a day school on the Cote Reserve, Kamsack, Sask.\n\nWe have agreed with Dr. Grant to close the Crowstand school at once.

The buildings are heated by stoves with the help of a furnace. Wood is used altogether for fuel.\n\nAccommodation\nThe school has ample accommodation for 50 pupils.\n\nHistory of School\nOn Nov 2nd/79 A.G. Macdonald in his report stated that Chief Cote's band...\nwere desirous of having a school started on the Reserve and that there was 30 children within a radius of two miles who would attend.\n\nBy an O.C. dated March 26 - 1880, a grant of $100 was given by the Deptt towards the completion of the school building at the Crowfoot's and also an appropriation for the teacher's salary amounting to $12 per year for each pupil, the total however not to exceed $100 per annum.\n\nThis school was first opened in 1880 and conducted as such up to the end of the March 9th 1889, the teacher being paid an allowance of $12 per capita for each pupil.\n\nOn the 28th January 1899, the boarding school was started and the day school ceased to exist. It has been conducted as a Boarding School ever since. The average attendance at that time was 29. Acton Jones in his annual Report for 1889 (see page 63) says \"that the Presbyterian mission have erected a large building for the purpose of a boarding school, which was opened about March (1889) and is under the direction of the Rev. Geo. A. Laird.\n\nOn the 15th Oct/88 the joint convenors of the Presbyterian Church, writing to the Comm. of Indian Affairs stated that a substantial frame building costing about $1800 had been\nbeen erected at the Crowfoot. They also asked that a grant of 60\u00a2 per capita for the average attendance be given them by the Deptt. for each of their three schools viz. Birch Clowstand & 4 Mile Hills.\n\nBy an O.S. dated the 29th Nov. 1888, a grant of 60\u00a2 per capita for 25 pupils was allowed each of these schools, the whole amount to each not to exceed the sum of $300.\n\nThe Commrs requested for these schools as follows: \"That in case of the attendance being less than 25 at one school and more than 25 at another, the money not needed for the former case be applied to cover the excess of pupils in the latter.\"\n\nThis request was acceded to by the Deptt. and the Commrs notified to this effect. It was also stated that this decision was not to form a precedent for similar procedure in regard to other Boarding Schools.\n\nOn the 23rd May 1889, the Commrs was notified that after the first July 1889, a grant was available for these schools of 60\u00a2 per capita for each of 20 pupils.\n\nOn the 14th July 1890 the Rev. Andrew Baird wrote the Sup't of Indian Affairs and he stated that the accommodation at the school was not sufficient \u2014 that the Church was erecting a new building to increase the accommodation and that they had already spent $2700 on the building and wished the Deptt.\n(continued)\n\nmake an appropriation towards helping them erect the new stone building for promised school purposes at the Crowfoot, and also asked that the per capita grant be increased from 60 to 160.\n\nThe Dept. considered that it would not be advisable to give a grant toward the erection of a new building for the reason that they did not consider it proper to expend Govt money on buildings situated on land which did not belong to the Govt and as to increasing the per capita grant Mr. Baird was informed that only schools of the industrial class received the rate for which he asked.\n\nIn reply to this argument, the Rev. Mr. Baird writing in behalf of the Synodical Committee of the Presbyterian Church says: \"That the Committee is willing to convey to the Govt a site for the building with the hope that the Dept. will then give them a grant of $1000.00 towards completing the stone building. The whole cost of the erection of the building to the amount of $2700.00 has thus far been borne by the Church without assistance from the Govt. The site on which it is proposed to erect the building is homesteaded by the Presbyterian Church although the patent has not yet been secured. It is intended that the patent be secured so that interest in the ownership in the hands will be given...\"\nHistory (continued)\n\nOn the 17th Febry 1891, Mr. Baird forwarded to the Dept' copy of a letter which he had written to the Indian Comm., stating that owing to a change in the proposed plans of the new school whereby another story was added to the height, a considerable increase in the cost was necessary and that instead of \u00a31000 as at first estimated the cost would be \u00a32700 00 and he asked that the Govt bear the additional expense thus incurred, in addition to the \u00a31000 already asked for making altogether the sum of \u00a32700 00 asked for by the Church authorities for the Crowland Bldg School.\n\nIn a memo which was submitted to the Sup't-General of Indian Affairs by Mr. Vanderburgh, he stated that he concurred with the above proposition as being a fair one and that it should be accorded to thus equalizing the cost of the buildings as between the Church & the Dept' being \u00a32700 00 to each party making the entire cost of the school building amount to the gross sum of \u00a35400 00\n\nBy O.C. dated the 27th June authority was given for the payment to the Presby. Church authorities of the sum of \u00a31000 00 towards the erection of the new building at the Crowland, so soon as they shall have\nHistory (continued)\n\nhave submitted to the Dept. receipted Vouchers showing that that sum has been expended by them in the erection of the buildings.\n\nA cheque for the amount of $1000.00 was forwarded to the said Commrs. on the 29th March 1892 in payment of the grant to the Crowsland Boarding School.\n\nOn the 7th Nov. 1892 the said Indian Commrs. Mr. Forget wrote the Dept. asking that a cheque for the sum of $1700.00 in payment of the balance of grant in lieu of the Boarding School at Crowsland be forwarded as provided for in the Estimate of 1892-93.\n\nIn reply the Commrs. were informed that as the title to the land upon which the school was built had not been transferred to the Dept. by the Presbyterian Church authorities although long since called upon to do so no further advance could be made until this was done.\n\nOn the 30th January 1893 the Rev. Mr. Baird made application to the Commrs. of Dominion Lands at Winnipeg for a Patent of the land comprising the South 1/2 of Sec. 19 Township 29 Range 31 West of the First Principal Meridian and also requested that 10 acres comprising the site of the building be\nHistory (Concluded)\n\nbe reserved and handed over to the\nIndian Dept.\n\nThe only title the Church had to the\nland was one of undisputed occupancy\nsince the establishment of the Mission\nat the Crossroads in 1894.\n\nOn the 13th June 1893 an Order in\nCouncil was passed authorizing the\ngrant to the Presbyterian Church\nof the land mentioned,\nreserving without a parcel of ten\nacres to be transferred to the Dept.\nupon the receipt of a surveyors\ndescription of the said parcel.\n\nThis 10 acres being the gift of the\nPresbyterian Mission Boarding School\nfor Indian Children to be transferred\nto the Dept. of Indian Affairs by an\nO.C. dated April 16/95 and the\nO.C. published in the Royal Gazette of\nMay 18/95. In the fourth consecutive week\nfor occupation of this 10 acres as O.C.\nabove mentioned on File No. 741\n\nA Cheque for \u00a31700 being the balance\nof the grant as stated in the Estimate\nfor 1892-93 was forwarded to the\nIndian Comm. on June 25/93.\n\nThe total amount contributed by the\nGovt. to the Crossroads Boarding School\nwas as follows:\n\n1000\u00a3 paid March 29/93 by O.C.\n1700\u00a3 June 25/93 from Estimate\nof 1892-93\nPer Capita Grant\n\n1889-89 The Crowland Boarding School was first opened January 28th, 1889.\n\nBy O.C. dated Nov 29th, 1888 a grant of $60.00 per capita for each of 25 pupils was allowed the school. The amount of this grant actually received by the school up to the end of the fiscal year 1889-89 was $806.31.\n\n1889-90\n\nThe number of pupils receiving the grant during this year was reduced, 20 pupils being provided for as against 25 pupils during the previous year.\n\nOn the 23rd May 1889 the Board of Commissioners was notified that after the 4th of July 1889 a grant was available for the Crowland School of $60.00 per capita for each of 20 pupils.\n\n1890-91\n\nThe Estimates for this year allowed an increase in the number of pupils and provided for 30 at $60.00 per capita.\n\n1891-92\n\nThe Estimates for this year provided a grant of $72.00 per capita for each pupil up to the number of 30.\n\n1892-93\n\nThe grant provided by the Estimates for this school was the same as that of the previous year.\n\n1893-94\n\nThe Estimates provided the sum of $72.00 per capita for each of 30 pupils, $20.00 being an allowance.\n\n1894-95\n\nThe Estimates provided the sum of $72.00 per capita for each of 30 pupils, $20.00 being an allowance.\nPer Capita Grant continued\n\n1895-96: The Grant allowed this school during this year was $72.00 per Capita for each of 30 pupils.\n\n1896-97: The Grant was the same as the previous year $72.00 for each of 30 pupils.\n\n1897-98: Same as two previous years.\n\n1898-99: Same grant as previous three years.\n\nJ.B. 28/4/99\nKamsack, Sask.,\nJune 17th, 1926.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Minister of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has been reported to me several times of late that it is the intention of the Government to build a rather expensive Indian Boarding School on the Keeseekoose Reserve, five miles north of the present Cote Improved Day School on the Cote Reserve. In connection with this, I would like very respectfully to call your attention to the following considerations, which may not have come under your notice:\n\n1. There was a boarding school at or near the same location several years ago, which was closed owing largely to a lack of sympathetic support from the Indians. Later a day school was started in the same buildings.\n\n2. There are only about ten Roman Catholic families on this Reserve and in order to get any considerable number of pupils from the neighbouring reserves, an effort may be made to recruit from Protestant families. This would naturally lead to friction and difficulties for Departmental officials.\n\n3. If, as is stated, it is the intention to draw a large number of the pupils from other reserves a hundred or more miles away, would it not be better to build the school nearer those reserves from which most of the recruits would naturally come?\n\n4. The Cote Day School has been serving the educational needs of the great majority of the Cote Indians for the past ten years, but, as you may readily suppose, there are some who would like to be set free from the responsibility of caring for their children, and these have been talking of petitioning the Government to replace the present Cote Day School with a boarding school. I do not think such action is necessary at the present time, but the grounds for the request are as good as in the case of the proposed school on the Keeseekoose Reserve. But if that school is erected, then the situation is changed and it may become very desirable from our point of view.\n\nYou will see therefore the complications that this proposed building would lead to and quite unnecessarily. The needs of the Keeseekoose people could very well be served at a fraction of the expense by the erection of a day school in a central position. Such a school could be so located that only one family would have more than two miles to come to school.\n\nIn conclusion, let me say that I write you in confidence that this matter will receive your careful consideration and that you will try to do what is best for all concerned.\n\nI am,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nW. McWhinney.\nI think in the near future a day school should be located on Devil's Creek in Tp. 15, R. 5, east in the Northeast portion of the reserve. There are a number of families settled there who are not liable to sell out. If North St. Peters is closed, it might be re-opened with advantage at this place.\n\n(Plans attached)\n\nPlan in drawer.\nOttawa, June 25, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. McWhinney:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, concerning the proposal to erect a residential school for Roman Catholic Indian children at St. Philips, Sask. It is true that the advisability of providing a small institution at this point has engaged the Department's attention. There is no likelihood of any building activity in this connection this year. When our plans for the future are being determined, your remarks will not be overlooked.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. W.

There are now upon it buildings costing considerably more than $5000 which are used for a boarding and Industrial School for Indian Children.\n\nAs evidence of date of occupation I submit to you the following extracts from our official minutes, the original minutes being also offered for your examination. Under date May 25th 1881 the record says: \"Mr Flett was also authorized to select and occupy a site for a Foreign Mission station at the Crow stand.\"\n\nAt a later date in the course of the same meeting it is recorded that \"Mr Cuthbert McKay, the missionary appointed by the Foreign Mission Committee of the General Assembly to labor at the Crowstand, being present, the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbytery was instructed to furnish him with a commission and to instruct him to labor in the field assigned him under the direction\n\nThe Commissioner of Dominion Lands,\nWinnipeg.\ndirection of Mr. George Flett.\"\n\nIn the annual report of the Foreign Mission Committee laid before the General Assembly in June of the following year these words occur \"At Croft and near Fort Pelly a school has been opened for Indian children which promises to do much good. The teacher, Mr. Cuthbert McKay has been very successful.\"\n\nI have also to inform you that the Indian Department has promised a sum of money in aid of school buildings for this mission and naturally before handing over the money, the Department asks that it have control of the site. I have to ask therefore that the following plot be reserved out of the Church property and transferred to the Indian Department. Commencing at a point 86 rods East of where the Northern boundary of Cote's Indian Reserve cuts the Western line of the above mentioned section thence 20 rods South thence four rods East, thence 20 rods North thence four rods West to the point of beginning.\n\nWhen the patent is made out, it should be drawn in favor of the Board of Management of the Church and Manse Building Fund of the Presbyterian Church in Canada for Manitoba and the North West as trustees for the General Assembly's Foreign Mission Committee.\"\n\nI am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd) Andrew B. Baird.\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOffice of the Commissioner of Dominion Lands,\nWinnipeg, 1st February, 1893.\n\nSir,\n\nOn the 16th ultimo I sent you a copy of a letter addressed to the Land Commissioner of the Manitoba and North Western Railway Company in reference to the fractional S \u00a7 of Sec 19 -- 29 -- 31 W. P. M. together with the original application of the Reverend Andrew Browning Baird on behalf of the Church and Manse Board of the Presbyterian Church in Canada affecting this land. I have now to hand you copy of a letter from the Rev. Mr. Baird in which he explains at length the object that the Presbytery has in view in this application.\n\nI may add that the official records of the Presbytery were produced by the Reverend gentleman and that the extracts which his letter contains are correct extracts from the minutes of the Presbytery.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Baird is particularly anxious that if it is decided to patent this land to the Church the portion upon which the Indian Department proposes to establish the Industrial School shall be excepted from the patent.\n\nHe also desired me to draw your attention to the fact that in the declaration which is now in your possession he mentions 1880 as being the year in which this land\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nland was first occupied by the Church Mission. Upon looking further into the matter, he has ascertained that the Mission first went into occupation of the premises in 1881.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) T. R. Burpe,\n\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour by direction to enclose herewith for your information a letter from the Secretary of the Dominion Lands Board, dated the 14th ultimo, enclosing a communication of which a copy is also herewith enclosed, from the Reverend Andrew Baird, asking on behalf of the Foreign Mission committee of the Presbyterian Church for a grant of the South half of Section 19, Township 29, Range 31, West of the 1st Meridian, in connection with the Mission and Industrial School for Indian Children at that point.\n\nAs this is a matter which concerns your Department, and as Mr. Baird says you have promised to grant financial assistance in the erection of buildings, it is proposed, if you concur therein, to transfer the half section in question to your Department, and leave it with you to deal with the question of the Mission.\n\nIn the meantime the Agent has been instructed to reserve this land for this purpose, if he has not in the meantime otherwise disposed of it.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nL.

I beg to inform you that there appears to be no description of the land used in connection with the Crow-stand Boarding School other than that contained in the letter from your Dept & its enclosure.\n\nThe half acre of land which is situated within the fractional Lots of Sec 19, Tp 29, R. 31, W. 1/2 M. & appears to be the spot where, according to the\nBesides setting the school stand, & I may here state that in Mr. B's description of the land there is an apparent error, as he describes as the northern boundary of Cota's Res., what he describes as the southern boundary of ed.

Dept. & the papers which accompanied it, & the half acre within the said fractional half section described by Mr. B. so that on which the school building stand. I will suggest as preferable that Mr. B. be instructed through the County Surveyor at Winnipeg to have the school lot surveying surveyed, & that when this is done, a plan\nA description of the same be forwarded to Mr. West, within a view to a grant being made in the usual way by O.C. for the site of the school, & then that Mr. West deal with the remainder of its fractional half section in such a way as to will meet the views of the Board therein body & be at the same time in accordance with the rules of Mr. West.\n\n[Signature]\n\nProtestant\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 20th ultimo, No. 52549, addressed to the Deputy Minister of the Interior, respecting the application of the Rev. A. B. Baird, of Winnipeg, for the grant of land lying within the fractional South half of Section 19, Township 29, Range 31 West of the 1st Meridian, for the site of an Indian Industrial school, I have the honour by direction to inform you that the Commissioner of Dominion Lands in a letter received subsequently to the communication above referred to, reports that the Rev. Mr. Baird states that your Department would prefer to acquire 10 acres of the land in question, instead of the small area previously applied for.\n\nIn reply I am to say that before this Department can take any definite action in the matter it will be necessary for your Department to file here a proper description, made by a Dominion Lands Surveyor, of the 10 acres to be granted, and that as soon as such description is received here, the matter will be submitted for the requisite action.\n\nL.

Commissioner\n\nSECY'S BRANCH,\nAPRIL 11, 1898\nWRITTEN.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a copy of a letter of the 6th inst from the Bishop of its interest in regard to the Rev. D.B. Burridge applying for a grant of land in connection with the Crowland Ind. Mission Board's Catholic School.\n\nI have to direct your attention to the second paragraph.\nOFFICE OF THE\nIndian Commissioner,\n\nNORTH-WEST TERRITORIES\n\nRegina, 26th May, 1893.\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter (not numbered) of the 11th ultimo, enclosing copy of communication from the Department of the Interior relative to the Rev. A. B. Baird's application for a grant of land in connection with the Crowfoot Indian Mission Boarding School, and requesting me to have the survey made and description of the land, required by that Department, forwarded to you.\n\nSince even if there were funds available for survey work before the beginning of the next fiscal year (which I have been advised by the Department there are not) it would be impossible before that date to obtain the description and have other formalities completed, in order to admit of the Church obtaining a title to the lands, and transferring the same to the Department, it becomes necessary to draw attention to the danger of the absence of the grant in aid of the building, amounting to $1700.00 lapsing. In this connection I beg to refer to Department's letter of the 19th November last in which\n\nTo the Deputy of,\nThe Supt. General,\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIn reply to a request that a cheque might be issued in favour of Rev. A. B. Baird in payment of the balance of grant in aid of the building, it stated that as the title to the land upon which the school is built had not been transferred to the Department by the Presbyterian Church, no further advance could be made, and added that it would like to see the accounts for any further expenditure which had been made upon the buildings.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Baird was written to in the matter in January last made application to the Department of the Interior for a documentary title, and that 10 acres be reserved and handed over to the Indian Department.\n\nThe only title the Church had to the land upon which the stone building has been erected was one of undisputed occupancy since the Mission was established and buildings erected in 1881 and 1882.\n\nThe outcome of the Church's application for a title which could be transferred is the requirement of the survey and description herein first referred to. Under the circumstances I would beg to strongly recommend that a cheque be issued for $1700.00 the balance of the grant.\n\nThere is not the slightest ground to apprehend any reluctance on the part of the Church to fulfil its promise to transfer the title as soon as obtained, but in any case it would seem that the Department can perfectly well protect itself by arranging with the Department of the Interior to issue the title direct to it instead of to the Presbyterian Church.\n\nWith regard to Department's request in its letter hereinabove\nherein-above quoted to see accounts for any further expenditure which had been made on the buildings, I beg to remind it that accounts attached to Voucher No. 4668 paid by official cheque No. 4834, showed a total expenditure up to that time of $3266.47 on the buildings, and since then beyond furnishing, the only outlay has been, as I am informed by the Rev. Mr. Baird, on some trifling additions, such as a porch, which he says he presumes would not be material to our purpose.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner.\nCertified Copy of a Report of a Committee of the Honourable the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL, on the 13th June, 1893.\n\nOn a Report dated 29th May, 1893 from the Minister of the Interior stating that an application has been made by the Revd. A.R. Bird, of Windsor, on behalf of the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church for a grant of the fractional South 3 of Section 19, Township 20, Range 31 West of the 1st Principal Meridian, adjoining the Indian Reserve of Chief Gabriel Cot\u00e9 for mission purposes.\n\nThe Minister further states that Mr. Baird represents that the land in question was first occupied by the Presbyterian Church for mission purposes in 1881, and has been continuously occupied since that date, and that it is further represented that there are now upon it buildings costing considerably more than \u00a31,000., and Mr. Baird asks that, in the event of the half section in question being granted to the Presbyterian Church, a parcel of 10 acres surrounding and covering the site of the buildings be reserved thereout in order that it may be transferred to the Department of Indian Affairs, that Department.\n\nTo the Honourable\n\nThe Minister of the Interior.\nDepartment having agreed to contribute a sum of money in aid of such buildings and being therefore desirous of securing the control of the land immediately about them.\n\nThe Minister further states that in a letter dated 11th April, 1893, the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs states that the Indian Commissioner will be at once instructed to have a survey made of the parcel in question, as it will be necessary to have a description of the same filed in the Department of the Interior before it can be transferred to the Department of Indian Affairs, but as the Presbyterian Church authorities are anxious to have the question of the grant settled as soon as possible, he, the Minister, sees no objection to the fractional half-section being in the meantime granted to the Church for mission purposes, subject to the reservation of the 10 acres required by the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Minister therefore recommends that the fractional South & of Section 10, Township 20, Range 31 West of the 1st Meridian, adjoining the Reserve of Chief Gabriel Cot\u00e9, be granted to the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church for mission purposes; reserving throughout, however, a parcel of 10 acres surrounding and including the site of the school building on such half section, of which parcel a surveyor's description shall in due time be filed in the Department of the Interior by the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Minister further recommends that on such description\ndescription being filed the 10 acres affected thereby be transferred to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Committee submit the above recommendations for Your Excellency's approval.\n\n(sgd) John J. McCue,\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\nSir,\n\nI enclose for your information a copy of an Order in Council dated the 13th ultimo authorizing the grant to the Presbyterian Church of the Fractional S. \u00a7 of Section 19, Township 29, Range 31 West of the 1st Meridian, reserving thereout a parcel of 10 acres to be transferred to the Department of Indian Affairs upon the receipt of a surveyor's description of the said parcel.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nL.

The grounds on which I make the application are as follows:\n\nWe are very much isolated, being 45 miles from Yorkton, our nearest Railway Station.\n\nIn consequence of this, the expense of running the mission is much increased, and it becomes necessary for us to grow as much as we can at home. We have to keep sheep and cattle for milk, butter and meat. We have a half section of land, but unfortunately there is no hay on it.\n\nHeretofore we have been buying our hay from the Indians, but now owing to increase in herds and the decrease in available hay, they require it all for themselves. My desire is to break up a quantity of our land and when it is ready seed it with brome-grass.\n\nAnd it is for this purpose I am asking your department for enough wire to fence a quarter section of land.\n\nI think from the facts stated, you will see the reasonableness of my request, and I trust your Department will feel disposed to grant it.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYours obediently,\nNeil Gilmour.\nPrincipal.\nOffice of the Indian Commissioner\nfor Manitoba and the North West Territories.\n\nWinnipeg, 29 May 1899.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit to the favourable consideration of the Department the enclosed application of Rev.

Neil Gilmour for 1600 lbs. barbed wire to fence the Crowstand school grounds; and in reply I beg to say that the Department cannot entertain this application.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nH.D.

David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary:\n\nMr Agent McKenzie, under date the 22nd ultimo, forwards an application from the Principal of the Crowstand boarding school for a grant for fencing the unenclosed land connected with the school, the cost of which he places at $150.00 for wire and posts. He also asks for assistance to enable him to improve the water supply of the school, both for fire protection and domestic purposes, for which he has given no estimate.\n\nTwo years ago the Presbyterian Church expended the sum of $6000.00 in the erection of a new building and Mr Gilmour, the Principal, claims that they have no money now available for the improvements asked for.\n\nThis school was started in '89 and the Government made a grant of $1000.00 to assist in erecting the old building.\n\nAn application was made two years ago for wire for fencing, which was not allowed. See memo, turned out.\n\nMr McKenzie, in his covering letter, states that he considers that they should have a good artesian well and that it is very necessary to have the land enclosed. Mr Gilmour claims, in support of his request that they never asked the Department for\nassistance in paying off deficits and that they do not wish to do so.\n\nI may say that there is no money specially appropriated for this purpose, and if the Department feels disposed to accede to the Principal's request a special appropriation would have to be made or the General School Vote be drawn upon.\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 4th May, 1901.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that Mr Agent McKenzie has forwarded an application from the Principal of the Crowstand boarding school for a grant for fencing the unenclosed land and assistance to enable him to improve the water supply of the school.\n\nA copy of the Principal's letter is enclosed herewith for your report.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\n\nSecretary\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg,\nMan.\nCrowland, April 24th, 1901\n\nMr. J.M. Douglas, Esq.,\nHornby Road, Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Douglas,\n\nA year ago, you assisted us very much in getting an increase in the number of grant-earners, at the Crowland School, and I am grateful. Now is another matter that I would like very much to have you bring to the notice of the Department.\n\nWhen our new building was completed, at a cost to the church of upwards of $6000, with no assistance at all from the Department, I tried very hard to get them to give a grant to furnish iron beds for the school. But I was informed, that the Department did not pay to Boarding Schools, anything beyond the per capita grant, and therefore my request could not be granted.\n\nOn two or three occasions I made several appeals for assistance in purchasing something very much needed for the better equipment of the school, but have always been refused upon the same grounds. Now Mr. Douglas, I must positively, from figures given from the books,\nof the Auditor General, that this had not been the policy of the Department in the past, as it looked like a large special grant to both Church of England and Roman Catholic Boarding Schools.\n\nBut Mr. MacLaren, a copy of some notice found in Park 2, and in the paper mentioned by Departmental Secretary, for last year, to show that it is not yet the policy which the Department is putting into practice.\n\nNow Mr. Douglas, it is a fact, that calling the Presbyterian Church, has not received fair treatment and if we do not get at least a proportion of the assistance that is being regularly given to other denominations engaged in similar work there is going to be a strong protest made.\n\nWe claim that we are among the country, equally as well as either of the other denominations, and we prepared at any time to compare the thoroughness of the work being done, with that of either the R.C. or C.E. We ask no favor, only fair treatment.\n\nNow I am not going to ask for $2000 as a Roman Catholic principal, would ask for and never. But there are two things of which\nwe are very much in need, and for which there are no funds available. Owing to our isolation, we are compelled to keep cattle to provide fresh milk and butter for the school. We have some 300 acres of land connected with the school, but it is not enclosed, and we are constantly having trouble because our cattle getting down into the hay meadows of the Indians, and wandering off sometimes to great distances so that we lose the milk and it is bad for the cattle. A grant of $150 would enable us to purchase the wire and posts necessary to fence in our land, and it would be a great blessing for us.\n\nThe other matter is this. Our mission is situated on the top of the cattle land overlooking the Assiniboine River. We tried twice for water, but for 40 or 60 feet down the moisture in the soil is so charged with alkali as to be quite unfit for use. The consequence is we have no water at the mission at all either for use in the school or for fire protection. But how to draw all our\nwater in barrels, up the hills from the river. You can hardly realize what this means. When it rains and the face of these clay hills is wet, it is almost impossible for a team to get up, with a load, and get water in much less, and a great deal of it for all purposes.\n\nAnd thus for this reason too, we have an adequate fire protection. It is true we have some hand grenades and a couple of Babcock extinguishers, but if fire were discovered just in the principal shop, they would do nothing. A pound of gunpowder, if they could always be kept upon & work when you want them & - which is not the case -\n\nBut if a fire had gained any headway, which in a frame building such as ours, it would in a very few moments, these little things would have no effect, and we would be wholly at the mercy of the fire.\n\nThere is nothing that we could have here, that could give us protection, except having a constant and sufficient supply of water always available. There is just one feasible way that I know of by which we may have this\nsupply of water at Buck Lake Boarding School. The conditions were somewhat similar to surface water, too alkaline for use.\n\nThe Indian Department gave a grant for the purpose, and the Government will again be kind, and a six-inch well put down something like 200 feet, when an excellent vein of water was struck, which rose almost to the surface. A tight fitting pipe, which could pull down in the well, as it was sunk, so keeping out all the bad surface water. Then a force pump was put in, and loose connection made, so that by raising the pump, at any time, they could be raised throwing a stream of water on any part of the building. If we had such a well the cost would be double purpose of giving us a supply of water for the use of the mission and also giving us the fire protection, which is so much need. I do not know what the cost of this well and pump would be, but the department will know, because of having made a similar expenditure at Buck Lake.\nIf any schools have a special claim for consideration, on account of circumstances, then I think ours should be of the number. The fact that we are 45 miles from the nearest town, our railway, and that much of the surrounding country is of a swampy boggy nature, with bad roads, adds very much to the cost of running the school. We have to hire all our own porters down, as our team has to be kept constantly at the school to draw water up from the river. This alone means a loss to us of over $250 a year. Our borrowing becomes difficult each year, to finance, with the funds available. We are anxious if possible, to avoid the necessity of asking the Government to come to our assistance in wiping out an annual deficit\u2014although it would seem that some of the other schools that have received quite liberal special grants from the Government, have still quite large deficits, and I think the Auditor General's report will prove that the Government has paid their deficits in the past. Surely this\nCrowstand\nPresbyterian Indian Mission\n\n213474\n\nCrowstand, Mass.\n\nwho by wise and careful management, are seeking to avoid future unsavoury defects ought to receive all possible encouragement.\n\nIt is nearly always the case that when any of the churches erect new buildings they prefer a grant from the Government to assist in building. But our church spent over $6000 last year in new buildings and received no assistance from the Government. But the church is unable to expend any more money here, although they realize how much these things are needed.\n\nSurely then it is not asking too much to request them to give a grant. For the two objects I have named, and I trust they will see it in that light. I am afraid Dr. Douglas, I have trespassed on your time by writing at so much length, but it was necessary in order to put you in possession of all the facts, so that if you are willing you may be able to present our case in a forcible way. I will be very glad indeed Dr. Douglas, if you will take this\nCrowstand\n\nPresbyterian Indian Mission.\n\n213474\n\nCrowstand, Alta. 191\n\nmatter up for us, and try to procure the grant we ask for. I feel sure they will see the reasonableness of the request, and as a matter of simple justice as between discriminations, it will be easy to show the strength of our claims.\n\nHoping you in anticipation, and awaiting the favor of a reply,\n\nI am. Yours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNeil Gilmore\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 6th May, 1901.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nWith reference to the communication addressed to Rev. Dr. Douglas, M.P., by the Principal of the Presbyterian Boarding school at Crow's Nest, I beg to say that a similar application was received & has on the 2nd instant through Mr Agent McKenzie, a copy of which application was submitted to the Commissioner for his report. There is no special appropriation for the improvements asked for by the Principal (that is for fencing and provision for a water supply) and if the Department feels disposed to accede to his request, a special appropriation would have to be made or the General School Vote drawn upon. It would be very difficult to determine the cost of sinking an artesian well, as it would be a matter of uncertainty at what depth water would be found in suitable quality and quantity. The cost of fencing is already given as $150.00.\n\nWith regard to the Principal's remarks as to grants made to other boarding schools I beg to say that in each case mentioned by him, the amounts were specially voted.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, 7th May, 1901.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to the letter sent you by the Reverend Neil Gilmour, Principal of the School at Crowstand, I beg to say that the matters referred to therein have already been brought to the attention of the Department in the form of an application through Mr. Agent McKenzie, and a copy of that application has been forwarded to the Commissioner at Winnipeg for his report.\n\nI may add that there does not appear to be any fund out of which the money could be taken for the improvements asked for by the Principal, namely, the fencing and water supply, but it is quite impossible to deal with the matter until a report is received from the Commissioner on the subject.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. M. Douglas, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nAttach to 1167415\nWhen returned from\nR.M. & send to\nMr. Benson\nSir,\n\nI have received your letter of the 4th instant covering an application from the Principal of Crowstand Boarding School to Mr. Agent McKenzie, for a grant for fencing unenclosed land and assistance to enable him to improve the water supply of the school.\n\nIt is somewhat singular that the Principal of this School did not, through the Agent at Pelly, forward to me a representation of these requirements of the school, with a statement of probable cost, along with the other estimates of the Agency sent in last autumn, in order that provision, if deemed advisable, could have been made, in the votes for the next financial year. This is the first I have heard of these wants of the school; but may say that they are doubtless important for the school. It is true that the Presbyterian Church without any aid from the Government expended about $6000.00 last year to reconstruct and enlarge the Crowstand buildings, and I think the Department might now consistently help the school to enclose its land with a fence.\n\nWith respect to the insufficient water supply for the school, I cannot avoid saying that the management of most of our\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nour Boarding and Industrial Schools have been at fault in this particular. They locate school buildings with very little consideration of how they are to obtain a sufficient water supply. Tests should have been made at Pelly whether an artesian well would be a success or not before the school building was erected. While I agree that the school ought to be assisted to improve its water supply, both in a sanitary and fire protection point of view, I do not think any money should be expended for this purpose until an engineer or other qualified person examines and reports on the best method of obtaining such supply - whether from a well or from the Assiniboine River.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nMr. McLean,\n\nThis letter was handed to me by Rev. Dr. Moore, of this City. Please let me have a report upon the subject therein mentioned.\n\n17th May, 1901.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Sup't General.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nLetter returned to D.

Dr Douglas M.P. A copy of the first application which also asked for a grant for fencing purposes, was sent the Commissioner on the 4th inst. for his report which has been received and is placed on File No. 116741----5 forwarded herewith.\n\nThe Commissioner states that this is the first intimation he has had of these wants of the school, which are, doubtless, important. He remarks that it is true that the Presbyterian Church expended about $6000.00 from its funds in the reconstruction and enlargement of the Crowstand building, and he thinks that the Department might now consistently help the school to enclose its land with a fence.\n\nWith respect to the insufficient water supply for the school he calls attention to the fact that the management of most of the boarding and industrial schools have been at fault in this particular, locating buildings without sufficient consideration of how they are to obtain a sufficient water supply. He does not consider that it would be wise to expend any money for this purpose until an engineer\nor other qualified person examines and reports upon\nthe best method of obtaining such supply, whether\nfrom an artesian well or from the Assiniboine River.\n\nThere is no money voted for either of these\npurposes and the Commissioner thinks it strange that\nthe Principal of the school did not, through the\nAgent at Pelly, forward him a representation of these\nrequirements with a statement of the probable cost\nso that if deemed advisable, provision could have\nbeen made in next year's estimates.\n\nI reported upon the application submitted\nby Dr Douglas (which was not made official) on the 6th\ninstant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Brown\nRef. 116743, I.A.\n\nSCHOOLS. Ottawa, 23rd May, 1901.\n\nDear Dr. Moore,\n\nI have to return herewith the letter which you sent with me some days ago from Mr. Neil Gilmore of Crowstand, Assiniboia, with regard to the necessity of making some provision to improve the water supply of the Crowstand Boarding School. I have looked into this matter and find that a report on the subject was recently received from the Indian Commissioner at Winnipeg, from which it would appear that no representations in this connection have been made to him in the past. While the Commissioner quite appreciates the importance of providing a good water supply, he calls attention to the fact that the management of most of the Boarding and Industrial Schools have been at fault in this particular, locating buildings without sufficient consideration of how they are to obtain an adequate water supply, and he does not consider that it would be wise to expend any money for this purpose until an Engineer or other qualified person has\n\nRev. W. Moore, D.D.,\nOttawa.\nhas examined and reported upon the best method of obtaining such supply, whether from the artesian well or from the Assiniboine River. I am inclined to agree with the Commissioner in this respect, and I think his suggestion should be acted upon before any further action is taken in the premises. I may add, that there is no money available out of which the proposed expenditure could be incurred, and it seems unfortunate that the School authorities did not make necessary representation to the Commissioner as to these requirements, with a statement of the probable cost, as the Department could then have looked into the matter with a view to making necessary provision, should such a course have been decided upon.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSgd Jas.

Dr Moore. There is nothing on file to show that Mr Douglas was communicated with, although at the time the letter was sent in, it was not made official. He may have been written to semi-officially by the Deputy Minister; however, if not I think it would be well to advise him in the terms of the letter addressed to Dr Moore. Please instruct me in this matter.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\n25/5/1901\nMr. McLean,\n\nMr. Douglas should be advised in the terms of my letter to Dr. Moore.\n\nD.M.I.\n\n29th Nov., 1901.\nOTTAWA, 30th May, 1901.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reference to the application from the Principal of the Grosvenor boarding school forwarded to the department by you for a grant towards the improvement of the water system I am directed to say that a report on this subject has recently been received from the Indian Commissioner at Winnipeg from which it would appear that no representations of this nature have been made to him in the past. While he quite appreciates the importance of providing a good water supply he calls attention to the fact that the management of most of the boarding and industrial schools has been at fault in this particular, locating buildings without sufficient consideration of how they are to obtain an adequate water supply, and he does not consider that it would be wise to expend any money for this purpose until an engineer or other qualified person has examined and reported upon the best method of obtaining such supply, whether from an artesian well or from the Assiniboine River. The Department is inclined to agree with the Commissioner\n\nRev. Dr. Douglas M.P.,\nDongola,\nN.W.T.\nin this respect and thinks his suggestion should be acted upon before any further action is taken in the premises. I may add that there is no money available out of which the proposed expenditure could be incurred and it seems unfortunate that the school authorities did not make necessary representations to the Commissioner as to these requirements with a statement as to the probable cost, as the Department could have then looked into the matter with a view to making necessary provision, should such a course have been decided upon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\n\nSecretary\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 15th ultimo relative to the application of the Principal of the Crowsland boarding school for a grant to assist him in improving the water supply of that institution, I beg to enclose for your information a copy of a letter addressed to Rev. Dr Douglas, M.P., on the 30th ultimo in this matter.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nCOPY.\n\nYorkton, May 5th, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nAs requested by you I now report on the portion of the S.E.1/4 of Sec. 24, Tp. 29, Rge. 32 W. 1st N., which lies east of the Assiniboine River, and say that said land is low flats partly covered with willow scrub and at some seasons of the year is nearly all covered with the overflow of the river. It is of no value for agricultural purposes. It is best adapted for grazing and not very good even for that. I value said land at $1.00 per acre.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n(Sd) N.G. McCallum,\nHd.

Flanygin,\nP. Verigin.\nCrowstand, Assa., May 2nd, 1903.\n\nMr. J.G. Turriff,\nCom. of Dominion Lands,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn connection with our Indian Boarding School we have the south half of Sec. 19--29--31 which touches on the Assiniboine River on the south as shown by the accompanying plan. Between this property and the river there lies a parcel of some seventy-five or eighty acres belonging to the Loukhobor reservation, but which is completely isolated from the rest of that land. This tract is that part of the south half of 24--29--31 which lies north of the river and is fit only for grazing purposes. For this use it would be of considerable value to us but of no use to any adjoining property owner.\n\nIn view of these facts on behalf of the industrial work of our school I would respectfully request that this land be transferred to our school property as a free grant.\n\nHoping that your Department may see fit to accede to this, I am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Sgd.) W. McWhinney,\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith an application from Mr. W. McWhinney, Principal of the Crowstand Presbyterian Indian Mission, for permission to acquire as a free grant, or by purchase, the fractional S.1/2 24--29--32, (containing between 70 and 80 acres, which lies North of the Assiniboine River.) This land lies within the tract reserved for the Doukhobors, but in-as-much as it would be of no value to the Doukhobors, or to anyone else other than to the applicants, being cut off by the Assiniboine River, I can see no objection to the sale being made. I met Mr. Verigin and other members of the Committee who have been explaining the matter to them, they gave me a letter to the effect that they had no objection to the land being withdrawn from the reserve. This letter I attach also a report of Homestead Inspector McCallum, who examined the land, to the effect that it is of little value, worth not more than $1 an acre.\n\nI might mention that on my way down from rely in company with Mr. McCallum, who was driving me, I stopped for the night at the Mission, when the application was handed me.\n\nIf it lies within the power of the Department to make a free grant of this land to the School, I think it should be\n\nJ.G. Turriff, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Dominion Lands,\nOttawa.\nbe made, as they are doing a thoroughly good work in educating the Indian boys and girls, there being no less than 44 between the ages of 6 and 16 years receiving instruction. As the older boys are taught farming, possibly the grant could be made under Sub-section \"E\" of Section 90 of the Regulations.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n(Sd) E.F. Stephenson,\nInspector of Agencies.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed I am directed to enclose you herewith a copy of a letter dated the 9th instant from the Agent of Dominion Lands at Winnipeg, together with a copy of the application therein referred to from Mr. W. McWhinney, and copies of 2 other documents also enclosed. Will you kindly advise this Department of your view in regard to this application.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ.D.

Mr Stevenson, Inspector of Dominion Land Agencies, states that he met the Doukhobor Committee and that they have no objection to the land being withdrawn from their reserve.\n\nThe Crowstand Boarding school has the S.\u00bd Sec.19,Twp.29,Rge.31 granted them for school purposes and as the land applied for would be useful for additional pasturage and would be of little use to anyone else, I think this Department might recommend the Principal's application being granted. If however, it has to be paid for, I do not see that sufficient information is furnished as to the necessity for more pasturage which would justify the Department in\nbuying this land.\n\nI think that matters of this kind should be brought to the notice of the Department by the Presbyterian Church authorities with whom all financial transactions should take place.\n\nIf, however, the Department of the Interior will make the grant for nothing I see no reason why it should not be recommended.\n\nMay 30th\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\nMay 30/05\nOTTAWA, 30th May, 1903\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter with enclosures relative to an application from the Principal of the Crowstand Boarding school for a free grant from your Department of a portion of Section 24, Twp. 29, Rge. 31 containing about 80 acres more or less and belonging to the Doukhobor Reservation; and in reply I beg to inform you that you will advised of the views of this Department in regard to this application in a few days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of the Interior\nOTTAWA.\nOTTAWA, 1st June, 1903:\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 30th ultimo I beg to say that the Department has decided to recommend the application of the Principal of the Crowstand Boarding school for a free grant from your Department of a portion of Sec. 24, Twp. 29, Rge. 31, containing 80 acres, more or less and forming a part of the Doukhobor Reservation, which your Inspector says the Committee transacting the land business for the Doukhobors have no objection to being withdrawn from their reserve.\n\nThis Department is led to recommend this application in view of the fact that the additional grazing land embraced in this tract will be of great use to the school, and I shall be pleased if the Principal's request can be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOTTAWA.\nMr. Meltonson -\n\nI have looked up the\nletter-book and can find\nno record of these letters.\n\nW.M.

Indian Commissioner,\n\nGlass, the missionary at Whitefish Lake, who submitted the new teacher to prepare this return, is, however, of opinion that the manner in which it is made out is the correct way, and that the average attendance to be used for the days present should be computed, for the authorized holidays, taken correctly to days at the same rate as the average arrived at for the number of days of attendance, the pupils were actually present, as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{23 \\times 4}{5} + \\frac{2795}{65} = 582.\n\\]\n\nbut I am confident all of the rules must be followed in filing in the returns, and while the rules require this is a disregard of rule 10, the result arrived at cannot be the opposite be accepted as correct.\n\nRule 5\n\nWill you be good enough to state whether Mr. Glass's or the former interpretation of the rules, is in harmony with that of the Department, in order that the returns may, in the future, be prepared in an uniform and a correct manner?\n\nGoodfish Lake School.\n\nSimilar remarks apply to the returns of this school, and the figures added in pencil are those that this office considers the correct ones.\n\nBlue Quill School.\n\nThe teacher of this school is at variance with this Office as to the reading of rule 5. The figures added in pencil were made in this office.\n\nIndian Affairs,\n\nRegina.\n\nJohn Ross, Main Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a memo from Mr Agent Ross forwarded by you on the 27th ultimo with reference to the mode of computing the average attendance at day schools; and in reply I beg to say respectfully that owing to the want of uniformity which exists in vacations taken by teachers of such schools the Department felt it better to fix the number of school days in each of three quarters at 65 days and one quarter of 66 days and after deducting 104 days for Saturdays and Sundays, holidays up to the number of 45 days are allowed during the year making the aggregate number 149, leaving 216 days during which the school must be open each year. The Department therefore while admitting that Mr Agent Ross' interpretation of Sections 5 and 10 is justified by their wording, nevertheless agrees with you that to arrive at the correct average attendance of all pupils should be obtained and then divided by the number of days the school was open and it would like this rule to be followed out hereafter.\n\nWere, however, payment made on the average attendance as now being calculated, instead of\n\nThe Assistant Indian Commissioner for Regina, N.W.T.\nfor the number of days taught, the teacher would be entitled to pay for an average of 9.65 and not for 6.7 or 4.3 as by Rule 5 all authorized holidays will be paid for and may be counted as days present. In the case of the Whitefish Lake School, the one in point the school was open 42 days with 23 authorized holidays making 65 school days in Quarter. There were 15 pupils on the roll for that Quarter whose aggregate attendance amounted to 282\u00bd days, authorized holidays 23, counted as days present by Rule 5 would make the aggregate number of holidays 23 X 15 equal 345.\n\n\\[ \\frac{345 + 232\\frac{1}{2}}{65} = 9.65. \\]\n\nThe teacher was in error in making the aggregate attendance 270\u00bd instead of 282\u00bd. As the holidays were allowed by this rule to be counted as days present, Mr Ross added the aggregate number of holidays to the aggregate attendance instead of deducting their number from the number of school days, which would give the correct average attendance, thus \\( \\frac{65 - 23}{42} \\) divided into \\( 282\\frac{1}{2} = 6.7 \\).\n\nThe average as computed by the teacher 4.3 would be the average were no holidays allowed.\n\nAs the wording of Rules 5 and 10 is ambiguous and misleading it will be changed when the next supply of forms is printed so that no doubt may exist as to what is meant by the average attendance for the Quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\nExtract from an article\u2014\"On snow-shoes to the barren grounds\", by Caspar W. Whitney, in the Harper's Monthly Magazine for December 1865. (Page 21)\n\nWe were making for the White-Fish Lake Indian reservation, where we had been told we could find food and a covering for the horses, and a schoolmaster who would give us a place to throw down our blankets, and the best of his lander. We were not concerned for ourselves, for we carried enough to provide a substantial meal, and, I think, all three of us would have preferred sleeping in the open to the average cabin. Then this drowsy child of nature led the way to a schoolmaster, but not to the schoolmaster we had been seeking, whose house was a few miles farther on, we subsequently learned.\n\nThe schoolmaster we found was a study in filth. He lived like a dog in a wretched hovel, and talked like a cockney Englishman; indeed, he confided to me, the following morning, that he had come from London, and was living there chiefly to learn the Cree language, that he might later preach \"Jesus to the wayward heathen.\" Meanwhile he was educating him. This cockney's own idea of education seemed summed up in the single word coercion. If the Indians surrendered for the dance of their tribe, he scattered them; if they played the games of their childhood, he stopped them; if they asked for reasons, he told them it was the devil in them that they exploited and which he wished to curb out. A logical way forsook, of educating the ignorant? And this is why we find the broken-spirited Indian, who realizes he is the creature of an all-powerful master whose ways he cannot understand, so often \"converted,\" but only in individual cases educated and civilized. He is \"converted\" because it requires only outward appearance, and he finds his material life made pleasanter thereby. He is willing to change his \"Great Spirit\" for the white man's \"Great Spirit\" when a few beads or an extra ration make the trade inviting. But he cannot be educated without being first civilized, and he cannot be civilized because in most cases the white man does not know how, or does not find it to his interest, to make the attempt in a rational way.\n\nAt present he distrusts, and sees only what he is being \"civilized\" off the face of the earth, and remembers the white man in his successive roles of welcomed guest, greedy hunter, settler, and exterminator. I am not dealing in heroics, and everyone knows that the savage must disappear before the civilized man; but if we are to attempt the civilization of those that remain let us first endeavor to gain their confidence, and then follow it up by methods which they can grasp. It is not to be done in one season, nor in two; the civilized red man cannot be brought forth full-flowered, as from a patent incubator; he can be evolved only after long periods of gradual and natural development; yet we expect by mere word of mouth\nmouth to make him forsake the sentiments of a lifetime,\nof generations of lifetimes. At the same time he should\nrealize there is a law in the land which punishes and protects\nhim as thoroughly as it does the white man. He should not be\nallowed to escape with no severe penalty for fugitive warpath\nfestival than that of being merely herded back to his reserva-\ntion, when white men equally guilty would be hanged or shot.\nThe surest way of civilizing the Indian is through his child-\nren, and possibly their children in turn will cease to remem-\nber that once their ancestors roamed over the country hunting,\nand learning the lessons of their common mother Nature, ins-\ntead of living fenced in on a reservation, ploughing, and\nstudying the precepts of the white man.\n\nWe left the Indian reformer early the\nnext morning, after a broken night's rest on a dividor floor\nthan, I think, I ever saw in an Indian lodge. We must have\nproved a blessing to that fellow, for we put money in his\npurses, and such a meal in his stomach as I fancy he had not\nfor many a long day.\nOTTAWA 26th November 1895\n\nRev: Sir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that the attention of the Department has been called to an article entitled \"On Snow Shoes to the Barren Grounds\" by Caspar W. Whitney, appearing in Harper's Monthly Magazine for December 1895, commenting most unfavorably upon a school master on Whitefish Lake Reserve.\n\nThe two schools in operation there are conducted under the auspices of your Society, and it is to be regretted that any cause for such statements could be found even in one of our outlying schools as the publicity given by the extensive circulation of this magazine will cause an erroneous impression to get abroad as to the value of our schools. Teachers who show a disregard for cleanliness in the care of their school premises and persons are wholly unfit for their position as it is useless to attempt the civilisation of Indians without teaching them both by precept and example the habit of cleanliness. An extract from the article referred to is enclose herewith, and I should be glad if you would make any comments thereon, which it may seem to you to call for.\n\nYours etc.\n\nRev. A Sutherland, T\n\nToronto\nSir,\n\nThe attention of the Department has been called to an article entitled \"On Snow Shoes to the Barren Grounds\" by Caspar W. Whitney, appearing in Harper's Monthly Magazine for December 1895, commenting most unfavorably upon the school master on Whitefish Lake Reserve. It is to be regretted that any cause for such statements could be found, even in one of our outlying schools as the extensive publicity given by the magazine will cause an erroneous impression to get abroad as to the value of our schools. Agents should be most vigilant in the matter of cleanliness\u2014both in the school premises and person of the teacher, and any teacher shown to be negligent in this respect should be at once reported to the Department, as it cannot retain such a person in its employ.\n\nIt is useless to attempt the civilisation of the Indians without teaching them, both by precept and example the habit of cleanliness. The Department would like you to procure a copy of this Magazine and obtain a report from the Agent on the portion of Mr Whitney's article referred to.\n\nYours etc.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner\n\nRegina, N.W.T.\nSir,\n\nYour letter of Nov. 26th, No. 116957, enclosing extract from the article by Caspar W. Whitney, in \"Harper's Monthly Magazine\" for December, 1895, \"On snow-shoes to the barren grounds\", was duly received. I will have some comments to offer shortly upon the article in question, but desire first to obtain some testimony in regard to matters of fact. I have called the attention of our Missionary at White Fish Lake to the extract in question, and will await his reply before writing further.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYours Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Hon. the Deputy Super't General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of above quoted letter, in which extracts from an article that appeared in the December issue of Harpers Magazine are embodied, written by Mr Casper W. Whitney and having reference to the person and dwelling of one Fredk Zorhurst, sometime teacher of the Indian day school at Goodfish Lake on James Seenum's Reserve No 128.\n\nIn reply I would inform you that, during the residence of this teacher at Goodfish Lake I was but twice in his house and at these visit beyond the utensils and crockery being unwashed I saw nothing to warrant Mr Whitney's lurid description, which you quote. This gentleman is certainly very ungrateful for the shelter and hospitality afforded him on a winter night, but perhaps the teacher's repellent appearance and his more repellent manner did more to arouse Mr Whitney's disgust than the house, described as a kennel.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner.\nRegina.\nMr Hemming, the artist, who accompanied Mr Whitney told me that the teacher was a -- fool but made no other reference to him.\n\nThe Rev E.B. Glass is responsible for the employment of this man, who, he said, was an excellent teacher. Neither Inspector McGibbon nor Rev John McDougall shared in Mr Glass's views, as I heard the former express an unfavourable opinion of him, and the latter dismissed him summarily last May.\n\nIn regard to the houses occupied by the teachers of day schools on this Agency connected with the Methodist Society, I would inform you that they are the property of this religious body, and the one in question being a private residence, the Agent doubtless did not consider that it came under his supervision, although such visits would have had beneficial results.\n\nThe teachers sent to this Agency by the Society above referred to are usually lay preachers and their office is dual, that of teacher and preacher, the result is, in consequence, that they neither are the one or the other. I have noticed in the past (no fault can be found with the present staff) and I write this with no thought of casting any reflections upon those who are guided by their convictions, no matter how unique their views may be, that the more excessive the zeal the male teachers in this Agency have displayed, the less the attention\nattention they have given to the sanitary condition of their surroundings and sometimes of their persons. With them cleanliness is usually found to be in inverse ratio to godliness, though one would naturally suppose the qualities to be inseparable.\n\nI have, etc.\n\nsgd G.H. Harpur.\n\nA.A.\nSir,\n\nReferring again to your letter of Nov. 26th, No. 116957, enclosing an extract from an article in \"Harper's Monthly Magazine\" for December, commenting unfavorably upon the School master at Wabasee Fish Lake, I beg to say that I communicated with the Rev Mr McDougall on the subject, and have received a letter from him in which he states that a vacancy having occurred in the school at Good Fish Lake in the autumn of 1894, the Missionary, the Rev E.B.Glass, temporarily engaged a man by the name of Zuhouset, who was in the neighborhood. In some respects he was a competent teacher, but his habits seem to have been very slovenly, and as soon as Mr McDougall knew the circumstances he was promptly dismissed. I am disposed to believe, therefore, that Mr Whitney had some ground for his remarks respecting the condition of the teachers' house; but so far as his general observations on methods of civilising the Indians are concerned, Mr Whitney's remarks are plainly those of a man who throws up the prejudices of a certain class against all religious work, and even to some extent in the belief that the only good Indian is a dead one.\" It would be well for Mr Mr Whitney to remember that in no case has any substantial attempt been made to civilise the Indians with the pioneer by religious work. I presume this will satisfy...\naries who knew the Indian character would be one in their efforts to put an end to the dances, because these, like the potlatches on the Pacific Coast, are one of the strongest ties binding them to their old heathen mode of life. If by stopping the \"games of their tribe\" Mr Whitney means their gambling, any teacher should be commended for that; but if he refers to healthfully outdoor sports, I very much doubt the statement. Our Teachers and Missionaries, as far as I am aware, have never discouraged these, but on the contrary have often joined in them, and I know some today who in such sports as foot-ball, lacrosse, hockey, &c., are foremost among the leaders and young men of their schools or missions. Mr Whitney's sneer at the \"conversion\" of the Indian may be allowed to pass with the remark that I have yet to meet with the first case of a truly civilized Indian who has not been converted. His reference to beads and rations as an inducement to the Indians to change his \"Great Spirit\" is a simple untruth. I claim to have considerable acquaintance with missions and missionaries among the Indians, at least with those connected with the Protestant Churches, and I do not believe that such a case ever occurred as Mr Whitney speaks of. Some of Mr Whitney's remarks may apply to the American method of treating the Indians, but has no application to those North of the 49th parallel.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Deputy Super't General, of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA 4th February 1896\n\nRev: Sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo in further reference to the article which appeared in Harper's Monthly Magazine for December by Caspar W. Whitney, commenting inter alia upon the school master at Goodfish Lake; and in reply I beg to say that the Department agrees with you in your opinions expressed upon Mr Whitney's article above referred to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nRev: A Sutherland, D.D.\nToronto, Ont:\nOTTAWA IIth July 1896\n\nRev:Sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th ultimo relative to the Whitefish Lake Indian school; and in reply I beg to say that in view of the fact that this school is so remote and peculiarly circumstanced, the Department agreed last December to allow the teacher to hold school on Saturdays to make up for any time unavoidably lost. The Return for June quarter has been received and the total number of days the school was closed during the year is shown to have been ------------------33\n\nNo: of authorized holidays ---------------------45\nNo: of days school was closed in excess of holidays-27\nNo: Saturdays taught to make up lost time--------16\nActual no: days lost during the year-----------------21\n\nFrom the above statement it will be seen that the total number of teaching days the school was short during the year was 21 (not 22 as stated by the teacher) after allowing off the 16 Saturdays.\n\nThe teacher states that the 21 days lost time was caused by illness at different times during the year, and in this view of the fact that the Department will allow the full grant for the year and a Cheque to cover deductions made for the March and June Quarters, amounting to $42:69, is enclosed herewith, on this account.\n\nRev:A Sutherland,D.D.\n\nThe Methodist Mission Rooms\n\nToronto\nThe Department is advised that Miss Fetherstone, the teacher of this school, is a cripple and a chronic invalid, and that the school has often to be closed on account of her ill-health, and although it has made payment for lost time in this instance, it would not feel justified in doing so in future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs:\nEXAMINED\n\nSCHOOL BRANCH\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th inst., No. 116957\u20143, in reply to a letter of mine dated June 17th last, referring to the closing of the school at Whitefish Lake some three weeks longer than the time allowed by the Department. In my letter just referred to the reason for closing the school was stated to be the unavailability of the missionary and his wife, and the unwillingness of the teacher to stay alone in the mission house. From your letter I would infer that the Department has information from some other source that the 21 days of lost time was caused by the illness of the teacher at different times during the year. The statement that \"Miss Featherston, the teacher of this school, is a cripple and chronic invalid\" is entirely new to me; but I have written to the missionary, and also to the Rev Mr McDougall, intimating that if the facts are as stated a change ought to be made. When I receive their replies further communication will be had with the Department if necessary.\n\nI am\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Deputy Super't General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\"White Fish Lake, Alta.\n\"Sept. 4th, 1896.\n\n\"Dear Dr Sutherland,-\n\n\"Yours of 29th July, re lost time in White Fish Lake school, and cause, was received on the 14th ultimo. One paragraph reads, 'Your attention is especially called to the last paragraph of Mr Reed's letter. If the facts are as stated they should have been reported to me long ago, and it is disappointing that they should have reached me at last through the Department at Ottawa instead of directly from yourself.' The last paragraph of Mr Reed's letter is, 'The Department is advised that Miss Fetherston, the teacher of this school is a cripple and a chronic invalid, and that the school has often to be closed on account of her ill health, &c.' In reply I have to say\n\n\"(a) That 'the facts are not as stated.' Though lame when she came to White Fish Lake, the teacher had no difficulty in getting to and from her school up to December 17th, 1895, and used to walk from house to house visiting parents and children, and attending prayer meetings, &c., without the aid of cane or crutch. I have seen her playing with the school children about the school, like a kid, many a time. Before the date mentioned she never had to close school on account of ill health. Mr Reed's and your own letter would seem to imply that Miss Fetherston came a 'chronic invalid'. On this point I have further to state,\n\n\"(b) That Miss Fetherston had to sit during last December for days in a school house with little wood, while the cold wind whistled up through the floor under the foundation of the house, and that sitting there, getting chilled, and remaining so throughout the day, she contracted a cold in the hip which laid her up\nfor a good many days, her illness commencing on 17th Dec., 1885.\n\nAll her illness proceeded from and was connected with that freezing operation. After the ground was frozen an Indian was sent to bank the school house, but he threw so little earth against the building that the banking was useless. Sometime after another was sent to haul manure in order to complete the banking; the last banking was done after 17th Dec. In the meantime the teacher and children suffered, and made complaint that the house was very cold.\n\n\"Now the Department which charges itself with building, repairing and furnishing school houses, should also charge itself with neglect, and the suffering endured by the teacher from that neglect. Miss F. now uses a crutch, but moves around lively enough and loses no time. Relative to her teaching and general efficiency I would refer you to the Inspector's report in the Blue Book last published, and to Missionary Reports.\n\n\"(d) As to lost time, 12 days were lost through this protracted illness, and 9 through absence from the Reserve while Mrs Glass and myself were at Edmonton,\u2014that is the 21 days lost.\n\n\"I remain\n\n\"Yours Sincerely,\n\n(Signed) \"E.B.Glass,\"\nSir,\n\nReferring to previous correspondence with the Department under date of July 29th, respecting the alleged physical incapacity of the teacher at White Fish Lake, I beg to say that a communication on the subject was sent to the Rev E.B.

Dr Sutherland on this subject.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs:\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nIt would be nice if I could have my request granted to stay all my holidays until spring and could then take the nine weeks' vacation and travel to get into training for the final examination.\n\nOf course, if you have any objection to my doing so, I will withdraw my request at once and try to be content with less time at the school.\n\nPaul - hoping that way\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a request from the teacher of the Whitefish Lake Day School that she may be allowed to take all her holidays in the spring in order that she may go to Edmonton to study for her final examination.\n\nI have informed Miss Brown that it is the Department's desire that the long holidays be given during the lay season. However, I submit her request for your consideration because in the case of the Whitefish Lake Day School, the Methodist Mission has established a boarding house in connection with the school and should it prove a success, the parents may leave their children at the boarding house during the lay season. This establishment is quite in its infancy and as usual in the early stage it has been difficult this year to get the children to stay there this year. The school has been kept open this year during the lay season and I would recommend that the holidays for this year may be given in the spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H.

I understood, also, that there were then fewer children of school age within reach of this school than heretofore. One of the Steinhauer's had moved down to the Saddle Lake reserve and in this way the school had lost a pupil or two, so I think.\n\n3. If this school is again re-opened I do not expect the attendance will average more than 3 or 4 pupils.\n\n4.

As you have been informed in connection with other matters the Department is paying particular attention to educational questions with a view to general improvement, and one of the essential conditions of success is the hearty co-operation of all officials, which must be insisted upon.\n\nReports on the three day schools in your Agency will be expected at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Hughes, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nSaddle Lake, Alta., March 2, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR MONTH OF FEBRUARY 1940.\n\nI endeavored to have a joint meeting of the Indians of the Saddle Lake and James Seenum's Bands but the Indians did not appear to be anxious to get together. A meeting was held at Whitefish Lake reserve at which the greatest interest appeared to be the establishment of day schools. A meeting was also held by the Indians of Saddle Lake reserve. Owing to expression of conflicting ideas, division of opinion and the apparent undercurrent of antagonism of one group against the other, however, nothing much was accomplished toward getting together on any definite progressive project. A proposal was made to oust Chief Moses and Councillor James Cardinal and it has been found that when they are in this mood, it is rather difficult to get them together on any definite subject. The matter of purchase of a tractor and ploughing outfit was brought up and discussed but the feeling of the majority was against the proposition. The matter was accordingly dropped, for the time being at least.\n\nW. E. Gullion,\nIndian Agent.\nCalgary, July 17th, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honour to report on a visit I made to the Saddle Lake Agency.\n\nSCHOOLS:\n\nAt Whitefish Lake the question of establishing a day school on the Reserve was mentioned by a few \u2014 four or five members of the United Church. I do not favour the idea: This Reserve is a long and narrow one; to place a school in the centre, somewhere near the Churches \u2014 U.C. and R.C.\u2014 would serve a limited number only. Children living at a distance could not walk to school, it being too far; and the parents are not equipped to drive them to and from school five days a week; to do so would mean spending most of their time on the road, and visiting on the way. I pointed out to them that they had a good residential school at Edmonton, where the children are well cared for \u2014 clothed and fed \u2014 and given a good education. The Roman Catholics are satisfied with the Blue Quills School; this is filled to capacity; however, the new addition to be built will help to relieve the situation.\n\nC.

I referred him to your reply at the meeting held last June at Treaty time. I also informed him that the school question was out of my jurisdiction. He then stated that it was the intention of the J. Seenum's Band to ask for the reopening of the day school thru other sources. He did not make the statement with any malevolence. The feeling seems to be very strong for a day school.\n\nThe above for your information.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(Sgd.) \"W.P.B. PUGH,\"\nIndian Agent.\n\nC. P.

The Indians are enquiring to purchase these buildings and I would like to have the authority to either sell them or give them away. As to the value I am not quite prepared to say but I would obtain the best offer possible from the Indians. Log construction with shingle roof. The Indians would move them.\n\nW.P.B.

Pugh, Indian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alberta.\n\nRe: Disposal of old buildings,\nWhitefish Lake Reserve.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 5th instant, in which you seek departmental authority to dispose of the old school and the teacherage at the Whitefish Lake Reserve.\n\nIt is our understanding that neither of these buildings is in use and that both are in a somewhat dilapidated condition. The writer has learned from experience that such buildings, when neglected, often become a real danger from a sanitary standpoint. In view of this fact, it will be acceptable to the Department if you make arrangements for the dismantling of these buildings, on the understanding that the lumber available will be given to Indians, without charge, for the repair of their homes. If, in your judgment, any particular Indian receives an amount of lumber for which payment should be made, he might be persuaded to make payment by consenting to undertake work, either on the reserve or at the agency,\u2014the ploughing of gardens, hauling of relief supplies, etc.\n\nR. A.

However I hit upon the idea that the two buildings will make a good community hall. I asked the Band if they would co-operate, move the same to a suitable location and donate all necessary labor, they stated they would, so I will endeavor to complete the project.\n\nI might say that this Band has no hall whatsoever and are badly in need of one, the two old buildings will make a fair hall.\n\nThis will fit in with Mr. Morris's Woman's Clubs, if I ever get time to get around to push the organization of them at Saddle Lake & White Fish.\n\nTrusting my action meets with your approval.\n\nW.P.B.

It has been standing there several years unused and there is an opportunity to sell it.\n\nWe wish to talk that house if it belongs to us as I am led to believe. I want Dr. Endicott to have your assurance re the ownership.\n\nIf it belongs to the Dept. I, of course, want to guard the interests of the Dept.\n\nKindly have the Stenographer send me a copy of your reply to Dr. Endicott.\n\nYours faithfully,\nArthur Bower\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nThe school building at Whitefish Lake was erected during the summer of 1893. It is built of logs, with shingled roof, and is 20 by 22 feet, with a small entrance porch attached. This school has been closed since June 30th, 1911, on account of poor attendance. At the time the school was closed the building was reported to be in good repair. It was built and is owned by the Department.\n\nThere is no likelihood of this building being required again for school purposes, as the children from this reserve are Methodists and have been attending the Red Deer Industrial School.\n\nI can find no information as to the cost of erecting the building, nor what its present value would be. This latter information could, no doubt, be supplied by Mr. Agent Hughes.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, January 9, 1920.\nOttawa, January 13, 1920.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from the Rev. Arthur Turner, Calgary, requesting permission to sell the old school building on the Whitefish Lake Reserve, Saddle Lake Agency, Alta.\n\nThere has been no school at this point for several years and no likelihood of its being re-opened, as the Indian children from this reserve have been attending the Red Deer Industrial School. Mr. Turner states that there is an opportunity to sell the building and that he understands that it is the property of the Methodist Church.\n\nFrom the information which the Department has on file it is of the opinion that this building is the property of this Department. Our files show that this building was erected during the summer of 1895 and that certain repairs made since that time were paid for by the Department. Our Agent at Saddle Lake is being written to and asked to furnish a report regarding the ownership of the building. As there is no further use for it for school purposes there would be no objection to its being sold.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant requesting to be informed as to whether the Department owns the school-house on the Mission Lake Indian Reserve, Saddle Lake Agency.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, from the information on file, it would appear that this building is the property of the Department. It was erected during the summer of 1895 and repairs since that time have been paid for by the Department. Mr. Agent Hughes, Saddle Lake, is being asked to furnish a full report regarding the ownership.\n\nAs this school has been closed for some years and the building will not again be needed for school purposes, the Department would have no objection to its being sold.\n\nAs soon as a report is received from the Agent you will be further advised. I may say that the Rev. Dr. Enright is being informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. Arthur Barnes,\n1140 - 16th Avenue N.W.,\nCalgary, Alta.\nOttawa, January 13, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from the Rev. Arthur Bower, Calgary, stating another the Department owns the old school-house on the Redfish Lake Reserve. He states that he is led to believe that it is the property of the Methodist Church and requests that permission be granted him to sell the building, as it has not been used for several years.\n\nThe information which the Department has on file shows that the building was erected during the summer of 1872 and, as records have been made since that time and paid for by the Department, I am of the opinion that this building is the property of the Department.\n\nYou will be good enough to furnish a full report on this matter, stating who owns the building, the condition it is in and the present value. You should also state whether you consider it advisable to sell the building.\n\nKindly reply as soon as possible.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Asst., Deputy and Secretary.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Address]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nDear Sir,\n\nI am much obliged for your letter of January 13th, 1920.\n\nNo. 16957/1\n\nand I will wait for further report after you hear from Mr. Agent Hughes.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nArthur Barnet\n118-7-5\n\nSADDLE LAKE\nBUILDING SUPPLIES ACCTS.\nWHITEFISH LAKE SCHOOL\n\nCLOSED\nFROM 10/20\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6028)\n\nFile 117-1-5, part 1\nPelly - Crowstand Boarding School - Building Maintenance. 1890-1891\n\nFile 117-1-9, part 1\nPelly - Crowstand Boarding School - School Lands. 1891-1904, 1917\n\nFile 118-7-1, part 1\nSaddle Lake - Whitefish Lake School - General Administration. 1885, 1894-1898, 1907-1914, 1946\n\nFile 118-7-5, part 1\nSaddle Lake - Whitefish Lake School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1897-1920\n\nFile 123-11-5, part 1\nNorway House School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1897-1908, 1928\n\nFile 124-4-1, part 1\nFort Frances - Little Forks School - General Administration. 1912-1914\n\nFile 124-4-5, part 1\nFort Frances - Little Forks School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1898-1902\nNo. 123-11-5\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nNorway House\n\nBuilding Supplies, etc.\n\nNorway House Day School\nSir,\n\nIn a letter received from Miss Ella B.

This showed his own expectation in regard to the claim for Dispensing Supplies for the Destitute and was the foundation for my Voucher 206.\n\nLooking up my Voucher 83 I find that he has not been paid since July 1900 as per your letter above quoted and so I have cancelled Voucher 206 and have substituted Voucher 230 covering the whole period of service.\n\nMr. Lowes has not served since the time specified in the Voucher inasmuch as he was removed to Island Lake by the Methodist Missionary Society. He will not be available for any further service.\n\nChief Sinclair has had charge during the current year and I should be obliged if you would permit me to issue a small Voucher of ten dollars in his favor for the winter past. It is understood however that he has been promised nothing and expects nothing. It is purely optional with the Department.\n\nI should think that with the Agent residing there no further need could be found for employing any person to distribute these supplies for the future.\n\nI have the honor to be\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs - Ottawa\nOttawa, 4th May, 1903.\n\nRevd Sir,\n\nI have noted the contents of your letter regarding the services rendered by Mr. Lowen as dispenser at Norway House Reserve. You state that he only claims payment for the issue of supplies from the 16th April 1901 to the 30th April 1902. It is presumable then that he only issued supplies during that period. How do you know that he issued the rations during the period for which he has not claimed payment (viz: from March 1899 to July 1900)? If he did the work it is probably that he would be paid for his services. Under the circumstances the voucher first sent in by you had better be returned to the Department and it will be paid.\n\nWith reference to the question of paying the Chief for his services as dispenser, I beg to say that unless you can furnish good reasons for his receiving remuneration for his services the Department does not consider that he should be paid. In his capacity as Chief he is supposed to assume some responsibility without being paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRevd J. Bemrose,\nIndian Agent,\nWest Selkirk, Man.\n\nDeputy Mgt.

I then investigated the case finally and found as follows:\n\n(1) My Voucher 88, eighty three, paid him for service rendered during Mr. Short's time. I have positive proof that he served as Dispenser for this period. I have been in the country to the north every summer for 31 years back and am very familiar with many circumstances unknown to the casual traveller.\n\n(2) My Voucher 230 Remunerated him for the two years which he served under my own direction lacking two months.

We will be unable to offer him any position without his being notified of his acceptance of the position.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Revd J. Sennons was recently asked whether the services of a dispenser of supplies is required at Norway House. He has answered stating that considers that this work should be done by the resident Agent. When the Indian Agent for Severn River is appointed you should inform him that he will be expected to do this work instead of Mr. Lowen who has acted as dispenser hitherto. Kindly also notify Mr. Lowen, at the proper time, that his services will no longer be required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Pedley\n\nThe Hon. D. Laird,\nResident Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.,\nDeputy Sect. General,\nof Indian Affairs.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 26th ultimo, I beg to state that when the Indian Agent for Berens River Agency is appointed, with headquarters at Norway House, the work of dispensing the supplies to the Indians of that Band can be attended to by the Agent, and the dispenser will then be notified that his services will no longer be required.\n\nI may add that Mr. Lewes has been away from Norway House since last summer and I understand the destitute supplies were left in charge of the Chief by the Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nAsst. Indian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa 8th October, 1903.\n\nRevd Sir,\n\nI beg to direct your attention to your letter of the 8th May last, in respect to Vouchers Nos 83 and 230 mentioned therein, in favour of Mr Joseph H. Lowe, for dispensing supplies at Norway House. Owing to the manner in which these vouchers were submitted an over payment of $15.00 has been made to Mr Lowe. The Department therefore desires that you will be good enough to obtain from him without delay a refund of that amount. Voucher No 83 which amounts to $35.00 covers payment from March 1899 to July 1901\u2014two years and four months; and Voucher No 230 covers payment from July 1900 to 30th April 1903\u2014one year and nine months. You will observe that these dates overlap. The last mentioned voucher should have read from July 1901 to 30th April 1903\u2014nine months. The fact that it did not read thus has resulted in Mr Lowe being paid twice for the period from 2nd July 1900 to July 1901.\n\nI may add that the Department looks to you to have this matter speedily adjusted, as had you sent the vouchers in proper form the error would not have occurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev J. Serrana,\nIndian Agent,\nWent Selkirk, Man.\n\nS.

There is a separate file in the Department for the accounts and other papers relating to each school. This is the reason that you should forward them as you did. It is necessary that the accounts for each school should come in separately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRevd John Simmons,\nIndian Agent,\nWent Selkirk, Man.\nOttawa, 18th November, 1903.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department desires that you will kindly comply without further delay with the instructions contained in letter of the 6th instant ultimo, by forwarding to the Department $15.00 the amount of the over payment made to Mr Lowes, which resulted from the manner in which the vouchers were sent in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev J. Simmons,\nIndian Agent,\nWest Selkirk, Man.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter above noted I desire to say that I have read over the correspondence bearing upon this question and cannot regard myself as being to blame for any error made over the claim of Mr. Jos H. Lowes. If you refer to it I think you will agree with me that my accompanying letters show that I did not wish to ask more than fifteen dollars according to my first Voucher but was directed to send another for a larger amount which was done.\n\nIf I was not to blame I could hardly with reason be asked to hold myself responsible. However I believe Mr. Lowes is reliable and will recoup the Department if error has been made. He is at present many miles beyond reach. He is about three hundred miles from a Post Office and out of reach of the usual line of Travel at Island Lake. When I could reach him I do not know.\n\nMeantime the Department may keep back the amount of $15.00 from my Voucher 53 sent with this Mail amounting to $24.00 and I will try to reimburse myself when I can see him. I don't however like the principle of being capitalist for the Department. Had it not been for the nice way in which the request is worded I should feel disposed to fight it out on general lines.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa 14th December, 1863.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, in further reference to the Department's instructions that you should obtain a refund of $15.00 from Mr. Jno. H. Lowes to make good the over-payment to him as a result of your having sent in an incorrect voucher; and in reply I may say that the Department is at a loss to understand your statement that you can not regard yourself as being to blame for the mistake having occurred.\n\nIn the last paragraph of your letter of the 8th May you stated that you did not consider that voucher No. 208 (which was for $15.00 only) was the case. In the second last paragraph of the same letter you stated \"my voucher No. 208 remunerated him for two years which he served under my own direction lacking two months. I think the showing is correct as it stands under the last mentioned voucher\". This voucher which was made out for $36.25, was paid upon the above recommendation. It was afterwards found (as pointed out to you in letter of the 8th October) that certain dates were the dates in voucher No. 208 over-topped the dates in voucher No. 88, which was previously paid, and that it was necessary to obtain a refund of $15.00.\n\nI think that when you again read over the correspondence you will be of the opinion that the error arose as pointed out by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. J. Somers,\nIndian Agent,\nWest Selkirk, Man.\nSecretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, 190\u2014\n\nIt seems that Mr. Lowe was entitled to be paid from the 1st March 1899 to 30th April 1902.\n\n3 years & 2 months @ 15\u00a2 = $47.50\n\nHe was paid by vouchers Nos. 839 & 220 as follows\u2014\n\nBy voucher No. 839 from 1st March 1899 to 1st July 1901. 2 years & 4 months @ 15\u00a2 = $35.00\n\nBy voucher No. 220 from 1st July 1900 to 30th April 1902. 1 year & 2 months.\n\nEntitled to:\n\n$26.25\n$61.25\n$47.50\n$13.75\nIndian Agent's Office,\nWest Selkirk\n\nApril 28th 1904\n\nRef.: Your Letter\n\nSir,\n\nOn the 19th of November 1903 under No. 118778/5 you wrote in regard to a $15.00 overpay to Joe N.

I wish, however, to point out that Mr. Lowe states in his letter, forwarded by you, that the supplies received at Norway House in July 1898 were not drawn upon until the following March, 1899. In the face of this statement it is not understood why Mr. Lowe claims payment for distributing supplies previous to March 1899.\n\nI return Mr. Lowe's letter herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

The school population at Little Forks is so small that I doubt if an average attendance of five or six could be maintained. But the matter should be inquired into and the Agent's opinion obtained. The Long Sault School, in my opinion, should be re-opened. There is an Anglican Church missionary there, and an improved day school would probably become a success. The Indians of the bands object to their children being sent so far away as Elkhorn, as they scarcely ever see them again. I sympathize with them in regard to these long, if not final separations from their children, and as there is no Church of English residential school nearer than Elkhorn, it would seem as if they are entitled to an improved day school at Long Sault.\n\n* * *\n\nSgd. D.

The shingles are gone and the leak through the roof is making the plaster fall and the walls rot. The storm windows have been removed to the parochial building adjacent for greater safety.\n\nx x x x\n\nThe question of no school was touched upon and was rather a sore spot. It was stated that there were ten children of school age on the reserve. One man stated that if they wished their children to be instructed they must send them over to the American side of the river which they thought was not creditable to our department. There are nineteen children on the reserve.\n\nx x x x\n\n(Sgd.) John Semmens\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n7 children of school age\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Inspector Semmens, in his report on the Little Forks Reserve, calls attention to the fact that there is no provision for the education of the children of this band. They formerly had a school there, but it was closed on account of the small attendance. The census return shows that there are only seven children of school age, while Mr. Semmens states that he was informed by one man that there are ten children on the reserve and by another nineteen, but I think we may take it for granted that the census return is fairly correct. It would not be advisable to re-open the school, as a new building would be required and there would never be enough children to justify the expense.\n\nThese Indians are given as nearly all pagans and I think it would be well if steps were taken to have these children placed in the Fort Frances Boarding School where\nwhere there would be accommodation for them. The Indians apparently wish their children educated and they state that they would have to send them over to the American side of the river to school.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, May 19, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Semmens, in his report on the Little Forks Reserve, calls attention to the fact that there are some children on this reserve of school age for whom no educational facilities are provided and that they are obliged to go over to the American side of the river for their schooling.\n\nThe Department does not feel disposed to re-open the school on their reserve, as a new building would be required and there would not be enough children of school age to justify the expenditure. The boarding school at Fort Frances has accommodation for more pupils and the Department would like you to use your best endeavours to have these children placed there and report the result.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

McColl\n\nSuperintendent\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have seen the Chief of Standingstone lately with regard to the school; he is anxious to have the school completed, but on condition the contract be given to the Indians themselves. The walls of said school are built and measure 22 x 16 - about 14 ft high. Chief offers to take the contract of furnishing and finishing it for $250 - two hundred dollars.\n\nHe will purchase lumber for the ground floor, the rest Indians will manufacture themselves. He will also put stove in and tables and seats for class work.\n\nHe says he does not want a white man to come and do for them work that they can do as well themselves, especially when they are so badly in need of the means of livelihood. He insists upon this and will not allow the school to be completed unless the contract be\nbe given to themselves.\n\nI presume the Department will have no objection to this. From what I can see myself on the Reserve, I believe these Indians are capable of doing fairly good work. Again you will not likely get a carpenter to do the same work at this figure.\n\nI took care not to apprise the Chief of the exact sum that has been voted for this school. I thought $200 or would be sufficient for their work.\n\nI trust this offer will not necessitate any delay. I shall be leaving by first navigation and would like to be here to assist these people.\n\nIt will be necessary to authorize the Chief for a certain amount of credit for provisions.\n\nI hope you will give instructions to that effect.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSgd C.

There were ten children, he said on the reserve the whole year round and he thought that he should have a school. I subsequently discussed this matter with the agent and found that he was opposed to taking action owing to the nearness of the boarding school at Fort Frances.\n\nThe chief, when urged to place his children in the boarding school, said that three children from his band had died there and he is opposed to sending any more. He further stated that he found that too much freedom was allowed to the children, too much opportunity for the association of the boys and girls. He emphasized the fact that this was not so under previous superintendents, but that the present principal was lax in this particular, and that was another reason why he did not wish to send the children there.\n\nSgd.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. P. Wright, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Frances, Ont.\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nAccording to the request of the Deputy Minister, I had this morning an interview with the deputation of five Indians and their Interpreter, representing the Long Sault, Little Forks and Stangecoming bands of Fort Frances Agency.\n\nThe Councillor from Little Forks reserve and one from Long Sault reserve asked that the day schools on these reserves be re-opened. The school population at Little Forks is so small that I doubt if an average attendance of five or six could be maintained. But the matter should be inquired into and the Agent's opinion obtained. The Long Sault School, in my opinion, should be re-opened. There is an Anglican Church missionary there, and an improved day school would probably become a success. The Indians of the bands object to their children being sent so far away as Elkhorn, as they scarcely ever see them again. I sympathize with them in regard to these long, if not final separations from their children, and as there is no Church of English residential school nearer than Elkhorn, it would seem as if they are entitled to an improved day school at Long Sault.\n\nSgd. D. Laird\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, January 27, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nThe deputation of Fort Frances Indians who called at the Department the beginning of this week asked for the re-opening of the school on the Long Sault Reserve.\n\nBefore taking any definite action regarding the matter the Department would like to have a report from you as to whether you think it would be justified in acceding to their request, in view of the unsatisfactory results obtained at the school when it was in operation. Be good enough to state the number of children of school age and the probable average that could be obtained, as well as the general condition of the building in which the school was formerly held and what it would cost to put it into repair if the school were re-opened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. F. Wright, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Frances, Ont.\nReferring to your letter of 27th January last,\n\nNo. 116766/1, relative to re-opening of the school on the Long Sault Reserve, I beg to state that in view of the unsatisfactory results obtained at the school when it was in operation, and the nomadic habits of these people, and the lack of interest they take in education, think I do not the Department would be justified in re-opening this school. There are 12 children of school age on these reserves, but I do not think that an average of more than half that number could be obtained.\n\nThe school building is a good frame building, well equipped, and in good repair.\n\nIn my opinion, very little can be done to advance the seven bands on the Rainy river, until we can get them amalgamated into one band on one reserve, as there are only 247 in the seven bands, and scattered all along the Rainy river.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, February 9, 1912\n\nMemo for Dept. Admin. Education\n\nProbably the best\nthought is called in this view. But\nof these is no immediate prospect\nof an amalgamation of the two bands on\nthe Rainy river. I don't think the\nDepartment is justified in refusing to\naccept the school at Long Point River.\nThe other house is in good repair; and\nconsidering its size is not to be despised.\nWe should not forget our treaty obligations,\nand I may further remark that the\ncommittee from the reserve on the\ndeputation which recently visited the\nDepartment stated that there were some\nyoung persons on the reserve older than\nthe school age who would attend in the\nwinter season if the school were re-opened.\n\nW. Laurier\n\nB.T.\nOttawa, February 13, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant in reference to the re-opening of the Long Snuit School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in deference to the wish of the Indians the Department considers that it would be well to give this school another trial. I would ask you, therefore, to make inquiries with a view to obtaining the services of a competent teacher and report to the Department the result of your inquiries as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. P. Wright, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Frances, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 13th February last,\n\nNo. 116766/1 relative to the re-opening of the Long Sault Day School, I beg to state that I visited this Reserve on the 21st Ultimo, and was informed by the Indians that they want a teacher from their own band, two men were mentioned, viz: - Walter Blackbird, a son of the Chief of No. 1 band, who is 20 years of age, and was educated at the Elkhorn Industrial school, the other was a son of No. 8 of band No. 2, who is called Jas. Horton, he is 26 years of age, and received his education in the Day school on the reserve, some years ago.\n\nI asked them both to send me an application for the position, but have only received one from the former, which I herewith enclose, also his letters to me on the subject.\n\nI would recommend that Walter Blackbird be given a trial as teacher of this school, as in my opinion he is the more capable of the two. He acted as Interpreter for the delegation that visited the Department from here this winter. With regard to salary I think that as he has heard that the teacher at the Manitou Rapids gets $400.00 per year, he will be expecting the same.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Agent.\nSAM. LEPINE\nLUMBERMEN'S AGENT\nCH\u00c9L\u00c9S HOTEL\n62-64, 66 York Street\n\nOttawa Long Sault\nMarch 15th 1912.\n\nMr. Joseph Wright,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Frances,\nOntario.\n\nWill you kindly send a copy of this writing to the Department for me and oblige.\n\n(Signed) Walter Blackbird\nOttawa.\n\nI am a Graduate of Teknion Industrial School, having been graduated from 1901, and was discharged in 1910 from the said school.\n\nAnd would like to take the position as a teacher of the Long Sault Reserve School, which I am sure I could manage.\n\nApplied by,\n\nWalter Blackbird.\nIndian Agent,\nFort Frances,\n\nI am telling you a few facts why the school ought to be given to me by the Department.\n\nI was Baptized by Rev. Johnston in 1903. But Jim was never Baptized. I think that a Christian ought to be taught to learn the pupils more good and look forward to God at the same time than a person who knew nothing about God. Secondly, I have been educated more than Jim and suppose to know more. Jim has been going to school for some time and he would also need English. But taking the Big classes in school it may be different for him. We kind of doubt that he would not go on any too well. Lastly, I think that after the government puts a pupil through the Industrial Schools, they ought to be possible help the Graduates get a good position. But instead of that, the pupils lose their Education and become nothing. Of course, if I don't satisfy the people Jim can take the school in 1913 that's all that I see for myself and apply to the Department.\nHope you will do your best for me and I'll do my very best to take the Indian children that are under you hoping to be answered soon as possible from the Department.\n\nFrom truly yours,\n\nWallace Blackbird\nLong Squall Reservation\nFeb 23rd 1912.\n\nMr. Smith Wright,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Frances.\n\nWill you kindly answer at once and let me know what the teacher is supposed to get (per month) and if the government supplies provisions for the teacher as well as the Indians of the Reserve say. As perhaps you know that I am married now. I told you when you were down here the other day that I wasn't very anxious to take but think well enough that...\nI have better education than Jim he came I know just how far he went in his course at school several years ago. The only thing you will see yourself when he writes you'll find his writing more pretty than mine. But if Jim tries hard for the school you might as well let him teach. I don't care about taking the position if knew it wouldn't provide from the first. I would gladly take the position and delay with it so long as you thought want me.\nSir,\n\nLet me know that this question has been answered.

It is also to be understood that the appointment is only temporary and Blackbird's retention in the position will be dependent upon results in the way of attendance and progress. You will be good enough to submit these terms and if they are satisfactory a supply of school material should be requisitioned for and the school re-opened, if possible, by the first of April.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ.

A peep through the windows showed that everything was in perfect order. The outbuildings are in poor shape.\n\nThe Agent had engaged a young man to take this School and he opened it and continued it for a short time then wrote to the Agent that he preferred work in the logging camps and so left the School closed.\n\nI subsequently obtained an interview with the young man an Indian Lad of about 21 and he promised me that he would again open the School and continue teaching until the Treaty Payments were made when he would resign the work unless in the meantime he should change his mind.\n\nI took this action because there were a few children of School age idling about with nothing to do but loaf and I thought it wise that they should be kept out of harm's way by having the opportunity of attending School and at the same time learn something of advantage.\n\nI have the honor to be\nExtract from Report of Inspector John Semmens on the Fort Frances Agency, May 14th to June 5th, 1913.\n\nOriginal on File 393106.\n\nLONG SAULT RESERVE.\n\nI noted the school outfit at the Long Sault Mission and found as follows:\n\n3 maps; 20 school desks; 1 large stove; 18 stove pipes; 1 chair; 1 teacher's table. The cupboard containing the school books, of which there is said to be a large supply, was nailed up and I did not open it lest there might be subsequent waste. Everything is in readiness for opening this school when the Department feels warranted in doing so, and in my judgement the sooner this is done the better. I therefore recommend that the agent be instructed to do all he can with a view to recommencing school work here.\n\nSgd.

Sir,\n\nReferring to your report on the Fort Frances Agency, in which you recommend the re-opening of the Long Sault School, I have to ask you to be good enough to advise the Department how many children there are of school age and what distances they reside from the school approximately. The attendance at this school when it was in operation before was very small and it may be that the prospects are better now. Before taking action, however, the Department would like to have this information, which no doubt was given to you at the time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

These are all on the west side of the River and are for the most part attending no school at present.\n\nIt will also be proper to mention that the School building has been put into proper condition and only needs the desks and furnishings necessary for comfort and efficient work.\n\nThe fact that the Council are a unit in demanding extra School accommodation might also be mentioned.\n\nAs a Department we should not lose sight of the fact that things are somewhat unsettled just now resulting from the surrender of the Reserve and the possibility of some removing.

On the first of September she was succeeded by Miss Nellie Leask, during the month of September in that quarter. The cheque for that quarter, No. 3408, was for $40.27. As the school was running for 29 out of the 33 school days in that quarter, Miss Dewar claims that more should have been allowed than $40.27; and that $40.27 is not a proportionate amount of the school grant for that quarter considering that the school was open 29 days out of the 33, and would have been open the other days had there been any children to attend the school. The cheque was made out in favor of Miss Leask, but that matter has been arranged between the two, Miss Dewar and Miss Leask, Miss Leask receiving $25.00. Miss Dewar therefore claims the balance of $34.75. She is entitled to the holidays, as she taught during the three quarters before that.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Agent.\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo. I herewith enclose school returns of the Peguis school (day) for the month of October 1909.\n\nMiss Lemisk took charge of this school on the first of September 1908. She left on the 31st of October, after teaching just two months. She is about to be married. It is very difficult to get teachers. I have asked Miss Bella Stout who lives adjoining the school and whose father is a retired Hudson's Bay man to take charge until I had communicated with the Department. She is willing to continue as teacher if she receives the appointment. She is 19 years old attended school in the city of Winnipeg, up to Grade eight (VIII) and I would recommend her.\n\nThis school was not established under the auspices of any church and the appointments have always been made by the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 10th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, advising the Department of the resignation of Miss Leask, Teacher of the Peguis Indian Day School, and recommending the appointment of Miss Bella Stout.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Miss Stout may be appointed on the distinct understanding that the engagement is only temporary and at the pleasure of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nSecretary.\n\nJ. O. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nOttawa, November 16th, 1909.\n\nEx'd\n\nSir,\n\nIn connection with your proposed inspection visit to Selkirk I beg to say that the Department would like you while there to look into school matters on the St. Peter's Reserve.\n\nAuthority has recently been given for the engagement temporarily of a teacher at the Peguis Day School. In the recent sale no land was reserved at this point and there is a good public school close at hand. If the lands patented to Indians and still held by them personally are taxed by the municipality and if a school tax is imposed the Indians would have the privilege of attending the white school, and the Department wishes you to ascertain whether such taxes are paid by them there and at other points on St. Peter's Reserve. It is thought that Peguis and perhaps some other purely Indians schools might be dispensed with, and the Department would like to have a report from you on the situation as it exists in each of the old sections (St. Peter's South, Peguis, St. Peter's North, St. Peter's East and Muckle Creek).\n\nYou will also be good enough to inspect and report upon the Dynevor Hospital.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nS. Swinford, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, November 16th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, in reference to the amount of salary paid Miss Leask, Teacher of the Peguis Indian Day School, for the quarter ended September 30th, last.\n\nIf you will refer to paragraph 5 of \"Instructions to Teachers\" on the back of the quarterly day school return you will see that all day schools are required to be open 216 days during the year, and according to the quarterly return received from Miss Leask she taught 29 days in the September quarter, and was, therefore, paid 29/216 of $300.00 or $40.27, the amount due for her services during that quarter.\n\nAs regards Miss Mary Dewar, the former Teacher, she was paid $300.00, or a full year's salary, for the period which she had charge of this school. Payment cannot be allowed Miss Dewar for two periods of holidays in one year, and she also has received the full amount of salary due for the period of her services at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ. O. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No.319979/I of the 10th; I instant in reference to schools matters on the old St Peter's reserve, I beg to say that I drove down to some of the schools on Friday last, but the Teachers could not give me the information I required, so I returned to the Indian Agents Office for the records there and then had an interview with the Reeve of St Clements Municipality, which includes the reserve land on the east side of the river.\n\nAt the South St Peter's School during September Quarter there were on the roll, 6 Boys, and 7 Girls, Treaty; and 4 Boys, and 6 Girls, Non-treaty; giving an average of 9'50. There are 19 Families still holding parts of their allotments within attending distance of this school, but only 6 of these have children of school age. But there are still families living on their allotments that have been sold.\n\nAt Peguis School during September Quarter there were on the roll 8 Boys, and 4 Girls, Treaty; and 1 Girl, Non-treaty, giving an average of 6. There are still 13 Families holding part of their allotments, but only 4 of these have children of school age.\n\nAt North St Peter's School during September Quarter there were on the roll 10 Boys, and 12 Girls, all Treaty. Giving an average of 9'14. There are here 8 Families still holding parts of their allotments, of which\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\nwhich four have children of school age.\n\nAt East St Peter's School during September Quarter there were 4 Boys, and 7 Girls, all Treaty, giving an average of 4. There are here 7 Families still holding part of their allotments, three of which have children of school age.\n\nAt Nuckles Creek School during September Quarter there were on the roll, 2 Boys, and 3 Girls all Treaty giving an average of 5'20. So far as known there are still four families holding parts of their allotments, but only three families have children of school age, and they are all at school. The Clandabye Public School is about 2\u00bd miles distant and as the attendance is so small I would recommend that this school be closed.\n\nAbout two hundred yards from the Peguis School is a Municipal Public School, but it has refused to take the Treaty children even if they do pay taxes, for the reason that the school is now overcrowded. But across the river and only about a mile away is another Indian School, East St Peter's, and during the winter all the children in the vicinity could attend either school as they can cross the river on the ice. Consequently there is no necessity to keep both schools open, and I recommend that one of them be closed. It might be left to the decision of the Councillors which one should be closed, but the East St Peter's is much the best building.\n\nThe other two schools at North, and South St Peter's I think it would be well to leave open for some time yet.\n\nThere are a number of families that have sold their allotments, still living on the reserve, undecided where to remove to. But next summer I think there will be quite a migration to other reserves.\n\nThe old people have had inducements held out to\nthem to retain a small part of their allotments, that they might live on and be within reach of relief when necessary. This accounts for so many families remaining there, without children.\n\nThe Reeve of the Municipality of St Clements which includes the reserve lands on the east side of the river, told me that with the Reeve of St Andrews which includes the reserve lands on the west side of the river, they had taken legal advice and had assessed all the old reserve lands for which Patents had been issued by the Government, whether held by Indians or sold, and if the taxes were not paid within the legal time allowed the land would be sold for taxes the same as other land. He said the names of Indian owners had been placed on the Municipal Voters list and they would have a vote accordingly. That so soon as there were sufficient settlers in any vicinity to petition for a school, a district would be organized and a school built at which the children of Indians that paid taxes would have as much right to send their children as other settlers.\n\nI broached the question whether in the case of lands sold to white men and taxes paid by them but still occupied by Indians whether the Indian children could attend the Public School. He said so long as the taxes were paid he thought they could, but he was not sure and would take legal advice on the question.\n\nNo special school tax has been assessed in St Clements, but it has in St Andrews as there is a school in operation there and the District includes all the allotments on the west side except those included in the Town of West Selkirk. But there is no Public School on the east side of the river (St Clements) where Indian children can attend.\n\nI am Sir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nS.

St. Peter's Band.\n\nSCHOOLS.\n\nThe schools are only fairly attended. There are a number of children at Devils Creek, where a number took land and moved onto it and their families are there without facilities for schooling. They are too far from any of the river schools. When the fall term opens with the consent of the Department I could take an exact census of the children there and it might be advisable to rent a house and transfer one of the teachers now on the river to a school, there.\nOttawa, July 13, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your report on the Glandeboye Agency for the month of June I beg to say that your remarks with reference to the number of children located at Devils Creek have been noted. In this connection it would be well for you to report before long upon the whole situation on the St. Peters reserve. As you are aware the Muckles Creek and the East St. Peters schools have already been closed and, as the Indians have removed to their new reserve, it may be possible to close other schools. When the municipality collects school taxes from those who are living upon their allotments educational facilities should be provided by the Sections in which they reside.\n\nYou will be good enough, therefore, to go carefully into this whole matter and report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. O. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo. A Miss Avery, a sister of the Baptist minister located at Gilalo, St Peter's Parish, has been teaching the Peguis school. I have received no notice of her appointment as teacher. She applied to me for the position but as there is some considerable friction and has been for years between the Baptists and the Church of England in that parish I did nothing in the matter. The Church people have always claimed the supervision of schools in that Parish. The Rev Mr. Laronde failed to make a recommendation of a teacher until a few days ago, when he recommended Miss Isbister formerly teacher at Brokenhead Reserve. If the Department wish I can close the school at Peguis and reopen the East St. Peter's school almost directly across the river. The children who attend these schools or did attend them when they were both open live on both sides of the river. We own the building on the east side. We closed it last January. It is already for occupancy. We may need to spend money on the one on the Peguis school if we continue to keep it open all winter. We could make the change at the beginning of the quarter Oct. 1st. It becomes a question as to which church shall have the recommending of teachers in the Parish. The change will be a subterfuge or will look like one to the Department but I have been going to recommend it as the building at Peguis is very likely going to be too cold. The band have with very little assistance have kept it in repair.\n\nI would like to have the authority to put a new door on the South St. Peter's school. The outside and inside doors are both been repaired so often that they are beyond doing anything with.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Man.\nOttawa, September 19, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant in reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Peguis School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department had no knowledge of the resignation of the previous teacher or of the appointment of Miss Avery, and no action to place a new teacher in charge should have been taken without its consent. You will be good enough to ascertain by whose authority Miss Avery assumed control of the school and you should also state what proportion of the pupils of this section are children of professed Baptist parents. The Department cannot recognize Miss Avery's appointment until this further information is had.\n\nYour remarks with reference to the re-opening of the East St. Peter's school are noted. The Department cannot decide with regard to this until it is informed which school would provide accommodation, within easy distance, for the greatest number of children. The last official report showed that there were only four families in the Peguis district with children of school age and three families in the East St. Peter's Section. It would not appear to be necessary to keep both schools in operation.\n\nJ. G. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nIn this connection the Department would like to have the report called for in its letter of July 13th, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\nEXTRACT FROM AGENT'S REPORT ON THE CLANDEBOYE AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF AUGUST, 1910.\n\nSelkirk, Man., Sept. 1st, 1910.\nClandeboye Agency.\n\nSir,\n\nSchools. The schools are all open in St. Peter's save the R. O. school. We had no teacher for the one at Brokenhead and I directed Miss Monkman who formerly applied and was appointed by the Department in January last to open it if no one else came to take over the work. I have not been to Devils Creek in the St. Peter's parish to yet but the Rev. Mr. Larose, the Church of England Missionary, wishes to go with me and we have deferred making the visit until the parents and children are likely to be all home from berrying and haymaking. There will be about 30 children. There are that many attending the Sunday school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n(Signed) J. O. Lewis\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 22, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nOn July 13th, last, Mr. Agent Lewis was asked to report fully upon the whole educational situation on the St. Peter's Reserve. Two of the old schools have already been closed, viz.\u2014Muckles Creek and East St. Peters. The question of closing the Peguis and re-opening the East St. Peters is already before the Department.\n\nAt the time of the sale no land was reserved for school purposes at Peguis and there is a public school close at hand. If the lands patented to Indians and held by them personally are taxed by the municipality and if a school tax is imposed the Indians would have the privilege of attending the white school. This remark applies to all the lands patented to Indians in the municipality.\n\nThe question of establishing day schools on the new reserve has now to be dealt with and it is desirable that as many of the schools on the old reserves as possible should be closed.\n\nIt has also been suggested that some of the present buildings might be disposed of to the municipality when it is found necessary for them to establish schools.\n\nIt would be well for you to confer with Mr. Lewis.\n\nRev. J. Simmons,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nand submit a report so that the Department will know exactly how matters stand.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 18th Sept., 1910\n\nMiss. Avery has just made her return for the Sept quarter for the school at Peguis, St. Peter's. Her Roll shows 24 pupils. Of these 7 are from the east side of the Red river and who would attend the school on the east side if it of the river were open, (East St. Peter's). Rev. Mr. Laronde reports 15 children on the east side of the river ready to attend that school if it were opened. That number would include the 7 children that are now attending the school at Peguis. I drove up to interview the clerk of the St. Andrew Municipality and found that all of the St Peters Parish west of the Red river is in one school district, the school house of which is at Gilele, (Peguis) about a half mile from our school. The white people there object to having Indian children attend the Public school as they are more or less affected with scrofula which they claim is contagious.\n\nThe steps to be taken to form school district is for the ratepayers to call a public meeting and form a Board pro tempore and petition the Municipal Council to lay out the district and authorize them to organize. It is going to be difficult to do this on the west side of the river. All the white ratepayers will petition against it. There is a large area of assessable property belonging now to non-residents. This large area makes a low special school tax. It could, I think be easily done on the east side of the river in the Municipality of St Clements. There is no school district there and no white people that would oppose it save the non-residents. If the Department think it ad visable I will get the Indian ratepayers to call a meeting and prepare the Petition to the Council. I feel pretty certain that it would carry.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\nThere are about 18 pupils at Devils Creek who have no school to attend. We have no building there possible to use as a schoolhouse. An effort is being made by the Councilors to get someone to give up a house for that purpose.\n\nIt is about impossible to get good earnest teachers at the salary we offer. In this diocese the teachers get only the grant made by the Department. As a consequence we have no teachers that know anything of the art of teaching. Miss Avery has taken a great interest in her work and is very successful. I would be sorry to lose her. I have since learned that the two families, Laroche and Avery's are very friendly. If the Department approve of an effort being made by me to have a public school on the east side of the river I would recommend that Miss Avery be left where she is for the present until we can see the result of the effort to establish the Public school.\n\nThere are a few good men among the Indians in that part to whom the suggestion might be safely made and who could have it carried through. I would not however like to make any suggestions to anyone until I heard from the Department.\n\nIt might facilitate matters if I were placed in a position to make an offer of the East St. Peters school house now the property of the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 11, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, and in reply I beg to say that in view of your recommendation the Department approves of Miss Avery's remaining in charge of the Peguis school.\n\nThe Department does not wish to take any steps in reference to the establishment of a public school at the present time, but your remarks in reference thereto have been noted. It is expected that Rev. Mr. Semmens will confer with you in regard to these matters at an early date, when further information may perhaps be available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ. O. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nRef. No. 4\n\nOffice of the Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nLAKE WINNIPEG AND KENORA INSPECTORATE,\n\nStonewall, Man., January 4th 1911\n\nSir,\n\nLast September you wrote me in regard to the St Peters Schools and at the time I was more than busy and I requested Indian Agent Lewis to write you his views on the general question. Subsequently I asked Mr Sutherland acting for Mr Lewis to see that the question was dealt with and he informed me that he had written you the information required.\n\nSince that I have looked into the matter and have concluded that we are not under obligation to supply these people with educational advantages as they are tax payers and the Municipality which collects taxes are in duty bound to supply them with school accommodation.\n\nHowever the Municipal authorities absolutely refuse to entertain all propositions looking in this direction and it may be good policy to continue two Schools for the present one at South end and one at Millcote. If we were to withdraw too suddenly misunderstanding and further friction might arise.\n\nIt is necessary to supply two Schools at the Peguis Reserve and it should be understood that we give privileges only on Reserves. This impression it will be my duty to give to all concerned but for the present I think it will\nbe best to continue the two Schools named.\n\nI may say that the Municipal authorities object to the admission of Indian children to their day schools because they are Indian children but this foolish prejudice will wear away in time and the rights of the case will prevail.\n\nSo far as the Indians are concerned it is best for us to encourage their removal as much as possible to Peguis and if every advantage is allowed at St Peters they will be slower in moving. The erection of the two Schools which you have ordered at Peguis will be an extra inducement to parents to move their families there and a careful policy is the best under existing conditions.\n\nI shall be glad to be further instructed in this matter and will carefully guard the interests of the Indians on the one side and the interests of the Department on the other although allowing the existence of the two Schools at St Peters for the present I think that the Municipal Council should be made to understand that the arrangement is only tentative and that the Department does not consider itself under obligation to continue the privilege indefinitely.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nCanada\nOttawa, January 12, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant in reference to the St. Peter's schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that as it is your intention to visit these schools again in the near future the Department will defer any action till your report is received.\n\nAny recommendations that you may wish to offer will then be gladly received. I may say that the Department wishes to name the school establishment on this reserve as soon as possible having due regard for the welfare of the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Simmons,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMEMO.\n\nAt Selkirk, Man.\n\nJanuary 10th, 1910\n\nSir,\n\nIn connection with Returns of the Penguin School, otherwise called Norton St. Peters, for the Quarter ending December 31st, I refer to letter No. 26002, wherein you were informed of the resignation of the teacher, Miss Everitt, to take effect at the end of last quarter.\n\nA few days ago I received a recommendation for the appointment of a substitute, but was insufficiently informed as to the qualifications of the applicant and am now inquiring. As the returns appear to be very satisfactory, it is a pity to see the work interrupted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. A. Robertson\nActing Indian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, January 20, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, and in reply I beg to say that it is the intention of Mr. Inspector Simmons to visit this reserve at an early date and when he does so you should consult with him in regard to the appointment of a teacher for the Peguis school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary:\n\nG. A. Betournay, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nA. Belourney, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 25th inst., I beg to say that Miss Myrtle Pruden, recommended by me to the Indian Dept. for the North St. Peters School, possesses only a high school training, and was recommended to me by Rev. W. Thomas of Selkirk. She has had no experience in teaching.\n\nA second application subsequent to that of Miss Pruden was made to the Indian Office, Selkirk, by Miss J. Tracey, who I hear has normal training and such as I could recommend for the school as she is a member of our Church. I learned of her application after I had informed Miss Pruden that I wished to send in her application to the Indian Dept. But as you have not forwarded the recommendation, there are two two\napplications before the Dept. for the school, and no doubt you will know which one of the two to recommend to the Dept. I myself think that the better trained of the two applicants should be given the preference.\n\nI shall be pleased to see the school in running order as soon as you can send down the teacher.\n\nWith Kind Regards,\n\nYours truly,\nL. Laronde.\nReferring to your letter of the 10th inst.\n\nIn regard to the resignation of Miss Ivery as teacher of the Peguis Day School, I enclose a communication from Rev. Mr. J. Laroche representing the Church of England at that point. I also met Councillor W.D. Harper, who fairly represents the Indian opinion at that point and decided upon placing Miss J. Tracy in charge. I wished to avoid any unnecessary delay and I trust the Department will not be displeased.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, January 26, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant with enclosures, and in reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the action taken by you in placing Miss Tracey in charge of the Peguis school. The salary will be paid at the usual rate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. A. Betournay, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nOttawa, November 24, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant in reference to the North St. Peters School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the situation as reported by you, the Department approves of your suggestion that Miss Pruden be asked to resign at the end of the current quarter, and you may take action accordingly.\n\nBefore confirming the appointment of Miss Stout I have to ask you to be good enough to state what qualifications she possesses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Watson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\n\nNo.\n\nALSO TO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nIndian Agent's Office,\n\nHelkirk\n\nNov 1st 1911\n\nEnclosed find petition from members of the Peguis or North St. Peters school district. Since my return from treaty payments I have had a great many complaints about the way Miss Pruden has been handling this school, and today I went down to inspect it for myself. I found the school closed and on enquiry was told that the school had been closed for two days, and that the teacher was off to Winnipeg. She did not ask permission from me to close the school, and it would appear that of late she had been running the school to suit herself without consulting any person. I would recommend that at the end of this quarter Miss Pruden be dismissed and a new teacher engaged. I would also recommend that Miss Bella Stout be employed as teacher for the coming year. Am not personally acquainted with Miss Stout, but I understand she taught in this school before and the people all seem anxious to have her back. Mr. Stout applied to me for the position for his daughter if a new teacher is to be engaged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Watson\nIndian Agent\n\nSec\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nWe, the members of the Pugnie School district, kindly ask your Department to depose our teacher Miss Myrtle Burden on the charges of neglect. Some weeks only keep school 4 days but at all times only in school 3 1/2 of a day some days half an hour before noon day, after days children go home not seeing their teacher.\n\nWe therefore claim she is drawing her salary without paying for it, and also our children deprived off there days by not getting full hours in the asks that our pray be sanctioned by her getting her discharge & getting Miss Bella Stone.\n\n- John Prince\n- Andrew Sinclair\n- David Sinclair\n- Mrs. Wm. & child\n- Charles Williams\n- Samuel Cromarty\n- James Prince\nOttawa, January 11, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to official letter of November 24th, last, in which you were asked for information as to the qualifications of Miss Stout, teacher of the North St. Peter's School, and to ask when the Department may expect a reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Watson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nSir,\n\nRe letter No 319979/I; Dated 11th inst.\n\nI never received your letter of Nov 24th, asking for information as to the qualifications of Miss Stout. I was surprised that I did not receive an answer to my letter of Nov 17th, but thought probably you were having some communication with the English Church Authorities, as I understood you usually allowed the church to have some say in the nomination of a teacher where they have a mission.\n\nI have just had word from Mr Stout, that his daughter could not take the school if the position were open as she had made other arrangements. So if you decide to make a change a new teacher will have to be secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Sec.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDept of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 22, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that Miss Stout was not able to take the position of teacher of the St. Peter's School, Peguis Reserve. In view of your report and the request of the Indians for a change it is not considered advisable to continue the services of Miss Pruden, unless there has been a decided improvement in her method of conducting the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Watson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed find a letter from the Rev Louis Laronde of St Peters, about the Indian schools there.\n\nI told Mr Laronde that while I was strongly in favour of having qualified teachers, I did not know what The Dept would do with regard to St Peters as St Peters was no longer a reserve, and it might be that The Dept would not feel called upon to continue the Indian School in St Peters, as those who owned their land would be entitled to send their children to the municipality school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Sec\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nBox 339, Selkirk, Man.\nFeb. 27th 1912.\n\nJohn Watson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent, Selkirk,\nDear Sir,\n\nIn view of the fact that there is a general dissatisfaction on the part of the Indian Dept. officials and the Indians on account of the inefficiency of our present Indian Day School teachers in St. Peter's due to their lack of experience and qualifications; and, in view of the fact that the Department has raised the grant for qualified teachers to $50, and there is now no reason why we should not have properly qualified teachers, therefore I beg to make application to the Department for the enactment of a regulation to the effect that after a certain date none but qualified teachers shall be employed by the Department in the existing day schools in St. Peter's, and that, along with such regulation, permission be granted that due notice of such regulation may be served at any time by the Indian Agent on the request of the clergyman of the Parish, upon the teacher or teachers in whose schools\na more satisfactory work is possible and is de-\nsirable.\n\nThere is no disposition on the part of any\nof the present teachers to resign, and only by\nsome regulation as the one suggested above is\nit possible to dispense with their services.\n\nI may say that the Indians are dissatisfied\nwith the present teachers, and many children\ndo not attend school because of the inefficiency\nof their teachers.\n\nI am ready to submit a petition signed\nby the Indians whose children go to school\nin this Parish, asking for a regulation similar\nto that asked for in this letter, and I shall\nsend it in, if so desired by the Department. But\nI hope my application will be sufficiently\nespecially in view of the fact that Inspector\nof Indian Agencies, Rev. John Demmery, is\nrecommending in his annual report, that\nqualified teachers be employed in the day\nschools of St. Peter's.\n\nI believe, under such regulation as the above,\nI would have no difficulty in securing the\nservices of properly qualified teachers for our day schools.\n\nI believe I am stating the fact in saying that you concur with me in the view that properly qualified teachers are urgently needed for the day schools in St. Peter's, and I hope you will endorse my application to the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLouis Laronde,\nIncumbent,\nSt. Peter's Man.\nOttawa, April 23, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a memorandum prepared by Mr. E. K. McLean, D.L.S., who subdivided the St. Peter's Indian Reserve, from which you will see the amount of land reserved by the Department in connection with the Indian schools at that time in existence.\n\nIn November of the year 1909 Mr. S. Swinford, then Inspector of Indian Agencies, was asked to visit the reserve and report fully upon school matters. The Department has in view the withdrawal of its contribution towards these schools so soon as this can be done without any detriment to the Indians. If the lands patented to Indians and still held by them personally are taxed by the municipality and if a school tax is imposed the Indians will have the privilege of attending the white schools. The Department is not aware whether such taxes are being paid in any of the school sections as previously constituted on the St. Peter's Reserve. However, as above stated, it is the wish to dispense with the purely Indian schools as soon as practicable and the Department would like you to report on the situation in each of the following old sections: St. Peter's North, St. Peter's South and Peguis, in each of which there is still an Indian school in operation. I may add for your information that the St. Peter's East and the\n\nJ. R. Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n505 Broadway St.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMuckles Creek schools were closed sometime ago. The Department has been given to understand that the municipalities object to the admission of Indian children to their schools, but if the Indians are tax payers this objection cannot be considered valid and it will be the duty of the Department to see that they get the benefit of the taxes so paid, which is the privilege of attending the public schools in the sections in which they reside.\n\nAt the same time you might take up the question of the disposal of the school properties reserved at the time of the sale to the municipalities, specifying whether they are willing to take them over and, if so, at what price.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, April 27, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 23rd instant in reference to the schools on the St. Peter's Reserve I have to ask you to be good enough to inform Rev. Louis Laronde of the contents of that letter. Mr. Laronde had written to the late Agent on February 27th, last, asking for increased grants to the schools on this reserve. The letter above referred to will show him the attitude of the Department towards these schools generally.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. R. Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n595 Broadway St.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nI have to acknowledge your letter No 319979/1 dated April 23rd 1912.\n\nAs soon as I can conveniently, at an early date visit these schools and get fully posted as to matters referred in your letter I will advise as to the conclusions I have arrived at in this connection, paying due care to the instructions and suggestions set forth in your letter; at the same time I will take up the question of the disposal of the schools.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise that I have received notice from Miss Myrtle Pruden teacher in North St Peter's School that she has resigned her position as teacher; please let me know if it is the intention of the Department to continue this School.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nyour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, October 9, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant reporting the resignation of Miss Myrtle Pruden, teacher of the Peguis School on the St. Peter's Reserve, and asking if it is intended to continue this school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department considers that it would be inadvisable to carry on the school during the winter and you need not, therefore, take any steps to secure another teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nPeguis, Man,\nAug. 1st, 1917.\n\nDear Friend,\n\nI want a little information which I think you may be able to give me. I am Sec.Treas. of the School district here and I am directed to endeavour to obtain from the Indian Dept. a grant in aid of our school on the ground of so many of our pupils belonging to Treaty families from whom no taxes are received and for whom no fees are paid.\n\nThe Dept. makes grant of $200 a year to the School district South of us on the East side of the river (Dynevor) and we feel we ought to get some help too. Until lately the Treaty people refused to send their children to our school saying that they would have nothing to do with it as by so doing they would prejudice their case as to the Reserve settlement. The Manitoba Education Dept. has informed us that we must compel attendance, treaty or not, if resident in our district; so I have brought a little pressure to bear on them and a lot of them are now coming much to our gratification. There is a one horse affair in the way of an Indian School kept up North of us on the East side. The Indians themselves who are in our district kick at having to send their children over the river. Now they are sending to our school they declare that that school is no good in comparison. Some of the Treaty children who are near the ferry come over to our school; We make no charge to them, so feel that we ought to get some help. To whom should I apply in the matter? Any advice you can give me in confidence will be greatly appreciated.\n\nKind regards,\n\nAll well with us,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) J. Blatherwick.\nWINNIPEG MAN.

John Blatherwick of St. Peters Reserve, in which he states that there are a number of Indian children attending the Provincial School under his charge, and asking that a grant be allowed towards the cost of their tuition.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will be prepared to make a grant of $12 per capita per annum on the average attendance of Indian children. This is at the same rate as is allowed for the tuition of Indian Treaty children of the south half of St. Peters Reserve at the Patapun Public School. It is presumed that all the children attending the school mentioned by you belong to treaty families. The name of the school district to which you refer is not mentioned, but, if the Secretary Treasurer and the board of trustees accept the above offer in payment for the tuition of the Indian children who attend your school, a resolution of the board to that effect should be forwarded to the Department.\n\nYou will be good enough to take this matter up with the Secretary Treasurer of the school district and inform him of the Department's decision in this matter. You should also forward fuller particulars as to the number of children who will be likely to attend, where these reside, and the name of the school district.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAnst.

School\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing the quarterly returns of the Blood Vein Day School, in the Norway House Agency, for the September, December and March quarters last. I have the greatest doubts as to the advisability of paying the grant wholly or even in part. However, the teacher is an Indian and his two children, the only ones in attendance, would be entitled to be considered as Indian pupils. I, therefore, think that some payment should be made, such as the Department may feel in proportion to the work done. I wrote to the Chairman of the Missionary Committee of the Methodist Church and he replied that he had no knowledge of the state of affairs, and that the present teacher, who is absent at present from the school, has been notified not to return to it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 19th May, 1905\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn October 1903 a school was opened under the auspices of your Society at Bloodvein River and returns were received up to the 30th June last and cheques were sent you in payment of the salary of the teacher there, Mr Jeremiah Rundle.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner has just forwarded returns for September, December and March quarters last which show an enrollment of only two pupils, the children of Mr Rundle. All the other Indians are said to be away from the reserve and the Commissioner expresses grave doubts as to the advisability of paying the teacher wholly, or even in part. He states that he wrote to the Chairman of the Missionary Committee of your church, who replied that he had no knowledge of the state of affairs there, and that the teacher, who is at present absent from the school, had been notified not to return to it. Under the circumstances the Department does not feel disposed to pay the three quarters salary in full, as no one apparently received any benefit but Mr Rundle's own children.\n\nThe Department would be glad to have your views as to what payment, if any, should be made.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.\nGeneral Secretary\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLean\nSecretary\n\nMethodist Mission Rooms\nToronto.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, #23407-3, referring to the Indian school at Bloodvein River, and the inadvisability of continuing the same in view of the exceedingly limited number of children reported in attendance.\n\nI have sent a copy of your letter to the Rev. T. Ferrier, Chairman of the District in which Bloodvein is situated, and hope to receive his reply at an early date. If there are facts in the case that might modify the judgment of the Department, I will see that they are promptly communicated.\n\nUnder our present agreement with Mr. Rundle his pay continues up to the close of the present school year, say June 30th. I suppose it is only during a part of the year that any considerable number of children are found at Bloodvein, but I will ascertain the facts and report.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nRev. Dr. Sutherland,\nMission Rooms, Toronto.\n\nDear Doctor,\n\nIn the summer of 1903, Rev. E. R. Steinhauer of Fisher River and others represented to me the necessity of a teacher at Bloodvein Reserve, pointing out that a school was there and a number of children. I took no definite action, believing very little in a day school under such conditions, but later on I had word that Jerry Rundle was available, in fact had gone to take charge.\n\nNot seeing any report for the year, not being able to go and visit the Reserve, I knew little or nothing of the state of affairs. The Government Agent and Inspector were there at Treaty in 1904, and I learned from them that things were not in the best of condition; but still believing that children were attending school I placed it on the list for 1904-5. Some time in April last, I had word from Rev. E. R. Steinhauer that Jerry Rundle was over at Fisher River, and reported that his own children were all that attended the school last winter. I at once wrote Jerry not to return to the school until further instructed. I have already paid Jerry two-thirds of the\nyear's salary. Under the circumstances I think if the Government pay\na half-year's grant it would be a fair arrangement, with the under-\nstanding that the school will be closed.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Signed) T. Perrier.\nSir,\n\nIn accordance with an intimation contained in my letter of the 30th ultimo, I wrote the Rev. T. Perrier respecting the school at Bloodvein River, and have just received his reply, a copy of which I enclose.\n\nIn view of the facts I think Mr. Perrier's suggestion a reasonable one, namely, that the Department pay a half year's grant with the understanding that the school be closed.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory to the Department, I am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Butterfield\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnclosure.\nOTTAWA, 14th June, 1905\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant relative to the Bloodvein River school; and in reply I beg to say that in accordance with Rev. Mr Ferrier's suggestion, a Cheque for $150.00 has been sent you (covering a half year's grant) on the distinct understanding that this school is to be closed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nRev. A. Sutherland D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto.\nOttawa, September 19, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nBy mutual arrangement the Blood Vein River School, which was conducted under the auspices of Your Church, was closed in the year 1905. A return has just been received from Mr. Harold Wilding which shows that he had the school open for a period during the months of July and August, but this return does not show either when the school was opened nor when it closed, neither has it been transmitted, as it should be, through the office of the Indian Agent.\n\nThe Department would like to ascertain by whose authority this school was opened by Mr. Wilding.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, 25th November, 1910.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI beg to call your attention to official letter dated September 14th last with reference to the reopening of the Blood Vein River School during the months of July and August last and to which no reply has been received.\n\nWill you kindly give the Department the information asked for therein as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBRANDON, Manitoba.\nThe Secretary Department\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying your letter of Sept 19th, in Brandon.\n\nThere has been pressing for a teacher for some time in that community. Mr. Rundle was there. They claim he was a good teacher and I think they are about right.\n\nSo I send Miss Smith, who is a graduate of Wesley College, a young woman from the few months of the summer. We shall see what will be the result. You have a copy of his report as teacher, and it appears as though they should have a teacher for the summer months, but that is for the Department to decide.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. T. Porter\nSuperintendent of Aboriginal Indian Schools and Hospitals in Canada\nOttawa, December 12, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo in which you advise the Department that it was on your authority that Mr. Wilding conducted the school on the Bloodvein Indian Reserve during a portion of the months of July and August.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in view of your explanation payment of the salary due Mr. Wilding for the term has been forwarded to the Church authorities. Mr. Wilding complains of the condition of the school building and of course for this the Department cannot be held in any way responsible as it was not aware that the Indians wished to have this school re-opened. In future you will be good enough to advise the Department and obtain permission before making an appointment such as this. In the meantime the Agent will be written to for a full report on the conditions on this reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nAust. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, December 12, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nThe school on the Bloodvein reserve was opened this summer and placed in charge of Mr. Wilding for a portion of the months of July and August. I have to ask you to be good enough to report upon the work. The return shows that there were altogether 32 children enrolled with an average attendance for the 35 days of 11.3.\n\nThe Department would like to have your views as to the necessity and advisibility of re-opening this school. Rev. Mr. Ferrier, who is Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, is in favour of conducting a school here during the summer months. In your report you should also deal with the condition of the building and give your views generally on the whole situation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.A. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. C. Calverley, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Keewatin.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of December 12th, 1910.\n\nNo. 33407 \u2014 I beg to state that on my visit to Blood Vein on the 22nd July the school at that place had been open two days there were 8 girls and 10 boys on the register. The walls of the building are in very good condition. The building requires mudding or plastering and white-washing. There are no desks or other school material.\n\nIn this vicinity in the spring there is very good sturgeon fishing and several families from other reserves make this their headquarters. This makes a decided increase in the number of children on the reserve and, if the Department is of the opinion that sufficient good can be accomplished along moral and educational lines to warrant the expenditure necessary to keep the school open during the summer months, I am of the opinion that a sufficient number of pupils will be resident on the reserve.\n\nJudging from the results obtained where day-schools were kept open the year round I am very doubtful whether much good can be accomplished by the reopening of this school for the summer months.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nTHE SECRETARY DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs Ottawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nA request comes to have the school open at Bloodvein, near Winnipeg, for four months this coming summer.\n\nWill the Department sanction this and what salary will be paid for the four months?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. Ferrier\nOttawa, February 27, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department has made inquiries and as a result is not disposed to conduct a summer school during the coming season at Bloodvein River. Repairs are needed to the school and there are no desks. The teacher last year would appear to have conducted the school without desks and school material of any kind. There is a doubt as to whether this school building is on the reserve. I may say that the Department hopes to send a surveyor to this reserve next summer and he will look carefully into the matter and report. In the meantime it is not thought well to take any action towards furnishing the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nDept. Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nMarch 26, 1912.\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing you re the school for the summer months at Blood Vein, Lake Winnipeg. I understand that during the summer the Indians come down from Grand Rapids, Deer Lake, and Sandy Lake to trade, and do considerable trading at Blood Vein, and I think a school there for the summer would be very well attended. There is a building there that would suit for the purpose and I think I could secure a teacher provided the Department would pay a salary of say, $300, for five months.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. Ferriee\nOttawa, April 18, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg leave to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo in reference to the appointment of a teacher to take charge of the school on the Bloodvein Reserve during the summer holidays and to say in reply that, in view of the fact that many Indians congregate on this Reserve and remain there for a considerable time, the Department is prepared to furnish the supplies and pay a salary for a teacher. Preference should be given to a student. Full particulars with regard to the qualifications should be supplied. The salary will be at the rate of $500.00 per annum for the time that the school is kept in operation, payment being based upon a school year of 200 days. As soon as the Department hears from you the necessary action will be taken for having the supplies forwarded to the Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T.

Sir,\n\nOn April 18th, last, the Department agreed to the appointment of a teacher to take charge of the school on the Bloodvein Reserve during the summer months and on April 24th you acknowledged this letter, stating that you would endeavour to secure a suitable person for the position and report later on. No further word has been heard from you in the matter, but recently a return has been received from Joseph A. Everett showing that the school was open for sixty days.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to report if Mr. Everett took charge of this school by your instructions and what qualifications he held for the position. The Department desires here to remark that apparently no requisitions for supplies for this school were received and there were very few on hand. It is not understood how the teacher could perform very satisfactory services without the necessary books and stationery.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nTo the Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to yours of the 19th instant the authority of the Department was given on April 16th last to engage a teacher for the school at Blood Vein. When I was in Ottawa I discussed the difficulty of getting just the kind of person I would like. I was in hopes that we could secure a probationer of our church for the summer vacation but did not think it possible and mentioned the alternative of engaging Joseph Everett. This was understood to be acceptable to the Department, providing no other supply could be obtained. I engaged him on the understanding that he should receive $2.50 a day for every day that he kept the school open. He wrote me stating that he had kept the school open for sixty days and I have settled with him on that basis, so that if the Department sends the cheque to our office in Toronto for $150.00, it will be in harmony with the arrangements made with Mr. Everett, and the authority of the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nTo the Secretary,\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs far as I have been able to learn, Mr. Joseph Everett rendered good service as day school teacher at Blood Vein for a few months last year. I have a request from the people through the missionary, Rev. F. G. Stevens, to engage him again for a few months during the coming summer. I would like the consent of the Department for this arrangement.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. Ferrie\nOttawa, February 6th, 1918.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, in reference to the employment of Mr. Joseph Everett, as teacher of the Bloodvein School, and in reply, I beg to say, that before authorizing this engagement, the Department would like to have a full report on the work that he performed at Bloodvein last year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Everett as teacher at Blood Vein for the summer months. No reply has been received. Would you kindly let me know if the Department would favor this. There is a strong request from the people and as far as I know they appreciated the school last year by the attendance.\n\nThere is also a request from Little Grand Rapids for a teacher for the coming summer. We have had teachers there in the past but during the last two years none was sent. I could probably secure a probationer of our ministry to go out there for the summer. Would the Department favor this appointment? The salary to be paid would be about $2.50 a day for every day taught.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. Ferrier\nOttawa, May 13, 1923.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo in reference to conducting a school at Bloodvein during the summer months.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your letter of January 26th, last, was replied to on February 6th and you were requested to let the Department have a report as to the work performed by Mr. Everett last year.\n\nAs the time for re-opening the school is now near at hand and as the Indians themselves have said that they wish to have a teacher appointed, Mr. Everett may be appointed temporarily for three months at the salary of $2.50 per day for each day that the school is kept open. Mr. Everett last year conducted this school apparently without any school supplies and the Department received no reports from him. If he is engaged this year monthly reports must be insisted upon and as soon as advised that it is his intention to take up the work a supply of school material will be forwarded, if he will advise the Department as to what is needed. He should be in a position to do this having been in the school last year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.,\nAsst.

Miles Bagg was engaged as Mr. Stevens of Fisher recommended him. I am not quite sure of his qualifications but will find out and let you know. I understand that he is doing very good work.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Carrier\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\nFisher River, Man. April 28th, 1920\n\nMr H.O. Latulippe\nIndian Agent\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nDear Mr Latulippe,\n\nI am inclosing the school returns for quarter ending March 31st for Bloodvein day school.\n\nThe school was closed for sickness three days and forty-one days teaching were put in so I settled for forty four days, I trust you will agree to this.\n\nI wrote you some time ago that I had engaged Alex Murdoch to commence teaching at Bloodvein on or about April 1st, but I have now to report that he has backed out of his promise and is not going to take the work. Miles has also quit just at the end of the quarter. At present I have no one to send there, I do not think it as very important just now, as the attendance would be almost nothing for the Spring months, I will see what I can do about a teacher later on.\n\nI am sending in two requisitions for supplies for Bloodvein school. The teacher there borrowed some things from our day school here, Mr M.G. Mingay has asked me to ask you to mail them to him here, so that being replaced, he can make a true report of school materials on hand at the end of June quarter.\n\nIn connection with the Bloodvein school I must report to you that I am finding it increasingly difficult to get teachers to stay at Bloodvein, and that our day school affairs are always in trouble because of the way Mrs Kitty Scott has been and is acting, as she does not belong to Bloodvein and has been and is leading an immoral life. I think she should be placed on her own Reserve (Fisher River) and so kept under Police surveillance that she would be prevented from her present practices. With kind regards\n\nYours sincerely\nF.G. Stevens\nSir,\n\nInclosed you will find returns for the Bloodvein day school and also two requisitions for school material, one of them you will notice that the Rev. F.G. Stevens is requesting to be sent to Fisher River as supplies borrowed from the Fisher River Day School. On the other I have erased the brooms and scrubbing brushes as they are included in the estimates for 1920-21 and will be delivered at the above named school at the Annuity payments.\n\nYou will also notice that the Rev. Stevens reports that the teacher has quit teaching at the end of March quarter by copy of a letter attached and received from Mr. Stevens, and that he finds it very difficult to secure a teacher for the Bloodvein day school. In regards to this matter I beg to say that on my visit to this Reserve I will report fully to the Department and try and find out why they cannot obtain a qualified teacher for this school.\n\nIn reference to the report about Mrs Kitty Scott, which Rev. Stevens has embodied in his letter, I beg to say that I have had correspondence from Mr Indian Agent Carter, of the Fisher River Agency in regards to this matter and I understand that he has brought up the matter before the Department and as Mr Carter is well acquainted with the facts and there is no doubt that his report is correct.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, May 10, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has noted that Miles Bagg will discontinue teaching this school at the end of the March quarter.\n\nOn your next visit to this reserve the Department will expect to receive from you a complete report regarding the difficulty that is found in obtaining a qualified teacher for this school. At the same time you might look into the complaint made by Rev. Mr. Stevens of the actions taken by Mrs. Kitty Scott. The Department understands that this woman is a member of the Fisher River Band and you should state in your report why she is living at Bloodvein, and also, if you consider that she should be sent back to her own reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nH.

T. G. Stevens, Fisher River, in which he stated that Mr. Bagg had left at the end of the last quarter and that he had no one to send there at present, but that he did not consider it very important just now as the attendance would be almost nothing for the spring months.\n\nIt is hoped that a suitable teacher will be secured to take charge of this school after the summer holidays.

Mr Chas Mason, an ex-teacher of this school was present and stated that he had his utmost to please them but could not get the children to attend the school.\n\nRev. F Lemch reported that he would open the Blood Vein (R.C.) Indian Day School on the 16th of August.\n\nIn reference to the complaint made by the Rev.

Mr. Inspector Simmons in his last report speaks well of the teacher of this school, and the Department would like to know if you have any suggestions to make as to how some improvement might be made in the attendance. The difficulty would appear to be apathy on the part of the parents, and, as you are acquainted with the local conditions, a full report, with any recommendations you may care to make, will be gladly received.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D.

The attendance has decreased until it is a question whether the school should be closed or not.\n\nThis is, in the opinion of the Department, a matter calling for prompt action, although apparently you do not so look upon it, judging by your total disregard of the Department's request. You will be good enough to let the Department have the report called for at once, and give your reasons for not complying with its instructions in the first instance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. O. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWest Selkirk, Man.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nNovember 20th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of October 28/09,\n\nNo.117585/1.\n\nI made mention of this school in my last monthly report on Schools. This school was opened at the urgent request of the Indians. It is on the East side of the Winnipeg River, near the mouth. There never were very many children of school age at that point, but a school-house had been built there a number of years ago, and had been closed on account of insufficient attendance. The Chief and Council of the Band asked that this School House be moved further up the river where there are more children, as it is about impossible to allow school children to cross and recross the Winnipeg River. The River varies that Reserve from a half to a mile in width. During a West wind from the lake, the river is about as dangerous as the lake would be, with the added danger of the current. The Commissioner however demurred at having the School House moved, or recommending the building of a new school-house, and this was opened two years ago to attempt to pacify the Indians, thinking perhaps this would satisfy them.\n\nTo The Secretary,\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nIt has never just exactly suited them, but they have not made much protest since. I have looked over the situation several times, and I cannot see where a school-house could be built there that would be easily accessible to a very much larger number of children. There is a large creek coming down on the East side, in fact two of them. One of these was bridged by the Indians a year ago this Fall, but the other would be too great an undertaking as it is somewhere about two hundred feet wide.\n\nIt is difficult to recommend just what should be done. To be of any use it would really require two schools, both of which would be poorly attended. There is no road on the East side of the River, but in parts there are trails cut through. The Indians have asked that roads and bridges be constructed on the East side, the same way that we did in 1905 on the West side. I have never recommended it, leaving it for future consideration, as the other on the West side cost us over $3,000.00. In the month of September Miss Folster wrote that in August she had had no children at all for days at a time, and asked me what she should do. I told her to continue the school, and keeping it open until we would decide what could be done. She has had children attending in September and October. I do not know what the November attendance will be, and can only ascertain by correspondence. I would recommend that the school be kept open until the end of this quarter, and if the attendance does not improve get another teacher, and in any case not close the school until the first of April, as the winter is a part of the year in which they are best able to get the children to attend school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, November 29th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant in reference to existing conditions at the Lower Fort Alexander School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of your recommendation, the Department will keep the school open during this winter, trusting that the attendance will improve, but as the trouble would not appear to be lack of interest on the part of the teacher it is not seen where any advantage would be gained by dispensing with the services of Miss Polster, of whom the Inspector spoke very highly.\n\nIt might be well if you would communicate with the Chief and councillors of this Band and impress upon them the necessity of taking advantage of the opportunity afforded by the school, that better results would be obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. O. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWest Selkirk, Man.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE.\n\nSelkirk, Man.\n\n19th Jan. 1910\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo.\n\nOn my visit to Fort Alexander I visited the Lower Fort Alexander school and found only four pupils present, three girls and one small boy. In the afternoon I had a Council meeting and discussed the matter with them and with Rev. E. Thomas the resident missionary. It was proposed there that a vacant building, two miles up the river from the old school, 20ft x 20ft be taken for awhile on trial and used as a school. The rent suggested was $2.00 per month, though the Indian who owned it said he would be satisfied to give it gratis, if it was used for a school as he had children who needed schooling and could not get it. The proposed building is almost directly opposite the Upper school. The river has not frozen hard enough this winter to allow crossing. The river is one mile wide at this point and is not safe crossing at any time, either in summer or winter. If this school is opened it will make a difference of just two in the attendance at the Upper school. I would recommend that the removal be allowed and that a rent be paid for the building.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa, February 1st, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th ultimo suggesting the experiment of conducting the present Lower Fort Alexander school in the building situated on the opposite side of the river to the location of the Upper school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as this school where at present located is not meeting with the success desired, the Department approves of your proposal. You may, therefore, make arrangements for the rental of the building referred to at the rate of $3.00 per month, and the Department trusts that this change will result in a much better attendance being secured.\n\nYou will be good enough to report on this matter on the occasion of your next visit to the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ.

The removal of the Lower school to a point further up the river has given a great deal of satisfaction and has about trebled the attendance.\nFort Alexander\nMay 25th\n\nThe Indian Agent\nWest Selkirk\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOwing to the bad condition of the ice this fall I was unable to continue teaching across the river, as I am obliged to live on the south side, while the school is on the north. When the river was freezing up I could not cross with a boat and had to close school for three weeks till the ice was strong enough to cross over on.\n\nI asked the people to get me a house to stay in during that time, or to fix up the schoolhouse and I would stay there but none of them made any effort to do so. Therefore I have put down in the register and returns no wood supply etc., for it was no fault of mine. If they got a house for me to stay in I would willingly have gone to live on the other side of the river.\n\nTrusting you will understand this and believe my report true.\n\nI am\n\nyours respectfully,\n\n(Miss) E. J. Foster,\nLower School Teacher.\nOttawa, January 17, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from the teacher of the Lower Fort Alexander School in which she states that the school was closed for sixteen days during the December quarter because she was unable to cross the river.

The resident clergyman with my consent placed Mr Henderson in temporary charge. It was distinctly understood that as soon as the bishop could be communicated with and could make a direct nomination the employment of Mr Henderson would cease.\n\nAs to Mr Henderson he is an Indian with an industrial school training.

Original on file 11758515\n\nIn this connection the Bishop has through the Rev. Mr Fryer the new Incumbant of Fort Alexander nominated Miss Eva Fryer as the new teacher of the Fort Alexander Lower Day School as directed by your letter to me under previous date. This lady goes forward to day to open the school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(sgd.) John Semmens\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nOttawa, Sept. 14th., 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,-\n\nThe Department is advised by Mr. Inspector Se\nSevens that Miss Eva Fryer has left for Fort Alexander to take up\nher duties as teacher at the Lower School. In reply I beg to say\nthat this arrangement will be satisfactory to the Department, although\nthe appointment of a qualified teacher would be more desirable. Miss\nFryer has had considerable experience, however, but the Department\nhas no definite record as to her capabilities. She will be paid\nto commence with at the rate of $800.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRt. Rev. J.

I think this will turn up all right. I had a note from Mr Smith saying he thought it had been sent to St John's College Winnipeg, if so he will get it.\n\nNo 117566-1.\n\nI see no reason whatever why Mr Fryer should not give all the time that any other teacher gives to school work. He is a capable teacher, and has had long experience in teaching Indian schools; therefore I see no reason why he should be paid less than Mr A or Mr B, if he does the work he is worth the pay, if he does it not then the Dept can get another man. I think that he should be paid $400. If he cannot fulfil the conditions then I do not want him to teach at all.\n\nNo 117566-1.\n\nRe Miss Fryer. Miss F. did not go out to take charge of the Lower school, but I promised to send in her name if the man\nsent in by Mr. Simmons gave up the school. Mr. Fryer informs me that this man has left, and I should be glad to see Miss F. appointed, she may not be qualified, i.e., she does not hold a certificate, but is quite as well qualified as most who have been at this school.\n\nThe Dept should be able to get her record from the Agent on Rainy River as she taught school there for over two years.\n\nShe will be willing to begin on $300 a year, and we could not get a really qualified teacher for less than $600.\n\nWill you please kindly pay Miss F. direct from the Dept but should be glad if you would pay Mr. Fryer's a/c to me as he will have to be paid quarterly from the Diocese whether the a/m from the Dept is to hand or not.\n\nBelieve me Sincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, September 26, 1911\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's communication of the 19th instant, and in reply to that portion in which Your Lordship deals with the appointment of a teacher for the Lower Fort Alexander School I may say that the Department is prepared to appoint Miss Fryer temporarily, her retention to be dependent upon the success with which she meets in the work. Her initial salary will be at the rate of $300.00 per annum.\n\nThe other matters referred to in Your Lordship's letter will be dealt with in other communications. I would state that it would be a great convenience to the Department if Your Lordship in communicating would deal with only one subject in each letter.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

I think the real reason is the difficulty of getting to the lower school, and this I fear would apply to any woman we could get in, and we cannot get a man really qualified to teach for less than $500.00 a year. If you think that J.H. would supply the need I should be glad if you would send in his name.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nBelieve me sincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files - 6028, File 125-18-1, part 1)\nOttawa, November 28, 1911.\n\nRev.

His Lordship the Bishop mentions a salary of $500.00 per annum. I may say that the Department will be prepared to pay this amount for a person with suitable qualifications. I shall be glad to be informed as to the result of your inquiry.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev.

We find him to be a good teacher, and although he may have faults, he is certainly one of our best young men. The Rev. Mr. Troyer thinks so and you know the Bishop nominated him and yourself appointed him temporarily last year.\n\nWe have tried to get other teachers, Mr. Troyer has too, and the Bishop wrote that he cannot send a teacher. We all think Jeremiah ought to be tried again.\n\nIf you have heard anything detrimental to Jeremiah's character it is from malice or not. I really do not care what word is used, there appears a little trouble came from child through a misunderstanding and that is all. Therefore may we hope you will use your influence for this appointment.\n\nYours faithfully,\nWm.

I am by no means sure she will take it, or taking it remain for any time.\n\nI do not know anything about Miss I., but your Inspector recommended her, and the Rev Thomas speaks well of her. She cannot be a proficient teacher for no girl will take a school at such a place as Fort Alexander on $300.00 a year, nor yet on $500.00, because she can easily get other and better schools in civilization.\n\nBelieve me Sincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\nDear Sir,\n\nMiss Dobister has resigned from the Lower Fort Alexander Day School. She gives no reason except that she is not able to carry on the work.\n\nI believe the chief reason is the difficulty of crossing the river, and the place where she can reside on the North side.\n\nI would strongly recommend Jeremiah Henderson for this school. The Rev. Mr. Fryer speaks well of him and thinks he would do well. The Inspector promised Mr. Fryer he would recommend him when Miss Dobister was appointed.

It is the opinion of the Councillors who are here that this or the Peguis school should be closed for the winter. It takes considerable wood to keep all the schools going during the winter and as it is charged against the funds they feel that they would like to retrench during the winter where possible. During the winter it is possible that, with the smaller number of children of school age now in the Parish, to make either Peguis or East St. Peter's school suffice for the accommodation of the children in that immediate locality. The river is frozen over. The Council prefer that the Peguis school be left open. Councillor Harper today offered to repair the Peguis school at his own expense if it were kept open. He owns the building. There are more smaller children close to it than the other school. We agreed, if the Department sanctioned it, that the Peguis school be left open for a while and if we found it too cold a building, move over to the other school building.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Can.\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\nOttawa, December 4th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the resignation of the teacher of the East St. Peter's school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the stand taken by yourself and the Indian Council, the Department considers that this school had better remain closed and the children of the section attend the Peguis school for a time at least, and you will be good enough to take the necessary action to have this carried into effect.\n\nThe Archbishop of St. Boniface has nominated Mr. J. A. Fitzgerald of Glandeboye as teacher of the Peguis school and he may take charge at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ. O. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nSir W.S.\n\nfor proposal to move\nbuilding to Mission lot\nWith reference to your letter 118271-5 of March 26th 1911, I beg to say that this matter of removing the Red School to a point at or near the Church of England Mission, a distance of about 2 miles, was before the Agent some weeks since, and I had supposed that the proposition had already been laid before the Department when I wrote my letter of the 24th March.\n\nMr Laronde's letter was a re-statement of the case to me as already laid before the Agent, hence my remark \"that I supposed the Department had already taken such action as their judgment would warrant\". The delay has placed the matter in a very difficult aspect, because the river will be broken up in a few days and I do not think it will be possible to move the building for the present owing to the overflow water and dangerous ice.\n\nI cannot see that at this date, it would be wise to undertake the work as it might not be satisfactorily accomplished, owing to the reasons given. In view of this, the matter had better be deferred until some more convenient time.\n\nOwing to the action of the Municipal Authorities, it does not seem proper at the present time to close Gilolo School.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOTTAWA, CANADA\n125-20-1 CLOSED\n\nFROM 28/11/09\n\nTO 14/11\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6029)\n\nFile 125-20-5, part 1\nClandeboye - St. Peter's East Protestant School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts - Administration. 1897-1902, 1911\n\nFile 125-20-9, part 1\nClandeboye - St. Peter's East Protestant School - School Land. 1920\n\nFile 125-21-1, part 1\nClandeboye - St. Peter's East Roman Catholic School - Administration - Teacher. 1895-1896, 1910\n\nFile 125-21-9, part 1\nClandeboye - St. Peter's East Roman Catholic School - School Land. no date\n\nFile 125-22-1, part 1\nClandeboye - St. Peter's North School - General Administration. 1896-1900, 1911-1925\n\nFile 125-22-9, part 1\nClandeboye - St. Peter's North School - School Land. 1917-1918, 1925-1926\n\nFile 125-23-1, part 1\nClandeboye - St. Peter's South School - General Administration. 1894-1913\n\nFile 125-23-9, part 1\nClandeboye - St. Peter's South School - School Land. no date\nNo. 125-20-5\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nClaudeboyte\n\nBuilding Supplies, etc.\n\nSt. Peter's East Prot.

J. Simmons,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n\nDear Mr. Simmons,\n\nI beg to present again the need of moving the Red School, E side, St. Peter's Reserve, from its present site to the St. Peter's Church lot.\n\nI have given the matter every consideration and I am convinced it would be the most convenient and would serve the highest interests. For should the school be moved according to our application, there would be three schools on the E side of the River almost equidistant from one another, and this speaks much, I believe, for the proposed location.\n\nAt present the Red School and the R.C. school are bunched in one place, and both are closed, and this shows that, at present, a school is unnecessary at this point, much less two. But should this part ever be settled, its educational needs could be met by the R.C. School.\n\nImmediately half mile south of the R.C. School.\nTo the St. Peter's Church, a distance of one mile, there are 21 church families, while south of the Church there are 7 church families in a distance of \u00bd or \u00be of a mile. There are thus 28 families in the distance of \u00bd or \u00be miles.\n\nIn the list of children submitted I gave the number as 49. As a matter of fact there are 53, as the children of Tom Prince and John Anderson are left out.\n\nI am ready, should this matter be approved, to submit the name of a first class and proper qualified teacher, who has had experience in Indian day schools, to the Department.\n\nWe are very anxious that you should take action in this matter as soon as possible, as the plan proposed will be a simple matter while the ice remains, but much more difficult to do in summer.\n\nTrusting that you will approve of the matter,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL. Laronde.\nSome time since, a letter was received from the Rev. Louis Laronde of St Peter's, asking that the unused \"Red School\" be removed to a site on or near the Mission lot of St Peter's.\n\nIt was claimed that this could be done very easily while the ice was still on the river, but could not be moved easily at a later date.\n\nThe Indians interested, agreed to move the building without expense to the Department except for a new foundation, which might cost $25. or $30.00.\n\nThis whole matter was referred to the Indian Agent and received my approval so far as it concerned this Inspectorate.\n\nThis morning I received a second letter from the Rev. Mr Laronde in regard to it, which I send enclosed in this letter for your information.\n\nTo my own mind the case is worthy one, but I presume that the Department has already taken such action as their judgment will warrant.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOTTAWA, CANADA\nOttawa, March 28, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant enclosing a communication from the Rev. L. Laronde in regard to the removal of the Red School from the East side of the St. Peter's reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to carry out this suggestion without further information. In your last report upon the situation on the St. Peter's reserve you recommended that the Department should only keep two schools in operation, one at Gilolo and one at the South end. I would ask you to state now whether it is proposed to close the Peguis school at Gilolo in case this school is removed to the position suggested and re-opened. It would avoid a great deal of confusion in the Department if the names by which these schools are known would be used by the Missionary in designating them. You state in your letter that you presume that the Department has already taken such action as their judgment would warrant. I may say that so far as the records show this proposition has not been before the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J.

This number shows that this district is more deserving of a school than any other in the whole Parish.\n\nThe nearest school for these children is the South St. Peter's. But its location on the West side of the River, renders it almost impossible for the children of the East side to attend it. In summer it is impossible for them to attend it, as the parents cannot remain at home to row their children across and back every day. In winter, I find that a few attend, though but irregularly, on account of distance. The majority do not attend even in winter, as the school is fully two miles away. Thus about \u00bc of these children attend school irregularly in winter, while \u00be do not attend school at all.\n\nOn behalf of the parents and children of this district I beg you to allow the people of this district to move the school to a new location.\nCentral for all their children. It is the unanimous wish of the people that the school be located on or near the St. Peter's Church lot, 212, which is high and dry, and easy of access. In return for the occasional use of the building for parish purposes we would be willing to lend the site to the Government for school purposes as long as it should be required, or the Government could secure, in exchange for the land on which the present school is situated, or otherwise, an acre of ground in the lot immediately adjoining the church lot and owned by Geo. Frank, of Selkirk.\n\nThe people concerned are willing to move the building to the new site without charge to the Government. The moving will not be difficult if done before the river breaks up. The Government would be asked to have a stone foundation put under the building in the new location. The moving of the building would be under the charge of Henry Geo. Prince, whose trade is to move buildings, and he guarantees to do the work without damage to the building.\n\nAfter careful enquiry I find that the number of children that will attend this school should it be moved, will be steady.\n\nI earnestly hope you will give this matter your careful consideration, and that you will give us a favorable reply soon, so that we can move the building while the ice remains.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nLouis Laronde\nIncumbent.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNO.\nALSO\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nMarch 27th 1911\n\nRe petition to move Red School.\n\nA few days ago Rev Louis Laronde handed me the enclosed petition, I intended sending it to you at once but held it a few days hoping to get Mr Laronde and the two councillors together and see if they were agreed as to the site, one of the councillors is sick and I have not been able to get them together and as the time is short if the school is to be moved this spring, am sending the petition without further delay. I am not acquainted with the district so cannot say much about the proposed site, but I spoke to Mr John Semmens (our Inspector) and he seemed to think the idea a good one, and spoke favorably of it. Please let me have a reply as soon as possible, in fact if you would wire me it might help matters along, as they are afraid if the school is not moved at once it cannot be moved this spring.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indians Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nOnt\nOttawa, April 3, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo with enclosure from the Rev.

PETERS INDIAN RESERVE SCHOOLS.\n\nST. PETERS SOUTH: Situate on River lot 52, west of river. School frame, in outward appearance the equal of the usual country school throughout the province. Building nearly new; value $800.00. An area of 1 63/100 acres left as grounds, running from main highway to rear of school. Building is well back from road and at rear of school lot. If school section established, might be sold to advantage.\n\nPEGUIS: Situate on River lot 86, west of river. Log building, poor repair. No land reserved. Good public school quite close. As lands are now patented to Indians if taxes are paid, or perhaps grant given the public school, this could be closed and all attend the public school.\n\nST. PETERS NORTH: Situate on River lot 140, east of river. In English Church chapel. No land reserved. Might be closed.\n\nST. PETERS EAST: Situate on River lot 170, east of river. Frame building, fair repair; value $300.00. One acre reserved for school. Might be eventually treated same as St. Peters South.\n\nST. PETERS EAST (R.C.) Situate on land used for mission purposes by Roman Catholic Mission on River lot 184. Building property of Church.\n\nMUCKLE CREEK: Situate on west boundary of reserve on Sec. 11, Tp. 15, R. 4, east. Frame building, value $400.00 one acre reserved for school. This school can probably be closed as Indians have nearly all sold their allotments. Arrangements might be made with settlers for sale of building when school section established.\n\nI think in the near future a day school should be located on Devil's Creek in Tp. 15, R. 5, east in\nthe Northeast portion of the reserve. There are\na number of families settled there who are not liable\nto sell out. If north St. Peters is closed, it\nmight be re-opened with advantage at this place.\n\nJ. A.

There is on this land an old building formerly used for school purposes and known as the East St Peters Indian Day school. This building is in poor state of repairs, the foundations are rotten and part of the shingles are off.\n\nMr James Cassford of St Peters is offering the sum of $100.00 for the land and old building.\n\nIf the Departments intends to dispose of this land and building I would recommend that offers be secured for same.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, June 1, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th ultimo, in which you ask to be informed as to whether the Department owns the one acre of land comprising the school lot formerly used in connection with the St. Peter's East Indian Day School. This school lot is located on lot No. 170 on the east side of Red River, not Lot 107, as stated by you.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as the Department has no further use for this land for school purposes, it would be prepared to consider an offer for the disposal of the same.

Before receiving her notice of transfer she proceeded as usual to re-open the school at Fort Alexander after the holidays, but the resident missionary there, who had complained of her management, refused to give her the key of the school house and consequently she could not get into the school to teach. Under the circumstances I consider that she is entitled to payment for the full quarter, as it was no fault of hers that she required\nrequired number of days was not taught.

The list was not sent at the time of the receipt of the Returns, and has been received from Agent Steele today.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Affairs\n\nThe Deputy of the\nSuperintendent\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that Rev. Mr. J.G. Anderson of West Selkirk has recommended that the present North St. Peter's School be closed and that the school work be transferred to a point a mile and a half north of the present site and on the other side of the Red River, where the use of the Church of England Chapel is offered for school purposes, free of charge. In view of the fact that the population at the point where the school now is is composed principally of non-treaty half-breeds, whilst at the proposed new site (Trindal), the settlement is almost entirely Indian and the district well populated, and as there is another school situated within a very short distance of the one which it is proposed to transfer, as shown in plan attached, which can accommodate the children of both banks of the river, and also in view of the fact that the Trindal district has been somewhat neglected in the matter of educational facilities, and as further the proposed change would result in having two good schools instead of two poor ones, I have decided to avail myself of the offer of the Rev. gentleman, and instructions have been given to effect the removal to Trindal at an early date. The Indians have passed on the matter in Council and have pronounced in favour of the change. The $275.00 appropriated\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nfor repairs to the present school house will thus be saved and may, I assume, be used elsewhere. Regarding this I am submitting a separate proposition.\n\nThe expenses in connection with removing the North St. Peter's School will not amount to more than the cost of one or two wagon trips for 1\u00bd miles, and ferry charges.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nCommissioner\nOttawa, 6th June, 1898.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 126/103 of the 14th ultimo, informing the Department that the Rev. J. G. Anderson, of West Selkirk, has recommended that the present North St. Peter's School be closed, and that the school work be transferred to Trindal, a point a mile and a half north of the present site and on the other side of the Red River where the use of the Church of England chapel is offered for school purposes free of charge; and that in view of the reasons stated in your letter you have decided to avail yourself of the reverend gentleman's offer, and that accordingly instructions have been given to effect the removal to Trindal at an early date.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that from the plan enclosed and the explanations contained in your letter the proposed removal of the North St. Peter's school to Trindal appears highly advisable; and it is noted that you intend submitting a separate proposition in respect to the sum of $275 appropriated for repairs to the present school-house which will not be required.\n\nIt is presumed that in making a proposition\n\nA. H. Forget, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg,\nManitoba.\nin regard to the expenditure of the $275 you will at the same time suggest what use can be made of this building if it is the property of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, No. 118, re the closing of the present North St. Peter's School and transferring the school work to Trindal, and to say that the present building will be used as a storehouse for destitute supplies. In regard to the unexpended $275.00 available for repairs on this building, I have requested the Department to authorize the expenditure of same in connection with the erection of the new school house of Rossville in the Beren's River Agency, less a small amount which will probably be required in the Clansboye Agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\nCommissioner\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nHon. James A. Smart\nDeputy Minister of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Smart,\n\nYou will remember that some time ago we had a conversation regarding Indian schools at St. Peters Reserve. I would now like to get your advice before recommending those interested in the matter what official action to take. I find on enquiry that there are three Indian schools in the neighborhood of St. Peters, two of them on the opposite side of the river and practically inaccessible, the third one not at all convenient. Not one of these schools is doing good work and the attendance is very small. The Indian population at St. Peters is practically unschooled. It appears that the Indians themselves on the Reserve would like a new school established in a convenient center under the direct control of your department. They do not wish a school under the Manitoba Act for that would bring them into touch with the municipality, and this they wish to avoid. I believe they have a great fear of municipal interference and therefore they wish a school carried on under your direction. They think of\nWinnipeg,\n\npresenting a petition to you asking for a school in the heart of the Reserve. I believe that this wish is practically unanimous. Would you advise those particularly interested in this movement to go ahead with their petition? If not, what steps should they take. The children are now growing up in ignorance and it is felt that a school would be patronized if it were in charge of a competent teacher, and it is believed that a competent teacher could be secured.\n\nHoping to hear from you at your convenience,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.A. McIntyre.\nOttawa, August 15th, 1900.\n\nMy dear Mr. McIntyre,\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant with reference to the establishment of a day school on the St. Peters Reserve, to be controlled by the Department, which school can be under an efficient teacher and in reply I beg to say that this matter will be given consideration and you will be advised later on.\n\nI may say that I am not sure what the effect of such action would be in view of the fact that there are now, as you state, three schools in the immediate vicinity. It seems to be that if it is a fact that the schools are inefficient and incapable of doing good work as the teachers are not qualified, that the Department can very easily undertake to provide a competent teacher and I do not think I would hesitate in going that far. However this step could not be taken until an inspection was made by a competent person. I will write you later on with regard to the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. A. McIntyre, Esq.,\nProvincial Normal School,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, August 16th, 1900.\n\nPlease see copy of my reply to Mr. McIntyre's letter and let me know if there is any instance where such a course as he suggests has ever been adopted by the Department. I presume of course that there would be no money to build a new school and the suggestion would imply that the Department would have to provide for the teacher.\n\nDeputy Supt-General.\nOTTAWA, 20th August, 1900.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nIn reply to the enquiry made by the Deputy Minister in regard to the suggestion made by Mr. W.A. McIntyre of the Provincial Normal school, Winnipeg, for the establishment of a convenient central school on the St Peters Reserve to take the place of the four schools now in operation there, the undersigned begs to say that three of the schools in question are under the auspices of the Church of England while the fourth school is conducted by the Roman Catholics. An amalgamation of two schools under different denominations was tried at Cornwall Island and though still in operation, has not been a success as it has only been attended by children of one denomination.\n\nFour schools are more than are required for the number of children of school age shown to be on the reserve. Mr. McColl, in his report on these schools which was made in June last gives the number which should attend each school as follows:\n\n- East St Peter's R.C. ---- 15, average 7\n- North \" \" C.E. ---- 26 \" 11\n- South \" \" ---- 22 \" 7\n\nThere are, in addition to this number, 78 Protestant children at the Rupert's Land school and 11 Roman Catholics at the St Boniface school, making a total of 196 children of school age belonging to the reserve.\nMr. McColl's last census return gives the total number of children of school age on the reserve as 250,- 210 Anglicans, 34 Roman Catholics, and 6 Baptists, which shows a difference of 54 between his tabular statement and his school reports.\n\nI see two formidable drawbacks to the establishment of a central school, one being the religious difficulty and the other the scattered settlement of the reserve, which follows the river front about eight miles. Nearly half the children would have to cross the river and many of them would have to travel over four miles to reach a school situated at a central point. It would require a considerable amount of money to put up a suitable schoolhouse if it were decided to erect one, and as St Peter's Band has no money to speak of, funds would have to be voted for the purpose. I think the Department is now paying too much for the results obtained from this reserve but this is owing to the heavy drain made on the day school pupils by the Rupert's Land school.\n\nSome years ago the South St Peters day school had an enrollment of about 50 pupils, with an average attendance of over 35.\n\nThe small average attendance at our Indian schools is, in most cases, due to the lack of interest and ability in the teachers, and I think that if the schools are carried on as they now are, the attention of the Roman Catholic and Church of England authorities should be called to this matter.\n\nIt is not quite clear to me from Mr. Mc-Intyre's letter whether he suggests the amalgamation of all the schools into a central one, or the establishment of a central in addition to the four now in operation. If the latter construction is taken, I have\nno hesitation in saying that there is no need of an additional school.\n\nMartin Brossard\nOttawa, August 28th, 1900.\n\nI think it would be well to write to the Church of England authorities in connection with educational matters at St. Peters Reserve, stating that it is absolutely necessary for competent teachers to be placed in these schools. It is reported to the Department that the teachers on this Reserve are incapable of giving a proper education to the children and that there is a great lack of interest through the inability of the teachers to manage the schools. If this is true, it is absolutely necessary that some steps should be taken to appoint properly qualified teachers, and I would suggest that no teacher be appointed unless holding a Second or Third Class certificate and having had a thorough Normal School training. If these requirements are not met the Department will certainly have to undertake to provide proper educational facilities for the children on this reserve.\n\nAnother fact to be borne in mind in connection with St. Peters Reserve is that it is situated practically\npractically in civilisation, and is surrounded by settlers whose children have the advantage of good common school education, under the laws of the Province.\n\nDeputy Supt-General.\nOTTAWA, 5th September, 1900.\n\nSir,\n\nIt having been reported to the Department that the schools on the St Peter's Reserve are not as successful as they should be, it is thought that it would be well for you to write to the Church of England authorities in connection with educational matters on that reserve, informing them that it is absolutely necessary for competent teachers to be placed in their schools. The teachers are said to be incapable of giving the proper education to the children under their charge, and there is a consequent lack of interest owing to their inability to manage the schools. If this is true, properly qualified teachers will have to be appointed, holding at least professional second or third class certificates. If these requirements are not met, the Department will certainly have to provide proper educational facilities for the children on this reserve.\n\nThe same remarks apply to the Roman Catholic school.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg,\nMan.\n\nJ.

This would only leave a balance of $10.00 to be paid by you and if you are short of funds to meet this balance the Department will advance you this amount on your salary for the current quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nPeter Harper, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nNorth St. Peter's School,\nGatineau, Man.\nOn the 26th inst., I recommended a friend of mine, to write a petition to the Indian Department for me, and to forward a receipt that I received from the dentist of Winnipeg.

He has no professional qualifications. His present salary is at the rate of $600.00 per annum which was increased to that amount from April 1st, 1920. Previous to that time he received salary at the rate of $400.00. He also receives the bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum. There is an enrolment of 13 children, with an average attendance of 5. There are only 15 children of school age on that part of the reserve. Mr. Harper is an Indian and, from what information there is on file, is not very progressive.\n\nI consider that the salary and bonus he now receives compares favourably with the amount paid to teachers having his qualifications, but is much below that allowed qualified teachers. I should be pleased to be informed as to whether an increase will be granted him, or not, and, if so, the amount.\n\n[Signature]\n\nI would not recommend any increase.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, September 2, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo enclosing a copy of a communication which you received from Peter Harper, teacher of the St. Peters North Indian Day School, requesting an increase in salary.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Harper at present receives a salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum, together with the bonus at the rate of $150.00, or a combined salary and bonus of $650.00.

PETER'S NORTH School, June 12, 1923.\n\nGeneral Remarks.\n\nThere are, as far as I am able to judge, two causes for the backwardness of the children in this school: (1) The indifference of the parents, which is the cause of the irregular attendance. (2) The poor qualifications of the teacher.\n\nMr. Harper is conscientious and tries his best, but he is not qualified, either in an academic or in a professional way. I do not think that he can make the work interesting enough to make the children anxious to go to school. I think that Mr. Harper, apart from what I have said above, is a good faithful worker but he could not be accepted in a public school.\n\nA. Willows,\nInsp.\n\nThe report shows clearly that Mr. Harper is not qualified to teach school although he is doing his best. It seems to me that the Department should take steps to put a qualified teacher here. There is no necessity to use the Provincial Compulsory Act, as we have provision in our own act to take care of a situation such as Mr. Willows mentions.\n\nYou will note what he says regarding the building. But it will not be advisable to spend more money on a building until we are satisfied with the progress of the school itself. The first thing to do is to get a good teacher and then the Department, I feel sure, will be glad to put up a decent school building.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\nOttawa, July 3rd, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his inspection of the St. Peter's North Indian Day School, makes the following remarks regarding the services of the teacher and the progress being made by the pupils:\n\n\"There are, as far as I am able to judge, two causes for the backwardness of the children in this school:\u2014\n(1) The indiffidence of the parents, which is the cause of the irregular attendance. (2) The poor qualifications of the teacher.\n\nMr. Harper is conscientious and tries his best, but he is not qualified, either in an academic or in a professional way. I do not think that he can make the work interesting enough to make the children anxious to go to school. I think that Mr. Harper, apart from what I have said above, is a good faithful worker but he could not be accepted in a public school.\"\n\nI shall be pleased to have your views as to whether you would recommend that the services of Mr. Harper be dispensed with or not. As you are aware, he has been in the employ of this Department as teacher of the above school for a long period. The Inspector's report shows clearly that Mr. Harper is not qualified to teach, although he appears to have done his best. It would appear that the services of a qualified teacher should be secured for this school, but, before taking any action, we desire to have your opinion in the matter. Your early reply will oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. O. Latulippe, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No.125-22-1 of the 3rd instant, in regard to the services of the teacher and progress of the pupils of the North St. Peters Indian Day School, I beg to say that although Mr. Peter Harper is conscientious and tries his best he is not qualified to teach, for the benefit of the children and better attendance I would recommend that a qualified teacher be appointed for this school.\n\nIt appears that the Anglican Church authorities have difficulties in securing the services of a teacher for the Hollow Water River Indian Day School as shown the last two years, when they obtained a student for only three months in each year. Permit me to suggest that Mr. Harper be appointed teacher for this school; the Indians of this Reserve are more anxious to send their children to school. I believe that he would be suitable for the present at least and anticipate better success than at St. Peters.\n\nMr. Harper has intimated that he would accept the position. Hoping that this report will be satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nH.O. Patuleppe\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 17th, 1923.\n\nVery Rev. Sir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report to the Department on his inspection of the St. Peter's North Indian Day School, makes the following remarks regarding the services of Mr. Peter Harper, the teacher, and the progress being made by the pupils:\n\n\"There are, as far as I am able to judge, two causes for the backwardness of the children in this school: (1) The indifference of the parents, which is the cause of the irregular attendance. (2) The poor qualifications of the teacher.\n\nMr. Harper is conscientious and tries his best, but he is not qualified, either in an academic or in a professional way. I do not think that he can make the work interesting enough to make the children anxious to go to school. I think that Mr. Harper, apart from what I have said above, is a good faithful worker but he could not be accepted in a public school.\"\n\nIn view of the Inspector's report, it is considered that it would be in the best interests of the Indian children to obtain the services of a qualified teacher.\n\nMr. Agent Latulippe, Selkirk, Man., has suggested that Mr. Harper be transferred to the Hollow Water River Indian Day School, to begin duties when the teacher that has been engaged for the summer months gives up the work. It is considered that Mr. Harper would be satisfactory at Hollow Water River, and he has expressed his willingness to accept the transfer. This change, if carried out, should prove beneficial to the children at the Hollow Water River school. The Indians at this point appear to be more anxious to send their children to school, and there would be a better attendance there than Mr. Harper has been able to maintain at the St. Peter's North school. We are anxious to obtain a qualified teacher at the St. Peter's North school, and if you are satisfied that Mr. Harper's services would be satisfactory for Hollow Water River, he could be transferred to that point and take up duties about the 15th of September next. In any event, we consider that a change in teachers should be made at the St. Peter's North school, and I shall be pleased if you will endeavour to secure a qualified teacher in time to begin duties when the school re-opens after the present summer holidays. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher secured should be forwarded for the approval of the Department.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your views regarding the transfer of Mr. Harper to Hollow Water River, or the matter of dispensing with his services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nVen.

We have informed the Archdeacon that we desire the services of a qualified teacher for the St. Peter's North Indian Day School. As soon as we hear from him as to whether he concurs in the transfer of Mr. Harper, and the appointment of a qualified teacher to succeed him, you will be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

We believe that he will serve your Department faithfully, and will be able to impart some rudimentary knowledge to the scholars at Hollow Water River. He is a fervent Churchman and can be safely used for spiritual work if required.\n\nWith regard to his successor, we will select as good a man as we are able, and will forward all particulars for your information and approval. In the meantime it will be of great assistance to us to know the amount of salary you are willing to pay.\n\nI am,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nArchdeacon.\nOttawa, July 28th, 1923.\n\nVery Rev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, regarding the proposed transfer of Mr. Peter Harper, teacher of the St. Peter's North Indian Day School, to the Hollow Water River Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say we note that you are entirely in favour of this transfer, and we shall be pleased if you will arrange for Mr. Harper to proceed to Hollow Water River and take up duties when the present teacher, Mr. A. H. Davis, gives up duties.\n\nMr. Harper is at present in receipt of salary at the rate of $500 per annum. We will grant him an increase of $100 on his removal to Hollow Water River, which will make his salary, from the date he begins duties at this school, at the rate of $600 per annum, which will be supplemented by any bonus provided by law.\n\nWe hope that Mr. Harper will meet with every success in his work at Hollow Water River. We are quite aware as to his faithfulness and devotion to duty, and, although he has limitations as a teacher, his transfer to Hollow Water River may, it is hoped, be in the best interests of all concerned. We have informed our Agent, Mr. H. O. Latulippe, Selkirk, Man., of approval being granted by yourself and the Department for the transfer of Mr. Harper.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will obtain a successor to Mr. Harper at the North St. Peter's School, and inform the Department as to the name, qualifications and experience of the person secured. The amount of salary allowed will depend upon the qualifications which the person secured possesses, and we will be prepared to make a substantial increase in salary over that allowed Mr. Harper if a fully qualified teacher is obtained for the St. Peter's North School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Archdeacon Thomas has approved of this change being made. The Archdeacon states that he will endeavour to select a good teacher to succeed Mr. Harper at the North St. Peter's School.\n\nAs you are aware, Mr. A. H. Davis is teaching at the Hollow Water River School during the summer months. As soon as he gives up duties, Mr. Harper could arrange to move to Hollow Water River and take charge of the school at that point.

He is a man of first class education and holds a Fellowship in the Royal Geographical Society of London England.\n\nHe is a married man and has recently been engaged in Immigration work, but now offers himself for school work for the period of one year.

The teacher informed me that the non-treaty pupils do not interfere with the regular classroom instructions of the Indian children.\n\nThere is no grant paid to this school by the district for the tuition of the non-treaty children. The public school inspector, Mr. A. Willows, suggested that the Department make arrangements with the Provincial Dept. of Education for a tuition grant to be paid for the non-treaty pupils attending. If this is granted, will the tuition be payable to the Department or the teacher?\n\nHoping that this report will be satisfactory,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nMarch 18th, 1924\nOttawa, March 24, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, in which you inform the Department that six desks have been provided for the non-treaty children who are attending the St. Peter's North Indian Day School.

Your Mr. Inspector A. Willows is acquainted with the situation. Will it be possible to conduct this school as a combined white and Indian activity or would you consider allowing this Department a grant for the tuition of the white children who are attending?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDept. of Education,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, May 8, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 7th ultimo, which has been forwarded by the Department of the Interior. I have noted your proposal that the wards of this Department who are attending the St. Peter's North Indian Day School receive their education at the Patapum Public School. If this scheme is feasible it would, no doubt, effect an economy for this Department and I am writing to Mr. Indian Agent Latulippe, of Selkirk, Man., for his recommendation. I note that the building at the Patapum School can be moved one mile to a better position at a cost of not more than $600 and that your Department is willing to share the initial and current expenses, if the activity is carried on as a joint Indian and public school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nDr. R. Fletcher,\nDeputy Minister,\nDept. of Education,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, May 8, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nThis Department is corresponding with the Manitoba Department of Education, with a view to conducting a joint Indian and public school for the children of the St. Peter's North and the Patapum Public Schools. You will remember that you drew this question to our attention in your letter of March 19th, last. I have now to inform you that Dr. R. Fletcher, Deputy Minister of Education, Winnipeg, has proposed that the Patapum school building be moved one mile north and that it be conducted for both Indian and white children.\n\nPlease inform me without delay if this building is better suited for a combined school than is the building in use at St. Peter's North. Further, you should intimate whether or not a site a mile north of the present Patapum school would be suitable located for the regular attendance of the Indian children who have been attending the St. Peter's North School.\n\nDr. Fletcher proposes that this Department share in the expenses (estimated $600) of moving the Patapum School and in the current expenses in the future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. O. Latulippe, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter NO.125-22-1.of the 8th instant, I beg to state that the Patapun school building is in good condition and a very superior class of building to the one at present used in North St.Peters for a school and would recommend that it be moved North.\n\nI think that it should be moved at least two miles or there about as it would then be more central for children attending.\n\nAt this time of year it would be an expensive job to move this building and I would suggest that it be moved in winter as soon as the ice is strong enough on the river to hold it, as it would much easier and at considerable less expense.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, May 20, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer further to your letter of the 7th ultimo, relative to the proposed combined Public and Indian Day School to take the place of the Patapum Public and St. Peter's North Indian Schools. Mr. Indian Agent Latulippe, of Selkirk, Man., states that the arrangement would be a satisfactory one from the standpoint of this Department, provided that the Patapum school building is moved at least two miles north of the present site. You will remember that your suggestion was a property a mile north of where it is now situated. I should be pleased if you would inform me if the site proposed by the Indian Agent would be suitable for the white children who are to attend.\n\nMr. Latulippe recommends that, if the building is to be moved, it be done in the winter on the river's ice. He believes that considerable saving would be effected if his suggestion is carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. R.

Wetton, who has held the position of Teacher of the North St Peter's Indian Day School for the past year, has asked permission to delay the opening of the said school until October the 1st.\n\nDuring the present holiday season he is holding a temporary position with the Department of Immigration and Colonization, and this position will not terminate until the end of September.\n\nHe has done a very successful work in North St Peter's Day School, and rather than disturb the present arrangement we recommend that leave be granted to extend the holiday season until the 1st of Oct.\n\nIf this does not meet with your approval then we may be compelled to nominate a successor for the position.\n\nI am,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nArchdeacon\n524 Spence Street\nWinnipeg, Man.\nAugust 11th 1924.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA - ONT.\n\nSir,\n\nOn November, 1923, I was appointed as Teacher to the N. St. Peter's (Selkirk) Indian School - Man., at a salary of $800 per annum (including board).\n\nDuring the whole period of eight months that I have been teaching at this school, I have been unable to secure proper accommodation for my wife & myself in the school district, as there is no school house, board or residence being only obtained at a farmhouse on the bank west side of the Red River, and which affords me practically no privacy. My wife who has been under the doctor's care during the past few months (two weeks ago our first child was born) and has been compelled to live alone in rooms in Winnipeg, whilst I was at N. St. Peter's. I could therefore only see her during week-ends (returning to N. St. Peter's on Sunday evenings) and vacation time. With the\narrival of spring I tried to secure better accommodation for my wife & myself in the school vicinity, but unsuccessfully.\n\nDuring this period (Nov-June 1923-24) the rent for the two places has cost me approximately $144.57, and travelling expenses to visit my wife in Winnipeg has also cost me approximately $50.00.\n\nI would therefore appreciate very much the favourable consideration of the Dept. for Indian Affairs of this matter with a possible view of some refund to me of these expenses which I have unfortunately been compelled to incur owing to lack of school house accommodation for my wife & myself in the school vicinity.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThos.

In the light of your explanation, the Department concurs and Mr. Indian Agent Latulippe is being advised.\n\nI have also your letter of the 20th instant, enclosing a communication from the teacher with reference to the expenses, due to lack of residence facilities at the St. Peter's North Indian Day School. As you are aware, this Department has corresponded with Dr. Fletcher, relative to the advisability of amalgamating this activity with the Patapum School District. I am not prepared to give favourable consideration to the provision of a teacher's residence at the present time. You may inform Mr. Wetton that the Department understands his difficulty and, to assist him, his salary for the coming academic year, commencing October first, will be at the rate of $850 for the 9 teaching months, plus any bonus provided by law.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Although I understood that my temporary Immigration duties were to terminate at the end of September, I was informed at the end of August that owing to a slight error having been made regarding the date of the termination of these duties, my temporary engagement is until October 15th instead of September 30th, as previously advised.\n\nUpon my communicating the matter to Mr. H.O. LaTulippe, the Indian Agent at Selkirk, he advised me to personally apply to your Department for a further extension up to October 15th.\n\nAs I am a Returned Overseas Officer, and have a wife and child to support, I could not afford to remain idle during my Vacation and therefore was very glad to avail myself of the temporary work in the Immigration Department.\n\nUnder those circumstances I trust that you will be able to grant me the further extension required.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nOttawa, October 7th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 1st instant, I beg to inform you that the Department will approve of a further extension of time being granted for the re-opening of the St. Peter's North Indian Day School until the 15th instant instead of the 1st instant as previously advised. We hope that you will be ready to resume duties as teacher immediately after the 15th instant. Salary can only be allowed from the date on which you resume duties.

Mr. Wetton informs the Department that he will be ready to resume duties on that date. Salary will be allowed Mr. Wetton from the date on which he resumes duties. I shall be pleased if you will inform the Department at a later date as to the exact date on which he takes up work at the above school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. O. Latulippe, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nDecember 1, 1924.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nI discussed the amalgamation of the St. Peter's North Indian and the Patapun white Day Schools with Dr. Fletcher, Deputy Minister of Education for Manitoba, Public School Inspector Willows and Archdeacon Thomas. The St. Peter's North Indian school building is in poor shape and it is approximately 5 miles north of the Patapun school. If the Patapun school were moved two miles north, the majority of Indian children would be nearly 3 miles away. This would mean that the Indian children would have to be drawn to school. Mr. Wetten, the present teacher, who is doing especially good work, says that the most central point for the Indians would be the ferry, which is somewhat south of the present site. It is possible that Inspector Willows might agree to the ferry situation if the Patapun school were moved and a joint school conducted.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell F.

As the building at St. Peter's North is in unsatisfactory condition, this Department has either to arrange for an amalgamation or to build. I am informed that a site for the proposed joint school, satisfactory to the Indian children, would be at the Ferry and that the Patapun School building would have to be moved, if not that far north, at least 2\u00bd miles, before it would be suitable for our wards. I wish to remind you that there are at present enrolled in the St. Peter's North Indian Day School 14 non-treaty children; and that, even if certain children living south of the present site of the Patapun School would be unable to attend, there are a sufficient number of children of school age, who are not wards of the Department of Indian Affairs, to warrant your Department giving serious consideration to the placing of your building 2\u00bd or 3 miles north of its present location.\n\nThis Department is prepared to bear one-half the cost of moving the building and would contribute a like share of the current expenses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I am enclosing, for your information and for your criticism, a copy of a letter which I am directing to the Manitoba Department of Education. If the arrangement proposed by this Department is not satisfactory, I should be pleased to have a report from you.

None of the Indian children would have to drive to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nH.O. Patapun\nIndian Agent\nJ.D. MacLean\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSince our last correspondence concerning the possibility of amalgamating the Patapun School with the North St. Peter's Indian School, a number of families have located in the district within one mile of the present school building. This alters the whole situation and makes it necessary for us to re-open the school on its present site.\n\nI am informed that there will be some half dozen or more Indian treaty children attending the school as soon as it is opened. I shall be glad to know what your Department will contribute towards the education of these children. I think you are making a grant of $20.00 per head for similar cases at Moose Lake.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. Fletcher\nDeputy Minister of Education.\nOttawa, April 6, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that it has been decided not to amalgamate the St. Peter's North Indian Day School and the Patapum Public School. Dr. Fletcher, of the Manitoba Department of Education, informs me that there has been an increase in the number of children in the vicinity of the Patapum School and that it is their intention to re-open it. The Department of Indian Affairs will allow a grant of $20 per child per academic year for any Indian children who attend this white school.\n\nI wish to ascertain from you if there will be a sufficient number of Indian children to warrant our building a new school at St. Peter's North. Your report for the month of January, last, indicates that the building is not worth repairing. We shall ask the Provincial authorities to give us a grant for the white children who attend the St. Peter's North School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

If Indian children attend, we will allow $20 per child per academic year, based on the actual attendance.\n\nThere is a sufficient number of children in the vicinity of the St. Peter's North Indian Day School to warrant continuing the activity and this Department may arrange for an appropriation for a new building. There are several children attending who are not wards of the Indian Department. Should you not give us a grant for their schooling?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Letulig, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nSir,\n\nAs unexpectedly, I have been offered, and have accepted, a better position, in the Department of Immigration and Colonization, and am entering at once upon these new duties, I therefore desire to hand in my immediate resignation as Teacher of the North St. Peter's Indian Day School, near Peguis (Selkirk) Manitoba.\n\nWhile I fully realize that up to the present I have been the Teacher of this school, and that you would have preferred some longer notice of my resignation, yet, under the circumstances, I trust you will therefore accept this my hurried resignation, instead of receiving the usual two weeks' notice thereof.\n\nSince I have been in charge of this school, I have endeavoured to give satisfaction in my work, but I have found the conditions there very difficult, owing to:\n\n(a) There being no proper accommodation for a Teacher;\n(b) There being no proper accommodation there for my wife & child;\n(c) The double expense incurred in keeping a home in Winnipeg for my wife and child, and my own boarding at North St. Peter's, together with the travelling expenses of my week-end visits to Winnipeg.\n\n(d) The people residing in the vicinity of the school are mostly Indians, and Indian Half-Breeds, and hitherto the only accommodations could obtain with white people, within reasonable distance from the school, were very unsatisfactory in many ways.\n\nUnder these conditions I have been finding it almost impossible to live, even economically, within my school district.\n\nThe school also is in a very bad condition, quite unsuited for both the health and comfort of the attending pupils, and I had hoped that a better building would have been substituted for the present one 'ere this. Throughout I have endeavoured to do my best for the pupils, and I feel assured that they have progressed under my tuition educationally, and have shown an interest in their school work, but the various adverse conditions under which I have had to labour, has of late been a discouragement to me.\n\nI gladly take this opportunity, however, of expressing my very deep appreciation of the kindness and sympathetic consideration that the Indian Agent, Mr. H.O. Latulippe, has throughout shown towards me and my school work. He has done much to help and encourage me in my work and I feel deeply indebted to him for his personal interest and readiness at all times to cooperate with his advice and practical help.\n\nI feel sure that you will understand my position and that I felt unable to refuse this opportunity of bettering myself and conditions.\nany by this change of being better enabled to establish a home with my wife and child under more congenial conditions, and in view of these circumstances you will be prepared to accept my immediate resignation.\n\nI have already personally notified the Archbishop of the Diocese of Rupert's Land, and Mr. H.O. Latulippe of my resignation, and have handed over the school and school equipment to Mr. H.O. Latulippe. I am also sending him my school report (to date) to be forwarded by him on to you.\n\nPlease accept my apologies for giving such a short notice.\n\nThanking you for all your kindness and consideration towards me during the period of my Teachership at the North St. Peter's School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLieut., F.R.G.S., F.R.C.I.\nOttawa, May 11, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, tendering your resignation as teacher of the North St. Peter's Indian Day School, to take immediate effect.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your resignation is accepted. It is regretted, however, that you were not able to complete the present school year. We note that you have informed Mr. Agent Latulippe and the Archbishop of the Diocese of Rupert's Land of your resignation, also that you have handed to the former your school reports to date. As soon as these reports are received, payment of any balance of salary due you will be made up to the date of giving up your duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nThos. O. Wotton Esq.,\n524 Spence St.,\nWinnipeg,\nMan.\nOttawa, May 11, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nA communication has been received from Thos. G. Watson, teacher of the North St. Peter's Indian Day School, in which he tenders his resignation, to take immediate effect. He states that he has notified you and handed you his returns to the date of his giving up duties. Please forward these returns at an early date, in order that payment of the balance of salary due him can be made.\n\nAs the church authorities will not likely nominate a teacher for the balance of the present academic year, this school may remain closed until after the summer holidays. Please inform the Department as to whether you would advise that the school be continued in operation the next school year. It will be necessary to request the church authorities to nominate a suitable teacher if the work is to be continued.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. O. Batteaupe, Hq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant NO. 125-22-1 I beg to say that Mr. Thos. G. Wetton sent me a copy of his resignation as teacher of the North St. Peters Indian Day School and his returns were received at this office while I was away to Fort Alexander Reserve and which I inclose herewith.\n\nWith regard to the North St. Peters Indian Day School, I beg to report that as St. Peters is not now an Indian Reserve, in my opinion I don't think that the Department should go to the expenses of putting up a new building there; it would also mean that a teacher's residence would have to be built as there is no proper place for teacher to stay where the school is now. There is a school district at Peguis, 1\u00bd mile across the river, where the children could attend, there may be a few days in fall and spring when they could not cross the river, but otherwise they could easily cross in boats. There is another white school now opened, South of present school called Patapun three miles on the same side of the river, where children near there could attend.\n\nWe only have 10 or 12 treaty children at present attending school at North St. Peters and as the Department is prepared to pay for the Indian children's tuition attending White Schools I consider that it would be more economical and to the children's advantage to attend the above named schools.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, May 27, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, in which you recommend that the St. Peter's North Indian Day School be closed indefinitely. I note that there are two white schools situated close to the Indian families that are still resident in this locality and that the ten or twelve treaty children could attend there if the Department provided a tuition grant. I am writing to His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land, explaining that the Department considers it advisable to close our school and asking him to concur. In the meantime, you should take no steps to continue the activity and should make arrangements to safeguard the Department's equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. O. Latulippe, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nOttawa, May 28, 1925.\n\nMost Reverend Sir:\n\nThe Department has given serious consideration to the question of continuing the St. Peter's North Indian Day School. I am informed that the present building is beyond repair, and, if our school is to be continued, considerable capital expense will be necessary.\n\nThere are but ten or twelve treaty children in this neighbourhood, which is no longer an Indian reserve, and there are two rural schools in the vicinity, which, I understand, would accept our wards if a tuition grant is paid.\n\nMr. Wetten, the present teacher, resigned on the 4th instant - his resignation to take effect immediately, and in the meantime the school is closed. Before even considering a building programme or a re-opening of the school, I wish to have Your Grace's recommendation. I might point out that Indian work in this locality will, in all probability, diminish from year to year; and at the present time it is my opinion that we would be well advised to pay tuition grants for our wards, so that they will be able to attend the white schools.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMost Rev. S. P. Matheson, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nBishop's Court,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Mr. McLean:\n\nI hope you will pardon the delay in replying to yours of May 26th regarding the North St. Peter's Indian Day School. I held the view that in as much as it was probably only a matter of time when all the Indians of St. Peter's would be moved to the Peguis Reserve it would not be prudent to go to the expense of erecting a new school. However, as I have not been in touch with the north end of the Reserve for some time past I had to consult with those who are more familiar with the situation as it now exists. I may state that when the former teacher left so suddenly he called upon me and appeared to be very strong in the opinion that the two schools should be continued, and that a new building should be erected. I am enclosing letters from the Missionary in charge and also from the Provincial Inspector of Schools. From them you will judge as to what is best to be done under the circumstances. In view of the very heavy expenses to which your Department is committed with reference to Indian Schools generally I confess that I thought that this additional expense might be avoided but it would appear that conditions demand the retention of the school. I am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nA. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, June 26, 1925.\n\nMost Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Grace's letter of the 22nd instant, with enclosures, with reference to the St. Peter's North Indian Day School. I note that children who have attended this school in the past cannot be accommodated at either the Patapum or Peguis Public Schools and that a building to replace the Indian school is urgently required.\n\nI wish to assure Your Grace that the Department has given sympathetic consideration to this problem; but, whereas this locality is no longer an Indian reserve, children for which we are responsible will, no doubt, decrease in numbers from year to year. On the other hand, as the vicinity becomes settled by whites, there will be an ever increasing number of white children.\n\nI believe that it is not incumbent upon this Department to incur capital expenditure at St. Peter's North. If a local school district is formed and is assisted by the Provincial Department of Education, we would be pleased to pay a grant for any treaty Indian children that attend. In the meantime, the Indian children should be recruited for Indian residential schools. I am writing to Mr. Indian Agent Latulippe, asking him to discuss with Indian parents of this district the advisability of sending their children to Elkhorn for an education.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMost Rev. S. P. Matheson, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nBishop's Court,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, June 29, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe building which has been used at the St. Peter's North Indian Day School is beyond repair, and, as this locality is no longer an Indian reserve, the Department has decided not to make replacement. There are but few treaty children residing near this school and the numbers will decrease from year to year. The Department intends to place the children of our wards in Indian residential schools.\n\nThis letter is directed to you, in view of the arrangements made whereby non-treaty children could attend this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. Fletcher, L.L.D.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDept. of Education,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, June 29, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has decided not to rebuild at the St. Peter's North Indian Bay School. As you are aware, this locality is no longer an Indian reserve and the children for which we are responsible will decrease in numbers from year to year. Please make a report concerning the advisability of placing the physically fit Indian children who have attended this school, in the Elkhorn Indian Residential School.\n\nYou should also make an inventory of the classroom and other equipment that is of any value. This inventory should show the condition of the desks and articles listed. Make arrangements for the safeguarding of this property until such time as you receive further instructions in relation thereto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Ass't Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. O. Latulippe, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nJune 29th, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. MacKenzie:\n\nI thank you for yours of June 26th #125-22-1 in reply to my letter to Mr. McLean. The position which your Department takes in regard to that North Dynevor School appears to me to be an eminently reasonable one. I hope that the agent will succeed in persuading the Indians to fall in with it. Please return the letters which I enclosed in mine.\n\nI am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, July 6, 1925.\n\nMost Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Grace's letter of the 29th ultimo and am pleased that you consider the Department's proposal with reference to the Indian children at St. Peter's North a reasonable one. I am returning the letters which accompanied your earlier communication. I regret that these were filed in such a manner that Your Grace's pencil notation was overlooked.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMost Rev. S. P.

PETERS INDIAN RESERVE SCHOOLS.\n\nST. PETERS SOUTH: Situate off River lot 32, west of river. School frame, in outward appearance the equal of the usual country school throughout the province. Building nearly new; value $500.00. An area of 1 1/4 acres left as grounds, running from main highway to rear of school. Building is well back from road and at rear of school lot. If school section established, might be sold to advantage.\n\nPEGUIS: Situate on river lot 86, west of river. Log building, poor repair. No land reserved. Good public school quite close. As lands are now patented to Indians if taxes are paid, or perhaps grant given to the public school, this could be closed and all attend the public school.\n\nST. PETERS NORTH: Situate on river lot 140, east of river. An English Church chapel. No land reserved. Might be closed.\n\nST. PETERS EAST: Situate on river lot 170, east of river. Frame building, fair repair; value $200.00. One acre reserved for school. Might be eventually treated same as St. Peters South.\n\nST. PETERS EAST (R.C.) Situate on land used for mission purposes by Roman Catholic Mission on river lot 184. Building property of Church.\n\nMUGGLE CREEK: Situate on west boundary of reserve on Sec. 11, Tp. 15, R. 4, east. Frame building, value $400.00. One acre reserved for school. This school can probably be closed as Indians have nearly all sold their allotments. Arrangements might be made with settlers for sale of buildings when school section established.\n\nI think in the near future a day school should be located on Devil's Creek in Tp. 16, R. 5, East in the northeast portion of the reserve. There are a number\nof families settled there who were not liable to sell out. If North St. Peters is closed, it might be re-opened with advantage at this place.\n\nJ. K. McLean.\n\n(Plans Attached)\nSir,\n\nI understand that the Department is the owner of a small piece of land on lot 32 St Peters. There is an old school house on this property, which was used as a smallpox quarantine at the time of the smallpox epidemic. This building is gradually going to wreck and ruin. I do not know the amount of land owned by the Department as a school site on lot 32, but quite a lot of the property is taken up by a ravine which runs through it. Mr. R. Clemons has requested me to submit to the Department the following offer for the above mentioned property. He will pay the Department Two hundred Dollars cash for same, and the money could be paid over just as soon as the transfer could be made out. I think that is a very good offer, for if things go on as they are there will not be much of the building left before long. An early reply will greatly oblige.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\nClandeboye Agency\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, 13th December 1917.\n\nMemorandum\n\nDeputy Minister,-\n\nMr. Colcleugh, Indian Agent at Selkirk, Man., states that Mr. Clemons submits an offer of $200.00 for the South St. Peter's school house and lot and that it is a fair price. The lot is situated in the northerly portion of lot 32 of the St. Peter's Parish adjacent to the great highway and contains 1.73 acres. The building is a frame structure and cannot be considered valuable; in fact is depreciating rapidly. I agree with Mr. Colcleugh that the price offered is reasonable although it might bring more if offered by tender. I would suggest that we put this lot, with the building, up for sale by tender.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.W.

We note that no religious services had been held in this old building during the past two years or more.\n\nRelative to the site on which this building was located, the Department can find no record from the survey notice of Lot No. 135 or from the sale of this Lot to John Ryland of any building used for school purposes being located thereon. From the surveyor's notice it is stated that the St. Peter's North School was situated on River Lot No. 140, east of the river, and that no land was reserved for school purposes when this lot was disposed of. The Rev. W. Tinney, in his letter, a copy of which was forwarded to you under cover of official letter of June 30th, stated that there were a number of long seats and a pulpit in the old building which were supplied by the church authorities, also a bell. If these had not been removed before the building was taken down they should be placed at the disposal of the church authorities. We are unable from the record on our files to ascertain that the church authorities contributed any amount towards the cost of the erection or maintenance of this building. The proceeds of the sale, viz., $30, have been deposited to the credit of Casual Revenue.\n\nPlease interview the Rev. Mr. Tinney and advise him of the contents of this letter. He may be in a position to advise whether the church authorities expended any amount in erecting the building or towards the cost of its maintenance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

In regard to the overcrowding of the school building, I am obliged to say that in view of the overcrowding, it appears to be caused by the attendance of more than half the children whose parents should be informed that they will have to provide school accommodation elsewhere.\n\nThe Department take pleasure in sending Mr. Muckle a supply of the new form of\nof the Report respecting Schools in which to make his report on the reports forwarded by you to Mr. Johnston.

J. Morgan, dealing with Indian schools on St. Peter's Reserve. In conclusion he states: \"There has been no teacher in any of the schools on the reserve for some time,\" etc. As one who is on the spot and knows all about the reserve schools I feel compelled to say the above statement is entirely untrue, as the following facts will undoubtedly show. First, two of the schools, the Church of England school and the Roman Catholic school have been running all the time. Secondly, two of the schools opened their doors again for the months of January and February, and the third opened its doors on March 3, and the third and last one opened its doors on March 9th. The schools in the reserve were therefore running at full swing on March 9, and yet the above statement was made by A. J. Morgan on March 11. Kindly publish this statement so that everyone believes that \"Truth is great and will prevail.\"\n\nJOHN G.

Miss Isbister put her application into Mr. Laronde but he has failed to give us any particulars of her age or her standing, qualifications. I know her and she is probably about 20 years old. She has a common school education. It is a heavy school and should have a qualified experienced teacher but as the grant is so small and there is no other source from which they draw salary we will have to be content with those who have just such qualifications as Miss Isbister has.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo advising the Department that Miss Overton, teacher of the North St. Peter's school, has resigned.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this school has been in charge of Mr. Harper for some years and presumably you refer to the South St. Peter's school. At neither of these schools, however, is the attendance very high, and in fact the attendance in the past would not justify the employment of high salaried teachers. The policy of the Department at the present time is to pay more liberal salaries to competent qualified teachers and the authorities of the Church of England have been advised on more than one occasion of this fact. If your letter, therefore, has reference to the South St. Peter's school the temporary appointment of Miss Isbister is approved and her retention in the position will be dependent upon the success with which she meets.\n\nYou will be good enough to report regularly upon these and other schools on the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF.W.R. Colclough, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of Jan. 31st No. 117570-1 I beg to say that Feb. 21st, I visited the South St. Peters School. I found the attendance very small, only one Treaty child and three non-Treaty. This is caused by the majority of the Treaty children attending the Municipal School in St. Clements which is situated about one mile from the South School. The South St. Peters School is situated in the Parish of St. Andrews and therefore the children from this Parish have no right to attend the St. Clements School which is situated about a mile below the South School, but across the River which is the dividing line between the two Parishes. I have had a talk with the Rev. Mr. La-ronde the Sec.-Treas. of the Municipal School in St. Clements, and they would not object to the Treaty children attending this School, if the Department could give them a grant of about $300.00 per year, to help pay the running expenses. I think that the Treaty children would be much better attending this School as they would then be taught by a Teacher holding a certificate. There are about forty children of school age in the District in which the South School is situated. This School is in a good condition, I have had the doors locked and nailed up since it was closed, and I think that it would be a good idea to also have the windows boarded up, for if they are not, they will soon be smashed. If the Department approves of this suggestion, kindly let me know and I will have the work done immediately.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, Ontario, March 17, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant in reference to the attendance of Indian children from the South St. Peter's section at the school in the parish of St. Clement's.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is prepared to pay a reasonable fee for the tuition of these children at one or other of the white schools, but before deciding would like to know why they do not attend the school in the parish in which they are situated, viz., St. Andrew's. Presumably it is because they are nearer to the school in the parish of St. Clement's, although your letter does not make this point clear.\n\nIt is noted that the Secretary Treasurer of the St. Clement's school has suggested the payment of a lump sum towards the maintenance of this school. This is, however, the method usually followed by the Department in dealing with cases of this kind. It is considered preferable to allow an annual per capita amount based on the average attendance. It is noted that there are a large number\n\nP. W. R. Goldsborough, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nof Indian children who would attend this school and you may make the proposition to the School Board to pay $1.00 per month on the average attendance and if satisfactory, obtain their acceptance in writing; payments can then commence from the first of next month, to be made quarterly upon the receipt of the usual returns certified by the teacher and yourself.\n\nIf all the children of the South St. Peter's section were to attend the school in St. Clement's it would make quite a tax on the teacher. It might be that some of them could attend the school in the parish in which they are situated and, if so, the Department would be willing to pay on the same terms. Kindly report with reference to this.\n\nYou may have the windows of the South St. Peter's School building boarded up, as suggested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

The former has suffered some from the establishment on the west side of the river nearly opposite of a Baptist Day School. It will be remembered that a year ago I tried to move this school to where the most children could be found, viz on the west side of the river near Harpers but we have now been forestalled in this by the establishment of a denominational school as above.\n\nMuckles Creek is a weak school always but owing to removals especially so this year. It has become a question whether it is wise to continue paying a teacher at this point. There are more non-treaty children than others and it might not be amiss to think of handing this work over to the provincial authorities.\nEx't.\n\nOTTAWA, 26th April, 1905\n\nSir,\n\nI have to call your attention to the following remark made by Rev. Mr. Sommese in his semi-annual report on the Clandeboye Agency in regard to educational matters there:\n\n\"The attendance at day schools has somewhat improved this year except at St Peters North and Muckle's Creek schools. The former has suffered some from the establishment on the west side of the river nearly opposite of a Baptist day school. It will be remembered that a year ago I tried to move this school to where more children could be found viz.-on the west side of the river near Harper's but we have now been foiled in this by the establishment of a denominational school as above.\n\n\"Muckle's Creek is a weak school always but owing to removals especially so this year. It has become a question whether it is wise to continue paying a teacher at this point. There are more non-treaty children than others and it might not be amiss to think of handing over this work to the Provincial authorities.\"\n\nThe Department would like to have your report on these statements, and especially in regard to the Muckle's Creek school.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nHon. David Laird,\nSecretary\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, March 16, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Inspector Serrano's report on the Huckle's Creek day school, and with reference to the school being closed for more than three weeks previous to the inspection the Department would like to know if you could suggest any way by which or compelled these Indians could be induced to furnish the fuel necessary for the school. It cannot be kept open unless the building is heated properly, and it is apparently not the teacher's fault that the wood is not supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant re the Huckle's Creek Day School, and to say that on receipt of Mr. Inspector Semmens' report I wrote to Mr. Indian Agent Lewis asking him to see that the next quarterly returns only show the actual number of days the school was open, so that the payment of the grant be made only for that period, or as the Department may see fit.\n\nAs to the fuel supply, this is a somewhat difficult matter. At other parts of the reserve the Indians deal in wood and are given permits to cut with the understanding that the schools are to be well provided in respect of fuel or be closed. Not so at Huckle's Creek, and there are no incentives to offer or punishment to exercise, if the Indians refuse to give a hand. All that can be done that I see is either the withholding of the grant or rely on the exertions of the resident Agent who may persuade the Indians from time to time to help themselves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 3, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ult. with reference to the fuel supply for the Huckle's Creek day school, and in reply I beg to say that the Department would like you to communicate with the Agent and ask him to endeavour to persuade the Indians to supply the necessary fire-wood.\n\nIf he cannot prevail upon them to do so, the Department will have to consider the question of closing the school.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\n\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, December 4th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nThe return from the Muckle's Creek school for the September quarter shows an attendance of only 32. This very small number does not warrant the Department in keeping this school open after the end of the current quarter, and you will be good enough to notify Miss Fitzgerald that her services will not be required after the 30th instant.\n\nThe Department would be glad to have suggestions from you at your earliest convenience as to any arrangement that might be made temporarily for the education of the very few children who are now resident on this portion of the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ.

D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. V. R. Coleclough, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 16th inst., I beg to say that the North St Peters or Trudeau School was closed by orders of Dr O.I. Grain and Dr J.R. Steep and has been closed ever since the 15th day of December 1914. I have asked the Doctors about the opening of this School, but they have refused to allow me to do so, and they say that the School should remain closed until after the Summer holidays.\n\nIn regards to the Patapan School, this School has been closed since Good Friday. I have seen the Secretary Treasurer of the Municipality of St Clements, where this School is situated, and he informs me that the School will be opened again, just as soon as the St Peters Reserve question is settled. This School is a Municipal School and one over which we have no jurisdiction.\n\nIn regards to the South St Peters School, I beg to refer you to a report you have or will receive from Inspector J.R. Bunn. My reason for doing this is because Mr. Bunn has all the correspondence in regards to the closing of this School. I do not think that it would be advisable to open the South St Peters School, as we used this building as a pest house during the smallpox outbreak, and if it were opened again, I think it would be an inducement to keep some of the Indians hanging around the old St Peters Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOFFICE OF\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES\nLAKE WINNIPEG INSPECTORATE\n\nWINNIPEG, MAN., 28th April 1915.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter number 233875/1 dated 16th April 1915, also an enclosure, the same being a copy of a letter signed by John Flett and William McCorrister, in reference to the education of the children on St Peter's Indian reserve.\n\nIn this connection I beg to submit the following report. The \"Trindle\" or North St Peter's school, before Harper teacher, was closed on the 18th of December 1914; this was done by the direction of the doctor, and on account of the prevalence of an epidemic of smallpox existing in St Peter's at that time, it was feared that the assembling of children would be dangerous, and be a possible means of spreading the epidemic. The school has remained closed since the date given above; when the end of the quarter ending March 31st 1915, was drawing near, I was asked if the school could be opened. I referred the request to the doctor, he intimated it was not advisable, and still more or less dangerous to open the school, as he was not sure that the epidemic of smallpox was completely stamped out; the school is still closed, at the time of writing, and the doctor will keep it closed a little longer, to insure safety from the smallpox, which was in the vicinity of this school.\n\nThe south St Peter's Indian Day school, was closed on the 28th Feb'y 1913, at this time the teacher was resigning, it was found that the number of children attending had fallen to the low quarterly average of 1 Treaty child and 2 non-treaty children, out\nof reputed school population of over 40, and I find that Mr Agent Coleleigh, in reply to departmental letter number 117570-1 dated Jan'y 31st 1913, reported that the cause of this low rate of attendance was because the majority of these children were attending the Municipal school in St Clements, and I also find that the trustees of this municipal school entered into an arrangement to afford tuition to Indian children, on the terms of departmental letter 117570-1 dated the 17th March 1913, and that this arrangement has been in operation, with satisfaction, but that this municipal school was also closed, from the latter part of December 1914 until the latter part of Jan'y 1915, on account of the smallpox epidemic; it was opened and continued up to the end of March inst., and was then closed on account of some financial complication that the Municipality felt would not permit them to operate the school for the present, as soon as this complication can be adjusted, the school will operate.\n\nFrom the foregoing, I think that the claim that is made by John Flett and William McCorristar, that they are suffering a great hardship with reference to the educational privileges for their children, is not well founded. I have met these men, and I have pointed out to them that the closing of the schools under the present conditions, and the conditions that have existed since the beginning of December 1914, on account of the smallpox epidemic, during that period, could not have been avoided, that the doctor was doing this as a protection to the people, and to prevent the spread of this terrible disease, and that the department would not interfere with the directions of the doctor in this very important matter. I also pointed out to them that, until this epidemic started, ample arrangements for the education of their children existed, and that the department was defraying the cost in connection with these arrangements, so that the department was providing the educational privileges they were entitled to, when there was no cause, such as the epidemic, to prevent operation of the schools, arranged for, to do this work.\nI asked these men who had written this letter for them, and why they did not bring this matter to the notice of their Agent, who could have clearly explained this matter to them, they would not give me the name of the author, this action on their part gives me the impression that they were prompted to do this, not so much on account of the so stated hardship, but as an indirect complaint re land titles in the old reserve.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, May 22, 1915.\n\nSir,-\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 7th of April, last, in which you complained that the children of your band were suffering great hardship from the fact that there was no school in operation on the whole of the St. Peter's Reserve I beg to say that, as you were informed, the Department has made inquiries into this matter and has learned that the North St. Peter's School is closed by doctor's orders on account of an epidemic of smallpox and the South St. Peter's was closed for want of attendance, as nearly all the Indian children in that neighbourhood were attending the municipal school at St. Clements.\n\nHad you communicated with Mr. Agent Colclough you would have received all the information necessary. In future you will be good enough to address your communications to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAVY\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. John Piatt,\nSt. Peter's Indian Reserve,\nBox 321,\nSelkirk, Man.\nOttawa, May 22, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo giving the reasons for the closing of the North St. Peter's, Patapun and South St. Peter's schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. John Flatt is being informed of the reasons for closing these schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n7th April, 1924\n\nR\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nre Patapun School District\n\nThe school in the above district has been closed for some two years owing to the lack of resident ratapuners with children to attend the school. Recent new families have settled in the northern part of the district and their children are attending the North District School. Recently our Inspector, Mr. Smith, visited the school and interviewed with Mr. D. Smith, the Indian Agent at Belcourt concerning the amalgamation of Patapun and the North District Schools. He stated that by moving the present school used in the North District and site North the building could be made to serve both communities. The attendance would be that of the students and at present twelve of these would be public school children.\n\nI am writing to ask if your Department will be willing to share on an equal basis in the expense of moving the school to a new site and placing it on a foundation there ready for use and in operating it as a normal school for the children from the district and those from the Reserve. The Inspector estimates the cost of moving the building and placing it in condition for use at not more than Six Hundred Dollars, including the site.\nIt would appear to be an economy for your Department and for certain School Districts under this Department to put these two groups into one school which could be an efficient public school.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you in the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. Fletcher\nDeputy Minister of Education.\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\nCANADA\n\nLAND PATENTS BRANCH\n\nOTTAWA, 29th April, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nEnclosed is a letter dated the 7th instant from Mr. R. Fletcher, Deputy Minister of Education, Winnipeg, regarding the school building in the Patapun School District. It is quite apparent that this letter was intended for your Department and accordingly it is referred to you for attention.\n\nI may say that Mr. Fletcher is today being advised that his communication is being forwarded to your Department for consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[N. O. Cot\u00e9]\nController.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, May 8, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 7th ultimo, which has been forwarded by the Department of the Interior. I have noted your proposal that the wards of this Department who are attending the St. Peter's North Indian Day School receive their education at the Ratapun Public School. If this scheme is feasible it would, no doubt, effect an economy for this Department and I am writing to Mr. Indian Agent Zeddyman, of Selkirk, Man., for his recommendation. I note that the building at the latter school can be moved one mile to a central position at a cost of not more than $600 and that your Department is willing to share the initial and current expenses, if the activity is carried on as a joint Indian and public school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. Mclean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nDr. R. Fletcher,\nDeputy Minister,\nDept. of Education,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, May 8, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nThis Department is corresponding with the Manitoba Department of Education, with a view to conducting a joint Indian and public school for the children of the St. Peter's North and the Patapum Public Schools. You will remember that you drew this question to our attention in your letter of March 16th. I have now to inform you that Dr. R. Fletcher, Deputy Minister of Education, Winnipeg, has proposed that the Patapum school building be moved one mile north and that it be conducted for both Indian and white children.\n\nPlease inform me without delay if this building is better suited for a combined school than is the building in use at St. Peter's North. Further, you should intimate whether or not a site a mile north of the present Patapum School would be suitably located for the regular attendance of the Indian children who have been attending the St. Peter's North School.\n\nDr. Fletcher proposes that this Department share in the expense (estimated $600) of moving the Patapum School and in the current expenses in the future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nO. Latulippe, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nRegina, Sask., Sept. 4, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham -\n\nOn my last trip to Manitoba I visited the Clandeboye agency at Selkirk, and, in company with the agent, drove down to the school along the river on the old St. Peter's reserve, and also visited Brokenhead Reserve.\n\nWhile at the agent's office Mr. Matulippe showed me a letter from the Department, dated last May, in connection with the amalgamation of the Indian school on the old St. Peter's reserve and a white school which is situated three or four miles further up the river. It appears that this white school has been closed for something over a year and the Department of Education in the Province of Manitoba has made a proposal to our government to amalgamate the two schools for the purpose of keeping down expenses, as it appears that the white settlers are unable to finance the salary of a teacher. Our school on the reserve is an old log building and not worth very much, whereas the white school is a good frame building on a cement foundation and is in good shape, with the exception that it needs painting.\n\nIf this arrangement was gone into the white school would have to be moved down the river about two miles. It would be an easy matter to move it in the winter time on the ice as it stands right near the bank of the river and a level place can be found just below the school where it can be got down onto the ice and there is a good building site a couple of miles below where it would be an easy matter to move it off the river on to the site.\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nRegina, Sask., Sept. 10, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the Clansboye Agency which was visited by Mr. Inspector Christianson a short time ago.\n\nI would draw your attention to what the Inspector says regarding the correspondence which you have had with Indian agent Matulippe on the question of amalgamating our Indian School with the white school in the district. In discussing this matter with the Inspector he tells me that unless the white school is moved two miles nearer to where the Indians reside an amalgamation would be of no consequence whatever. This may not have been a matter that you wished to discuss with my office, but the Inspector being on the ground and the latter being brought to his attention, I believe that perhaps it is in order for me to write on the subject.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nDecember 1, 1924.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nI discussed the amalgamation of the St. Peter's North Indian and the Patapun White Day Schools with Dr. Fletcher, Deputy Minister of Education for Manitoba, Public School Inspector Willows and Archdeacon Thomas. The St. Peter's North Indian school building is in poor shape and it is approximately 5 miles north of the Patapun school. If the Patapun school were moved two miles north, the majority of Indian children would be nearly 3 miles away. This would mean that the Indian children would have to be drawn to school. Mr. Setton, the present teacher, who is doing especially good work, says that the most central point for the Indians would be the ferry, which is somewhat south of the present site. It is possible that Inspector Willows might agree to the ferry situation if the Patapun school were moved and a joint school conducted.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM R. FLETCHER, DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION FOR MANITOBA, dated March 27, 1925.\n\nOriginal on 125-22-1.\n\nI am informed that there will be some half dozen or more Indian treaty children attending the school as soon as it is opened. I shall be glad to know what your Department will contribute towards the education of these children. I think you are making a grant of $20.00 per head for similar cases at Moose Lake.\nOttawa, April 6, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, in which you intimate that your Department intends to re-open the Patapun School. If Indian children attend, we will allow $30 per child per academic year, based on the actual attendance.\n\nThere is a sufficient number of children in the vicinity of the St. Peter's North Indian Day School to warrant continuing the activity and this Department may arrange for an appropriation for a new building. There are several children attending who are not wards of the Indian Department. Should you not give us a grant for their schooling?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

No. 1636.\nYour Department has been paying fees for the Indian children attending the school but now we are paid for the last school year, so no account was sent to you.\nIf there are forms on which to make out this account I would be glad to have some and information as to who paid etc.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.E. Delisle\nOfficial Trustee\nPatapum S.D.\nOttawa, December 5, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, relative to the payment of tuition fees for the Indian children attending the Patapum S.D. No. 1636.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will allow $20 per child per academic year based on the average attendance as shown by returns which should be prepared by the teacher and forwarded through the office of Mr. G. A. Stevenson, Indian Agent, Selkirk, Man. I may say that the last payment to this school was for the quarter ended June 30, 1927. If any Indian children have been in attendance since that time, the Department will allow grant at the above rate upon receipt of returns of attendance which should contain the names of the bona fide Indian children only. A supply of return forms for the purpose is enclosed herewith.\n\nIn forwarding the returns, it should be definitely stated the name of the secretary treasurer of the school board or other official to whom cheques in payment of the grant due should be sent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. E. S. Dunlop, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\n107 Baby St.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, December 5, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from the Official Trustee, Patapun S.D. No. 1636, requesting a tuition grant for the Indian children who attend. In this connection, I beg to enclose for your information copy of a communication which we are today forwarding to him.\n\nWhen the returns mentioned therein are received by you, you should check them over carefully and see that only the names of wards of this Department are included. You should then certify the returns and send them to the Department in order that payment of the tuition grant due can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. A. Stevenson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nThe Secretary  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa, Ontario  \n\nDear Sir,\n\nOur attention has been called to the overcrowding in Peguis and Patapam schools, one on the East side and the other on the West side of the Red River at Pymewy. It is found that a number of the children attending these schools are Indian children and that there are also four Indian children in a small group not attending any school. It has been suggested that a new building near Pymewy Hospital can be rented and an extra classroom opened, which would relieve the crowding in the other schools and also provide for a considerable number of children not now attending. The figures before me indicate that there are thirteen Indian children, wards of the Indian Department, involved. Under the circumstances it occurs to us that your Department might be prepared to join with us in opening the extra classroom. I shall be glad to hear from you in the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nK. Fletcher  \nDeputy Minister of Education.\nOttawa, October 23, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from the Deputy Minister of Education for the Province of Manitoba, a copy of which is enclosed, in which he draws attention to overcrowding in the Peguis and Patapum White Schools. In this connection you will note his suggestion, to have an extra classroom opened in a building which can be rented, near Dynavor Hospital, in order to relieve the crowding in the other schools and provide for the education of both the white and Indian children. He requests that this Department join with the Provincial Department of Education in opening the extra classroom. You will note, further, that he states there are 13 Indian children, wards of the Department, involved.\n\nAt the present time, we provide a tuition grant for Indian children attending the Patapum Public School. The last grant was paid for the quarter ending June 30th, last. The return received for that quarter showed an attendance of 12 boys and 3 girls - the average attendance being 8.55 pupils. Besides the above, we have supplied Gilbert Harper, No. 1098, St. Peter's Band, with a book for his children attending the Matlock School, in the municipality of St. Andrews, and Francis Sinclair, No. 901, St. Peters Band, with books for his daughter who is attending Selkirk Public School. During the past school year, the Department also supplied books for the daughter of Joseph Prince, No. 1023, St. Peters, attending Selkirk Public School, and for the daughter of Andrew Sinclair, No. 901, St. Peters Band. It appears that the assistance mentioned above is all we are providing, outside our own Indian schools, for the\n\n- Indian children\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nIndian children of the St. Peters Band.\n\nI would request that you take up with the Deputy Minister his suggestion regarding the providing of extra classroom accommodation and ascertain what proportion of the expenses, i.e., for teachers' salary and the other current school expenses, this Department would be called upon to provide. Please state, also, whether you would recommend that we assist towards the expenses. You should furnish as complete information as possible. I may add that our Appropriation this year is so limited that, if any assistance is provided, the funds will have to be voted in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, October 23, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, drawing attention to the overcrowding in the Peguis and Patapum Schools, attended by Indian children, and suggesting that this Department join with you in opening an extra classroom in a building which can be rented, near Dynevor Hospital.\n\nIn this connection I have to inform you that Mr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies, is being requested to take the matter up with you and to furnish a report concerning the cost involved and what portion thereof would be a charge against this Department. When full information is received, favourable consideration will be given to the carrying out of your suggestion for the providing of increased school facilities for our wards.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nDr. Robert Fletcher, B.A., LL.D.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDept. of Education,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter dated October 23rd, No. 125-26-1, I wish to state that Dr. Fletcher, Deputy Minister of Education, is not yet in possession of the figures regarding the cost of opening the new classroom near Dynevor Hospital. He was not aware that the Department had been paying fees to either the Patapun or Peguis School, and suggested that I secure from the Department a statement of the money paid in fees during the school year of 1932-33.\n\nWhen the Department furnish this information I will again get in communication with Dr. Fletcher who will no doubt by that time have the figures in connection with the operating cost of the extra classroom and will be prepared to submit a proposition.\n\nI might just add that at present there are 18 children enrolled, and from information gathered from Dr. Fletcher, there are 5 or 6 other Indian children of school age. This would give a total enrolment of 24.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G.

With reference to your enquiry as to the amount of fees paid for the tuition of Indian children during the school year 1932-33, I have to say that the following statement will show the amounts paid each quarter, to J. E. S. Dunlop, Trustee of the Patapun School District, 107 Ruby St., Winnipeg, Man.:\n\n| Average Attendance | Amount Paid |\n|--------------------|-------------|\n| December Quarter, 1932 | - 10.06 $60.36 |\n| March Quarter, 1933   | - 10.02 60.12 |\n| June Quarter, 1933    | - 8.55 51.30 |\n\nI may add that the fees allowed are at the rate of $20.00 per capita per annum - 10 teaching months - based on the average attendance.\n\nBesides the above fees, we have, as stated in official letter to you of the 23rd ultimo, paid accounts for books supplied to several Indian children attending white schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The aggregate attendance on the enclosed return is only 651.\n\nAs we have received no return for the quarter ended March 31, it is possible that this return was intended to cover both the March and June quarters.

Bradbury, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nOffice of the\n\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES,\nLake Winnipeg and Kenora Inspectorate.\n\nWINNIPEG, Man., Jan. 6th, 1911.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir,\n\nAt a Council of the Indians held at Fort Alexander, Indian Reserve, December 23rd, 1910, the following requests are made; which I hereby transmit for the consideration of the Department.\n\n1. The Protestant Indians request that a Boarding School be built at the upper end of the Reserve to replace the two Day Schools now in operation. The argument used by the Indians is that they move around so much that it is impossible for them to send their children to the Day School to any degree of regularity. They further argue that the Protestants should have equal privilege with the Roman Catholics of the neighborhood.\n\n2. The Band ask that a yoke of oxen be furnished by the Department to the Indians of this Reserve.\n\n3. It is stated that the Agent promised one hundred dollars to build a bridge across the creek known as \"The Francois Bruyer Creek\" on the East side of the river. It is four years since this promise is said to have been made and so far as known no authority has been issued and it is much needed.\n\n4. Four years ago a ditch was surveyed by Dominion Land Surveyor of Blanchard and it was expected that work on the said ditch would be commenced forthwith, but nothing has been\ndone. The Council now asks that this work be completed in order to drain the large swamp behind the Reserve as the waters of the swamp are causing the banks to give way and slide into the river. A further reason is that the swamp might be made a hay ground if properly drained and at present there is very little hay ground available.\n\n5. The Indians further ask that permits be issued to them to cut five hundred cords of green wood so as to give them employment because the dry wood has become exhausted.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n1. With reference to the request of the Indians for a Boarding school, I feel confident that the Department will not entertain it when there is a Government school so near at hand, so I find it difficult to endorse their claim. At the same time I recognize the fairness of the request.\n\n2. I am prepared to recommend that a yoke of oxen be given to the Band.\n\n3. The bridge asked for is much needed and will cost $100.00 and I recommend that permission be granted to proceed with this work.\n\n4. Mr. Blanchard's report must decide whether this bridge is necessary or not, but in my judgment it is much needed.\n\n5. I also recommend that permission be granted the Agent to issue permits for five hundred cords of wood as requested.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nJohn Sommerville\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nJ.S./H.\nOttawa, January 17, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report of the 6th instant, and in reply to that portion in which you deal with the request of the Protestant Indians of the Fort Alexander reserve for the erection of a boarding school I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to grant this request. You will be good enough to inform the Indians accordingly and advise them that the Department will expect them to send their children regularly to the day schools when conditions will permit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Simmons,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSelkirk, February 14th,\n\nEXTRACT.\n\nOn January 24th and 25th I visited Fort Alexander Reserve, and beg to report as follows:\n\nOn 25th held Council meeting in school.\n\nThe Chief among other things mentioned a subject which I believe has already been placed before the Department viz. The establishment of a boarding school for the children of Protestant parents in this band. I promised that the matter would be brought to the attention of the Department, but held out no hope of the request being granted at present. There are two Protestant Day Schools on this reserve, the one on the south of the river was open had a fair attendance and the children seem to be making good head way. The other school I expect will be opened next week as the teacher, Miss E. Isbister, left Selkirk this morning for Fort Alexander.\n\nIn connection with boarding school, Councillor John Henderson said that if they could not have a boarding school the present school should be repaired, as it needed new shingles and an extra ply of boards on the walls as it was very cold. At the time of my visit the roof was covered with snow and I could not judge as to the condition of the shingles. On my next visit the snow will be gone and I will be able to see the shingles also the foundation and will report as to the repairs I believe necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) John Watson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 23, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report on the schools on the Fort Alexander Reserve and with reference to the establishment of a boarding school for the Protestant Indians I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to give consideration to this matter at the present time.\n\nYou refer to the need for repairs to the present school and the Department will await details as to these repairs at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Watson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\n125-28-1 CLOSED\n\nFROM 10/2/09\n\nTO 23/2/12\nFile 125-24-1, part 1  \nClandeboye - Muckle's Creek School - General Administration. 1901-1909\n\nFile 125-24-5, part 1  \nClandeboye - Muckle's Creek School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1898-1909, 1920\n\nFile 125-24-9, part 1  \nClandeboye - Muckle's Creek School - School Land. 1920\n\nFile 125-26-1, part 1  \nClandeboye - Patapun (Public) School - St. Peter's Reserve - General Administration. 1913-1915, 1924-1938\n\nFile 125-26-3, part 1  \nClandeboye - St. Peter's Reserve - Patapun (Public) School - Payments of Grant. 1934-1948\n\nFile 125-28-1, part 1  \nClandeboye - Fort Alexander Protestant Boarding School - General Administration. 1909-1912\n\nFile 126-13-1, part 1  \nManitowapah - Lower Fairford School - General Administration. 1904, 1911-1916\n\nFile 126-14-1, part 1  \nManitowapah - Upper Fairford School - General Administration. 1907-1916\nNo. 126-13-1\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nMANITOWAPAH\n\nGeneral Correspondence\nLower Fairford School\nEXTRACT from Mr Inspector Marlatt's report on the Mantowapah Agency, dated 23rd Feb. 1904. Original on file 164027-26\n\nFairford, Little Saskatchewan and Lake St Martin.\n\nAt Lower Fairford, on the north side of the river, the Rev'd Mr Clark, Baptist Missionary, has opened a day school with an attendance of about 15 pupils. This action is mildly resented by the Anglican section, but so far as I can see no harm is likely to come of it. It has not affected the attendance at our own school which is almost directly opposite on the south side of the river; in fact I think it has had the effect of stimulating our teacher to greater effort. Parents on the north side do not care to trust their children on the river as the ice is very treacherous. Mr Clarke's school solves this difficulty.\n\nIndian Commissioner's note on above paragraph:\n\nThis school taught by Mr Clarke receives no aid from the Government.\n\nD.L.\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nOTTAWA, 8th March, 1904\n\nSir,\n\nMr Inspector Marlatt in his report on the Nani-\ntowapah Agency mentions that the Baptist Missionary\nhas opened a day school at Lower Baird on the\nnorth side of the river. The Department would like\nto know who gave Rev Mr Clark authority to open a\nschool on this reserve and all other particulars in\nconnection with its establishment.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nHon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.:\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant re the opening of a day school under the Baptist Church auspices on the Lower Fairford Reserve, on the North side of the river, and would say that I am not aware of any authority having been ever given in this connection. The Baptists have located a mission on this reserve at least twelve years ago and there has been no clash between them and the Church of England that I am aware of, and I therefore did not feel like interfering. The establishment of a school is of more recent date, but, as the Inspector says, it seems to have a stimulating effect, and I have not thought it advisable to interfere. No grant is given or asked for, and the Baptists would even seem to object to Government support. I shall be pleased to take my future action according to the wishes of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 5th April, 1904:\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith reference to the establishment of a day school at Lower Fairfield by the Baptists, the Commissioner reports that he is not aware of any authority having been given to this end. The Baptists have had a mission on the reserve for some years and have apparently worked in harmony with the Church of England, the only other religious denomination carrying on work on the reserve and the Commissioner states that he did not think it advisable to interfere when they established the school.\n\nWhile this particular case does not call for the interference of the Department, it seems to me that it should not be ignored and the least a religious denomination could do is to ask for permission before establishing themselves on a reserve.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Bruce\nOTTAWA, 7th April, 1904:\n\nMy dear Mr Laird:\n\nWith reference to the establishment by the Baptists of a day school at Lower Fairford, I agree with you that in this case no action is necessary. I consider, however, that the Department should not be ignored in such cases and that permission should be asked by the denomination before establishing itself upon a reserve.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg,\nMan.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nof Indian Affairs.\nSir,\n\nIn answer to your letter of the 7th. instant re the establishment of the Baptists at Fairford Reserve, I would say that this occurred several years before I received my present appointment. Otherwise the matter would have been looked into.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOFFICE OF INSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES\nLake Manitoba Inspectorate\nStonewall, Man. Aug. 26, 1911\n\nSir,\n\nYours of the 6th ultimo, No. 150,000 - 1, received and contents noted. After getting back from the treaty payments in the Manitowah and Pas Agencies and inspecting all the protestant day schools, I would suggest that the salaries of Rupert Bruce and Colin Sanderson, teachers respectively of the Upper Fairford and Lower Fairford day schools be increased to $400.00 per annum. These teachers in all respects, are the equal of John Favel, the teacher of the Lake St. Martin day school and seeing that he is now getting that amount they should be entitled to the same. This raise will have a good effect, and encourage these teachers to do better work.\n\nYours truly\n\n(Sgd.) S.J. Jackson\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\nOttawa, Ontario.\nExtract from letter received from R. Logan, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man., re building a new boarding school\nat Lower Fairford. Original on File 117 651-5\n\nIf the Department entertain the idea of\nbuilding a boarding school at this point, there would be\nno need of a day school. If not, I might say that this\nwould be an excellent location for an improved day school.\nMr Colin Sanderson, the present teacher, would not be able\nto take charge of such a school, but there ought to be no\ndifficulty in getting suitable people to take charge as\nthe school is only six miles from the railway.\n\nYour obedient servant\nR. Logan\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 25, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of August 26th, last, in which you recommend an increase in salary to Colin Sanderson, teacher of the Lower Fairford School, I beg to say that previous reports received upon Mr. Sanderson's work as teacher of this school do not warrant the Department in granting any increase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nS. J. Jackson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nStonewall, Man.\nOttawa, June 5, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. S. J. Jackson, Inspector of Indian Agencies, in his annual report on the schools in his inspectorate speaking of the Lower Fairford School states that the teacher has been too long at this school and he suggests either an exchange with some other teacher in the inspectorate or a three months course in the Normal School, Winnipeg.\n\nIt appears that the lack of success at this school is partially owing to the carelessness of the teacher and the fact that he does not take an interest in his work. The Department does not consider that it would be advisable to transfer him to any other school and it is hardly thought that the school authorities would allow him to enter for a course at the Normal School. I should be glad to have you make inquiries with regard to the latter. In any event I have to request you to inform Mr. Sanderson that unless future reports show a decided increase in the attendance and progress at the school the Department will have to consider dispensing with his services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nExtract from the Report of Mr. S.J. Jackson, Inspector of Indian Agencies and Reserves, on the Schools in the Lake Manitoba Inspectorate, for the year ended March 31, 1912.\n\nLOWER FAIRFORD DAY SCHOOL. (Church of England)\n\nThe Teacher at this school has been too long at this school, and I would suggest his exchange with some other teacher in the Inspectorate, for say a year, or his taking a three months course at the Normal School, Winnipeg. He is a graduate from the Upper Fairford school, and has been teaching about ten years. He has a good deal of ability, but is inclined to be careless.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nSgd. S.J. Jackson,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOFFICE OF THE\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, 8th October,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nAt Fairford there are many Indian children living on each side of the river. This river is a very dangerous one in the winter time; it doesn't freeze solid and where the road is possible one day owing to the strong current underneath the ice it is dangerous the next. For that reason the Indians on the north side of the river wish that some arrangements could be made whereby the School Teacher could teach a few hours each day on each side of the river as did Teacher Camper Garricoh when he was in charge there.\n\nPlease notify me if any such arrangements can be made.\n\nYours &c.,\nGlen Campbell\nChief Inspector I.D.\nOttawa, October 15, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant reporting that there are many Indian children living on each side of the river at Fairford and that, owing to the dangerous condition of the river in the winter time, the Indians of the north side are anxious that some arrangement could be made whereby the teacher could teach a few hours each day on each side of the river, as was formerly done by Mr. Garrido when he was in charge there.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will instruct Mr. Agent Logan to see if such an arrangement can be made with the present teacher, Mr. Sanderson, but it does not consider that it would be justified in compelling him to do so, as it would be as dangerous for him to cross and recross as for the children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nGlen Campbell, Esq.,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nI reference to my teaching at two places, as I mentioned in my last report for the year 1912.\n\nWhen I was asked by the Superintendent of Indian agencies if I would (last June) I told him that I could not continue teaching for the salary I was receiving for teaching viz. $300.00 so he said he would try and get an extra of $100.00 per year from me. I started commencing teaching at once at the beginning of September quarter (or 1st of July) and continued to do so. It has cost me much more time and trouble. The pupils across the river attend school fairly well. The new place I am teaching. I have been teaching across ever since 1st July 1912. With two months holidays since and no word about the extra.\n\nNow I cannot do the teaching across the river unless I receive two hundred extra. If I don't receive this I will discontinue at once my teaching across.\n\nAwaiting a reply from you.\n\nYour humble servant,\nColin Sanderson\nTeacher\nOttawa, February 26, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department considers that it would be better for you to teach school only in the one place, i.e., in the old school building on the Lower Fairford Reserve. It is not considered that efficient work could be done by dividing the time between two schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nColin Sanderson, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nLower Fairford Indian School,\nFairford, Man.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI am in receipt of yours. I am not quite sure of Clare's entire fitness but as the people are pressing so hard for a teacher I think that we had better give him a trial. I am writing to the Agent at Portage, recommending him.\n\nRe Fairford, I had not thought of Mr. Dobbs in connection with the headship of the Improved School as I first of all did not know his fitness for the post and secondly, I feel that he will have his hands full with the Church work. If the department, however, consider a suitable man to carry on the Improved School, I shall be willing to entertain the proposition. The matter would have to be gone into very carefully from all stand points. For example, would his delicate wife be competent to assist him as Matron? Would the fact that there are relatives of both his present wife and his former one living in the district make difficulties for him? I have a high regard for Mr. Dobbs and shall be very sorry to lose him if what you have in view for him will take him away from me. Please let us further correspondence about the matter before you finally act. If I am to accompany the Agent who goes to try to persuade the Band to accept an Improved School I should know a good while ahead as I have appointments mapped out for months in advance.\n\nYours very sincerely\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.\nDeputy Superintendent etc.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nShow no one else in view for the position.\nJanuary 19, 1914\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant and I agree that we should have some further correspondence before finally settling the proposed creation of an improved day school at Fairford and the appointment of a teacher and matron; the work will really be advanced by delay. I agree that we should give Mr. Clare a trial.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. S. P. Matheson,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nBishop's Court,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing you a copy of a letter recently received from the Rev. J.H. Dobbs, re the salary of Colin H. Sanderson, day school teacher at Lower Fairford. This raise has been recommended by me some years ago and I am unable to understand why this teacher did not get a raise the same as a number of other teachers in my Inspectorate. Mr Sanderson will average well with the other teachers who have received the raise of $400.00, and I would recommend that he be placed at that figure for the June quarter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nFairford P.O. Manitoba.\nApril 20th 1914.\n\nS.J. Jackson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nStonewall, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Jackson:\n\nMay I please solicit your help in regard to an increase of salary for Mr. Colin Sanderson, teacher at the Lower River School.\n\nI understand he is only getting the old rate of $300.00 a year. This is really not a living wage as things are now, everything is so dear.\n\nI can honestly say that Mr. Sanderson is a thoroughly conscientious worker, keeping proper hours, and teaching school every day, and is deserving of the favour asked.\n\nI have not said anything of this as yet to Mr. Sanderson himself, as I wished first to ascertain your own ideas in regard to it.\n\nPersonally, I think it will be only be an act of justice to him to increase his salary by say $100.00 a year, as he is really doing his best in every way.\n\nTrusting you are well and hoping to meet you again on treaty day next,\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Sgd) T.H. Dobbs.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Inspector Jackson forwards a letter from the Rev. T. H. Dobbs asking for an increase of $100.00 a year for Mr. Sanderson, teacher of the Lower Fairford School. Mr. Sanderson has had charge of this school since the December quarter 1908 and is only paid at the rate of $300.00 per annum. He has no special qualifications or training as a teacher, but he is said to have a good influence on the reserve and, as Mr. Jackson says, he will average well with other teachers who have received the raise of $400.00. A salary of $300.00 is hardly a fair wage to offer a teacher in the West and I would recommend that the increase be granted.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, May 7, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo enclosing a copy of a communication received by you from Rev. T. H. Dobbs asking for an increase in the salary of Colin H. Sanderson, teacher of the Lower Fairford School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has decided to increase Mr. Sanderson's salary to $400.00 per annum from the first of the current quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. J. Jackson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nStonewall, Man.\nOttawa, May 7, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has decided to increase the salary of Mr. Colin H. Sanderson, teacher of the Lower Fairford School, to $400.00 per annum from the first of the current quarter and I have to ask you to notify him accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nOttawa, February 22, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nAs the new improved day school on the Fairford Reserve is now open the Upper and Lower Fairford schools should be closed. As Mr. Colin Sanderson, who taught the Lower School, has been transferred to the Little Saskatchewan School it is presumed that the Lower Fairford School has already been closed. If the Upper School is still in operation it should be closed at the end of the present quarter, March 31st, next, and you will be good enough to inform the teacher accordingly.\n\nAny school material on hand at these two schools should be sent to the new school and any supplies and equipment not required at that school should be carefully stored for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Stern, Fairford, Man., in which he complains of the inefficiency of the teacher at the Upper Fairford school owing to short-sightedness.\n\nThe Department would like you to make inquiries concerning this complaint and report. It is noticed that no report on this school has been received from the Inspector nor from the Agent for a considerable time, and it would like you to instruct these officers to furnish a report whenever they may have occasion to visit the school.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLean\nSecretary.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo drawing attention to the complaint of Mr. Geo. Storr as to the inefficiency of the Teacher at the Upper Fairfield school. The practice has been for the Inspector to accompany the Agent on the annuity payment trips and make his inspection at the same time. As dates had to be kept for payments and the trip completed within a certain period, time did not admit of the schools being fully inspected, and winter trips are only made to particular points when necessary. Mr. Agent Logan is now making the annuity payments, and it is impossible for me to get into communication with him in time to have him inspect the school. It occurs to me, however, that the matter might now stand until the new Inspector takes charge.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Indian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 12th, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant and in reply I beg to say that the Department concurs in your suggestion that the enquiry into the inefficiency of the teacher at the Upper Fairfield day school may stand until the new Inspector takes charge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg,\nMan.\nOttawa, December 30th, 1907.\n\nMr. Benson,\n\nHave you anything to show that the school at Fairford, Manitoba, is being badly managed at the present time?\n\nD.

I would be glad if you will look into the matter and give this man employment. He is son of George Bruce who for many years was teacher of the Fairford school and I should think would be qualified although I have no personal knowledge myself. Your Indian agent at Portage ought to be able to tell you. Rupert Bruce is living at Fairford now. He did not apply to me himself but a man at Fairford wrote to me on his behalf.\n\nI am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTheo. A. [Signature]\nOttawa, July 4, 1908.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nWith reference to the application of Mr. Rupert Bruce for the position of teacher of the Upper Fairford Indian school I beg to say that this school is at present in charge of Miss Eva Fryer and in July of last year a letter was received from Mr. George Storr of Fairford, complaining of her inefficiency and defective eyesight.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner was instructed to make enquiries into this complaint. He replied that time did not admit of his communicating with Mr. Agent Logan, who was then making the annuity payments and suggested that the matter stand until the new Inspector took charge. The Department agreed to this and there the matter stands.\n\nThe Commissioner might be reminded of this and told to note Mr. Bruce's application and that he is a son of the Rev. George Bruce who formerly taught this school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nOttawa, July 7, 1908.\n\nDear Mr. Burrows:\n\nI have your favour of the 3rd instant, with reference to the application of Mr. Rupert Bruce for the position of teacher of the Upper Fairford Indian school, and beg to say that his request is now being looked into.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. A. Burrows, Esq., M.

It is also expected that a white village will be built near there before long as the Canadian Northern Railway will cross the river at that point. I would, therefore, ask Your Grace to inform Mr. Bruce that his services will not be required after June 30th, next, and to take in the meantime the necessary steps to obtain a teacher with proper qualifications. As Your Grace was informed in a letter of recent date respecting the Little Saskatchewan day school the Department is prepared to pay a more liberal salary and will make a grant of $500.00 for a qualified teacher.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMost Rev. S. P. Matheson, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nYours of the 6th ultimo, No. 150,000 - 1, received and contents noted. After getting back from the treaty payments in the Manitowah and Pas Agencies and inspecting all the protestant day schools, I would suggest that the salaries of Rupert Bruce and Colin Sanderson, teachers respectively of the Upper Fairfield and Lower Fairfield day schools be increased to $400.00 per annum. These teachers in all respects are the equal of John Favel, the teacher of the Lake St. Martin day school and seeing that he is now getting that amount they should be entitled to the same. This raise will have a good effect, and encourage these teachers to do better work.\n\nYours truly\n\n(Sgd.) S.J. Jackson\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, Sept. 2nd., 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo and in reply to that portion in which you deal with an increase of salary to Rupert Bruce, teacher of the Upper Fairfield Day School, I beg to say that some months ago the Department communicated with His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land and informed him that it was not satisfied with the work being performed at this school by Mr. Bruce and asked that a teacher with proper qualifications be secured if at all possible. In view of the action taken at that time it would not be consistent to now grant a considerable increase to Mr. Bruce. Previous reports do not show that his work ranks with Mr. Favel's and there is no doubt that he does not secure nearly so good an average attendance, as shown by the returns and reports. The Department would be pleased to know, however, whether you are prepared to state that there has been a decided improvement in the work at this school since your last visit. It has been represented to the Department that this is one of the few Reserves in that district in which there is a good field for a competent certified teacher, and an offer was made to pay a salary of at least $500.00 per annum for such a person could one be secured willing to undertake the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. J. Jackson, Esq.,\nInspr. of Indian Agencies,\nStonewall, Man.\nOttawa, September 20, 1911.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI beg to refer to Your Grace to official letter of December 27th, last, in regard to the appointment of a more competent teacher for the Upper Fairford School and to ask what action, if any, has been taken in this matter.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMost Rev. S. P. Matheson, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nReplying to No.117654.\n\nDear Mr. McLean,\n\nI am in receipt of yours. So far, I have not succeeded in securing a teacher for the Upper Fairford School though I have made many endeavours. The fact is, that no good man will accept the position at the salary offered and there is no use sending an inferior man. Will you kindly let me know what is the largest amount I shall be authorised to offer? There is a difficulty also about a place for a man to board and Mr. Bruce's attitude is such that he is not disposed to render any assistance. However, if you tell me the best terms that I can offer, I will make further ef-\nforts and will write again to Mr. Bruce in regard to a boarding place.\n\nyours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\n705771\nOttawa, October 5, 1911.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Grace's communication of the 26th ultimo in reference to the salary the Department is willing to pay for a teacher at the Upper Fairford School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that as Your Grace has already been informed the Department believes that this is a reserve on which the conditions are such that a satisfactory day school might be conducted and if Your Grace can obtain the services of a teacher with certificates the Department will pay a salary of $600.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Matheson, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOFFICE OF THE\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES,\nLAKE MANITOBA INSPECTORATE,\nSTONEWALL, MAN., October 16th, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nYour letter No.317658, of date the 2nd ultimo received and in reply, I cannot report any decided improvement in this school since my former visit. My idea in recommending the increase of $100 per annum was that it would encourage this young teacher to try and do better work. I saw Archbishop Matheson a short time ago and he informed me that he finds it almost impossible to get teachers for the Indian reserves, and has no one in sight for Fairford.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, October 23, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant in further reference to the increase in salary for the teacher of the Upper Fairford School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as you have already been advised, it is the wish of the Department to obtain a competent, qualified teacher for this school and with this object in view His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land was informed that the Department would pay a salary of $600.00 per annum. It is hoped, therefore, that the Church authorities will be able at an early date to recommend a competent teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nS. J. Jackson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nStonewall, Man.\nNovember 9th, 1871.\n\nDear Mr. McLean,\n\nReferring to our correspondence in regard to the school at Upper Fairford, I had an interview today with the Rev. George Bruce, the missionary at that point. He states that his son has given satisfaction as teacher and that there has been no complaint. He admits that the attendance is smaller but contends that it is impossible to get the older pupils to attend school when they can obtain work on the railroads, etc. He also drew my attention to a report in the Blue Book regarding his son's teaching; certainly that report is favorable. I am aware that Rupert Bruce's education is deficient but I know also the extreme difficulty in procuring teachers for these Indian schools. Sandy Bay school is still being taught by Anderson. I have endeavored to procure a teacher but have failed. I could, I think, persuade a lady teacher to try it but there appears to be no place for her to board and lodge. The houses of the Indians are impossible places for that purpose. What can we do under the circumstances?\n\nI am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ. B. McLean, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 22, 1911.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Grace's communication of the 9th instant in further reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Upper Fairford School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is regretted very much that Your Grace has not been able to obtain the services of a competent teacher even at the increased salary offered. As a change at this school is highly desirable if any improvement at all is to be effected I would ask Your Grace to state whether you would have any objection to the Department making an appointment in this particular case. I may add for Your Grace's information that at several of the schools in the Diocese of Saskatchewan competent teachers have of late been secured and there has been a marked improvement in the management of the schools over which they have charge. The Upper Fairford School is one which it would appear offers a splendid field for an energetic and competent teacher and it is for this reason that the above suggestion is made.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMost Rev. S. P. Matheson,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nNovember 28th, 1911.\n\nDear Mr. McLean,\n\nI am in receipt of yours, and in reply I beg to state that I will have no objection to the Department looking out a teacher for the Upper Fairfield school. The person appointed should be a member of the Church of England and I should be very thankful if the Department would be good enough, before finally appointing a teacher, to submit the name to me with some information regarding him. You ought also to make very careful inquiries about a place for the teacher to board and lodge before he is sent out. That has been the most serious difficulty in the past. For if Mr. Bruce is unfavorable to the appointment he will not be likely to have the man live in his house, and that is really the only place where he could be comfortable.\n\nI am,\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nJ. B. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 19, 1911.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Grace's letter of the 28th ultimo in reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Upper Fairford School.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform Your Grace that under the conditions it would not appear expedient for the Department to undertake to secure the services of a teacher. It is hoped, however, that Your Grace will not relax your efforts to obtain the services of a more competent teacher for this school.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMost Rev. S. P. Matheson,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Mr. McLean,\n\nI thank you for yours but you must not go away with the impression that I am satisfied with Mr. Rupert Bruce's teaching. Judging from his education I cannot see how he can be a successful teacher. The difficulty in making a change is in Mr. Bruce's attitude. I mean the Rev. Geo. Bruce, the Missionary in charge. He used to teach the school himself and since he gave it up he has insisted on having a member of his own family do the work. The Indians are not all favorable to this but it is within Mr. Bruce's power to make it well nigh impossible for any one else to take the school and be comfortable. He has done good work on the reserve both as a teacher and as a missionary and it is a delicate matter to interfere with him now that he is becoming advanced in years. He is a most worthy man.\n\nI had a letter from an land the other day from the Indian personage asking me to tell him candidly whether the Indians in Canada were really \"dying out\" or not. I do not think that they are but I desire some specific information before replying to the letter. You will greatly oblige me by giving any information on the subject w\nwhich may be within your power to give.\n\nWishing you the compliments of the Season, I am very truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHave you ever heard from the Indians at Fairford as to their wishes in the matter of the School? If they wish a change I think that it should be made even in opposition to Mr. Bruce.\n\nS.F.A.\nOttawa, January 17, 1912.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Grace's communication of the 3rd instant in further reference to the appointment of a teacher to replace Mr. Rupert Bruce in the Upper Fairfield School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has had no communication from the Indians themselves in reference to a change of teacher, but reports received on Mr. Bruce's work of late have not been favourable and it is considered that a successful day school might be conducted at this point. The first essential, however, is a competent teacher. Of course reasonable notice would have to be given Mr. Bruce if it is decided to dispense with his services and the Department would again repeat the hope that Your Grace will be able at a not far distant date to nominate a competent teacher.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMost Rev. S. P. Matheson,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nWinnipeg, June 15th, 1912.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,-\n\nThe Chief and other Indians who came from Fairford desire to point out to the Department that the Indian Reserve School is within the thirty acres surrendered. It is utilized by only three or four of the Indian children and a great number of white children attend it. They would like the Government to give them a school centrally located for their own use in place of the present school. I instructed Agent Logan to look into this matter but would like to hear from the Department in this regard.\n\nYours &c.,\n[Signature]\nChief Inspector.\nOttawa, June 29, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant in reference to the day school at Upper Fairford.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is prepared to take the necessary action for the erection of a suitable day school building at a convenient point on the reserve and Mr. Agent Logan is being communicated with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGlen Campbell, Esq.,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, June 29, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Upper Fairfield School building is located on that portion of the reserve which has been surrendered and Mr. Campbell, Chief Inspector, reports that a new building centrally located will be required.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to go carefully into this matter and report fully. I am sending you herewith a blueprint of the reserve on which, after consultation with those interested, you should indicate the location of a building. You should also in your report state the kind of building, means of construction, etc., and deal with any other matters that may enable the Department to come to a decision. Previous reports from you show that this is a band where a successful day school might be operated and the Department will be pleased to have you give the matter most careful consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nReferring to your letter of 28th June last, No 117654/1 regarding a new School for Upper Fairford,\n\nIn reply would state, I did not receive this letter until my return from the annuity payments in Manitowapah Agency being at the end of July.\n\nIn reference to this matter would state, that a new School is not required, as the School now used is in good repair. It is situated on the land surrendered, and some of the Indians stated to me personally that it should be moved farther East. I forwarded the Map sent me to Rev Mr. Bruce, of Upper Fairford, and have asked him to look into the matter carefully with the Indians interested and give all the information he possibly can regarding the matter.\n\nOn receipt of his answer, will communicate with the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nIndian Agent's Office,\nPortage La Prairie, Man.,\n13th Dec. 1912.\n\nNo/ 113\n\nSir,-\n\nIn reference to the moving of the school at Upper Fairford they at Upper Fairford seem to want it to be moved half a mile or so to the east, as most of the children who attend the school live in that direction, some of the parents make as an excuse that it is too far for the children to go in the winter, but my experience is that on most of the reserves it does not make much difference as to the distance the school is, so far as attending the school is concerned. As to the moving of the school I made enquiries and found that there was no one at Fairford that would take the job of moving it, and if moved would have to get men from a distance to do it, which would cost considerably. I would suggest that the school remain where it is for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nR. Logan,\nIndian Agent.\nWhen at Fairford last month, the matter was brought up, by some of the Indians of there being a number of outside children who were attending the Upper Fairford day School and some of them thought this should not be allowed.\n\nI mentioned the matter to Rupert Bruce the Teacher, and he informed me that there were a number attending, who did not belong to treaty parents, stating that there was no other School, and as the children wished to attend he did not refuse them, and that he did not consider that it was any detriment to the Treaty children, as there were such a few attending.\n\nIn my opinion I cannot see that it is any drawback to the treaty children, but would ask the Department's instructions in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInd., Agt\n\nTee. Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 17, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant in reference to the attendance of outside children at the Upper Fairfield Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department does not consider the attendance of these outsiders is any detriment to the children belonging to the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nR. Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nExtract from letter from His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land, addressed to the Deputy Superintendent General, dated the 26th of December, 1913, the original on Little Saskatchewan school file No. 1.\n\nRupert Bruce is still in charge of the school at Upper Fairford though his father has retired from the Mission and a new man has been placed in charge, Rev. T. H. Dobbs, formerly of Shoal River. What about the effort to establish an improved Day School at Fairford? You will remember that you were to look into it before the Estimates were made up. Now that Mr. Bruce is not there I believe that the Indians can be persuaded to accept an Improved School particularly if they are told definitely that the Department has no intention of giving them a Boarding School. The trouble in the past has been that they were always given to understand by the Agents that the Department was ready to give the Boarding School but that the Bishop held it back. They even were given the impression that my predecessor had used for his own purposes the $28,500 voted by the Government for the purpose in Mr. Sifton's time. As I stated in a former letter, I am willing to accompany any one whom the Dept. decides to send and use my influence with the Band.\nJanuary 7th, 1914.\n\nMost Rev. Sir -\n\nReferring to that portion of Your Grace's communication of the 26th ultimo in which you deal with the Upper Fairford School. I note that Rev. T. H. Dodds has been placed in charge of the mission. As Your Grace is aware Rev. Mr. Dodds while at Shoal River had charge of the day school and his services were very satisfactory. I shall be pleased to know whether Your Grace has in view for appointment a teacher for Upper Fairford should it be decided to establish an improved day school, and if so, whether Mr. Dodds will undertake the work. I should like to have this information as I have under consideration asking Mr. Dodds to do some other work for the Department provided he is not to be placed in charge of the school.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from Your Grace at your earliest convenience.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Grace's obedient servant\n\nMost Rev. S. P. Matheson,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nBishop's Guard,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nSeveral years ago the Church of England had a teacher and a catechist at Rock Head, Government paying part of the salary and the Church supplementing the grant. Though we had some specially good men there the work was so discouraging and the Indians so troublesome that on the advice of the Superintendent of Missions, I withdrew from the work. Both the Superintendent and the Missionary advised me to close down the work and leave it closed until the Band would ask that it be resumed. A message has now come to me from the Band pleading that a teacher be sent. We have a good house there, a fair church, and I am told that there is a schoolhouse which is considerably out of repair. I wish to ascertain whether the Department will sanction the appointment of a teacher and if I secure a good man what salary the Department would offer. In view of the history of the place in the past it would be prudent to send a married man rather than a single one.\n\nI hope you are keeping in view the matter of the Fairford school and that you will give me a considerable period of notice if you wish me to accompany the person you send to deal with the matter. I had hoped to go there in July but it is possible that I may have to go over to England during that month instead.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Sup., Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nApril 3rd, 1916.\n\nMost Rev. Sir -\n\nI received this morning Your Grace's letter of the 25th ultimo in reference to the Jack Head and Fairfield Schools.\n\nArrangements were made last year to re-open the Jack Head School but evidently were not consummated. Our records show that there are only 18 children of school age on the Reserve and as this is a comparatively small number it is doubtful if a very successful day school could be hoped for. However, I am most anxious to meet your Grace's wishes in so far as possible. I should like to know if it is proposed to combine the duties of missionary and teacher. I think the Department would be doing its duty if it made a grant say of $800.00 for the educational work, the continuance to be dependent upon results attained. I should be pleased to hear from Your Grace further in the matter.\n\nMost Rev. J. P. Macdonald,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nBishop's Court,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nI am very much pleased with the interest that Your Grace is taking in the establishment of an improved day school at Upper Fairfield. The Agent and Inspector will visit this Reserve about June 15th to pay treaty and attend to their other ordinary duties. If it could be convenient for Your Grace to arrange to be at Fairfield at that time instructions will be given the officers above mentioned to explain to the Indians the attitude of the Department respecting a boarding school and that we are prepared to do for them in the way of a day school. I am sure that the co-operation of these officers with Your Grace on the ground would enable us to come to a settlement of this question which has been so long under consideration.\n\nI shall take no action in either of the above cases until I hear from you.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Grace's obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nBishop's Court,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nApril 7, 1914.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI note what you say in regard to Fairford and it will be a great disappointment to me if I cannot accompany the Agent at the date you speak of, but I am due in Regina just about that time for a very important appointment and it is just possible that I shall not be able to get back in time. However, if you give full instructions to your Agent I dare say matters can be explained to the Indians in a satisfactory manner. My only desire was to assist in negotiations and endeavour to persuade the Indians to accept of an improved school instead of their wished for boarding school.\n\nI must again thank you for your prompt attention to my letters. I have a feeling that with you at the head of affairs a great deal may be accomplished.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am, very sincerely yours,\n\nS.C. Rupertslan,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. Gen., Indian Office,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 6, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that the Department is advised by His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land that he fears he will not be able to accompany you and Mr. Agent Logan to Fairford at the time of the annuity payments. I have, therefore, to request that you will explain to the Indians that the Department has no intention of establishing a boarding school there, but that it is prepared to conduct an improved day school. You should use your best endeavours to persuade them to accept the latter class of school, which has proved very successful on other reserves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst., Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. J. Jackson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nStonehull, Man.\nOttawa, May 7, 1914.\n\nMost Rev. Sir,\n\nI have the honour to inform Your Grace that in compliance with the request contained in your letter of the 7th ultimo to the Deputy Superintendent General instructions have been given to Mr. Inspector Jackson to use his best endeavours with the Indians of Fairford, when he visits them at the time of the annuity payments, to induce them to accept an improved day school and to inform them that there is no prospect of the establishment of a boarding school there.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Grace's obedient servant,\n\nJ.

JACKSON ON THE UPPER FAIRFORD DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOn the roll I found 14 indian children; 5 boys and 9 girls classified as follows,-\n\nStandard 1.- 10\n   2.- 4\n\nThe average for the quarter ending March 31st was 5.\n\nNon-treaty children to the number of 10 attend regularly at this school. The teacher reports that the Indians will not send their children to school and say that they do not like the non-treaty children attending the school.\n\nMy opinion is that this is only an excuse. I can report no progress at this day school.\n\nDate of inspection,- April 12th, 1915.\nOttawa, January 12, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Jackson in his report on the Upper Fairford Day School states that the teacher reports that the Indians will not send their children to school, as they do not like the non-treaty children attending.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the Indians that unless they send their children to school regularly a truant officer will be appointed and the Regulations will be put in force.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. Ogletree, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nOttawa, February 22, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nAs the new improved day school on the Fairford Reserve is now open the Upper and Lower Fairford Schools should be closed. As Mr. Colin Sanderson who taught the Lower School, has been transferred to the Little Saskatchewian School it is presumed that the Lower Fairford School has already been closed. If the Upper School is still in operation it should be closed at the end of the present quarter, March 31st, next, and you will be good enough to inform the teacher accordingly.\n\nAny school material on hand at these two schools should be sent to the new school and any supplies and equipment not required at that school should be carefully stored for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

We do not have any information regarding the feasibility or desirability of such a school. You should state the number of children of school age on the reserve who are not attending a school. The Board would appreciate any information you may have regarding the possibility of establishing a day school at the Sandy Bay Reserve. If a school is established, you could consider whether it would be necessary to erect a building for the purpose or if a suitable building for the purpose could be obtained at a reasonable cost. You should also state the number of children who would attend. Furthermore, if a day school is started, please state whether it would interfere with the enrollment at the Sandy Bay Residential School. You should also state, also, if the members of this Band are Catholic or Protestant.\n\nAny information you can give, regarding this request, will be appreciated.

I shall be glad if you will forward a report, with your recommendation, as to the desirability or necessity for such a school. You should state the number of children of school age on this reserve who are at present not attending a school. The Department understands that a number of the pupils of this reserve are in attendance at the Sandy Bay Residential School. If a school is established, you should state whether it would be necessary to erect a building and a residence for the teacher or if a suitable building for the purpose could be obtained at a central point, to meet the requirements of the greater number of children who would attend. Further, if a day school is started, please state whether it would interfere with the enrolment at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. You should state, also, if the members of this Band are Catholic or Protestant.\n\nAny particulars you can give, regarding this request, will be appreciated. Your reply at your early convenience is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKensie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of the above noted letter in reference to the need of a day school, Sandy Bay Reserve. In reply I beg to state that I have made a survey of the reserve and have no hesitation in saying that a day school is very necessary as about 50 children of school age cannot be accommodated in the Residential School. The Residential School is located in the centre of the reserve, about two miles from the lake front. A day school should be built close to the school, accommodation could be found for the teacher at the Residential School, but would suggest a teacherage in close proximity to the day school, which should be erected between the Residential School and the Farming Instructional Assistant. The ground is suitable, a well would have to be drilled and the grounds fenced. The estimated cost would be in the neighborhood of $5000.\n\nNo building on the reserve is suitable for the purpose. The erection of a day school would not interfere to any great extent with the enrolment at the Residential School, some objections to a day school may be raised by the Church authorities on this point, but the fact remains that the Residential School on the reserve cannot take care of the education of all the children at present of school age. The members of the Sandy Bay Band are Catholic. I believe that this matter came up for consideration some years ago, the School Principal at that time was not in favour of a day school. The matter was talked over between the present Principal and myself, but he would not commit himself except to advise that the matter would be taken up with the Rev. Father Provincial.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJanuary 15, 1904.\n\nHONOURABLE THOMAS G. MURPHY\n\nRegarding a request for the establishment of a day school on the Sandy Bay Reserve, No. 8, Manitoba, I beg to say that the local Indian Agent was asked to report as to the desirability or necessity for such a school. In a communication, dated the 6th instant, from the Agent, Mr. J. Waite, Portage La Prairie, Man., he states as follows:\n\n\"I have made a survey of the reserve and have no hesitation in saying that a day school is very necessary, as about 40 children of school age cannot be accommodated in the Residential School.

I beg to suggest the North end of the reserve for the proposed day school; several good sites are available, close to Lake Manitoba and situated about the centre of the Northern portion of the reserve.\n\nA school to seat 30 pupils would be required with a teachers residence detached. I would suggest a full basement to the school, the cost would be very little, the basement being used for the seating of the children for their mid-day meal during the winter months. Coal will also have to be used for fuel and timber is getting very limited on this reserve. A heating furnace would have to be installed, a coal boiler.\n\nThe school should be about 1\u00bd miles from the Farm Instructor's residence and approximately 2\u00bd miles from the Residential school.\n\nWork could be commenced immediately, the nearest point where materials could be secured would be Portage la Prairie. The work could be done under a white foreman, employing Indian labour.\n\nThe teacher's residence would not require a basement as sufficient wood fuel could be secured to heat a small residence.\n\nThe building site is in the open, close enough to the lake to secure water with very little trouble.

White, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage La Prairie, Man.\nDecember 11th, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton,\n\nI am enclosing a copy of letter which I have today sent to Mr. Waite with regard to the question of a new day school and teachers' residence on the Sandy Bay Reserve. You may remember that we discussed the matter when on the reserve in July 1934. You might let me have your views in the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th inst., file 126-15-1, and wish to advise that I am still of the opinion that the day school should be built on the Sandy Bay Reserve.\n\nI wish to further advise that it would be almost impossible to build a cement foundation at this season of the year, and would ask that the building be not proceeded with until early in the month of March.\n\nThe plans for the combined day school and teachers residence are still on file here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\n\nED WINNIPEG, MAN., December 31st, 1935.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of Department Letter No. 126-15-1 dated December 11th, with the enclosure addressed to Mr. White, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie.\n\nThe policy of the Department, I think, should be the deciding factor as to the erection of a day school on the Sandy Bay Reserve. If the operation of boarding schools is to be continued, I do not see the necessity of a day school. On the other hand, if the Department is desirous of gradually eliminating boarding schools, a day school would be a step in this direction.\n\nI would, however, draw the Department's attention to the fact that the Sandy Bay Indian Reserve is one of the poorest reserves we have in Manitoba and the Indians are perhaps among the most destitute. If the children were taken out of boarding school and the care and responsibility placed on the parents, it would certainly greatly increase the hardships. Another factor which makes the hardship even greater than it already is the fact that the Indians are obliged to be off the reserve from early spring until late in the fall in order to provide themselves with a living. The Indians leave their reserve for trapping and work out during the summer months for the white farmers throughout the southern part of Manitoba. If the children were not in boarding school, they would unquestionably be with their parents and consequently away from school.\n\nI realise the present boarding school will not accommodate all the pupils on the Sandy Bay Reserve, but I think the policy of the Department should be the deciding factor as to whether this school is to be remodelled and made large enough to accommodate all the children, or whether the\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nextra accommodation will be provided by the erection of a day school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G.

They have put up a log building about 18 x 23 with shingle roof which they would use as a school, or they would put up another log building for a school, if the Department would furnish lumber etc., to finish, the building they have up is used for a church.\n\nThere are 14 children of school age on this Reserve:\n\nRobert Moore 2 Children,\nMrs Charles Moore 3 \"\nPeter Moore 2 \"\nIsaac Moore 2 \"\nand Mrs David Bourassa 5 \"\n\nThese children all belong to the Anglican Church with the exception of Mrs. Bourassa's who are Roman Catholic.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Asst.

In any event, the Department has no funds at the present time to meet the wishes of the Indians to establish a school on their reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. O. Oglebay, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nMarch 29th, 1922.\n\nMy dear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have had another request for the opening of a school at Birch River, and this time it seems to be backed by Mr. Ogletree, the Agent. On a former occasion when the matter came up, the Department did not see its way to taking the matter up because the children were so few in number. The question is now made by them that if our little Church at Birch River could be used for the school the Department might consent to pay a Mrs. A. a small salary for conducting the school. This woman lives on the reserve and, I am assured, is competent to give elementary teaching. The missionary in charge suggests that this might be done as a beginning, and to test the case, I cheerfully consent to allow the Church to be used temporarily provided it is kept clean for the Sunday services, and maintained in good repair.\n\nMr. Ogletree, your agent at Portage la Prairie, writes strongly opposing the removal of Mr. Hyson from the Improved School at Fairford, and Mr. Hyson himself contends that he is being unfairly treated, and deprecates any action looking towards his removal. I have told him that the Church authorities have made no move against him, but that the Indians have petitioned for his removal. Matters have become so complicated that, under all the circumstances, I think that it would be well to have Mr. Ferrier hold an investigation and report on the matter before steps are taken to remove Mr. Hyson.

When this is received by the Department, the supplies asked for will be forwarded.\n\nI will also be pleased if, at a later date, you will inform me as to Mrs. Awdy's Christian name, and the date on which she begins duties.\n\nYour Grace will be advised in a separate communication regarding the case of the Hysom's at Fairford Reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Grace's,\n\nMost obedient servant,\n\nMost Rev.

I have therefore written to her again and requested further information of a definite character. This I will forward to you as soon as received.\n\nIn her letter, dated May the 19th, she states:\n\n\"I will do my best to teach the children here; they have been coming to school over a month now, and they are learning pretty good.

Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa,\n\n-Re Birch River Indian Day School-\n\nMy Dear Sir;\n\nFrom letters recently received I gather that there is much confusion in this Reserve as to who the teacher really is, whether a Mrs. Audy or Miss Brass, and on this account I would recommend that no salary be paid for the above school, until you have received from me definite and satisfactory information concerning the identity of the teacher.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nArchdeacon.\nDiocese of Rupert's Land\n\nWINNIPEG, MANITOBA\n\nOct the 26th 1922.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe:- Birch River Day School.\n\nMy dear Sir:-\n\nIn a letter recently received from our Missionary at Shoal River, he has the following to say about the above Day School:\n\n\"There are thirteen names on the Register, of these seven are of school age, and five under school age. The average attendance is five.\n\nMrs Audy is regarded as the Teacher and has taught from March to the present date, with the exception of two weeks.\n\nThe school needs slates and pencils, scribblers, lead pencils and five No. 1 Readers. A school Register, blackboard and books of simple arithmetic. Biscuits should also be provided.\n\nThe present Teacher, Mrs Audy, is an Indian woman; her knowledge of English is meagre, and her ability to teach limited, but she is able to fill the bill at the present time. Her salary should be about $15 per month and should be paid direct to the Missionary at Shoal River.\n\nPersonally, my own opinion is that these children should be made to attend school at Shoal River, or sent to a Boarding school.\"\n\nThe above was received after a visit paid to Birch River at our request, and we feel that the information will be of value to you.\n\nI am, Very sincerely yours,\n\nArchdeacon.\nOTTAWA, November 2, 1922.\n\nVery Rev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, referring to the Birch River Indian Day School. It is noted that there is an enrolment of 13 and an average attendance of 5, and that Mrs. Henrietta Audy has kept this school open with the exception of two weeks since the month of March.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that arrangements are being made with Mr. Agent Ogletree for quarterly returns from this school, and upon his recommendation school material and a supply of biscuits will be directed to the teacher. I believe you had better write immediately to Mr. Agent Ogletree informing him of Mrs. Audy's post office address.\n\nIf our representative recommends such action, the Department will allow a salary of $15.00 per month to the present teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nVenerable Archdeacon W. Thomas,\nSynod Office,\n901 Somerset Block,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, November 2nd, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has had considerable correspondence with the Winnipeg Synod Office of the Anglican Church concerning the advisability of commencing school operations at Birch River, near Shoal River, Matiowapah Agency. Information is now to hand that Mrs. Henrietta Audy has been teaching a day school at Birch River since March. You may have some information regarding this work and if you believe such action is advisable you should forward to the teacher, whose address will be given to you by Venerable Archdeacon Thomas, quarterly returns, a register and requisition forms. These articles are being mailed to you under separate cover.\n\nThe Dawson authorities suggest that a salary of $15.00 a month be offered to Mrs. Audy, who is an Indian woman without much education. The Department would like your recommendation in this connection. We will supply certain classroom supplies and biscuits for a noonday lunch upon your suggestion, but would be pleased to have a special report regarding the advisability of offering even a small salary to Mrs. Audy.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

His Lordship Bishop Thomas is not in favour of this activity at the present time. If it becomes advisable to open a day school the Church have a building which the Department could use for a school. However, the cause is so doubtful that capital expense is undesirable. The Indian children that would attend belong to a group of families which have migrated from Shoal River, where there is a good building and a good teacher.\n\nSee file no. 11\n\nMay 1926.\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nThe Bishop of Brandon believes it advisable to give the Birch River Day School another trial. He is of the opinion, however, that Mr. Agent Ogletree is opposed to it on the ground that the children would be better off in residential schools.\n\nBy\n\n[Signature]\n\nMay 5, 1926\nSir,\n\nI would recommend that a day school be opened at the Birch River Reserve (No. 65 C, Swan Lake).\n\nThere are about 14 children of school age on this Reserve, who have not attended school for some time. The logs are up for the school building, and only the material will be required to finish it and the Indians will do all the work, providing they get some provisions while they are working.\n\nUp to date I have been opposed to this school as I intended to have these children put in the Elkhorn School, but on account of the bad reports from Elkhorn, it is impossible to get these children to go there. If the Department will consider opening this school, I will have an estimate prepared of the cost at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 9, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, recommending the re-opening of the Birch River Indian Day School.

There is no doubt at all that they are sincere and unanimous in a desire to have a Day School opened in their midst. About three years ago, and on the recommendation of Mr. Ogletree, they put up the logs for a building in the belief that a school was about to be opened. The logs still stand, and the men are ready at any time to complete the building, in fact I am confident that they are prepared to do everything within their power if only a School can be established for the education of their children. In this they are undoubtedly sincere. I took a census of the children and found them to number in all 27, sixteen of them being of school age. They are entirely illiterate, not one being able to read or write, and having no opportunities their general intelligence appears to be of a low grade. I spoke to\nthe parents on the subject of Elkhorn but it did not appeal to them at all, chiefly because it was an unknown place to them and because of its distance.\n\nWhile I am absolutely with you in a desire to maintain the enrollment at Elkhorn, yet I honestly think that this is a place from which we cannot, at the present time, expect to obtain any support. The children are too illiterate, their parents are frightened with the thought of parting with them, the distance from the Reserve to the Railway is great, the means of communication are practically nil, and for these several reasons I earnestly hope that you will favour the opening of a Day School at this place.\n\nIf such should be your decision, and I greatly hope it will, then I will advance the work in every possible way, and will nominate a well-trained teacher who has taken her course at St. Christopher's College, Blackheath, and whose training in the Froebel system makes her specially suitable for this particular place.\n\nI am, dear Commissioner Graham,\n\nEver sincerely yours.\n\n\u2014 Brandon.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nD REGINA, SASK. April 11th, 1930\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nWhile in Brandon recently attending the Bull Sale, I met His Lordship, the Bishop of Brandon, who discussed with me the matter of establishing an Indian Day School on the Birch River Reserve. I told him I was of the opinion that we should put forth every effort to recruit the children from this reserve for the Elkhorn Residential School, and that Day Schools were, generally speaking, not a success. I asked the Bishop when he next visited the reserve to go into the matter fully and ascertain if we could not get these parents to support the Elkhorn School by sending their children to that point. I am enclosing herewith copy of a letter which I have just received from him, from which you will see that he has not been very successful.\n\nI am still of the opinion that the children from this reserve should be sent to Elkhorn, however. When the Brandon children leave Elkhorn, this school will be short of pupils, and I think it is up to the Department to assist the Principal and keep this school up to strength, as I consider it one of the best schools we have.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C.

They are very poor and have been brought to Christianity through the efforts of the Church. They have no money but they do not want it. They live by working for farmers and doing any work they can get about the town. In summer they camp in the neighbourhood of Portage la Prairie and in winter they live in the woods to the southeast of the town. Our Church would like to begin a School for the benefit of the children and we are anxious to hear in prospect to rent a building. We are willing to pay something reasonable to get a good teacher and my object now is to ascertain what the Department can do to help us in this work. Our aim is to rent a room in Portage la Prairie for the summer and put an efficient teacher in charge and if the School is at all successful as we hope to have a building erected in the woods where the Indians camp for the winter so that School may be maintained its clear record. If the Indian population are to learn to be a menace to the peace\nThe proper of the County they must be Christianized and educated & the best hope is with the Chiefs and here our desire that they might be educated. The Department was pleased to find an allowance of $250 per annum to carry out School on the Sioux Reserve at the Bird Lake Band and we hope that equal consideration may be given to this request. The intention is to begin the School without delay & a suitable Teacher has been secured and we only wish to get the assistance of the recognition of the Department to enable us to proceed. I shall get the number of families as soon as possible and so put in a press in full force & can assure you that there are children enough to make a good School and that they do accept offers when the School is opened.\n\nWith much respect,\n\n[Signature]\n\nL.

I have been informed by Mr. Robertson that there are thirty-five children of school age among the Sioux tribe here and several others who are anxious to go to school.

Secretary in the matter which has been brought under the notice of the Department and other parties. The Indian Census reports that the Indians in question belong to the Oak River & Oak Lake Reserves, that\nif they are desirous\nof having a school\nestablished for their\nbenefit on either of\ntheir Reserves, he\nwould recommend\nthat aid be given,\nbut he cannot advise\nthe granting of assistance\nunder the circumstances\nfor School of a Band;\nthat if it were established\nsuch a precedent it\nwould have application\nthroughout all over the country\nfor similar assistance,\nwhich would probably\nresult in its being\nused as a further\ninducement to Indians\nto leave their Reserves.\n\nThere is no doubt\na great deal in the\nviews expressed by the\nIndian Agent in the\nmatter of the effect\nin question to discourage\nIndians from locating\nthemselves in the\nvicinity of towns\nwhile centres, other Reserves,\ndo not exist, as\nvarious evils inevitably\nattend their doing so.\n\nReserves\nReserves, though they are provided for the Indians, if they are not able to obtain subsistence for themselves, the U.S. is always ready to assist them. There is, therefore, an excuse for the Indians leaving their Reserves, especially in the neighborhood of towns or white centers.\n\nSuch a course is attended with the diminution of themselves, and also Indians to whatever nuisance to the white settlers. I thought and that it was my duty recently that I noticed in the public press papers reports of poor subsistence existing amongst these Sioux Indians at Fort Peck. I have been in communication with the Indian agent with a view to the affording of the same but he informs me that he is powerless to prevent it, as the Indians have so many facilities in a place like Fort Peck to obtain liquor without his knowing.\nKnowing anything about it.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOver\nRev.

It should be secured and to secure such an establishment for a school if deemed justifiable the district remains in charge and an institution started.

It was closed years ago for the following reasons. A portion of their reserve was required for a half-breed settlement & the Indians gave it up upon the understanding that they would be allowed land elsewhere in view of it. It appears now that no land else where will be given them, but the proceeds of the sale of that portion of their reserve which they gave up, shall be applied toward the payment of it. The Indians scattered after giving up their land & homes, & the school had to be closed. They are now returning to that part of the reserve they think will make them comfortable. Their school may be reopened. Last winter 16 children were in the...\nReserve School age.\n\nI have just seen Mr. Inspector Maclellan who says there is no appropriation for the school, & cannot possibly be before July 1860. Mr. Maclellan was asked to state the requirements of the band in this respect, the Indians sent in a request that the school be opened at the beginning of next winter. I am surprised to find that another physician will have to sleep before the children, who by act already are entitled to school. Can again receive instructions. The Indians did not tell me in what matter if putting with a portion of their reserve, they were asked by the then Agent of the D.O. to do so for the purpose above described.\n\nSomething like this from you soon\nthat we may proceed without\nwork without delay, for as the\nadvances the risk affecting a man into\nthe district becomes greater, so also does\nthe expense of transit.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.

Mr Hines states that many of the Indians are now returning to the Reserve and wish the school reopened; that last winter there were 16 children of school age on the reserve and that you were spoken to about the educational requirements of the band and informed the Indians that no appropriation was made for the school and that it could not be opened before next year.\n\nProvision for this school was made in last year's estimates and dropped from those of the current year, as you stated in your annual report that the school previously in operation was unsuccessful.\n\nMr Davis has been informed that it does not appear that any good results would be obtained were the school reopened, but that you would be written to for a report in regard to Mr Hines' application. The Department would like you to report fully.\n\nS.R. Harlatt, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nin this matter, but nothing can, however, be done about reopening the school this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary\nOffice of the Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n\nLAKE MANITOBA INSPECTORATE\n\nPortage la Prairie, Man., 24th Aug. 1890\n\nRef. Your letter, No. 119,410 of the 18th ultimo.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of above date asking for a report with reference to an application you have received from the Rev. Mr Hines through Mr T.O. Davis, M.P., relative to reopening of the Indian School at Cumberland in the Pas Agency.\n\nI have the honor to report that I do not think it advisable to reopen this School until the Indians decide to remain permanently on the Reserve, the School was closed before through lack of attendance and up to the present time I cannot see that the conditions have altered in any way, at times the Indians may promise to remain on the Reserve but they soon change their minds and scatter to their hunting and fishing grounds, in the summer they congregate for a short time on the Reserve and then disband for the balance of the year, some go to Sturgeon River, some to Pine Bluff, and a few who cannot hunt remain on the Reserve, the Indians of this Band depend almost entirely on hunting and fishing for a living.\n\nThe Secretary.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nthey do not care for cattle and the few they had we have had to take away from them as they would not take care of them, the soil of the Reserve is poorly adapted for gardening and but little is done in this respect, it is the policy of The Hudson Bay Company to keep the Indians of the Saskatchewan out on the hunting grounds and this Band is particularly under this influence and really I cannot see that there is anything else for them to do as they cannot make a living on the Reserve.\n\nThe Indian Day School at its best is a very poor institution and when the children cannot attend regularly it is money thrown away to try to teach them, if they are absent but a short time they appear to forget all they had previously learned.\n\nI may say that I have had a conversation with Mr Hines about this matter and I informed him that I would ask that a sum be placed in the estimates next year to reopen the School and it could be used providing by that time the Indians had settled down on the Reserve, but that nothing could be done this year, as no provision had been made to pay a Teacher.\n\nI might add that there is a School on the Reserve supported by the Government of the N.W.T., it is for the benefit of the Half-breeds, but Mr Hines objects to the Indian Children attending, on the ground that it is a Catholic School.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.R. Macdonald\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, 5th September, 1899.\n\nSir:-\n\nIn further reference to the communication forwarded by you from the Rev. Mr. Hines, of Prince Albert, asking for the re-opening of the Cumberland School in the Pas Agency, closed for the past two years, I beg to say that a report has just been received from Mr. Inspector Marlatt, who was asked for a report in this matter, stating that he does not consider it advisable to re-open this School until the Indians decide to remain permanently on the Reserve. The School was closed before through lack of attendance and up to the present time the Inspector states that he does not see that the conditions have altered in any way.\n\nIn summer they congregate for a short time on the Reserve and then disband for the balance of the year.\n\nMr. Marlatt also states that he had a conversation with Mr. Hines on this matter and informed that gentleman that he would ask that a sum be placed in the Estimates next year to re-open the School, which could be used provided by that time the Indians settled down on the Reserve, but that nothing could be done this year as no provision had been made to pay a teacher.\n\nI am informed that there is a school on the Reserve supported by the Northwest Government for the benefit of the half-breeds, but that Mr. Hines objects to the Indian children attending on the ground that it is a Catholic School.\n\nT. O. Davis, Esq., M. P.,\nPrince Albert,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ. D. McLean\n\nN. W. T.\nThe Sec'y\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to bring to your notice a change in the teacher at Cumberland which I desire to make, - I ask the Department to sanction it as I believe it is for the ultimate good of the work. The time is so short to the close of this quarter, & communications with Cumberland & the Pas so infrequent that I have been obliged to anticipate your approval, to instruct the two men to make the change. I am sorry for this but I only learned of the possibility of making the change when I was there a fortnight ago, & have only today arrived out. Mr. Nathan Vetter has been teaching at Cumberland, & is an excellent young man, a most painstaking, & worthy of encouragement. But he has had no training as a teacher, & I want to give him a year or two at Strip School & College to fit him for greater usefulness. Till now I could not see any way to replacing him. But I found that there was at Assinawkewin (Cedar Lake) a young man, son of a Councilor, I think, a pupil with good recommendation from Willow School, who desires to become a teacher.\n\nPrichard Sturge\nPrinell Albert\nSept. 25th, 1909.\nUnfortunately, I have not a memo of his name, but his father is John Daniel, so I will have his name sent to you. I have therefore instructed him to go to Cumberland, live with Rev. J. R. Settee, who is in charge of the school there (Mr. Daniel). I have told Nathan Settee to finish this quarter, send in all returns before I come up to Prince Albert, and I will put him to school to train for a teacher. I trust you will sanction this.\n\nMrs. James Settee and Mr. Sandie keep importing me for a school, and more than hinting that the I.D. will be pleased to have them. I always answer that they have never satisfied either the Dept or me, so that I shall not lend my name to their names. I trust that you will, if they seek your influence, consult their past records, and remain firm.\n\nI asked you to notify me if you decided to send the lady teacher to La Corne instead of E. Athabasca. I have heard nothing from you, but I hear that without waiting for the end of the quarter, and without answering any letter, you have placed her there. I respectfully submit to your wish in the matter, against my judgment, only asked for an answer; and it seems strange that I did not get that answer.\n\nI remain yours faithfully,\n\nJ. H. Saskatchewan\nOttawa, October 8th, 1909.\n\nRight Rev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 23rd ultimo I beg to say that in view of your recommendation Mr. Daniel may be provisionally engaged as teacher for the Cumberland School. His retention in the position to depend on his success.\n\nA note of your Lordship's objections to the engagement of Mr. James Settee and Mr. William Lundie will be made by this Department and should they again apply for employment due consideration will be given thereto.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Rev. Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Secretary.\n\nThe Right Reverend J. A. Newnham,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn a letter of Oct. 8th you were good enough to accept my nomination to Cumberland School of Mr Daniels, of Cedar Lake. I regret to inform you that I have just heard that Mr Daniels has not come in to take up the appointment, and will not now be able to do so. The school has not been closed, as the former teacher, Mr Nathan Jette, stayed on at some inconvenience.\n\nI have now, on the recommendation of Rev M.A. Lefler, of Wet Pas, as well as on my own behalf, that of the man nominated Mr Keddie, of Cumberland, to the post. He has already commenced work, and I stand in need of your endorsement of his appointment. Mr Keddie is a gentleman of good education, and his brother-in-law Mr Jones teaches the Separate School there. Mr Keddie has had a little experience of teaching, and I believe he is doing his duty.\n\nIf you think fit to notify him direct, and to make any instructions to him, address Mr Keddie, Cumberland House, via Fort de la Corne, Sask.\n\nI remain\n\nin faithfully,\n\nJ.M. Sark, Missionary\n\nSee separate seal.\nOttawa, November 4th, 1909.\n\nRight Rev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship's letter of the 29th ultimo, nominating Mr. Keddie, of Cumberland, as teacher of the Cumberland Indian School in place of Mr. Daniels, whose appointment was previously approved, but who was not able to take the position.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Keddie's appointment is approved and you may advise him accordingly.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Rev. Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Right Reverend J. A. Newnham,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, March 15th, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report on the Cumberland Indian Day School which shows that Nathan Settee is still in charge.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer to Your Lordship's letter of October 29th last, and the Department's reply thereto of the 4th of the following month, in which the appointment of Mr. Keddie as teacher of this school was approved. Be good enough to state whether it is Your Lordship's intention to carry out the proposed plan to send Mr. Settee to college.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nMarch 26, 1910\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to reply to your letter and to say that it was not till January that I learned that Mr. Setter was not going to college and was still teaching the Cumberland school. I am sorry that I omitted then to notify you of this but I thought you might have learned it through another channel. Mr. Setter is NOT going to college. I am quite prepared to let him give up the school to Mr. Keddie after March 31st, if you prefer it and if Mr. Keddie will still take it. If you can let me know at once which man you wish to take it I will send down word by the next mail.\n\nI will notify you when Mr. Morris goes to Grand Rapids.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. A. Saskatchewan\nOttawa, April 1st, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 26th ultimo in reference to the Cumberland School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the matter of replacing Mr. Settee will be left to Your Lordship's discretion. If Your Lordship is of opinion that Mr. Keddie is better qualified and more competent than Mr. Settee it might be well to make the change. Mr. Settee has in the past done fairly good work, but the attendance has been poor and Mr. Keddie's influence might produce an improvement in this respect. The object of the Department in writing to Your Lordship was simply to ascertain why the proposed arrangement had not been carried out.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nBishopsthorpe, Prince Albert, Sask.\n26-4-10.\n\nThe Secretary, Dept Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir:\n\n1. Yours No-119410/1, April 1st, Cumberland school.\nI have no desire to exchange Settee for Keddie. Mr Settee has been long in the work and does fairly well. I only proposed Mr Keddie when I thought Settee was going to college. Settee has abandoned this idea. I do not think Mr Keddie better qualified to teach Indians, though probably better educated. I think Settee had better stay on at present. Should he wish to leave, I should be glad to nominate Mr Keddie.\n\nJ.A. Saskatchewan.\nOttawa, May 9, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 26th ultimo, and in reply to that portion in which you refer to the Cumberland School I beg to say that the Department is quite prepared to carry out your suggestion that Mr. Settee should remain in charge of the school for a time.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, May 13, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nAn examination of the records of the Cumberland school for sometime past shows that the attendance is very low. In this respect it is one of the poorest schools in The Pas Agency.\n\nThe Department is desirous of obtaining some improvement and would be glad to know whether you have any suggestions to offer as to how this may be done. The experience of the Department shows that a great deal depends upon the efforts of the teacher, who not only must make his school work interesting, but must endeavour to obtain the confidence of the parents as well. It is quite understood that at certain seasons of the year the attendance must be low on account of the absence of the parents and children, but your school shows very little change at any time, which leads the Department to think that there may be something wrong in the management of the school.\n\nIn this connection I have to ask you to be good enough to make your report on the form sent you on February 11, last, at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nNathan Settee, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nCumberland House, Gaev\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of No.\n\nI have the honour to advise you that the teacher of the day school at Cumberland, Nathan, Settee and the teacher of the day school at Moose Lake, T. Elijah Constant, both have resigned their positions this to take effect after the end of the present quarter, an effort should be made to replace them at an early date so as to keep the pupils in hand.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 30, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of your letter of the 17th instant in which you state that Mr. Nathan Settee, teacher at the Cumberland school, has resigned his position I have to ask you to be good enough to communicate with His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan, with a view to securing the services of a teacher for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nFred Fischer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHudson Bay Junction, Sask.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nCumberland School: I hear that Mr. Nathan Lettee has resigned the school, though he has not informed me of it. I, at once wrote to Mr. John Keddie of Cumberland and asked him to take it on from October last. Your Department had already, long ago accepted his appointment, when I thought the school was vacant; but the school was not then vacant so he did not take it. Mr. Keddie is well educated and will I believe do his duty. I trust you will accept him, and notify him of his appointment, and instruct him as to his duties, reports, etc.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.A. Saskatchewan.\nOttawa, October 12, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of Your Lordship's letter of the 3rd instant in which you refer to the Cumberland School I beg to say that the appointment of Mr. Keddie as teacher of this school is approved, his retention in the position to be dependent upon the success with which he meets.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev.

I have decided to undertake investigation as leader on the Cumberland Reserve.\n\nSuch investigation to take place at once.\n\nI sincerely regret that my endeavours have met with so little success but the local people are so hard to influence that I am completely discouraged.\n\nI am enclosing return address label and I hold the keys of your disposal.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nJohn Adams Redden\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that J.A. Keddie teacher of the Cumberland day school has sent in his resignation as teacher on Cumberland reserve. He closed the school on the 22nd Sept. and accepted, I am told, a position as accountant with the Revillon Bro. trading Co at Pelican Narrows. His letter, with school returns reached me on the 25th, three days after he had closed the school. He left the keys of school and store house with Corpl. Belcher of the R.N.W.M.P.\n\nCorpl. Belcher passed through here, a few days ago, but I did not see him as I was away on a trip to Carrot River Indian timber reserve. As soon as he gets back I will see him and make arrangements for the distributing of destitute clothing.\n\nI will leave it with the Department, whether or not they will pay Mr. Keddie's salary for Sept. quarter, as he failed in giving the proper three months notice.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsste Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 10, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo in reference to the teacher of the Cumberland Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in accordance with our regulations, Mr. Keddie is only being paid for the time that he taught during the September quarter, viz.\u2014fifteen days.

As there are only four children at present living in the vicinity of the Cumberland school it should be closed at the end of this quarter and remain closed until such time as there is a sufficient number of children at that point to warrant its being re-opened. You will be good enough to inform Mr. Young that his resignation is accepted and arrange with Mr. Chamberlain for his transfer. He should commence his duties at the Red Earth school as soon as possible after the beginning of the new quarter, his salary to be at the same rate as is now paid him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to Department letter 119,410/1, Sept. 4th, I beg to report that I have just heard from the Chief at Cumberland who informs me that some of the Indians who had decided to stay on the Reserve have now moved their families off so that there would not be sufficient children to demand a school.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\nOttawa, October 2, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo reporting that you have just heard from the Chief at Cumberland, who informed you that some of the Indians who had decided to stay on the reserve have now moved their families off, so that there would not be sufficient children to demand a school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as there will not be sufficient children on this reserve to demand a school, no action will be taken at present in regard to the re-opening of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pass Man.\nOttawa, April 10, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 1617-116 of the first instant, referring to the request of Archdeacon J. A. MacKay that the school being built at Pine Bluff be undenominational. I have noted the enclosed correspondence and I approve of your letter in this connection.\n\nThe history of school activities at Cumberland House is, to the best of information at my disposal, as follows: The Hudson Bay Factor was interested in a school in 1894 at Cumberland House and the Rev. J. Hines, Church of England Clergyman, in 1899. From 1909 to 1917, the Bishop of Saskatchewan was responsible for the Church of England Indian Day School that operated at Cumberland House. There has been no school for the Indians of this locality since the Church of England school closed in 1917. At that time, it appears that there was a migration of half the band from the vicinity of Cumberland Post Office to Pine Bluff.\n\nThe information contained in your No. 1481-116, of the 3rd of December, last, is that there are 17 R. C. children of school age at Pine Bluff and that the people still resident at Cumberland House will, in all probability, move to the first named site in the future.\n\nBefore the Department goes on record in connection with the future of this school, I would be glad if you could give me what available information you have concerning the religious belief of those resident at Pine Bluff and the faith of those that you believe will move there in the immediate future.\n\nYou will remember that the Department is at present sanctioning the R. C. management of the school now under construction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. W.

The Chief and his Band have asked that a Boarding School be established here under the Church of England. They claim a day school is of no value to their children as they cannot leave their children in Winter having to take them along to their hunting grounds, they positively refuse to consider sending their children to any more Industrial Schools as they claim their children are too far away and never come back, viz they die at school, and this they find very hard. I had a conversation with Mr. Fox the Missionary in regard to this and he says that it is the only solution to the school question, namely to have a Boarding School. The Building should be put up as cheap as possible and serve as a home for the children throughout the year where they could be taught the year around, instead of the way it has been conducted, viz. about two months in the year. Mr. Fox also states that he is willing that the school can either be denominational or undenominational, just as the govt. see fit, but I think the Church of England has the first say.\n\nSgn. J.G.

Stewart esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been requested to respectfully submit for your consideration, the unanimous request of the Split Lake Band. They desire a Boarding School on this Reserve. On account of the Indians being absent from the Fort or Reserve, from September until June, a day school is not much use to the Band as a means of educating their children. This request was made about eight years ago and commissioner Laird said in the future the Dept. might fit, but not at present owing to the difficulty of getting material to Split Lake. Owing to the building of the R.R.Railway, the absence of a day school and the desire for education on the part of the Band, this request is again respectfully submitted.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.G.Fox,\nAnglican Missionary.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 14, 1912.\n\nRev.

Stewart on 17th August, 1912, relative to Council meetings held at the time of Treaty trip at Nelson House.\n\nRe School\n\nThe school at this is a very poor building. It is far too small for the number of children that could go to school. This building is only 18 by 16. It should at any rate be 30 by 20 and roofed with Rubber Roof Felting, heavy ply. They also wish that a male teacher be appointed here for their teacher as the Missionary has not been able to teach the children the full time. Benches and desks should be made also.\n\nThe Chief and Band also ask for a Boarding School to be established on their Reserve. They give the same reason as the Indians at Split Lake. Out of thirty children they have sent to the Industrial Schools, only two have returned. This is not much encouragement to them to send their children to these kind of schools. Now this Band is made up of Methodists and Roman Catholics about evenly divided. They have about 200 children or school age. This I know as I got them all together and counted them. Nearly all these children have to go to their parents' hunting grounds, let us say in September and they do not return till the beginning of June or the end of May. All those that are left around the Mission are those whose parents work for their living by driving dogs etc., so that there are only a few children left to go to school, so few that they can be taught in the kitchen of the Missionary's house. That is why they are asking for a Boarding School, so that they can leave their children at school, knowing at the same time that they are not far away from them. They also state that they are willing from time to time to provide the school with meat and fish as they can afford it.\n\nSgn. J.G. Stewart Agent\nOttawa, October 5, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of your report of the 17th of August, last, in reference to the establishment of a boarding school at Nelson House I beg to say that the Department has no funds available at present for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Stewart, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nMay 7th, 1918.\n\nDear Mr. Perrier -\n\nI was very sorry that I was not able to see you when you visited Ottawa last week. I have only returned to the office today.\n\nMr. MacKenzie tells me that you contemplate the erection of a boarding school building at Nelson House to accommodate 30 pupils. In this connection I wish to remind you of our previous conversation in which I asked you to submit a memorandum of your proposals in this respect to me for submission to the Minister. I understand that it is your intention to give orders at once for the erection of the building, but I cannot make any definite promise with regard to a grant until the proposition is placed before the Minister and receives his sanction.\n\nI shall be glad if you will let me have these details at once.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nPrincipal,\nBrandon Industrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nReplying to yours of May 7th, re Boarding School at Nelson House:\n\nMr. Ogilvie, your architect sketched for me the outline of the building that we propose erecting. He can give you all particulars as to size, etc. I placed the question of erecting a building before the General Board and they voted $2,000.00. I also placed it before the W.M.S. of our Church and we are expecting a similar amount from them. The idea is that this building shall be built out of logs and that the people shall do the work under the guidance of our missionary who is a carpenter. We purpose giving them a certain amount of rations while they are at the work and also furnish the windows, roofing, flooring, hardware, etc. We have about thirty iron beds at Morley, some utensils, a kitchen range and other stoves that we purpose shipping out as at least a beginning of the furnishings.\n\nI may say that on the strength of what passed between us when Mr. Arnup, Mr. Denyes and I were in your office, we assured the Board that if we built the building, the Department would give us the usual grant up to thirty children.\n\nI was making my programme to be at Nelson House during Treaty time to take up the question of site and building with the people. This will be, I believe about the 15th of July.\n\nTrusting this will meet with the approval of the Minister, I remain\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\n\nGRF\nJune 10th, 1918.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier -\n\nI have your letter of the 1st inst., replying to mine of the 7th ultimo, regarding the establishment of a boarding school at Nelson House.\n\nWhen discussing this matter I did not gather that it was your intention to proceed at once with the erection of the building, but that I was first to have an opportunity of obtaining a special appropriation for the payment of the per capita grant involved.\n\nAs you are aware our vote is now very closely estimated, and I would not like to pledge payment of the grant, particularly as I did not have an opportunity of interviewing the Minister, the Hon. Mr. Neighen, owing to his hurried departure with the Right Hon. the Prime Minister to London immediately after the closing of the session.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nPrincipal,\nBrandon Industrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\nI would, therefore, ask you not to take any further action until such time as the matter can be finally dealt with.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nREPORT OF VISIT TO NELSON HOUSE\non the Lake Winnipeg District.\n\nI left Brandon in a motor car Monday, July 8th at 9 A.M., for Neepawa and from there to the Pas by Canadian Northern Railway passing through Dauphin, Swan River, and Hudson Bay Junction; from the Pas by the Hudson Bay Railroad, a Government road, to Mile 137; then to Nelson House a journey of three days in a canoe, arriving at 10 P.M., Friday, July 12th.\n\nOn Saturday we held a meeting of the Chief, Council and an audience of about three hundred people at which we discussed the education of their children and the building of a boarding school that would accommodate thirty pupils in residence. The discussion proceeded under the following heads:\n\n1. Should a boarding school be built?\n2. The impossibility of the Government building during war time.\n3. Where should the school be built? 1st.- Mile 137 or some point on the Hudson Bay railway. 2nd.- On the present mission property. 3rd.- Some other point on the Reserve or some site near the Reserve.\n\nThe people were unanimous on the question of building the school. They were also unanimous that it be built on the Reserve only one man seemed to be in favor of the railroad. If built there little or no help would be received from the people. It would require separate staff to run it. The objections of the people would be raised if it was too far away as a reason for non-support. I suggested to the Chief that the best place to build was on the present mission property so that it could be under the eye and care of our missionary. The children and staff would also be convenient for service. The class-room could be used for worship on extreme cold days or when only a few people were home. There is also quite a bit of good land ready for gardening.\n\nThe following conditions were unanimously agreed to and a document containing them signed by the Chief and two Councillors on behalf of the people. Nearly a hundred men subscribed their names to the paper pledging to do their bit.\n\n1. That we will furnish all the logs and lumber of every kind that can be furnished in the community for the construction of the building.\n2. We will prepare the site, dig the cellar and put in the foundation.\n3. We will furnish all the labor required to put up the building.\n4. We will supply all the furniture for the dormitory, beds, chairs, benches, tables, etc.\n\n5. We will freight all the material supplied by the Methodist Church for the building and furnish the same from Mile 137 free of charge.\n\n6. We promise to keep attendance of the school up to thirty pupils.\n\n7. We will furnish all the fuel required for the heating of the building and cooking, free of charge.\n\n8. That those having children attending the school shall furnish fish and native food for the same to the best of their ability also choose skins for mocassins for their own children, free of charge.\n\n9. That all others will supply native food and skins for mocassins at fair cash prices. It is understood that the great bulk of food is to be secured from the lake, forest, and land, the boys assisting in the working of the gardens on the half day policy.\n\n10. The people who have children attending school to assist to freight food and supplies from Mile 137 free of charge.\n\nOn behalf of the Methodist Church we promised the following:\n\n1. We will provide for the building, windows, doors, roofing, nails and all material of every kind not available in the community.\n\n2. We will provide one good mechanic to oversee the construction of the building.\n\n3. We will provide rations of tea, sugar and flour if allowed by the Food Controller, to those who help to construct the building and freight the supplies from Mile 137 and provide lumber and logs.\n\n4. We will supply stoves, kitchen range, dishes, cooking utensils and all furniture necessary for the staff quarters.\n\n5. The management of the school to be under a missionary who shall be principal. A matron shall have oversight and responsibility for the welfare of the children and care of the building. A properly qualified teacher, one other male assistant to the principal.\n\nThe building to be sixty feet and to be known as a log building with ample accommodation for thirty pupils and the staff. To accomplish the above the Church has made a grant of $2,000.00 and the Woman's Missionary Society $1,000.00.\nThe Church was filled to overflowing at each of the three services on the Sabbath. At the afternoon service four children were presented for Christian baptism and the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper administered to about one hundred and eight. Forty of these came for the first time in response to an invitation to yield themselves to the Lord for an effort to lead the Christian life. The most of the forty were young men and women from fifteen to twenty years of age. The spirit and result of these services or the Sabbath were sufficient encouragement for the journey from Brandon to Nelson House.\n\nOn Monday Mr. McDonald, Indian Agent from the Pas paid the Annual Treaty of five dollars to each man, woman and child, and fifteen dollars to each Councilor and twenty-five dollars to the Chief, paying a total of two thousand, four hundred and forty dollars to four hundred and eighty treaty Indians. The entire population being over five hundred people. Many sports were enjoyed. Special mention might be made of two canoe races and a sack race. Twenty-one dollars were distributed in prizes. We spent Tuesday with the people, marrying four couples and holding a farewell service with the people.\n\nThe work of our missionary is greatly appreciated by the people and a very friendly spirit exists between him and his flock. The mode of living is by fishing, hunting, gardening, freighting; and many of the men are getting employment on the construction of the Hudson Bay Railway. Many of the people have gardens. The homes are kept neat and clean and altogether they are a very progressive, independent, fine band of Indians. This is shown by the work they are undertaking towards the construction of a school for the education of their children.\n\nBefore closing, I wish to make mention of the very efficient, faithful and much needed work of Miss Alice H. Jackson as missionary nurse, an agent of the W. M. S. of our Church. It is one of those illustrations of how much can be accomplished by a consecrated woman going in and out of the houses of the people, dispensing medicine, helping the sick and instructing the women on the necessity of keeping their homes in a sanitary condition. She also teaches how to care for the young children and many other minor instructions that cannot be accomplished by a male missionary, among a tribe not many generations removed from heathenism. The boat provided with the small gasoline engine is of great service in reaching those who need her care and attentions.\n\nThis work is of such importance and necessity that someone should be provided to continue it when Miss Jackson goes out on furlough.\n\nToo much praise and support cannot be given to those who so unselfishly give their lives by going to these far away fields and labor for the extension of the Kingdom among our native people.\nOn Mr. Butty's return from the East he has brought the war conditions and needs of the Allies before the people. At one of the Sunday services I spoke to them of the food situation. Before leaving Mr. Butty handed me three hundred dollars as their contribution to the Red Cross, which was contributed by the band assisted by the traders and other white people attending Treaty. The request is made that this contribution shall be given to the General Board of Missions in trust with the understanding that if in their judgment there is any war fund more needed and which would be more appropriate for their offering to be given to, this should be done. If not, then it is to be given to the Red Cross Fund.\n\nOne Wednesday we called at the Treaty ground, married two more couples and I started to shake hands with the people. Our interpreter requested me to stand while the people came to me. After shaking hands with about four hundred we stood surrounded amid the waving of handkerchiefs, hand full of hands and firing of guns and rifles, feeling thankful that we had been honored with such a generous welcome, such kind hospitality and spontaneous farewell from these people of the forest in our most northerly mission.\nMr. Duncan C.

Our Woman's Missionary Society have voted $1,000 and the General Board at this session here in Toronto this week have voted $2,000 to aid in the construction of this building. It will have an attendance of thirty pupils. By placing this in the list of schools with a per capita grant in the estimates for the coming session of Parliament, you will greatly oblige.\n\nI may say that from what was said in your office at the time that Mr. Arnp and myself were there last spring I have made a promise that the per capita grant would be forthcoming if we built the school. This, of course, I understand to be subject to the action of Parliament.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nP. Perrier\n\nDuncan C.

This school is conducted by Rev. Fr Egenolf, O.M.I., and his assistant Rev. Br Drouin, and has been in operation for the last two or three years. The matters taught are: reading, writing, arithmetic, singing and good manners. The average number of pupils is twenty.\n\nThe parties above mentioned, with the approbation of His Lordship Bishop Charlebois, have taken this initiative upon themselves and the results attained to the present time are very satisfactory and encouraging. I may add that the R.C. Mission has taken upon its charge all expenses made in connection with this school.\n\nIn view of these facts, I would suggest that this school be brought under the authority of the Department and treated as a day school. The Treaty Agent could examine the children and, if desirable, send his report to the Department.\n\nI would also ask for school stationery, viz: paper, pencils, pens, pen holders, writing books for beginners (with model letters), copy-books, scribblers, chalk, etc. I leave the choice to the judgment of the Superintendent of the school branch. If those articles are sent by mail please address them as follows: Rev. Fr Egenolf, O.M.I., Lac du Brochet, Via Turgeon Landing, Sask. and Le Pas, Man. If by Express, send to Rev. Fr Egenolf, c/o Bishop Charlebois, Le Pas, Man.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph [signature]\n\n[Stamp: School Branch]\nOTTAWA, May 30th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Charlebois, Le Pas, has requested that a grant for teacher's salary be provided for a day school which he states has been in existence during the last two or three years at Lac des Brochets. The school has been conducted by Rev. Father Egenolf, O.M.I., and his assistant Rev. Brother Drouin. He states that there is an average of 20 pupils in attendance, and that the results obtained at the present time are very satisfactory and encouraging, and that the R.C. Mission has, up to the present time, undertaken all expenses in connection with the school.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to instruct the paying officer for Treaty #10, on the occasion of his next visit to the place, to visit the school and make a report upon the work being performed. He should state the number of Indian children of school age in the vicinity, and also the class-room facilities provided, and the progress being made. His Lordship was informed that the providing of the grant for teacher's salary would depend upon the reports received as to the work being performed. I will, therefore, be pleased if you will have the paying officer furnish a report upon his return, which you will be good enough to forward to the Department with any views you care to make regarding the Bishop's request.\n\nI may add that in the meantime the Department is forwarding a small quantity of school material to Bishop Charlebois, who will have the same sent in to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Graham,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nCanada Life Building,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn accordance with your request for a report on R. C. Mission School at Brochet, Sask., I talked this matter over with Father Eganolf, who is in charge, and obtained information as follows\u2014\n\nWhen in session school class is quartered in the largest room in the Mission House about 20' x 18' in dimension. There is no other suitable building or room now available, but a separate and complete boarding school building is planned for next spring as this room is hardly large enough to accommodate all, and is becoming a bit cramped with the increase of students. About half the timber for this school has already been hewed and is on the grounds. With a larger school\u2014boarding school\u2014attendance will undoubtedly increase as many would-be students are unable to attend on account of the itinerant life their parents are forced to lead in this country. The school, such as it is, has been in session intermittently for 3 years; more regular of late. The students are allowed 14 months vacation in summer, commencing June 10th, this year, and one week at Xmas.\n\nThe teaching up to the present time has been done almost entirely by Brother Urbain Drouin. He speaks Cree, Chippewyan, English and French, and I should judge is quite capable. The children are all taught Cree, and some English. Their English vocabulary is taught from \"De La Salle Reader\" Parts 1 and 2, by phonetic system. They are also taught elementary arithmetic, spelling, geography, writing and reading. The majority of students now in attendance are half-breeds. The school attendance since opening has fluctuated a bit, but has averaged about twenty for the three years since its opening. At the present time there are twenty-five students of school age, who attend regularly; Chippewyan boys attend regularly during the summer, but absent all winter. Father Eganolf informs me that twenty-five is about the average number of children of school age resident here, but this will be doubled on completion of Boarding School. The ages of school children now in attendance ranges from 7 to 14, and there are 17 boys and 8 girls.\n\nHoping this report meets with your approval,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs School Files (RG 10), Volume 6030, File 128-16-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nReferring to your No. 128-16-1 of the 19th inst., I beg to return, herewith, Dr. Hindson's report on the Roman Catholic Mission School at Lac des Brochet. When forwarding this report with others concerning Treaty No. 10 on the 17th inst., I had overlooked your letter of May 30th last asking for a special report, and the expression of my views in regard to His Lordship Bishop Charlebois' request for a grant towards a teacher's salary.\n\nDr. Hindson reports that the average number of children is twenty-five, and I think His Lordship's application for a grant for a teacher's salary should receive favourable consideration. The fact that the instruction given at the School by the Reverend Father in charge is satisfactorily conducted would appear to be further reason why his application should be favourably considered.\n\nI may state that when I got your letter of May 30th last I requested the Paying Officer to submit a report, but as I thought a report of this nature would be more satisfactorily and exhaustively dealt with by Dr. Hindson I requested him also to furnish me with a report. Mr. McKay, however, did not comply with my request.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW. H.

This report was forwarded by Mr. Commissioner Graham, who recommends, in view of the work being done, that the grant for teacher's salary should receive favourable consideration.\n\nI have, therefore, to inform you that in view of the reports received the Department will approve the providing of a grant at the rate of $500 per annum towards the salary of the teacher. Such grant will be paid quarterly upon receipt of the usual returns of attendance. This grant will be paid at the above rate from the first of the current fiscal year, viz: April 1st, last.\n\nI shall, therefore, be pleased if you will inform His Lordship Bishop Charlebois of the grant having been allowed, and request that instructions be given to Reverend Father Egenolf to prepare and forward returns showing the attendance for the quarters ending June 30th and September 30th, last, and also to forward promptly returns at the end of each quarter in future when grant for salary at the above rate will be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This brings up the question of the status of teachers at our day schools. I consider these workers are Civil Servants; but, as they appear to be exempt from the operation of the provisions of the Civil Service Act in so far as the principle of competition in the matter of appointment is concerned, I believe they should be classed as \"temporary.\"\n\nOnly permanent Civil Servants are eligible for superannuation and I propose, with your concurrence, to inform those teachers that enquire that they are ineligible.\n\nI have asked the Accountant and the Acting Assistant Deputy to initial this memorandum, if they concur in this opinion.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your authority to automatically increase the salaries of Indian day school teachers $100 per academic year at the end of each of 15, 20, 25 and 30 years' satisfactory service.

This brings up the question of the status of teachers at our day schools. I consider these workers are Civil Servants; but, as they appear to be exempt from the operation of the provisions of the Civil Service Act in so far as the principle of competition in the matter of appointment is concerned, I believe they should be classed as \"temporary\".\n\nOnly permanent Civil Servants are eligible for superannuation and I propose, with your concurrence, to inform those teachers that enquire that they are ineligible.\n\nI have discussed this question with the Accountant and the Acting Assistant Deputy and they concur in this opinion.\n\nRussell J. Ferrier\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, Sept. 8, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, with reference to superannuation. In reply I have to inform you that whereas teachers of Indian day schools are not appointed by the Civil Service Commission, they can not be classed as permanent Civil Servants and are therefore ineligible for superannuation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Enclosed you will find a copy of her election. Will you have the arrears of contributions checked, and when certified, forward a copy to this Department using the form supplied for that purpose.\n\nIn the meantime, until arrears are confirmed, it will be in order for you to deduct the amount of $4.08 from the monthly salary of the above, together with 5% of monthly salary to cover current contributions.

I also thank you for increase in salary in lieu of hours.\n\nWould you kindly let me know if there is any pension scheme for teachers in Indian Day Schools? I have quite a few years' service in Indian schools & I should be glad to pay into such a fund which would eventually give me a pension.\n\nWould you kindly send me the latest Year book report of Ind.

Only \"permanent\" civil servants are eligible for superannuation and as teachers are not appointed by the Civil Service Commission, they are not eligible to come under the provisions of the Superannuation Act.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F. H. Paget]\nChief Accountant and Purchasing Agent\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.,\nFebruary 18, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nDuring the fiscal years 1928-29 to 1934-35 teachers of Indian day schools were paid bonus at a flat rate of $150 each. This practice was approved by P. C. 2261, of November 11th, 1928, and re-affirmed for the fiscal year 1934-35 by P. C. 1036, dated June 21st, 1934. Copies of these Minutes are attached hereto.\n\nP. C. 1/712, dated May 6th, 1936, provided new ranges of compensation with a view to the discontinuance of the bonus. Section B of Section II of Civil Service regulations re Bonus and Salary, approved by this last mentioned Order in Council, was considered authority for adding $150 to the salary of each teacher for the fiscal year 1935-36.\n\nI understand that Miscellaneous Vote No. 492 includes an item of $65,950 for salary adjustments in the Outside Service of Indian Affairs. Arrangements should now be made for a transfer from this Vote to Indian Education of the funds necessary to pay the increase in salaries of teachers of Indian day schools. The amount required is $55,031.25, as shown on the attached list.\n\nThe Treasury Board will give favourable consideration to our application provided it is approved by the Civil Service Commission. I wish to recommend that steps be taken to secure such approval.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Education.\nCutler, Ontario,\nFebruary 26, 1927\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nMay I ask would you kindly advise if the Department of Indian Affairs, owing to my age and long service, would now consider me eligible for Superannuation some time hence, and if arrangements might be made for my paying into the Superannuation Fund while teaching for the future.\n\nHoping for an encouraging reply regarding this matter, I am,\n\nVery respectfully yours.\n\nJean M. Herrnott\nOttawa, March 7, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Bowman:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to superannuation for Miss Jean Macdonald, teacher of the Serpent River Indian Day School, at Ouellet, Ont. I regret to inform you that she is considered ineligible for superannuation. Teachers of Indian day schools are appointed by the churches interested in the work and the Department and they cannot be classed as permanent civil servants.

In reply I have to inform you that teachers of Indian day schools are exempt from the operation of the provisions of the Civil Service Act in so far as the principle of competition in the matter of appointment is concerned and are, therefore, classed as \"temporary\" civil servants. Only permanent civil servants are eligible for superannuation and I regret to state that contributions to the Superannuation Fund cannot be accepted in your case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMiss Jean McDermott,\nCutler, Ont.\nToronto, March 26th, 1928.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am directed by the Minister of Education to state that Arthur A. Smith, who taught for 27 years in the Provincial schools, and two years in Indian schools, has applied for a pension under the Teachers' and Inspectors' Superannuation Act. Mr. Smith's breakdown in health occurred when he was a teacher at Curve Lake Indian School. The Act does not provide a pension for any teacher whose health breaks down after he has left the Provincial system, and has not taught the required forty, or thirty years, as the case may be. Will you kindly inform me if your Department has any retiring allowance for cases like this?\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister of Education.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, March 27, 1928.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, with reference to the case of Mr. A. A. Smith, who taught for many years in provincial schools and two years in an Indian school. The Department allows a small gratuity in the case of teachers who have given lengthy service at Indian schools; but I regret that Mr. Smith could not benefit, as he has had less than two years' service with us. I add, for your information, that there is no superannuation scheme for teachers of Indian schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nA.H.U. Colquhoun, Esq., B.A., LL.D.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Education,\nToronto, Ont.\nI have been working hard all my life. It is only during the last few years that I have been able to put away anything for the future. A pension scheme would be a lovely idea for me, but for others it might be a nice profession. I should be grateful for your helpful advice in this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, January 26, 1929.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, asking if you can come under the Superannuation Act.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that teachers of Indian day schools are exempt from the operation of the provisions of the Civil Service Act insofar as the principle of competition in the matter of appointment is concerned and are, therefore, classified as \"temporary\" civil servants. Only permanent civil servants are eligible for superannuation and I regret to state that contributions to the Superannuation Fund cannot be accepted in your case and that no provision is, therefore, made for superannuation or pension to teachers in Indian schools.\n\nThe Department allows a small gratuity in the case of teachers who have given lengthy service at Indian schools - usually two months' salary - on their retirement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEmile T.

Under what conditions are teachers of Indian Day Schools granted a pension?\n2. What percentage of their salary do they get?\n3. How many years' service are necessary?\n4.

Mac Rae.\nOttawa, July 16, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to pensions for teachers of Indian day schools. In reply I have to inform you that these employees do not contribute to the Dominion Government Superannuation Fund, as they are not considered permanent civil servants. There is, therefore, no provision for superannuation or for pension in the case of teachers at Indian schools. I may say, however, that the Department allows a small gratuity for teachers who have given lengthy service. In these cases, two months' salary is allowed upon retirement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJohn A.

I have discussed this with the authorities of the Provincial Department of Education in the past, but I am not sure that their regulations allow teachers of Indian schools to contribute. I am writing to them today in the matter.\n\nWhereas the superannuation fund to which you refer is controlled by the Provincial Department of Education, you should address your inquiry to Toronto.

She is still doing well and showing remarkable adaptability of method, considering her age.\n\nObviously, however, she can teach for only a limited time longer. I am writing to inquire whether technically her status is that of a civil servant; also whether she shall, if retired after long service have any source of allowance on which to retire.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. Bartlett\nOttawa, October 4, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Bartlett:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to Miss Helen McKay, teacher at the Birtle Indian Residential School. Employees at these institutions are not recognized as Civil Servants in any sense of the term; they are employed and paid by the church or the school management. There is, therefore, no Government provision for pension or gratuity upon retirement. Teachers of Indian day schools rank as temporary Civil Servants, and a small gratuity is allowed them after years of service. Even they cannot profit by the Civil Servant Superannuation scheme, as they do not contribute to the fund.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nG. W.

The final decision has not yet been reached on this question since it will require an amendment to be made to one of the Clauses of the Teachers' and Inspectors' Superannuation Act. I think I can safely say that at the present time this privilege will only be granted to those teachers in the Indian Schools who hold certificates as teachers from the Ontario Department of Education.\n\nI shall continue to give this matter attention and shall report to you any progress made.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nChief Inspector.\n\nRussell Ferrier, Esquire,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nV.K.

I have recently learned that a final decision has not been reached and that it will be necessary to amend one of the clauses of the particular Act. It appears, however, that the privilege will be granted only to those teachers who are teaching in Indian schools in Ontario, where the work is inspected by the provincial officers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

And, in view of my long service in Indian School work. I kindly request the Indian Department to help me out, and give me monthly allowance. Financially, I am out of funds, and I am at a loss, what to do, in order, to provide myself with the indispensable articles that I need daily.\n\nAwaiting a favorable reply.\n\nI remain,\nyour obedient servant.\n\nPeter Harper.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Ind. Affairs;\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, June 16th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your recent letter, applying for a monthly allowance in view of your services in Indian school work. In reply I beg to say that there is no Government provision for pension upon retirement of a teacher of an Indian day school. The Department, however, allows a gratuity after years' service and, in this connection, I would point out that, when your services at the Hollowwater River Indian Day School terminated in 1927, you were allowed the sum of $150., which amount was equivalent to two months' salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nPeter Harper, Esq.,\nSelkirk,\nMan.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to ask you if you will very kindly take up the cause of certificated teachers employed in the Indian Schools receiving grants from the Dominion government. Such teachers are not included in the Saskatchewan Teachers' Superannuation Act of 1930. In Section 3, it is stated that the act applies only to teachers employed in those schools \"receiving grants from the Province of Saskatchewan.\"\n\nSince your appointment in 1921 as Superintendent of Indian Education in the Dominion, it has been your aim to raise Indian Schools to the same educational standing as the white schools.\n\nIf certificated teachers employed in the Indian Schools are excluded from all superannuation benefits, it will eventually mean a falling in the status and educational standing of the schools under your supervision. I wonder if such a clause is in the Teachers' Superannuation Act in other Provinces. I have\nnot been able to ascertain\nthat information.\n\nIt seems most unjust that\nCertificated Indian teachers should\ngo through the same educational\npreparatory training, follow\nthe same course of study, (as\nfar as possible) be under the\nsame inspectorate, as the\nteachers in white schools, and\nyet should not receive the same\npecuniary benefits.\n\nFrom personal experience I\nknow Indian teaching is a far\ngreater tension on the health\nand nervous system, and the\nteachers on Reserves are deprived\nof social and educational\nprivileges.\n\nYou will understand how I\nfeel about Section 3.\nI taught in England as a\nCertificated teacher in Government\nschools for 13 years, and paid\nthe Superannuation Premium for\nthat period.\nI took Second Class Normal\nat Saskatoon 1912, and then\ntaught in a white school for one\nyear.\nIn response to the late Ven.\nArchdeacon McKay's appeal for\nteachers to go into the Indian\nwork, I went to Lac la Ronge.\nas senior teacher for a salary of $300.\n\nIf no certificated teachers had responded in the pioneer days, the Indians would not have been able to hold their own, and be intelligent self-supporting citizens of the province as they are today. May I give some instances of girl pupils, whose parents lived in tepees at Lac la Ronge.\n\nVictoria gained her Second Class teachers' certificate, and is now married to a white clergyman engaged in the Indian work, and Jennie has been on the staff of the Indian Residential School at Stoney Lookout for more than 2 years. When she came to see me in August, on her way home for the summer vacation, I reflected on her happy, intelligent countenance; she was so enthusiastic in her work. She stated in a letter, \"I received a few days ago, 'I'm going to like it too much, that I won't be able to leave it'.\" Both girls had innate musical ability, and were able to play the organ at the Sunday services.\n\nAnother pupil, to whom I taught music, bought a small portable organ, and carried it in the canoe.\nas they travelled from camp to camp. She eventually offered to return to school, and help the kitchen matron, if I would continue to give her music lessons. She did splendid work for many years, and then married a white man in a good position.\n\nI have not been able to resume teaching owing to continued ill-health, so I wrote to the superannuation commission, applying for the allowance for ill-health, and I received the following reply\u2014The act applies only to teachers employed in those schools, receiving grants from the Province.\n\nThanking you in advance,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nKate Le Clair.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 23, 1930.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to the superannuation of teachers of Indian day schools. I regret that there is no provision in this connection. Teachers at Indian day schools do not rank as permanent Civil Servants and do not come under the federal superannuation act. There are good and sufficient reasons why the Department is unable to have these employees considered as permanent for purposes of superannuation or pension. Unless the provincial teachers' superannuation acts include those employees at Indian schools, there is really nothing that can be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMrs. Kate LeClair,\n14 Baker Block,\nPrince Albert,\nSask.\n1930\n\nCHAPTER 93\n\n[Assented to April 10, 1930.]\n\nAn Act respecting the Superannuation of Teachers.\n\nHis Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, enacts as follows:\n\nSHORT TITLE.\n\n1.

Interest shall be calculated at the rate of five per cent. per annum or such other rate as may from time to time be prescribed by the Treasury Board, compounded half-yearly.\n\n34. Any payments to be made under the provisions of this Act, shall be exempt from provincial and municipal taxes, and shall not be subject to garnishment or attachment or seizure or any legal process, and shall be unassignable.\n\n35. The commission may, from time to time, with the approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council, make regulations for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Act, according to their true intent and meaning, and such regulations shall have the same force and effect as if incorporated herein.\n\n36.\u2014(1) The commission shall, each year, transmit to the president of the Executive Council a report showing:\n\n(a) the names of all teachers who have been superannuated or who have died during the last preceding fiscal year;\n\n(b) the positions held by them or the nature of their employment respectively;\n\n(c) the amount of salary payable to each at the time of superannuation or death, and the average of the five consecutive years of highest salary;\n\n(d) the age of each at superannuation or death;\n\n(e) the cause of superannuation in the case of retirement before attaining the age of sixty years in the case of men or fifty-five years in the case of women;\n\n(f) the amount of superannuation or other allowance granted in each case;\n\n(g) all regulations made under this Act;\n\n(h) the expenses incurred in the administration of this Act;\n\n(i) any other information considered necessary to make the report complete.\n\n(2) The president of the Executive Council shall lay the commission's report before the Legislative Assembly during the first fifteen days of each three-year session, or within fifteen days after its receipt, if the Legislature is then sitting, together with a complete statement of the financial standing of the fund for the preceding fiscal year showing the moneys withheld from school grants as contributions by teachers and moneys paid out in respect of allowances or refunds of contributions.\n\n37. This Act shall come into force on the first day of July, 1930.\nRegina, October 1, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI am enclosing herewith for your convenience a copy of The Teachers' Superannuation Act.\n\nKindly advise me what provision is made by the Dominion Government for pensions for teachers of the Indian board schools and Indian day schools.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 6, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Ball:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, enclosing copy of the Provincial Teachers' Superannuation Act and requesting information concerning the superannuation of teachers at Indian schools. In reply I have to state that teachers at Indian residential schools are not employees of the Department of Indian Affairs. They are engaged by the Reverend Principal or by the Church which is directly responsible for the management of the particular institution.\n\nTeachers of Indian day schools are classed as temporary Civil Servants and, as such, do not come under the Superannuation Act for permanent employees of the Federal Government. It is true that a few of these workers give many years of service and it is a matter of regret that a pension cannot be allowed. I may say, however, that most of the teachers of Indian day schools who give long years of service are in Holy Orders and the Department believes that the churches concerned should be responsible for their care during their old age and that they should not become a charge on public funds.\n\nTo recapitulate, there are few lay workers who give long years of service at Indian day schools. They do not come under the federal employees' superannuation scheme.\n\nIt would be a source of much satisfaction to this Department if the Saskatchewan statute could be amended to include these few lay workers. The Ontario Department of Education is considering an amendment to their Act. They hope to include Ontario qualified teachers who are teaching in Indian schools in Ontario which are regularly inspected by provincial officers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMy object in writing this letter is to enquire whether I could not come under the Civil Service Act and be eligible for superannuation allowance in the same manner as others engaged by the Indian Dept. at Ottawa.\n\nMy reason for asking when facts are stated are perfectly logical and cannot be denied.\n\nI have been teacher at the above mentioned School for nearly 17 years, and I have faithfully carried out my duties as such, and my efforts have met with success as reports to and from your Dept. are plain proofs of that fact.\n\nWhy some of the employees of the Indian Dept. should receive superannuation allowances, and teachers of Indian Schools who have worked hard for many years and rendered such admirable service to the Indian Dept. and practically to the State, should be excluded from participating in the benefits of the Civil Service superannuation allowances would not\n\nF. T. C.\nin the opinion of any reasonable person stand the least bit of argument.\n\nI am an employee of the Indian Dept. just as much as those that are employed at Ottawa or elsewhere, and there should be no discrimination.\n\nI would also point out that although a Bishop or any Clergy may select a teacher, that selection or appointment has to be confirmed by the Indian Dept. and the Dept. of Indian Affairs pay the salaries of teachers etc.\n\nThen that being so, and with the facts given and contained in this letter I sincerely trust that I as well as other teachers will shortly be included under the Civil Service Act and be eligible for superannuation allowance when their time comes. Faithful service should be rewarded.\n\nI would be glad if you could recommend my application to the Dept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher.\nThe Application for Superannuation\nSidney Browning\nHagwilget Indian Day School Teacher\n\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter received from Mr Sidney Browning Indian Day School Teacher of the Hagwilget Indian Day School (Recher Debeule) of this Agency. The letter no doubt is self explanatory, but I am at a loss as to what remarks I should make concerning the request.\n\nI cannot speak too highly about Mr Browning's work; he certainly is a very successful Teacher, and is doing good work amongst the Indian children of the Hagwilget Reserve. If such can be arranged so as to include Mr Browning in the Civil Service List after so many years faithful service, I feel same would be greatly appreciated.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nG.C.

You will inform him that teachers of Indian day schools are not classified as permanent Civil Servants and therefore do not come under the Superannuation Act for permanent employees of the Federal Government. In his case, where he has given many years of service, it is a matter of regret that deductions from his salary cannot be made in order that he be allowed a pension upon retirement. However, nothing can be done, other than two months' gratuity when he leaves our service.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nG. G.

Mr. Barner and he advised me to write to you to see if any progress had been made regarding securing superannuation for teachers of Indian schools in Ontario.\n\nI would also like to know if there is likely to be any positions available in Indian schools in the near future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Gibson.\nOttawa, February 10, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, regarding superannuation for teachers of Indian schools in Ontario. There is no provision by the Federal Government in their case, and the only hope is that the Provincial Act could be amended, if necessary, to include the few lay workers who give long service in Indian schools in the province. As you were informed in letter dated April 14, 1930, this matter is before the Provincial Department of Education, but the necessary provision has not yet been made in the Provincial Act.\n\nRelative to your request to be informed if there is likely to be any position available in an Indian school in the near future, I have to say that, in so far as the Department is aware, all present incumbents will be retaining their posts for the balance of the present school year. I would suggest that you make further application in July, next, if you desire a position. At that time, the services of new teachers, etc., will be engaged for the next academic year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nR. A.

McDermott, Sudbury, Ontario, in which she states that she has taught for twenty-five years from 1906 to October 1930, and asks for some consideration in the way of pension. Miss McDermott has been advised of the transfer of her letter to your Department, as the position which she occupied was one which was not governed by the provisions of the Civil Service Act.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD. C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 21, 1931.\n\nDear Miss McDermott:\n\nMr. Foran, of the Civil Service Commission, has forwarded to the Department your letter of the 7th instant, concerning superannuation. Teachers of Indian day schools are not classed as permanent Civil Servants and therefore do not come under the Superannuation Act for permanent employees of the Federal Government. In the case of those few lay workers who have taught many years in Indian schools, this regulation is a matter of regret; but, of course, the Department has to follow the usual practice of refusing our teachers an opportunity of contributing to the Superannuation Fund.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Jean McDermott,\n56 Young St.,\nSudbury, Ont.\nsewing, crocheting & knitting, socks, stockings, mittens, gloves & underwear. Seven years ago, when we were burnt out at all the big fires, my school class myself, we were burnt up. I kept them to show my friends.\n\nMy first school was at Bemidji, Minn., where my father was stationed while Augustus F. Berends, White Lake W., was Indian Agent. There were different schools on St. Peter's Reserve. Two at Fort Alexander, the 1st at the Baptist Mission & the 2nd at the mouth of the Assiniboine River. Fort G. I started the school in the deboys' school. Greatly helped by being there for a number of years, then being threatened with Y.B. my father had to substitute for me while I work away.\n\nI am a widow, childless & crippled, fell ill, fell & broke my left leg in hospital for 6 months which put me behind in my studies. May only come will have to go, so I thought I'd try writing to the dept. to see if it's possible for me to get a pension?\n\nIf you will kindly look up the records you will see that I am correct in all I told you. Also that Rev. P.B. McKenzie taught for me in 6 bands, one as far as St. Peter's when I was ill. Yours respectfully,\n\nHarriet McKenzie\n\nMrs. John Lusk\nChurchton, MB\nManitoba\nOttawa, December 20, 1932.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, regarding your previous service as teacher in Indian schools and requesting that a pension be allowed in view of your service.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department has no pension or superannuation scheme for teachers. Teachers are not considered permanent Civil Servants and, therefore, do not come under the Superannuation Act. I regret that it will not be possible to allow you a pension or a gratuity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMrs. John Leask,\nGlandeboyse P.O.,\nMan.\nOttawa, February 8, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nOn April 9, 1930, the late Superintendent of Indian Education wrote you in connection with the admission of teachers of Indian day schools in Ontario to the Provincial Teachers' and Inspectors' Superannuation scheme.\n\nIn your reply of April 11, 1930, you stated that there was no provision in your Teachers' and Inspectors' Superannuation Act for the admission of teachers in Indian schools to the privileges of the Fund, but you stated that the matter had been considered and it was possible that an amendment would be made to your Act.\n\nI would appreciate your advising if any action has been taken along the lines suggested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nV. K. Greer, Esq.,\nChief Inspector,\nDept. of Education,\nToronto, Ont.\nFebruary 10th, 1933.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th inst., and to state in reply that I shall be pleased to submit to the Teachers' and Inspectors' Superannuation Commission again your proposal that our Act be so amended as to extend the privileges of the Fund to teachers in Indian Schools within the Province. We shall give this matter consideration in time to have any amendments go forward for the consideration of the coming session of the Legislature.\n\nI may say in advance, however, that it will not be possible to extend these privileges to any teachers in Indian Schools who do not hold teaching certificates for the Province of Ontario. This latter requirement is fundamental in connection with contributions to the Fund.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nChairman, Superannuation Commission.\n\nA. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, February 16th, 1935.\n\nSir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 10th instant and it is noted that it is your intention to consider amending your Act so as to extend the privileges of the Teachers' Superannuation Fund to teachers in Indian schools in Ontario.\n\nThe Department appreciates very much receiving this information and I should be pleased if you would advise me later regarding what action is taken by the legislature.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nV. K. Greer, Esq.,\nChairman,\nSuperannuation Commission,\nParliament Buildings,\nToronto, Ont.\nReport of Actuary\n\nThe Ontario Teachers' and Inspectors' Superannuation Act could be amended so as to extend its full benefits and privileges to properly qualified teachers in Ontario Indian Schools, provided that:\n\n(i) The Dominion Government pays into the Superannuation Fund for each teacher now in these Indian Schools, that sum of money which the next valuation will show that the Province holds as a reserve for one of its own teachers of similar age and service and salary.\n\n(ii) The Dominion Government pays into the Superannuation Fund each August a sum of money equal to 2\u00bd% of the aggregate salaries of qualified Indian School teachers during the preceding school year plus one year's interest at 4\u00be%.\n\n(iii) Each qualified Indian School teacher pays 2\u00bd% of all salary received, this percentage to be deducted from each salary payment by the payer and to be subsequently paid at the end of each school year into the Superannuation Fund.\n\n(iv) All other requirements of the Teachers' and Inspectors' Superannuation Act are complied with.\n\nThe Province will make no charge for operating expenses in reference to such Indian School teachers, and the Fund will assume the additional liability created by previous Indian School service which has been given by some of our regular teachers now in Ontario schools.\n\nApril 4th, 1933.\nApril 27th, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am directed by the Teachers' and Inspectors' Superannuation Commission to state that the Commission have given very careful consideration to your request that the teachers in the Indian Schools of Ontario be allowed the privileges of the Ontario Teachers' and Inspectors' Superannuation Fund.\n\nThe Actuary for the Commission was asked to make a report as to the conditions under which these teachers might be admitted to the Fund. A copy of this report is attached hereto.\n\nIf the Dominion Government will accept the conditions set forth in the Actuary's report, the Commission will recommend an Amendment to the Teachers' and Inspectors' Superannuation Act, to be placed before the 1934 session of the legislature, extending the privileges of the Act to the Indian School teachers.\n\nTwo copies of the Teachers' and Inspectors' Superannuation Act and two copies of the Regulations for the administration of the Act are being sent to you under separate cover.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esquire,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nChairman, Superannuation Commission.\nOttawa, May 6th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing a copy of your Actuary's report as to the conditions under which teachers in Indian schools in Ontario could be admitted to the Teachers' Superannuation Fund.\n\nThe report of your Actuary has been carefully considered and it is realized that your whole offer is very fair. However, our appropriation has been so reduced this year that it is not possible to consider any payments which have not been specifically provided. Under these circumstances, I regret that the Department cannot give consideration at the present time to bringing teachers of Indian schools under the provisions of your Teachers' Superannuation Fund. At the same time, I wish to express this Department's appreciation of your offer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nV. K. Greer, Esq.,\nChairman,\nSuperannuation Commission,\nParliament Buildings,\nToronto, Ont.\nMemorandum:\n\nE.P. BUSKARD.\n\nReferring to your note of the third instant, embodying an extract from a communication received by the Right Honourable The Prime Minister and referred to the Superintendent General, from P. H. Gentleman, former teacher of the French Bay Indian Day School, on the Saugeen Reserve, Chippawa Hill, Ont., I would state as follows:\n\nThe services of Mr. Gentleman were dispensed with as from June 30th, last, on the report of the Provincial Public School Inspector and Mr. Inspector McCookin of this Department. In this connection I would refer you to my memorandum dated June 27th, last.\n\nNo successor has been appointed and the school, through poor attendance and lack of funds, has remained closed since Mr. Gentleman's services were terminated. At the time his services were dispensed with, it was intended to re-open the school at the beginning of the present academic year, viz.: September first, last; but, in the meantime, owing to a request for a further reduction in our appropriation, it was decided not to re-open the school.\n\nMr. Gentleman refers to the case of Mr. Wallace, a former teacher, who was retired on superannuation. In this connection I would say that Mr. Wallace, who gave 28 years' service in our employ, was retired on account of ill health.\nill health and superannuated under the provisions of the Public Service Retirement Act, 1920, as amended 1921 and 1922. This Act was better known as the Calder Retirement Act. Under its provisions, it was not required that contributions be made by the person served. This Act has now expired. As teachers of Indian day schools are not appointed by the Civil Service Commission, they cannot be classed as permanent Civil Servants and are therefore ineligible for superannuation. Since the going out of the Calder Act, the only provision we can make, under the requirements of the Auditor General, upon the retirement of a teacher who has given lengthy service - 10 years or over - is two months' retiring gratuity, which was granted and paid in the case of Mr. Gentleman.\n\nHAROLD W. MCGILL\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nFebruary 20th, 1935.\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nThe attached communication from the Bishop of Saskatchewan is referred to you for return, together with a draft reply for the Minister's signature.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, February 27, 1935.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 15th instant, referring to certain matters affecting the Indian day schools in your diocese.\n\nWith reference to providing midday meals, I understand an adequate quantity of biscuits is supplied each day school and, in addition, other supplies for midday meals are furnished upon application, in so far as funds available for the purpose permit.\n\nIt has been the practice to supply a reasonable quantity of soap and towels to the Indian day schools, and the Department has no record of having refused these articles to the Montreal Lake School. As a matter of fact, an account has recently been paid for the supplying of 12 lbs. of soap that had been forwarded to this school.\n\nRelative to the superannuation of teachers, I would state that teachers at Indian residential schools are not employees of the Department of Indian Affairs. They are engaged by the Rev. Principal or by the Church which is directly responsible for the management of the particular institution.\n\nAs stated by you, teachers of Indian day schools are classed as temporary civil servants and, as such, do not come under the Superannuation Act for permanent employees of the Federal Government. Information available to my Department indicates that, while\n\n- some teachers\n\nRight Rev. Walter Burd, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nSome teachers give many years' service at Indian day schools; the average length of employment does not exceed four or five years. After the present Act respecting superannuation of teachers in the province of Saskatchewan, assented to April 10, 1930, my Department communicated with the Provincial Department of Education regarding an amendment to their Act, to include teachers in Indian schools. No satisfactory arrangement resulted.\n\nThe salaries of teachers of Indian day schools in the province of Saskatchewan range from $600 to $1,050. In determining the salary to be paid teachers at Indian day schools, several factors besides academic qualifications are considered. Owing to present regulations, the salary rating now provided for these schools cannot be changed.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSgd. J. F. Murphy\nRegina, Sask., 27th Feb. 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that I had a conversation with His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan in Prince Albert on the 13th instant, during which several matters in connection with the operation of our Indian day schools were freely discussed.\n\nThere is another matter which I did not feel I had any interest in, but the Bishop suggested that our Department might co-operate in bringing about and this is the question of superannuation for teachers. The Department of Education for the Province of Saskatchewan is making provision for a contributory scheme of superannuation for its teachers, but no provision is made in the Act for teachers in day schools of the Indian Department. These teachers are not recognized as permanent Civil Servants and so no provision is made for pension for their old age. A teacher moving from a white school to an Indian school in the Province of Saskatchewan forfeits the benefit of his superannuation for the period of service in the Indian school and during that period he is not permitted to contribute to the Teachers Superannuation Fund. It appears to me that, as our schools are now being regularly inspected by Provincial School Inspectors and our teachers capabilities are to a large extent judged by the Inspector and the fact that they hold certificates from the Province, it would not be unreasonable to permit them to contribute to the superannuation provided by the province. Personally, I feel that the Bishop's attitude in this question is very fair and I promised him that I would bring this question to your attention in my report.\n\nW.

McLaren.\n\nI beg to refer to memorandum of the Representative of the Treasury dated the 15th instant, enclosing Staff Questionnaires covering teachers of Indian day schools. You will note that the employment status is given as #21 - \"Permanent C.S. (Exempt by O.C.) Full Time\".\n\nUpon further consideration, it is considered that teachers employed in schools operated under the jurisdiction of this Department and who, by authority of P.C. 20/1589 of July 20, 1934, are wholly exempt from the operations of the Civil Service Act, should be classed as \"Temporary C.S. (Exempt by O.C.)

Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\nMarch 31st, 1936.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honorable The Superintendent General,\n\nI have your memorandum of the 27th instant, enclosing letter received from the Minister of Education for the Province of Saskatchewan, with reference to the superannuation of teachers of Indian day schools.\n\nTeachers of Indian day schools are classed as temporary civil servants and, as such, do not come under the superannuation for permanent employees of the Federal Government.\n\nIn his letter of the 23rd instant, the Minister of Education for Saskatchewan points out that it would be necessary to amend the Superannuation Act covering teachers in Saskatchewan to enable teachers of Indian day schools to participate. In this event, the Dominion Government would be obliged to make a contribution to the Superannuation Fund of the Provincial Government.\n\nAs you are aware, there are Indian day schools in every province in Canada and, in each of these provinces, the teachers in the provincial schools have a Superannuation Fund. In the event of our arranging to bring the teachers of Indian day schools in Saskatchewan under the Provincial Superannuation Act, we would, no doubt, receive requests for similar treatment in the other provinces.\n\nIt should, also, be kept in mind that the length of service of teachers in Indian day schools, in the great majority of cases, does not exceed four or five years and, in addition, many of our teachers are religious.\n\nI would recommend that Honourable Mr. Estey be informed of the difficulties that would be presented if this Department arranged for placing teachers of Indian day schools in Saskatchewan under the Provincial Teachers' Superannuation Act and that, under these circumstances, this Department is not prepared, at the present time, to take any action in the matter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMINISTER OF EDUCATION\nSaskatchewan\n\nRegina, March 23, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have, in this Province, a number of schools for the instruction of Indian children maintained by your Department. In these schools you now require a teacher to have a first class certificate as obtained in the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nThese teachers are not accorded the privilege of joining any superannuation scheme, either Federal or Provincial. I enclose to you herewith a copy of The Teachers' Superannuation Act which obtains in this Province. Under the terms of this Act a portion of the teacher's salary is deducted and paid into a Fund and the Government of this Province has a statutory liability thereto as fixed by section 12.\n\nSection 3 applies to all persons teaching in the Province of Saskatchewan in schools that receive grants from the Province. This Province makes no contribution to the Indian schools and therefore the Act does not apply to teachers therein.\n\nUnder section 13 provisions are set out for the computation of teaching service which may be included in determining the amount of superannuation. This Act, not applying to the Indian schools, teachers who teach therein for a period and then return to teaching in the public school find that they must again start building up a superannuation fund. If they have taught in the Indian school for any length of time you can appreciate the seriousness of the position from the teachers' point of view.\n\nA number of church officials and teachers in Indian schools have urged upon me from time to time the unfair position in which the teacher in the Indian school is placed. The matter has, upon previous occasions, been brought to the attention of your Department and the answer has been to the effect that teachers in Indian schools are not civil servants within the meaning of your Act and therefore no superannuation fund is provided.\n\nI am disposed to agree that the teacher in the Indian school is placed in an unfair position. We cannot amend our Act to effectively cover the situation unless your Government is prepared to make an appropriate contribution to our Superannuation Fund.\nI am therefore placing before you the representations which have been made to me and urging upon you that you give favourable consideration to the end that the teacher in the Indian school may be relieved of the unfair position in which that teacher is placed today.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

Estey, Minister of Education for the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nWill you kindly have a reply prepared to Mr. Estey, for Mr. Crear's signature, along the same lines as your memorandum of the 31st of March.\n\nEnc.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, April 6, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Estey:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to enabling teachers in Indian schools in the province of Saskatchewan to obtain the privilege of joining the Provincial Teachers' Superannuation Fund and enclosing a copy of the Provincial Act.\n\nRegarding the teachers of Indian residential schools, they are engaged by the Principal or by the Church which is directly responsible for the management of the particular institution, their salary not being paid by the Department but by the church authorities, from per capita allowance made the school by the Department.\n\nTeachers of Indian day schools are classed as temporary Civil servants and, as such, do not come under the Superannuation Act for permanent employees of the Federal Government. The length of service of teachers in the Indian day schools, in the majority of cases, does not exceed four or five years. In addition, a number are members of religious orders.\n\nI note it would be necessary to amend the Superannuation Act covering teachers in Saskatchewan, to enable the teachers of Indian day schools in that province to participate, in which event the Dominion Government would be obliged to make a contribution to the Superannuation Fund of the Provincial Government; also make the deductions from salary and forward the amount for credit of the fund. There would be many difficulties in the way of placing teachers of Indian day schools who would be covered by the Provincial Teachers' Superannuation Act. Upon consideration, I am not prepared to take action at present in bringing the teachers that may be eligible under the provisions of the Provincial Superannuation Act.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHonourable J. W.

From Nov. 1, 1947 to Dec. 31, 1950 (period of 2 yrs. 2 mos.) I taught in the Indian School of New Credit, Brantford Reserve, where Capt. Stewart was Indian agent at Hagersville, Ont. I believe the first pupils in that school to obtain entrance standing succeeded under me. This school was\n\nJUL 2 1936\nyour know is under Federal Govt.\n\nIn 1906 I was invited by the Friends of Philadelphia to take charge of a school they had opened at Pittrofby, Saskatchewan, for the education of the Doukhobors. I was with this people for three years (1906-1909) and the first Doukhobor in Canada to get their children educated (with the exception of the late Peter Verigin's nephew) did so in my time. Almost immediately after leaving this work the Saskatchewan Doukhobors began to establish their own public school sections, and since many have graduated from the university, I believe my work which was not easy task laid the foundation for education among them - and to a certain extent modified their radical tendencies. This people were primitive of the primitive era in civilized countries.\nThe years spent with the Indians and Doukhobors are not considered in my Ontario superannuation allowance. If they were my annual income would be increased by approximately seventy-five dollars ($75.00) per annum.\n\nWhich is a very material sum to a superannuated teacher. I feel that my most useful work as a teacher occurred on the Penticton reserve and the hardships of those years probably had a good deal to do with my present ill-health.\n\nIn these anything, Mr. Prime Minister, in our constitution or in civil service compensation allowance that will justify the Federal Government in recognizing my work to the extent of seventy-five dollars annually.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Miss) A.

In this connection I would say the Secretary of the Civil Service Commission has forwarded this Department copies of the correspondence.\n\nTeachers of Indian day schools are classed as temporary Civil Servants and, as such, do not come under the Superannuation Act for permanent employees of the Federal Government. The length of service of teachers in the Indian day schools, in the majority of cases, does not exceed four or five years. In addition, a number are members of religious Orders. As teachers are classed as temporary Civil Servants only, they are not eligible to come under the provisions of the Superannuation Act.\n\nRegarding payment for sick leave, the Department has a provision by which we can allow one month's sick leave with pay, and, covering the same period, also pay the salary of a substitute, providing a doctor's certificate is furnished, covering the period the teacher is ill, not exceeding, as stated, one month.\n\nTeachers of all Indian day schools are engaged for a specified yearly salary, but, following the very generally accepted\n\nJ. W. Burns, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nChehalis Indian Day School,\nHarrison Mills, B.

Teachers of all Indian day schools in Canada are paid in the same manner.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to consider any change in the present methods of payment. It is considered that the rate of salary allowed teachers in Indian day schools compares favourably with that paid teachers of neighbouring white schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

A few years ago I took this matter up with the Honourable Mr. Creer, but his position at that time was that nothing should be done. Since that time I have had repeated requests, particularly from members of the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church, with respect to this matter.\n\nI feel that this is a subject which is going to be a source of constant complaint until such time as it is rectified. I am, therefore, bringing it to your attention and will appreciate your taking such action as you may feel disposed to undertake.\n\nI believe those directing the Indian schools now require that the teacher hold a first class certificate as issued by this Department. The teacher who accepts such a position then finds that superannuation is not available. While they are in the employ of the Federal Government they are not civil servants and although they are teachers in the province of Saskatchewan they cannot participate in the Saskatchewan Teachers' Superannuation fund. That fund is made up of a contribution of 4% of the teacher's salary and the fund is in effect guaranteed by the Province of Saskatchewan. Up to the present the Province has not paid into that fund any sum of money. In other words, it is maintained by the contributions of the teachers.\n\nIt may be that it is a matter upon which there should be some arrangements between the two Governments but, in any event, I think something definite should be done. The present position, as I view it, is unfair to the teachers and, until it is adjusted, will continue to be a continual source of complaint.\n\nI shall appreciate receiving an intimation of your views and, until then, with kind personal regards,\n\nI am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

G. Gardiner, has been passed on to me for consideration and reply.\n\nThe officials of the Indian Affairs Branch inform me that, in response to requests received from Indian day school teachers, the claims of these teachers for the creation of a Superannuation Act, or an arrangement whereby they would qualify for superannuation under the provincial acts now in force, have been very carefully and very sympathetically reviewed during the last year. The officials, however, are of the opinion that the difficulties standing in the way of superannuation allowances for teachers are almost insurmountable.\n\nWe have at this date a pupil enrolment at Indian schools of approximately 15,287. Of these pupils 8,297 are enrolled at Indian day schools and 9,040 at residential schools. Teachers employed at Indian residential schools are the employees of the churches under the auspices of which the schools are operated. These teachers can be considered in no sense government employees. In the case of Indian day school teachers, about 60% are nominated by the church authorities and these nominations in each case are approved by the Department. The salaries of Indian day school teachers are paid in full by the Government, although in a number of cases a teacher, in addition\n\nHonourable J. W. Estey, B.A., LL.B., K.C.,\nMinister of Education,\nRegina, Sask.\nto his regular classroom duties, acts as a missionary on the reserve. Indian day school teachers are classified therefore as temporary civil servants. It is estimated that 40% of the temporary employees of the Government in all the services throughout the Dominion do not qualify for superannuation. In this respect, Indian day school teachers do not differ from the Dominion temporary employees in other branches of the public service. In view of the fact that the average length of service rendered by a teacher in an Indian day school does not exceed five years, it is very difficult for me to see how we could extend to them the benefits of a superannuation act and withhold such benefits from the other temporary employees of the Government.\n\nThe main difficulties standing in the way of superannuation benefits for teachers in charge of Indian day and residential schools may be summed up as follows:\n\n1. An overwhelming majority of the teachers in charge of schools operated under the auspices of the Catholic Church are members of religious Orders and are not interested in contributing to, or receiving benefits from, a superannuation fund.\n\n2. The teachers employed at Indian residential schools are not the employees of the Government and, unless their status were changed, could not qualify for superannuation under the Dominion or Provincial Superannuation Acts.\n\n3. Indian day school teachers, particularly in the eastern provinces, move frequently from one province to another. It would be difficult, therefore, to adjust their superannuation allowances unless the Provincial Acts were somewhat uniform.\n\nI am inclined to agree with you when you state in your letter to Mr. Gardiner that this is a subject that is going to be a source of constant complaint until such time as -\ntime as it is rectified. However, I feel sure you will readily appreciate the difficulties confronting us in any attempt we may make to find a solution. If the teachers in charge of Indian residential schools were employees of the Government and if the teachers in charge of Indian day schools were employed by the Government in the sense that public school teachers are employed by the local trustee boards, the matter would be comparatively simple. Indian school teachers would then become permanent civil servants and automatically qualify for superannuation benefits. I feel confident, however, that the churches would vigorously oppose any attempt that might be made to modify the policy now in force. The churches of Canada were the pioneers in the field of educational effort in this country, and the co-operative arrangement now in force has been, with one or two slight modifications, the policy of succeeding governments since Confederation.\n\nI appreciate very fully your interest in this subject. If you find it convenient to visit Ottawa at any time in the immediate future, I shall welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter with you and with the officials charged with the responsibility of administering our schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRAH\nLebret, Sask.\nJune 8, 1939.\n\nMinister in Charge of Indian Affairs,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRecently at a local Teachers' meeting the condition of qualified teachers teaching in Indian Schools was discussed. Under existing conditions a certificated teacher in an Indian school is unable to participate in the provincial scheme of superannuation. He likewise is unable to participate in a federal scheme of superannuation. There is even a doubt as to whether his teaching continuity be broken when he teaches in an Indian school. This in itself is not conducive to certificated teachers being employed. For, should a teacher teach in an Indian school then return to the provincial field he receives no credit for the time taught in this school.\n\nAt our meeting I was asked if the Government stipulated stipulated minimum salaries for teachers in Indian schools; and if they exercised any jurisdiction re hiring of the teachers. I was unable to answer these questions. I was also asked if the government was aware of salaries obtaining in these schools; but again I was unable to answer. It is indeed regrettable that, though certificated, we are not eligible for any scheme of superannuation.\n\nAny information you may choose to give us on this matter, Sir, will be greatly appreciated by our Local of the Saskatchewan Teachers' Federation.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nM.J. Salamon.\nOttawa, June 16, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Salamon:\n\nYour letter of the 8th instant, addressed to the Minister of this Department, has been passed on to me for consideration and reply.\n\nI may state by way of comment that we have at this date a pupil enrolment at Indian schools in the Dominion of approximately 16,297. Of these pupils, 9,257 are enrolled at Indian day schools and 9,040 at residential schools. The teachers employed at Indian residential schools are the employees of the Churches under the auspices of which the schools are operated. Although the Government makes a per capita grant for the maintenance and operation of these schools, the teachers in charge cannot be considered in any sense government employees. In the case of Indian day school teachers about 60% are nominated by the church authorities and these nominations in each case are approved by the Department. The salaries of Indian day school teachers, which are substantially higher than the salaries paid to teachers engaged in somewhat similar work in public schools, are paid in full by the Dominion Government. It is my understanding that in a number of cases teachers, in addition to their regular classroom duties, act as missionaries and are no doubt paid by the churches for their missionary work.\n\nM. J.

This amount is deducted from the teachers' salaries by the individual school boards. Thus the contributions to the Fund are guaranteed.\n\nAs the Provincial Government makes no grant to the Indian Schools, the contributions of the teachers of Indian Schools cannot be guaranteed in this way. It seems that these contributions must be guaranteed before the Provincial Government will consider taking us in on the scheme.\n\nThe question is, \"Will the Federal Treasury Department, upon the written request of the teachers of Indian Schools, deduct from the salaries of the said teachers 4% of the yearly salary and lay over the amount collected to the Saskatchewan Teachers' Superannuation Fund?\"\n\nWe hope that the reply will be affirmative, so that we can supply this information when we make the request for the passage of the amendment.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary, S.T.I.D.S.

Perhaps the best manner of accomplishing it is to describe to you an incident that actually happened here in the spring of this year.\n\nI am a teacher with a B.A. degree and a teaching certificate. In March a certain principal requested me to take charge of some of the classes in the Indian School.\nunder his care. At first I was glad to consent, but later when I learned that our Department of Education does not consider the services of such teachers in Indian schools as services toward assimilation, I immediately cancelled my acceptance.\n\nSince then I've often thought that you, perhaps, could influence the members of the Department of Education of our province to change their present regulations with regard to teachers in Indian schools. And if it can not be done, then qualified teachers will be reluctant to accept positions in those schools and the Indian children must necessarily suffer considerably for lack of such teachers to instruct them.\n\nI hope my explanation of the situation has not been too lengthy or indistinct.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJoe. Froholt\nDear Mr. Trohak:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of September 18, in which you discuss the desirability of having either the Provincial Government or the Federal Government make provision for a superannuation fund for teachers.\n\nI may state by way of comment that we have at this date a pupil enrolment at Indian schools in the Dominion of approximately 15,967. Of these pupils, 9,287 are enrolled at Indian day schools and 6,680 at residential schools. The teachers employed at Indian residential schools are the employees of the Churches under the auspices of which the schools are operated. Although the Government makes a per capita grant for the maintenance and operation of these schools, the teachers in charge cannot be considered in any sense government employees. In the case of Indian day school teachers, about 60% are nominated by the church authorities and these nominations in each case are approved by the Department. The salaries of Indian day school teachers, which are substantially higher than the salaries paid to teachers engaged in somewhat similar work in public schools, are paid in full by the Dominion Government. It is gratifying that in a number of cases teachers in addition to their regular classroom duties act as missionaries and are no doubt paid by the churches for their missionary effort on the reserves. Indian day school teachers are classified, therefore, as temporary civil servants. It is estimated that 40% of the temporary employees of the Government in all the services throughout the Dominion\n\nMr. Jos. Trohak,\nArbury, Sask.\ndo not qualify for superannuation. In this respect, Indian day school teachers do not differ from the regular temporary employees in other branches of the public service. In view of the fact that the average length of service rendered by a teacher in an Indian day school does not exceed five years, it is very difficult for me to see how we could extend to them the benefits of a superannuation act and withhold such benefits from the other temporary employees of the Government.\n\nThe main difficulties standing in the way of superannuation benefits for teachers in charge of Indian day and residential schools may be summed up as follows:\n\n1. An overwhelming majority of the teachers in charge of schools operated under the auspices of the Catholic Church are members of religious Orders and are not interested in contributing to, or receiving benefits from, a superannuation fund.\n\n2. The teachers employed at Indian residential schools are not the employees of the Government and, unless their status were changed, could not qualify for superannuation under the Dominion or Provincial Superannuation Acts.\n\n3. Indian day school teachers, particularly in the eastern provinces, move frequently from one province to another. It would be difficult, therefore, to adjust their superannuation allowances unless the Provincial Acts were somewhat uniform.\n\nThe desirability of providing a superannuation fund for Indian day school teachers has been reviewed again and again by the officials of this Department. I think you will agree with me, however, when I state\nthat the obstacles standing in the way of the creation of such a fund are for the time being insurmountable.\n\nShould you desire additional information, I want you to feel free to communicate with me again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, December 7, 1943.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of November 28, in which you discuss a superannuation fund that might be established for the benefit of Indian day school teachers.\n\nI may state that the desirability of establishing such a fund has been discussed by the Minister of this Department and by the officials of this Branch on a number of occasions within the last five year period. The difficulties standing in the way of the establishment of such a fund appear to be, for the time being at least, insurmountable. I am enclosing herewith copy of a letter recently sent forward by me to Mr. Jos. Frohak, of Arbury, Sask. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory. I might add that in my judgment there is not even a remote possibility of the establishment of such a fund at any time during the years immediately ahead of us. I make this statement, being aware that you have four children to support. In view of this fact, it is just possible that you may desire to seek a position in one of the provincial schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEmcl.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. H. Lotte,\nTeacher,\nBig Island Lake Indian Day School,\nBeacon Hill, Sask.\nOttawa, December 11, 1944.\n\nDear Doctor Greer:\n\nI expect to be in Toronto on Wednesday, December 15, and Mr. Hoey has asked me to call on you with a view to having another short talk in connection with the possibility of arranging to have teachers at Indian day schools in Ontario eligible for the Provincial Government system of superannuation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nV. K. Greer, Esq., M.A., LL.D.,\nSuperintendent of Elementary Schools,\nDepartment of Education,\nParliament Buildings,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa,\nDecember 14, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY\n\nAs requested by you, I interviewed Doctor V.K. Greer, Director of Elementary Education, Department of Education, Toronto, yesterday with regard to the procedure that would have to be followed if we decided to complete arrangements to enable teachers in Indian schools in the province of Ontario to contribute to the provincial teachers' superannuation fund and thereby provide superannuation benefits for the teachers in our Ontario Indian schools.\n\nTo carry out this programme it would be necessary for the Ontario Government to pass legislation permitting our teachers to contribute to the fund and to benefit from it. Doctor Greer was quite willing to prepare and recommend such legislation, provided we made the following commitments:\n\n1. All teachers in the Indian schools in Ontario would be required to contribute to the superannuation fund.\n\n2. Each teacher would have to contribute $3\u00bd of the monthly salary. This amount would have to be deducted from the monthly cheques by this Branch and forwarded to the Ontario teachers' superannuation fund.\n\n3. This Branch would have to contribute an additional $3\u00bd to the superannuation fund for each Indian day school teacher participating.\nIn our appropriation for the fiscal year 1945-46 we estimate the total payment for salaries of teachers of the regular Indian day schools and the combined white and Indian day schools to which we contribute at an amount of $87,545.00 and 3\u00bd% of this amount would be $3,064.07. In discussing this matter recently with you you will recall that we thought we might be able to handle this particular 3\u00bd% contribution by increasing each teacher's salary by that amount. However, Doctor Greer pointed out that this system would not be satisfactory, as it would actually increase the basic salary of the individual teacher and, as a result, increase the contribution that the teacher has to make. Consequently it would be necessary for us to provide in our appropriation the additional amount of $3,064.07 to permit our paying the 3\u00bd% contribution.\n\nWe had a very friendly talk over this matter and, as mentioned above, Doctor Greer is quite prepared to recommend the necessary legislation, if we are willing to comply with the three provisions previously mentioned.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMemorandum:\n\nAs requested by you, I interviewed Doctor V.K.

In bringing this matter to your attention, I wish to stress the fact that I have not yet had an opportunity of discussing the matter with the Minister; and consequently this preliminary letter to you should be considered confidential and in a very real sense exploratory, so that when we have the data gathered from the various provincial departments of education, I will be able to place before the Minister some concrete proposals.\n\nHowever, I thought, on the occasion of your next visit to Victoria, you might discuss the matter in an off-hand manner with the Deputy Minister or other responsible officials of the British Columbia Department of Education.\n\nThe proposal has already been discussed with the Department of Education for the province of Ontario. They appear willing to allow teachers in this province to contribute to the Provincial Teachers' Superannuation Fund on the following basis:\n\n(a) All teachers in Indian schools in Ontario would be required to contribute to the superannuation fund.\n\n(b) Each teacher would have to contribute 5\u00a2% of the monthly salary. This amount would have to be deducted from the monthly cheques by this Branch.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n(c) This Branch would have to contribute an additional 5\u00bd% of each teacher's salary to the superannuation fund.\n\nIt is also understood that only qualified teachers would be eligible to participate.\n\nI thought you would like to have the views of the Ontario Department of Education and I would appreciate having some similar information from the province of British Columbia, keeping in mind, of course, what I have said in the first paragraph of this letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nActing Director.\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYour File 129-18\n\nI have your letter of December 15th in which you suggest that the possibility of arranging with the Province to allow teachers in Indian Day Schools to contribute to the Provincial Teachers' superannuation fund and thereby become eligible for benefits under the B.C. Teachers' Pensions Act be discussed with the Provincial authorities. This matter will be given attention as soon as it is possible for me to make the journey which I hope will be around the 11th of January.\n\nInformation in connection with the educational survey of conditions at the Alberni Indian Residential School, which you requested some time ago, is being assembled and I trust will be available for submission to the Department early in the New Year. It is just possible that I shall be able to tie the Victoria trip in with the work at Alberni.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. Hackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nActing Director of Indian Affairs,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Day School\nKamloops, B.C.\nJanuary 5, 1945\n\nDear Mr. Haggard,\n\nWill you please send me a copy of the rules governing the superintendence scheme including teachers in Indian schools.\n\nYours truly,\n[Signature]\nIsabel Swaggs\nTeacher\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Day Schools does not cover Indian Day School Teachers.\n\n[Signature]\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, January 20, 1945.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant, the Superannuation Act does not cover teachers at Indian day schools. These teachers are classed as temporary Civil Servants. They do not contribute to the Superannuation Fund and consequently are not eligible for superannuation allowance.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMrs. Isabel Snodgrass,\nTeacher,\nKlentu Indian Day School,\nKlentu, B.C.\nJanuary 23, 1945.\n\nMajor McKay,\nIndian Agent for British Columbia,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFollowing your visit of about a week ago, I had a talk with Mr. Norman Baker, Superannuation Commissioner, with reference to your suggestion that School Teachers employed in the Indian Schools be allowed to come under the provisions of the \"B.C. Teachers' Pension Act\".\n\nMr. Baker feels that there is no serious obstacle in the way providing the necessary funds are forthcoming. Such a provision, however, will require minor amendments to the Statute and unless action is taken very quickly this would not be possible at the forthcoming Session.\n\nMay I suggest that you arrange with Mr. Baker either to meet you in Vancouver at some time or for you to meet him in Victoria to discuss the matter more fully.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGeo. S. Pearson\n\nPROVINCIAL SECRETARY\nFeb. 1, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Baker:\n\nWhile in Victoria recently I briefly discussed with Honourable Mr. Pearson the possibility of arranging with the Provincial Government to allow teachers in Indian Day Schools to contribute to the Provincial Teachers' Superannuation Fund and thereby become eligible for the benefits under that system.\n\nI have now received a letter from the Minister suggesting that I arrange to meet you either here in Vancouver or in Victoria to discuss the matter more fully. It would be helpful to me if arrangements could be made to meet you in Vancouver as owing to the absence of the Inspector of Indian Agencies it will be difficult for me to leave the office until he returns. You might advise me in this connection and if you are not likely to be in the city in the near future I shall try to arrange a trip to Victoria.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. MacKay:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter with reference to the possibility of arranging for the teachers in Indian Day Schools to contribute to the Provincial Teachers' Pensions Fund.\n\nMay I say that it is practically impossible for me to leave Victoria while the Legislature is in Session but if you can make the trip over I shall be delighted to meet you for a discussion on this problem.\n\nIn the meantime, would it be possible for you to furnish me with all relevant information concerning the number of teachers there are at present employed in these schools throughout the Province, giving the following particulars; the period of service of each teacher, the date of birth, and the salary paid to each teacher during the period of service teaching in an Indian School.\n\nAm I to understand that the Dominion Government is prepared to pay the requisite contribution from a date to be agreed upon, and, in order that the teacher may receive benefit for service already rendered, that the Dominion Government would make a retrospective payment of the amount necessary to allow of the same pension credit for this period of service which has already been rendered?\n\nPersonally, I can see no objection to an amendment to the \"Teachers' Pensions Act\" which would allow of this procedure, and if the information which I am asking for can be obtained in time, it could be possible to seek the necessary amendment at this present Session.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"Norman Baker\"\n\nSUPERANNUATION COMMISSIONER.\nFeb. 21, 1945.\n\nPersonal\n\nDear Mr. Baker:\n\nI have your letter of February 2nd in response to my letter of February 1st regarding the possibility of arranging for teachers in Indian Day Schools to contribute to the Provincial Teachers' Pension Fund.\n\nThe particulars you have requested regarding the teachers employed in Indian Day Schools are being assembled and will be forwarded as soon as possible.\n\nPerhaps I should say here that the enquiries I have made have been no more than exploratory in character for the information of the Acting Director of Indian Affairs who is anxious to secure the reaction of the Province to the proposal preliminary to a discussion of the scheme with the Minister and other officials of the Department.\n\nI am reporting the results of my enquiries to the Department and requesting information on the points referred to in the fourth paragraph of your letter.\n\nI should be pleased to call on you during my next visit to Victoria but in the meantime if you happen to be over here and have a moment to spare I should be very glad to have you call. The office is at 418 Federal (Post Office) Building, corner of Hastings and Granville Streets.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Perry, Minister of Education, and his deputy, Dr. Willis, and also with Honourable G. Pearson, Provincial Secretary, whose Department administers the Teachers' Pensions Act. The reaction of these men to the proposal was favorable. It is doubtful therefore if there will be any opposition from the officials to the scheme provided satisfactory details with respect to payment of funds, etc., are worked out.\n\nYou might let me have, in due course, information on the points referred to in the fourth paragraph of the Superannuation Commissioner's letter of February 2nd, a copy of which is enclosed, in order that he may be advised.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

I assure you that your information will be given no publicity except that, but I may say that I had already heard members of our Commission expressing the feeling that it would seem as if these teachers should be brought into the Dominion Civil Service Fund instead of ours.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I do not want to bother you for answers to all of Professor Sheppard's questions, but I wonder if you would mind dropping us a note later, to let us know what decision is finally made on the suggestion of bringing these teachers into the Dominion Fund.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary, Superannuation Commission.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOctober 25th, 1945.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nHaving recently taken over the position of Secretary for the Ontario Teachers' and Inspectors' Superannuation Commission, I find that there is a file, going back over some years, concerning the possibility of including in our pension plan the teachers in the Indian Schools of Ontario.\n\nThis seems to have been brought to the fore again this summer, by an official request from the Ontario Teachers' Federation, as follows:\n\n\"That a teacher who has taught on an Indian Reserve in the Province of Ontario be allowed to pay into the Teachers' and Inspectors' Superannuation Fund for the years of such teaching in order that he or she may later receive credit for such years of service.\"\n\nWhen this request came before the Commission, the Secretary was instructed to secure from Ottawa the information which our Actuary might wish in order to reach any decision on this case.\n\nIn this connection, I enclose a copy of the note received from our Actuary, Professor N. E. Sheppard.\n\nAny assistance you may be able to give us, I can assure you, will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary, Superannuation Commission.\n\nDr. H. W. McGill,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY,\nONTARIO TEACHERS & INSPECTORS SUPERANNUATION COMMISSION\n\nIn order to answer the question raised by the O.T.F. at the meeting of the Commission held on 5 May 1945 in reference to the granting of credit for service of teachers in Indian Schools in Ontario, we think the Commission should have the following information:\n\n1. The number of such schools for Indian children.\n2. Are all such schools under the supervision of the Dominion Indian Affairs Branch? Why are teachers who are teaching in such schools not treated as Dominion Civil Servants? Up to the present has any provision or arrangement been made by the Branch for pensions of these teachers?\n3. The number of teachers of each sex at present teaching in Indian Schools under the supervision of the Dominion Indian Affairs Branch.\n4. The proportion of such teachers who have (i) Ontario certificates (ii) similar qualifications from other provinces in Canada or other parts of the British Empire.\n5. The annual salary range for each sex.\n\nThere is certain general information given for all Canada regarding the number of schools and Indian children in the Canadian Almanac. The Indian Affairs Branch may publish an annual report covering the above.\n\nIt may be that it is possible to have the above data obtained in respect of each Indian school in Ontario and for each teacher. If so, we could obtain part of the above general information from the individual data and in addition the individual age of each teacher and his or her length of service might be given.\n\n\"N.E.S.\"\nOttawa, October 27, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Henry:\n\nYour letter of October 25th, addressed to Doctor McGill, has been passed on to me for consideration and reply. I may state that Doctor McGill retired from the public service about a year ago and is at present living at the Pacific Coast.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that we have had under consideration during the last three or four-month period certain amendments to the Civil Service Act and to existing regulations, whereby teachers employed at Indian Day Schools would become permanent civil servants, contribute to the superannuation fund, and thus qualify for pensions. I cannot at the moment, of course, state what the final outcome will be. I do feel, however, that this information should be conveyed to all members of your Commission on the understanding that it cannot become a subject of public discussion until the Government here reaches a definite decision. It is altogether likely that you may not want at this date the information requested in the memorandum prepared for you by Professor N. K. Sheppard. In any event, I am enclosing copy of the last annual report of this Branch, which contains certain information with respect to the number of Indian Day and Residential Schools, the enrolment, etc. Should you require additional information, I want you to feel free to communicate with me again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nS.

The number of these is 41.\n\n(b) Regular schools which are vacant at present owing to the impossibility of securing a teacher. The number in this class is 10.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nProposals for Grades of Civil Servants to be employed in the Welfare and Training Service of the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources\n\nIt will be necessary, as I have pointed out in my brief, to complete a detailed survey of all provincial teachers' salary scales before making a definite recommendation to you. However, I decided to present these suggestions to you more to indicate how I was approaching this problem and to enable you to compare your ideas to mine.\n\nTeachers' salary scales fall into two main categories:\n\n(a) Those in which a comparatively high minimum salary is given to the beginning teacher, with small increases for each year's experience. An example of this is the Province of Saskatchewan, where the minimum salary for a certificated teacher is now $1,200.00 per annum. This is the highest minimum salary required by law in Canada.\n\n(b) Those in which a lower minimum salary is given to the beginning teacher, but with a substantial increase each year. An example of this is Nova Scotia, where minimum salaries begin at $900.00 a year but go up by $50.00 per annum.\n\nEach of these two systems has merit, but I am not prepared to decide definitely the one I would recommend to you until I have completed a survey of the entire field.\n\nA. DAY SCHOOL TEACHERS\n\n1. Teacher, Day School, Grade I - $900.00 - $1,050.00\n2. Teacher, Day School, Grade II - $1,000.00 - $1,250.00\n3. Teacher, Day School, Grade III - $1,300.00 - $1,650.00\n4. Teacher, Day School, Grade IV - $1,500.00 - $1,650.00\n\nClassification Regulations:\n\n1. Teacher, Day School, Grade I\n\n(a) After 1 September, 1947, a Teacher's Training Certificate from a recognized Normal or Teachers' Training School will be required. Any non-certificated teacher employed as of that date can be retained in the Service but no further non-certificated teachers will be employed except in the event of an emergency.\n\n(b) A salary raise of $50.00 a year to the maximum of $1,050.00 will be given for satisfactory teaching service.\n2. Teacher, Day School, Grade II\n\n(a) A Second Class Teacher's Certificate, or equivalent requiring High School Matriculation.\n\n(b) Three years' satisfactory provincial teaching experience or as a teacher, Day School or Residential School, Grade I.\n\n(c) At least one professional or academic course at a school of recognized standing during the teaching experience listed in (b) above. Such courses will include attendance at a Provincial Teachers' Summer School, University Summer School, Extra-mural Course from a University or a Provincial Correspondence School.\n\n3. Teacher, Day School, Grade III\n\n(a) A first class teacher's certificate or equivalent requiring high school Senior Matriculation (first year university).\n\n(b) Six years' satisfactory provincial teaching experience or three years as a teacher, day or residential school, Grade II.\n\n(c) At least one professional or academic course at a school of recognized standing during the teaching experience listed in (b) above.\n\n4. Teacher, Day School, Grade IV\n\n(a) A First Class Teacher's Certificate or equivalent or better.\n\n(b) Three years' satisfactory experience as a teacher, Grade III.\n\n(c) At least one professional or academic course at a school of recognized standing during the teaching experience listed in (b) above.\n\nB. TEACHERS, WELFARE\n\n1. Teacher Welfare, Grade I - $1,000. - $1,150.\n\n2. Teacher Welfare, Grade II - 1,200. - 1,350.\n\n3. Teacher Welfare, Grade III - 1,400. - 1,550.\n\n4. Teacher Welfare, Grade IV - 1,600. - 1,750.\n\nClassification Regulations:\n\nRegulations would be the same as for Teachers, Day School, except that these teachers would remain on the reservations during the summer holidays except for the usual 3 weeks' holidays.\n\nI would suggest that once every three years they be given a holiday of 7 weeks, providing that during this period\nthey attended a course at a Canadian or American university in Social welfare, Sociology, Child Psychology, or some allied professional field.\n\nC. TEACHERS, RESIDENTIAL\n\n1. Teachers, Residential, Grade I - $450.00 - $600.00\n2. Teachers, Residential, Grade II - $500.00 - $1,000.00\n3. Teachers, Residential, Grade III - $1,050.00 - $1,200.00\n4. Teachers, Residential, Grade IV - $1,250.00 - $1,400.00\n\nClassification Regulations\n\n(a) Promotions would be made on the same basis as for Teachers, Day.\n\n(b) These salaries are on exactly the same basis as for Teachers, Day, except that they are $25.00 a month lower in each category.\n\nD. PRINCIPAL'S BONUS\n\nThese would be paid on the same basis as the category of teacher into which they fall plus the following bonus:\n\n1. Day School Principals with schools of an average annual attendance of 50 or above would receive $1.00 per average annual attendance of the preceding year.\n\n2. Residential School Principals would receive $2.00 per average annual attendance of the preceding year.\nOttawa, August 9, 1946.\n\nSubject:\n\nAppreciation of Two Possible Superannuation Plans for Indian School Teachers\n\n1. Object.\n\nTo select one of the two superannuation plans listed below in order to provide greater benefit to, and more security for, the Indian school teacher:\n\n(a) That the teacher of an Indian school be permitted to pay into the Teachers' and Inspectors' Superannuation Fund of the Province in which such Indian school is located, for the years of his teaching, in order that he might later receive credit for such years of service. This proposal shall be known hereafter as the Provincial Superannuation Plan.\n\n(b) That the teacher of an Indian school be permitted to pay into the Civil Servants' Superannuation Fund of the Dominion of Canada, in order that he might later receive credit for such years of service. This proposal shall be known hereafter as the Dominion Superannuation Plan.\n\n2. Assumptions:\n\n(a) After some consideration I have concluded that it would be impractical to prepare a superannuation plan for the day school teacher and not for the residential school teacher. If the superannuation plan for the day school teacher was adopted, I feel sure that many of the teachers from residential schools who have their teachers included would be such that they too would soon have to be included in the superannuation plan. Therefore, I have decided to draw up a program for both classes of teachers in order that the requirements of these two groups could be properly assessed in relation to one another.\n\nWhether these two plans are adopted simultaneously or whether the residential school teacher's plan is discarded or delayed, I leave entirely to the judgment of my seniors.\n\n(b) That the key-stone of the educational system is the teacher and that it is most essential for the future of Indian education to provide at once, some form of security for our teachers. It is evident that the best form this security can take is a superannuation plan.\n\n3. Provincial Superannuation Plan\n\n(a) Advantages\n\nI. It would not involve any change in the present plan of appointing and dismissing of teachers of Indian day schools.\nII It would not involve any change in the present plan of appointing and dismissing of teachers of Indian residential schools.\n\nIII It would provide an optional plan for those denominations using religious orders in the teaching of Indians. Such denominations would have the choice as to whether or not they wish to contribute to such a Superannuation Fund on behalf of their teachers.\n\nIV Teachers would be easily interchanged between Provincial schools and the Indian schools of that province because of their contribution to the same Superannuation Fund. Many teachers of the provincial schools now refuse to change to any Indian school because it would involve the loss of time and possibly payment made to the Superannuation Fund. The adoption of this plan would eliminate this difficulty and would provide for greater co-ordination between the provincial schools and the Indian schools.\n\n(b) Disadvantages:\n\nI The nine Provincial Legislatures would have to be called on separately to authorize in each instance the change in their Teachers' Superannuation Acts necessary before our teachers could participate. Three provinces, namely, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Ontario, have already indicated their willingness to approve such legislative changes. However, it is possible that we might encounter some difficulty in arranging for such amendments. Some might well object to temporary Dominion Civil Servants being superannuated on a Provincial Civil Service Fund.\n\nII The Teachers' Superannuation Acts of the Provinces vary considerably; we could encounter difficulties in providing applications for authorization to cover the contributions of the Dominion Government to the Provincial Plans. For example, in Saskatchewan, teachers contribute four per cent of their salaries whereas in Ontario and British Columbia they contribute only three and a half per cent of their salaries.\n\nIII The Department would encounter some difficulty in moving teachers from one province to another province in view of the lack of uniformity in the Provincial Superannuation Acts.\n\nIV The teachers employed at Indian residential schools are not the employees of the Department, and unless their status were changed, could not qualify for superannuation. However, this difficulty would apply to both plans, as pointed out by the Honourable Mr. Crear (Flag No. 1 down).\n\nV The question of the change in status of residential school teachers as involved in number four above is one that would have to be referred to the four denominations at present running our residential schools. It is understood that there may be considerable opposition to a change in the policy.\nnow in force (as stated by Honourable Mr. Grigor\n(flag No. 2 down).\n\nVI It is understood that some of the Provincial Plans\nare not as financially sound as might be desired.\nFor example, in British Columbia, it has been neces-\nsary during recent years to require the teachers\nthere to pay in extra sums into the Fund in order\nto maintain the payments to teachers already\nretired.\n\nVII Separate provision would have to be made for teachers\nin the Northwest Territories and the Yukon. It would\nprobably be necessary to include them in the present\nDominion Government superannuation system. Then we\nwould be adopting two separate plans.\n\n4. Dominion Superannuation Plan\n\n(a) Advantages\n\nI. It would only require one legislative change to\nenact this plan.\n\nII. It would be easier from a finance point of view\nas it would mean only the addition of some six\nhundred teachers to the present Civil Service\nsuperannuation Plan. There would also be a standard\nrate of deduction.\n\nIII. The department could easily move teachers from\none province to another without interfering with\ntheir superannuation funds.\n\nIV. The Dominion Government superannuation policy is\na very sound one and would provide the greatest\nsecurity for our teachers.\n\nV. Our day school teachers are already Dominion Civil\nServants but exempt from superannuation. For them\nit will only be necessary to lift this exemption.\n\nVI. It will enable the department to authorize \"training\nin service\" by having teachers attend advance\ncourses on reduced rates of pay without losing\ntheir superannuation benefits.\n\nVII. The adoption of the Provincial Plan would lead to\nendless correspondence about leave or absence,\nillness of teachers, etc. It will require a staff\nof experts to determine the contributions and\ninterpret the nine different provincial systems.\n\n(b) Disadvantages:\n\nI. It might involve a change in the present plan of\nappointing and dismissing teachers of Indian day\nschools. At first this seemed a very serious\ndisadvantage. However, I have since found out\nthat the Department of National Health and Welfare\ndoes the appointing and dismissing of nurses and kitchen aids at Indian hospitals and nursing stations. With this precedent it should not be difficult for our Department to convince the Civil Service Commission that we should continue with our present plan.\n\nII. It will mean that the Department will assume the cost of paying teachers of Indian residential schools rather than the various denominations as at present.\n\nIII. It will hardly be feasible for this to be an optimal plan and all denominations will have to be called on to agree to this new procedure. As the Honourable Mr. Crear has pointed out, this may well be difficult (see IV below).\n\nIV. It will mean a change in the present plan of appointing and dismissing teachers of Indian residential schools. It would be most unreasonable to expect the Crown to assume the payment of these teachers and yet have no voice in their appointments. It will probably be necessary to compromise by having the denominations given the power of nomination. As this has worked successfully for day schools, it should work for residential schools.\n\nV. It will not be easy to inter-change between provincial and Indian schools as teachers would thereby lose their superannuation years (it would not affect administration funds). However, this will work in two ways: teachers will not want to change to Indian schools but on the other hand once they are in they will not want to change back to provincial schools. Thus our holding power will be greater.\n\nVI. Teachers will have to be paid on a 12 month basis to be full-time employees.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n\nAfter weighing carefully the above factors, I have decided in favour of the Dominion Superannuation Plan.\n\n6. Plan:\n\nIf you concur in this decision, I propose to next attack the problems as follows:\n\n(a) To conduct a survey of all provincial superannuation plans and teacher's salary schedules.\n\n(b) To classify the various grades of teachers and to list their duties and qualifications. (I attach as appendix A, a rough outline of my present ideas).\n\n(c) To prepare an estimate of the cost of this proposal.\nAugust 12th, 1946.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept' of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWill you kindly let me have some information with regard to the deductions made by the Department for Superannuation in connection with teachers at the Indian Day Schools. We understand that monthly deductions are made for this purpose and we would be glad to know if a person so engaged could continue paying into the fund after leaving a teacher's position or would the teacher receive a refund of the amount deducted for this purpose.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary-Treasurer.\n\nRHP/PH\nOttawa, August 19, 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOur Indian Day School Teachers are classified as temporary Civil Servants and do not qualify for Superannuation at the present time.\n\nThe deductions made from their monthly cheques are for a Retirement Fund as provided for by the Civil Service Act for temporary Civil Servants. These moneys accumulate yearly interest at the rate of 4%.\n\nA teacher cannot pay into this fund after leaving the service but can withdraw the accumulated sum on retirement.\n\nI hope this clarifies the situation for you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR. H. Pock, Esq.,\nSecretary-Treasurer,\nSynod of the Diocese of Rupert's Land,\nTrinity Hall,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nDear Sir,\n\nI was in charge of the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School for a period of five (5) years 1939-1944 and enjoyed the work very much. During that period however I was not credited with the 5 years of teaching in the province of Saskatchewan for superannuation service. I am now back in the public schools of Sask. and would like to be credited with those five years of teaching and am asking your department to do your utmost in promoting this. Will you kindly get in touch with the Dept at Regina and promote this scheme?\n\nIt is very regrettable that the teachers are not affiliated with the Sask. Teachers superannuation as I feel assured that your Indian day school teachers would be most\nbenefited and the results of the work of day schools teaching elevated if such a plan was brought about.\n\nI would gladly return to work on an Indian Reserve if we were affiliated with the local teachers' organization.\n\nMay I hear from you in the very near future regarding this matter as I have the interests of the Indian people at heart and am anxious to return to Reserve work when some superannuation scheme is developed?\n\nMay I also be so bold as to suggest that you appoint a helping teacher or School Inspector who will devote his entire time to supervision of Indian Day Schools in the various agencies throughout the province.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRaymond E. Robinson\nPov. Deer Lodge Public School.\nOttawa, November 6, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Robinson:\n\nI have received your letter of October 28. Unfortunately, your period of teaching with the Indian Affairs Branch cannot be credited to your superannuation service in the schools of Saskatchewan. The only credit which is given for teaching service in Indian schools is towards the granting of a permanent teaching certificate and that only when the school is inspected by a provincial inspector of schools.\n\nTeachers of Indian day schools are regarded as temporary Civil Servants and are at present not eligible under the Dominion Government Superannuation plan. Efforts are being made to have this changed.\n\nYour comments concerning the helping teacher and school inspectors are appreciated. We have already such helping teachers in service in Ontario and have recently appointed our own School Inspector in the Province of British Columbia.\n\nI regret that there is nothing we can do to assist you in your request.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Raymond G. Robinson,\nPrincipal,\nDeer Ridge Public School,\nDeer Ridge, Saskatchewan.\nOttawa, December 12, 1946.\n\nProposals for Changes in Classifications of Indian Day School Teachers.\n\nAttention: Mr. G.Y.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to our recent conversation, I enclose, for your information, a copy of the latest proposals drafted for the reclassification of Indian Day School Teachers as Permanent rather than Temporary Civil Servants.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F. Murray,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nOrganization Branch,\nCivil Service Commission,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of December 30th with reference to the superannuation of teachers who are members of religious orders.\n\nIn this province we make no distinction between teachers who are members of religious orders and those who are laymen. Any person holding a teacher's license from the Council of Public Instruction is eligible to teach in any public school and the individual school boards have the decision as to whether a lay person or a member of a religious order is to be engaged.\n\nI regret that I cannot send you a copy of the Nova Scotia Teachers Pension Act as the Act is at present out of print. Briefly, our teachers' pensions are not based on the teachers' salaries, but on their provincial aid, which is paid to them direct by the Department of Education. Sixteen per cent of the provincial aid is deducted each year and placed in the Pension Fund, and on retirement each teacher is entitled to pension equal to three times the provincial aid they received at the time of retirement. Pensions for fully qualified teachers vary from $650 to $1020 per year according to the class of license held.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nH. P. Moffatt,\nAsst. Supt. of Education.\nJan. 2, 1947.\n\nCol. B.F. Henry,\nSup't Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Henry,\n\nIn response to your S.O.S., I am forwarding under separate cover:\n\n(a) a copy of the Manitoba Teachers' Retirement Fund Act and by-laws made thereunder.\n\n(b) a copy of the Manitoba School Attendance Act.\n\n(Note - The latter is bound in an office compilation together with our Public Schools Act and Education Department Act - thought you might be interested in all three).\n\nThe Sisters in St. Boniface and the Brothers too come under our Teachers' Retirement Fund Act just the same as any other qualified teachers holding regularly recognized teaching posts. Of course they are not members of the Manitoba Civil Service nor do we have any separate schools in Manitoba.\n\nThe members of religious orders teaching under the St. Boniface school board or any other provincial school board in Manitoba are the employees of the school board concerned and are paid by the school board as such. What, for example, the Sisters personally do with their salary cheques is no concern of the St. Boniface school board. Could members of religious orders not serve as employees of the Dominion government on similar terms?\n\nHope you had a pleasant festive season.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJAN 8 1947\n\nREGISTERED\nONTARIO TEACHERS' AND INSPECTORS' SUPERANNUATION COMMISSION\n\nQUESTIONNAIRE\nRe EXTRA-PROVINCIAL TEACHING EXPERIENCE\nand Re EXPERIENCE IN INDIAN SCHOOLS\n\nNote to the teacher\u2014\nThe Teachers' and Inspectors' Superannuation Commission has asked your inspector (or your secondary school principal) to assist in collecting information about the extra-provincial or Indian school teaching service of present Ontario teachers.

In 1924, this privilege was extended to the appointment of ward aids and hospital attendants on various types. In 1946 this privilege was extended to the Department of National Health and Welfare and it was specified that these positions would be totally exempt from the Civil Service Commission. The reason advanced for this exemption was that rotational service was required of their hospital personnel; they were often moved from one hospital to another and also from one province to another and it was desired that this should be done with great flexibility. It was felt therefore that they should be exempt from the Civil Service Commission.\n\nSpecial reference should be made to P.O. 38/1721 of March 14, 1945, which specifically states that five years' temporary service when excluded from Civil Service Commission regulations, entitles application to Treasury Board for superannuation. (This was amended by P.C. 221/3185 of July 27, 1946.)\n\nMr. Hazleton also described the following method of detailing specific numbers for teaching positions:\n(a) HW denoting Health and Welfare,\n(b) IM denoting Indian Medical,\n(c) starting with P.E.I. and working towards B.C. by denoting the province numbers 1 to 9. No. 10 denotes Northwest Territories.\n(d) Numbers start at 6,000 and go upwards.\n\nTherefore a nurse at a hospital in the Northwest Territories would have her position denoted as follows:\n\nHW - IM 10-6000\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, April 12, 1947.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nIndian Day School - Stony Creek Reserve\n\nReference your 215-13-6944 of March 31\n\nAccording to our new teachers' salary scale,\nan advance copy of which I attach for your information,\nMr. Wilson could be classified as a grade 3 teacher and his\nstarting salary would be $1,500 a year. To this of course\nwe would add whatever janitor's fees you would deem neces-\nsary in this new school.\n\nIt is not our intention to classify teachers\nas welfare teachers unless we have the specific recommenda-\ntion of the Agent and Commissioner concerned. You will\nnote that Mr. Wilson, if so classified, would be entitled\nto $1,800 a year.\n\nFurther details concerning the salary scale\nwill be printed in the forthcoming issue of the School\nBulletin. However, I would like to point out that British\nColumbia has been the most difficult province to deal with\nin regard to teachers' salaries. Provincial salaries are\nmuch higher than in any other province except Ontario. As\na result, our salary scale is much higher than the scale,\nfor example, for the province of Nova Scotia and probably\nlower than most school board scales in British Columbia.\nI hope to have an opportunity of discussing this with you\npersonally on your intended visit to Ottawa.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nto: Mr. Wimberley:\n\nOttawa, December 1946\n\nCivil Service Standing for Indian School Teachers\n\nFurther to our recent conversation, I submit herewith proposals for submission to the Treasury Board concerning the above.\n\nSuggestions for Submission to Treasury Board:\nThe attached proposals are for grades of civil servants to be employed in the Welfare and Training Service of the Indian Affairs Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources. These proposals include a salary scale and the changing of Indian day school teachers from temporary civil servants to permanent civil servants, at the conclusion of two satisfactory years' teaching experience with the Department.\n\nEvery year we are experiencing greater difficulty in obtaining certificated teachers for our schools. All provinces have now introduced teachers' superannuation plans and are our teachers are leaving the service for provincial schools which offer them greater security. If we wish to compete with the provincial systems, it is most essential that we grant superannuation rights to our day school teachers.\n\nInsofar as the salary scale is concerned, you will find attached a complete appreciation of the salaries paid to teachers throughout the Dominion and a copy of Education Bulletin No. 1, 1946, entitled \"Teachers' Salaries and Qualifications in Eight Provinces - 1945.\"\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAPPENDIX A\n\nPERMANENT AND TEMPORARY TEACHERS\n\nI would recommend that\n\n(a) the provisions and regulations of the Civil Service Superannuation Act apply to this new class of contributor,\n\n(b) that at least two years' satisfactory teaching service in Indian day schools be required before application for permanency be made, and that the teacher by then hold a permanent teaching certificate.\n\n(c) that, in the case of day school teachers who teach only for the academic year of ten months, this ten month period shall count as one year of service within the meaning of the Act.\n\n(d) that teachers, who do not elect to become contributors, continue to be classed as temporary civil servants.\n\n(e) that teachers of schools which are in operation less than ten months continue to be classified as temporary civil servants.\n\nIn order to qualify for increased salaries, most of our teachers will be attending a five or six weeks' summer school course during their \"holidays\". Therefore, they will actually be improving their own qualifications and teaching ability during this two month period.\nAPPENDIX B.\n\nPAYMENT OF TEACHERS ON A 12 MONTH BASIS\n\nThis would not only make payment of salaries easier for our Treasury officials but is also in line with recent provincial legislation.\n\n(1) Nova Scotia\n\nEducation Act, 1946; Regulation 3 (a) \"Teachers' salaries must be paid in twelve equal instalments, the first to be paid not later than the last day of September, and the last not later than the last day of August\".\n\n(2) Alberta\n\nSchool Act 172 (3) \"Every teacher shall be paid his annual salary in twelve equal monthly instalments, on the last day of each month\".\n\nTherefore the salaries in our scale have been made divisible by twelve so that our teachers can be paid monthly.\n(For future issue of The Bulletin).\n\nProposals for Superannuation for temporary Civil Servants employed in the Welfare and Training Service of the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nThe Treasury Board and our Minister have approved of the establishment of grades of Civil Servants who will be employed on a temporary basis as teachers of Indian Day Schools. It is now our intention to approach the Treasury Board with the request that certain of these teachers be designated as permanent for the purposes of the Civil Service Superannuation Act, 1924, as amended.\n\nIf the Treasury Board approves of our proposals it will mean that certain of our day school teachers will be classified as permanent civil servants, for the purposes of the Civil Service Superannuation Act. We have had many requests from teachers, principals, agents and inspectors that such superannuation privileges be granted to our teachers. We have also had requests that teachers of Indian schools be permitted to pay into the Teachers and Inspector's Superannuation Fund of the Province in which such Indian schools are located.\n\nAfter much consideration it was found necessary to discard this latter plan of provincial superannuation contributions because of the following disadvantages it possessed:\n\n(a). It would have been necessary to request nine separate Provincial Legislatures to authorize in each instance the changes in their present Teachers' Superannuation Acts necessary before our teachers could participate.\n\n(b). The percentage contributions required by the superannuation commissions of the various provinces varied considerably. It would have involved a great deal of extra work by our Treasury officials in computing deductions at 3\u00bd%, 4%, 4\u00bd%, 5% etc. as required by different provinces.\n(c). The Department would have encountered some difficulty in moving teachers from one province to another province in view of the lack of uniformity in the Provincial Superannuation Acts.\n\n(d). Separate provision would still have to be made for teachers in the North West Territories. It would probably have been necessary to include them in the superannuation system. Then we would have been adopting two separate plans.\n\n(e). In general, the Dominion superannuation plan provides for a larger pension rate than do provincial plans.\n\nIn view of the above it was decided to approach Treasury Board with the proposals included herein.\n\nThis classification of permanent civil servant for the purposes of superannuation will be applied only to certain of our teachers as detailed below:\n\n(a) Teachers who are in possession of permanent teaching certificates as granted by Provincial Departments of Education.\n\n(b) Teachers who have been employed for a period of at least two years as Indian Day School Teachers and upon whose work satisfactory School Inspectors' reports have been submitted.\n\n(c) Teachers who otherwise qualify within the regulations laid down in the Civil Service Superannuation Act.\n\nNote: Married women to be eligible, provide proof of the fact that they are, of necessity, self-supporting.\n\nIt is requested that all teachers who fall into the above classification and who would wish to be made eligible for superannuation under the Civil Service Superannuation Act complete the form attached hereto and submit it to the Indian Affairs Branch as soon as possible. It is strongly suggested that you read carefully the clauses of the Civil Service\nSuperannuation Act. We have enclosed a copy of this Act so that you can consider its provisions carefully before making application.\n\nIt is emphasized that this is a preliminary step only and that when all applications are received, the Treasury Board will have to be approached and must approve of the proposals outlined in paragraph one before they become regulations.\nPERSONAL\n\nOttawa, May 8, 1947.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRecently I was able to obtain much valuable information from you concerning the proposals which we are advancing for the superannuation of Indian day school teachers.

I would suggest that your paragraph read somewhat like this:\n\n\"The Treasury Board on the recommendation of our Minister, have approved the establishment of grades of civil servants who may be employed as teachers in Indian Schools. It is now our intention to recommend to the Treasury Board that certain of these teachers be appointed as permanent, and thereby automatically become contributors under the Civil Service Superannuation Act provided they qualify in all respects.\"\n\nWith respect to the rest of your letter I have no comment.\n\nI note that you use the word \"designation\" in your questionsaire, and I would suggest that this be deleted. It is not a question of designation but one of appointment to a permanent position. There is no provision under the Civil Service Superannuation Act for designation of employees such as you propose to make permanent.\nI would also suggest that you do not forward a medical report to these people at this time. This report should only be forwarded to those whom you decide to recommend for permanent appointments that would be after you have received and examined all the completed questionnaires. By sending this form out to all your people, it might raise some false hopes.\n\nIn reference to your draft report to Council the only comment I have to make is that line eleven should be deleted for the reason that if the report is approved those named therein will automatically become contributors under the Civil Service Superannuation Act.\n\nI have discussed the above with Mr. MacKenzie of the Treasury Board staff and he concurs.\n\nAs a matter of record I would be glad if you would forward me a copy of the Order in Council approving the various grades and the salary range attached to each grade.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(G.

It is now our intention to recommend to the Treasury Board that certain of these teachers be appointed as permanent, and thereby automatically become contributors under the Civil Service Superannuation Act provided they qualify in all respects.\n\nIf the Treasury Board approve of our proposals it will mean that some of our day school teachers will be classified as permanent civil servants, for the purposes of the Civil Service Superannuation Act. We have had many requests from teachers, principals, agents and inspectors that such superannuation privileges be granted to our teachers. We have also had requests that teachers of Indian schools be permitted to pay into the Teachers' and Inspectors' Superannuation Funds of the Provinces in which such Indian schools are located.\n\nAfter much consideration it was found necessary to discard this latter plan of provincial superannuation contributions because of the following disadvantages it possessed:\n\n(a) It would have been necessary to request nine separate Provincial Legislatures to authorize in each instance the changes in their present Teachers' Superannuation Acts necessary before our teachers could have participated.\n\n(b) The percentage contributions required by the superannuation commissions of the various provinces varied considerably. It would have involved a great deal of extra work by our Treasury officials in computing deductions at 3%, 4%, 4\u00bd%, 5%, etc., as required by different provinces.\n\n(c) The Department would have encountered some difficulty in moving teachers from one province to another province in view of the lack of uniformity in the Provincial Superannuation Acts.\n\n(d) Separate provision would still have to be made for teachers in the Northwest Territories. It would probably have been necessary to include them in the Dominion Superannuation system. Then we would have been adopting two separate plans.\n\n(e) In general, the Dominion superannuation plan provides for a larger pension rate than do provincial plans.\n\nIn view of the above it was decided to approach\nTreasury Board with the proposals included herein.\n\nThis classification of permanent civil servant for the purposes of superannuation will be applied only to certain of our teachers as detailed below:\n\n(a) Teachers who are in possession of permanent teaching certificates as granted by Provincial Departments of Education.\n\n(b) Teachers who have been employed for a period of at least two years as Indian Day School Teachers and upon whose work satisfactory School Inspectors' and Indian Agents' reports have been submitted.\n\n(c) Teachers who otherwise qualify within the regulations laid down in the Civil Service Superannuation Act.\n\nNote: Married women to be eligible must provide proof of the fact that they are, of necessity, self-supporting.\n\nIt is requested that all teachers who fall into the above classification and who would wish to be made eligible for superannuation under the Civil Service Superannuation Act complete the form attached hereto and submit it to the Indian Affairs Branch as soon as possible. It is strongly suggested that you read carefully the clauses of the Civil Service Superannuation Act. We have enclosed a copy of the summary of this Act so that you can consider its provisions carefully before making application.\n\nIt is emphasized that this is a preliminary step only and that when all applications are received, the Treasury Board will have to be approached and must approve of the proposals outlined in paragraph one before they become regulations.\nAPPLICATION FOR AS PERMANENT CIVIL SERVANT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE CIVIL SERVICE SUPERANNUATION ACT, 1924, AS AMENDED.\n\nI, the undersigned, do hereby make application for appointment as a permanent Civil Servant for the purposes of the Civil Service Superannuation Act, 1924, as amended.\n\nI was born at ................................................................. on ...........................................

Mackenzie, Esq.,\nTreasury Board Staff,\nDepartment of Finance,\nEast Block,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nProposed Details For A New Manitoba Teachers' Superannuation Act\n\nI. The teachers desire a retirement allowance to consist of two parts:\n\n(a) A Service Pension provided by the Provincial Government, the amount of which would be determined by length of service at the age of retirement.\n\nThis pension is based on each full year and any fraction of a year of service to be paid in accordance with the following schedule:\n\n| Age       | Women | Men |\n|-----------|-------|-----|\n| 60 or over| $20,000 | $25,040 |\n| 59        | $18,586 | $21,174 |\n| 58        | $17,304 | $19,508 |\n| 57        | $16,124 | $18,110 |\n| 56        | $15,074 | $16,685 |\n| 55        | $14,104 | $15,453 |\n\nThe maximum for which a service pension could be drawn would be for forty years.\n\n(b) An Annuity, to be purchased by the accumulated funds derived from the reasonably deductions from the teacher's salary.\n\nThat for the annuity account a compulsory rate of interest be made from the teacher's salary and that it be optional for the teacher to contribute an amount up to 10% of salary.\n\nII. The normal retirement age should be set for all teachers and provisions should be made for optional earlier retirement in which case the pension would be actuarially adjusted.\n\nNormal retirement age shall be 60 years; compulsory retirement at age 65; optional retirement at age 55 with 15 years of service.\n\nIII. A satisfactory disability pension should be provided.\n\nAny teacher who has served at least 15 years in the schools of Manitoba under this act and who becomes totally disabled, and for that reason unfit for further service as a teacher, should be eligible to receive a retirement allowance. The retirement allowance should consist of the service pension, actuarially adjusted to the normal retirement age for the actual years of service plus the annuity that can be purchased by the accumulated five percent contributions made by the teacher with accrued interest. In any case where the retirement allowance so computed is less than $500 per annum such allowance should be increased to $500 per annum from the service pensions account.\n\nIV. The estate of a teacher who dies before retiring will be paid out of the fund to consist of the individual's contributions together with accrued interest.\n\nV. Teachers withdrawing from educational work should receive their contributions together with accrued interest.\n\nWe are willing to concede that persons withdrawing from teaching should receive all but their first year's contributions together with accrued interest until our experience of the new scheme justifies the payment of this concession. The contributions to be placed in the service pensions account.\n\nVI. Teachers who transfer their services to another educational authority within the Province of Manitoba should receive a paid-up annuity, to start at normal retirement age, for the period of service in the schools of Manitoba provided that until retirement age they have contributed to the provincial work.\n\nUnder this section, service pensions for actual years of teaching in the schools of the Province of Manitoba would be granted to:\n\n(a) Teachers who are now or who become employees of the Provincial Government as Inspectors of\nAt this meeting the proposed details were discussed clause by clause. Comments were offered quite freely by nearly everyone present. The meeting started at 3:30 p.m. and we adjourned at 7:15 p.m. I would say that it was a good meeting. The Select Special Committee looks upon our proposal with favor but whether we can hope to get all we are asking for will depend upon the ultimate cost of implementing the same. We do not feel the government will establish a full reserve to take care of all future pensions but they will attempt to establish a partial reserve by some combination of funds. We hope this along with small confessions to meet all emergencies that may arise. I have doubts as to whether a new year will be as productive as last year as we had hoped for, but I do feel that we have gone a long way in selling the proposal to the Select Special Committee of the Legislature.\n\nYour Committee regrets that they did not have more time to publish our doings and pending matters generally to the Manitoba Teachers' Association as had been done in the past but various members of our Committee did attempt to meet all demands on their time to discuss at conventions, local meetings, and wherever called upon, the many problems your Committee had to face. We endeavoured to answer all correspondence pertaining to pension matters as expeditiously as possible.\n\nI want to thank the various District Presidents and Secretaries, the Presidents and Secretaries of Locals for their whole-hearted cooperation in seeking the support of the various M.L.A.'s to see that legislation was enacted this year, certainly more effective and I believe that the Manitoba Government realizes today as never before the strength of The Manitoba Teachers' Society and all this because of the preliminary skirmish which was inaugurated by you, the District Presidents.\n\nI want to thank all members of my Committee who laboured with me in this endeavor, with utter disregard of dinner hours\u2014our meetings usually started at 4:30 p.m. and lasted through to 6:45, 7:15 or in some cases 9:00 p.m.\u2014for their endurance of our often rambling and sometimes irrelevant discussions and for their helpful suggestions and faithful attendance at meetings. I wish particularly to thank the Winnipeg members of our Committee in the persons of Miss Miller; our President, Mr. Baragar, and Vice-President, Miss Kinney, also Mr. Rowe and Mr. Hamilton for their letters and helpful comments so frequently received.\n\nI would like also to pay tribute to the untiring efforts of our General Secretary, Mr. McMaster, Miss Payne, Mrs. Rosebush and Mr. Marshall for their help in a very trying year.\n\nRespectfully submitted on behalf of the Pensions Committee,\n\nHarold Murphy,\nConvener.\nSchools, Normal School Instructors, Officials of the Department of Education, etc., Teachers who were so employed and now are retired under the Manitoba Civil Service Superannuation Act without credit for such teaching service.\n\n(b) Teachers who were, are, or who become employees of the Manitoba Teachers' Society.\n\n(c) Teachers who were, are, or who become employees of the Winnipeg Public Schools' Board. Teachers who are now retired from the Winnipeg staff under the Winnipeg Teachers' Retirement Fund, the Winnipeg Teachers' Pension Fund or retired without benefit of any pension.\n\n(While seeking service pensions for these teachers only for their period of teaching in provincial schools outside Winnipeg we are not without prejudice to possible future negotiations for recognition of their period of teaching service in Winnipeg.)\n\nVII. Only persons who have a possibility of participating in the benefits of the scheme should be competent to commence to file claims.\n\nIn order to qualify for a superannuation allowance whether on the ground of age, service, or disability, the applicant must have taught 15 years in Manitoba immediately prior to the date of application for the superannuation allowance and 15 years in all in the Province of Manitoba.\n\nVIII. A person who leaves teaching and without good connections but who returns to the profession may reinstate himself in the fund and receive credit for previous service by way back pay together with compound interest, at a rate to be set, but not to exceed 4%.\n\nIX. The present pensioners should receive pensions on the basis of this new act. Their service pension would be calculated as at their retirement age and in no case would their pension be less than the proposed disability pension.\n\nX. War Service.\n\n(a) Service in the forces of His Majesty or any of His Majesty's Allies or any of His or their naval services during the Great War of 1914-1918 by a person of either sex, where enlistment took place from the teaching profession from the normal schools or from the recognized universities in the British Commonwealth, or where the person so enlisting returned to the teaching profession in Manitoba prior to the first day of July, 1920, shall be reckoned as teaching service for all purposes under the act.\n\n(b) Service by a teacher of either sex during the years 1939-1945 as a member of the forces of His Majesty or any of His Majesty's Allies or any of His or their auxiliary services shall be reckoned as teaching service provided that enlistment took place from the schools, normal school or the Universities of Manitoba and provided that such teacher resumes employment as a teacher within two years subsequent to discharge.\n\n(c) Service by reason of mobilization for war disability or at the termination of additional training or service for a year as vocational instructor at a recognized D.V.A. School and provided that all contributions to the fund for the year in question on the basis of the last salary received as a teacher prior to enlistment are paid into the fund for each later than June 30th, 1950 (in the case of enlistment from a Normal School, the average salary paid during the year of enlistment shall be considered to be the salary received).\n\nIn this outline we have not set forth how the final settlement is to be made. Nevertheless we do still of the opinion expressed in our original brief of October 30th, 1946, that the safest, surest, and cheap-\nGive him a bat he can swing\n\nHe's still small fry, but no better, too, with a reference work specifically designed for him\u2014 Britannica Junior.\n\nBritannica Junior's vocabulary is carefully planned so that it can be understood by students at the elementary school level.

McManus, General Secretary\n\nI wish first of all to thank the members of the Committee for their co-operation, particularly Miss Shack who carried a large share of the burden. Miss Kinney, due to pressure of other work in connection with the Society, found it impossible to attend meetings of the Research Committee as she wished.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Committee held four meetings during the year.\n\nThe work undertaken was a survey of conditions in the rural areas. Sixteen hundred questionnaires were sent out and six hundred and forty answers were received.\n\nThe survey had a two-fold objective:\n\n(1) To provide a source of information about rural schools that would be useful to teachers applying for positions.\n\n(2) To provide as complete a picture as possible of the educational situation in rural areas.\n\nIn the first part of this report your Committee has attempted to present an overall picture of conditions. The second part of the report gives tables and statistics supporting the impressions and conclusions drawn in part I.\n\nAll thinking people today, who are conversant with world events, realize that the development of an educated, thinking body of citizens is imperative if a world catastrophe is to be avoided. Many prominent writers whose conclusions cannot be ignored state that the world situation points to a race between education and catastrophe, and some think that even now it is too late.\n\nIn the face of these facts, what is the educational situation in Manitoba?\n\nIMPRESSIONS DERIVED FROM READING 640 QUESTIONNAIRES\n\nEducation in rural Manitoba is at a low ebb. A large percentage of the teachers lack the necessary academic qualifications, experience and maturity to impinge successfully upon the children's knowledge, with still less possibility of producing a thinking body of students.\n\nClassroom equipment and sports equipment are inadequate in a majority of schools.\n\nHealth and sanitary conditions are very unsatisfactory.\n\nSchools employing permit teachers are on the whole more poorly equipped, have a greater teacher turn-over and less district cooperation than schools employing qualified teachers.\n\nThese impressions are supported by the following outstanding facts:\n\n(1) 262 teachers out of 640 are teaching on permits (approx. 45%).\n\nTable I\n\n(2) 222 schools out of 595 who answered this question reported 5 to 11 teachers employed in the last 5 years. The average number of teachers employed for the 595 schools is 4 in 5 years. Table II.\n\n(3) 303 teachers out of 640 (47%) have less than one year of experience. Most of these in fact have not yet completed their first year. Table III.\n\n(4) Only 177 of the 348 qualified teachers are attempting to improve their qualifications.\n\n(5) The questionnaires were poorly answered. A great deal of inaccurate spelling and bad sentence structure indicates poor scholarship. Answers to question 12 indicated in many instances a lack\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nOn October 27th, 1945, you wrote us, in answer to our inquiries about the position of teachers in Indian Schools, in reference to superannuation.\n\nAt that time you said it appeared probable, but not definite, that these teachers would be included in the Dominion Civil Service Fund.\n\nSince that time, we have conducted a questionnaire to find how many of the teachers now in Ontario schools have had any experience in Indian schools, and the number is quite extensive.\n\nProfessor Sheppard will bring in a report, at the October meeting of the Commission, on this questionnaire, and I was instructed to inquire from you, in the meanwhile, the present position of the Indian school teachers, as to the Civil Service Fund.\n\nAny information you may be able to give will be thankfully received.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary, Superannuation Commission.\n\nMr. R.

This matter has been thoroughly discussed by our Superintendent of Education with Mr. Simonsley of your own staff, with Mr. Gallock, Superintendent of Superannuation, Department of Finance, and with officials of the Treasury Board. The teachers of our schools were circularized and requested to indicate their willingness to contribute under the Civil Service Superannuation Act. The attached list contains the names of those who wish to be classified as permanent Civil Servants for the purposes of the Civil Service Superannuation Act.\n\nI feel certain that you realize the importance of this move. These teachers have no security whatsoever while they are employed in our schools whereas all nine provinces now have teachers' superannuation plans. I feel that these teachers, who live on isolated Indian reserves, far from electricity, running water and any other conveniences, are certainly as entitled to superannuation as are the clerks and stenographers employed in the Civil Service in the city of Ottawa. If we are to attract and hold a better class of teachers for our Indian schools, then it is most essential that we offer them the protection of a superannuation plan.\n\nYou will note from the attached list that many of these teachers who are applying have long and faithful records of service.

This Act may be cited as \"The Teachers' Retirement Fund Act.\"\n\n[1939, c. 21, s. 1.]\n\nInterpretation.\n\n2. In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires\u2014\n\n(a) \"Board of Administrators\" or \"the Board\" means the Board of Administrators appointed and constituted under the provisions of this Act;\n\n(b) \"Fund\" means the Teachers' Retirement Fund established under the provisions of this Act;\n\n(c) \"Teacher\" means any person holding a valid certificate of qualification issued under the regulations of the Ministry of Education of the Province of Alberta, who is employed\u2014\n\n(i) by the board of trustees of a school district or a school division formed and constituted under The School Act, in the capacity of teacher in a school;\n\n(ii) by the Lloydminster Public School District or the Lloydminster High School District in the capacity of teacher in a school;\n\n(iii) by a superintendent, supervisor, principal or other such official of a school district or a school division formed and constituted under The School Act;\n\n(iv) by the Alberta Teachers' Association.\n\n[1939, c. 21, s. 2; 1942, c. 44, s. 2.]\n\nApplication of the Act.\n\n3. This Act shall apply to all teachers actually employed in teaching in those school districts or school divisions receiving grants from the Province of Alberta and to any teacher acting as a full-time employee of the Alberta Teachers' Association.\n\n[1939, c. 21, s. 3.]\nThe Fund.\n\n4.\u2014(1) The Department of Education is hereby authorized and empowered to establish a teachers' retirement fund to be derived from\u2014\n\n(a) gifts and legacies;\n(b) amounts contributed by or on behalf of teachers as hereinafter provided;\n(c) interest or other income derived from the fund;\n(d) contributions from boards of trustees as hereinafter provided.\n\n(2) A separate record of the payments into the fund made in respect to each teacher shall be kept by the Board of Administrators of the Fund.\n\n[1939, c. 21, s. 4; 1941, c. 38, s. 2.]\n\n5.\u2014(1) Every teacher shall contribute to the Fund an amount equal to three per cent of his salary as a teacher earned by him at any time in the manner herein provided:\n\n(a) The board of trustees of each and every school district or school division in the province of Alberta and of the Lloydminster Public School District and the Lloydminster High School District is hereby empowered to retain and shall retain from the salary of each and every teacher the percentage which such teacher is required to contribute to the Fund in accordance with this section, which percentage shall be deducted from each payment on account of salary made to the teacher, and all moneys so retained shall be deemed to have been paid out of the salary and shall be deemed to be a contribution to the Fund by the teacher from whom the percentage of salary has been retained:\n\nProvided, however, that the Minister of Education may authorize in writing any board of trustees to pay the moneys so retained to the Board of Administrators and it shall then be the duty of the board of trustees to pay the moneys to the Board of Administrators at such times as the Board of Administrators may direct written approval but not oftener than once in each month and in any such case the provisions of paragraph (b) of this subsection shall apply only with respect to any amounts which have been retained by a board of trustees and not paid over to the Board of Administrators;\n\n(b) The Department of Education is hereby empowered to retain and shall retain, semi-annually at the end of each school term, from the grant payable to each and every school district or school division under The School Grants Act in aid of schools.\norganized and conducted under the provisions of The School Act, and from the grants available to the Lloydminster Public School District and the Lloydminster High School District an amount equal to the amount so required to be retained by the board of trustees from the salaries of all teachers of each school district or school division during each term, and to receive such payments to the Board for the purposes of the Fund the moneys so retained or received, and all moneys so retained and paid over shall be deemed to have been paid over to and received by the board of trustees on account of the legislative grant to the school district or school division for that term.\n\n(c) A substitute or temporary teacher as defined in The School Act shall not be required to contribute to the Fund as hereinafore provided except when employed for a total of ten days or more in any month.\n\n(2) During the first five years of any teacher's participation under the provisions of this Act, one-sixth of his contributions shall not be placed to the credit of the teacher in his account in the Fund but shall be placed in a reserve account to be disbursed as the Board of Administrators by by-law may decide, for the purpose of providing benefits for retiring teachers whose contributions under this Act have not built up an adequate retirement benefit.\n\n(3) Any teacher who leaves his employment as teacher for such reason as may in the sole discretion of the Board entitle him to continue his contributions, may apply to the Board for permission to continue the same during his absence from his employment and the Board may, for such length of time and on such terms and conditions as they by by-law prescribe, accept contributions by or on behalf of the teacher not exceeding in any year three per cent of the annual salary earned by him immediately prior to leaving his employment.\n\n[1939, c. 21, s. 5; 1941, c. 38, s. 3; 1942, c. 44, s. 3.]\n\n6. For the purpose of assisting the Department in determining the amount which should be retained and paid over, the board of trustees of each school district or school division shall, semi-annually, with the returns for the school term which the board of trustees is by law required to furnish to the Department, furnish the Department with a complete and accurate record, certified to be such by the secretary-treasurer or other proper officer of the school district or school division, showing the name of each teacher employed by the board of trustees in that term, the amount of salary paid to each teacher together with such further information respecting any such salary as shall be required by the Department. [1939, c. 21, s. 6.]\n7.\u2014(1) The board of trustees of every city, town, village and consolidated school district (not being within a division), and of the Lloydminster Public School District and the Lloydminster High School District, shall pay into the Fund at the end of each month an amount equal to one-half of one per cent of the total amount of salary earned in that month by each of its teachers required to contribute to the Fund.\n\n(2) In the event of the failure of any such board of trustees to pay any such amount as aforesaid, the Department of Education may retain semi-annually at the end of each school term from the grants payable to each such school district under The School Grants Act in aid of schools organized and conducted under the provisions of The School Act, and pursuant to The Border Areas Act or The Lloydminster Municipal Amalgamation Act, an amount equal to the amount which such board of trustees is then in default, and shall pay over to the Board for the purposes of the Fund all moneys so retained, and all moneys so retained and paid over shall be deemed to have been paid over to and received by such board of trustees on account of the Legislative grant to the school district for that term.\n\n(3) Every such board of trustees shall make due provision for the payment required by it to be paid and shall make no deduction whatsoever from the salary of any of its teachers by reason of any such payment.\n\n(4) The Board shall credit all sums received by it, pursuant to the provisions of this section, to the reserve account mentioned in subsection (2) of section 5.\n\n[1941, c. 38, s. 4; 1942, c. 44, s. 4.]\n\nBoard of Administrators.\n\n8.\u2014(1) There shall be a Board of Administrators consisting of four members, of whom three shall form a quorum for the transaction of business, who shall manage, control and administer the said Fund and shall be a body politic and corporate with all the powers and immunities provided by law for such bodies.\n\n(2) Two of the members of the Board shall be appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council in such manner and for such term or terms and at such times as he may determine.\n\n(3) The two other members of the Board shall be teachers and shall be appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, one of whom shall serve until the thirtieth day of June, 1943, and the other of whom shall serve until the thirtieth day of June, 1945, and their successors from time to time appointed shall serve for a term of four years each from the dates at which their respective appointments take effect. The two members so appointed under this sub-\nsection shall be nominated by the Executive Council of the Alberta Teachers' Association at least one month before the date on which they shall enter upon their duties as members of the Board of Administrators.\n\n(4) If any member of the Board shall vacate his office or should the office for any reason become vacant, the Lieutenant Governor in Council shall appoint a successor to serve for the unexpired term. [1939, c. 21, s. 7.]\n\nPowers of the Board.\n\n9.\u2014(1) The Board of Administrators is hereby empowered\u2014\n\n(a) to manage, control, invest and administer the Fund and its distribution and to act as and be the trustees thereof;\n\n(b) to receive moneys therefor whether by way of contribution, gift, grant, legacy or otherwise;\n\n(c) to appoint, employ, remove and discharge such officers or employees as it may deem necessary for the exercise of its powers;\n\n(d) to determine who shall be entitled to participate in the Fund and the amount each participant shall receive, and the manner and times of such receiving;\n\n(e) to refund and pay to any teacher who has contributed to the Fund, or to his estate, widow, or widower, or to his next-of-kin who are members of his immediate family, such sum or sums as it may determine, or may decline to so refund any moneys contributed by any teacher, or to require payment out of all moneys belonging to the Fund;\n\n(f) to enter into any engagement or agreement from time to time to bring about or to facilitate the transferring of any benefit to which any teacher is or may be entitled in this Fund to any other similar Fund and the transferring to this Fund of the benefits to which any person may be similarly entitled in any other similar Fund; and\n\n(g) to do all acts and make all such provisions and regulations as shall appear proper and necessary touching the proper ordering of all the affairs and business of the Fund, and for making any or any of them from time to time to pass by-laws and to amend, repeal, add to or re-enact all or any of such by-laws, and such by-laws as long as they shall be in force shall have the same force and effect as if part of the Act and be binding upon all persons to whom they apply:\n\nProvided always that all moneys to be invested by the Board hereunder shall be invested in such bonds, debentures\nor other securities as trustees are authorized by law to invest money in.\n\n(2) All such regulations so made, and all by-laws so enacted or passed, shall, however, before having any force or effect, be approved by the Lieutenant Governor in Council and be published once in The Alberta Gazette.\n\n(3) On or before the thirty-first day of December of each year the Board shall furnish to the Department of Education an audited statement showing the standing of the Fund as at the thirty-first day of August preceding and containing such other information as the Lieutenant Governor in Council may from time to time require.\n\n(4) Without limiting the powers of the Board as otherwise provided in this Act, the Board is hereby authorized to include in its by-laws provisions to the effect that a differentiation may be made in the amounts of the pensions, which shall be granted to teachers after the passing of this Act, according as their service is of a contributory or a non-contributory nature. [1939, c. 21, s. 8; 1942, c. 44, s. 5.]\n\nPenalty for non-compliance with provisions of Act\n\n10. Any person required by this Act, or by the regulations or by-laws hereunder, to furnish any information or make any return or statement in writing to the Department of Education or the Board of Administrators, or to perform any act or duty, who refuses or neglects to furnish such information or make such return or statement or perform such act or duty, shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding fifty dollars, which shall be remitted to the Board and credited to the reserve account mentioned in subsection (2) of section 5. [1940, c. 28, s. 3; 1942, c. 44, s. 6.]\n\nEvery person entitled to receive a pension and entitled to receive a sum out of moneys appropriated for the purpose by the Legislature\n\n11. Every person who under the regulations or by-laws of the Board is entitled to receive after the passing of this Act an amount as pension from the Fund, shall also be entitled to receive during such out of moneys appropriated by the Legislature for that purpose, and when calculating the amount to which such person is so entitled under the said regulations or by-laws, the Board shall also advance and pay such equal sums and the Provincial Treasurer shall at the end of each month pay over to the Board out of moneys so appropriated all sums which during such month shall have been so advanced and paid by the Board. [1939, c. 21, s. 9.]\n\nMembers of Board to serve without remuneration\n\n12. The members of the Board of Administrators shall serve without remuneration, but shall be entitled to receive, and shall be paid all necessary and actual expenses including travelling expenses incurred in and about the performance of their duties as such members. [1939, c. 21, s. 10.]\n\nCosts of administration payable out of Fund\n\n13. All costs and expenses incurred in carrying out the objects of this Act shall be borne and paid out of the Fund, provided, however, that the Department of Education shall\nprovide office space for the performance of all clerical duties necessary to carrying out the objects of the Act as well as for the storing of all documents, files, cards, etc., necessary for the carrying out of the objects of this Act.\n\n[1939, c. 21, s. 11.]\n\n14. Neither the right of any teacher to receive a payment out of the Fund nor any moneys payable to the teacher under this Act as advances by way of gratuity whether made in periodic payments or otherwise shall be capable of being assigned, charged or anticipated or given as security, nor shall the same be liable to be seized, attached or levied upon by or under the process of any court, and such right or moneys shall be exempt from execution of any law relating to bankruptcy or insolvency, and the Board may in its discretion refuse to recognize any power of attorney granted by a teacher with reference to any such payment.\n\n[1939, c. 21, s. 12.]\nOctober, December 9, 1947.\n\nSuperannuation for teachers of Indian Day Schools\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs requested by you, I present herewith the further details required so that you can proceed with the classification of certain Indian day school teachers as permanent civil servants. In your letter of November 20 you state that you are prepared to consider recommendations for the establishment of positions to permit permanent appointment in certain specific cases. These Indian day school teachers qualify under the conditions outlined in your letter:\n\n(1) They have all completed at least one year of service,\n\n(2) These permanent positions may be established within the maximum percentages of permanent employees laid down for this Department.\n\n(3) (a) Of the 22 teachers listed, the following were appointed prior to September 1, 1939:\n\nMiss Julia Jenkins,\nMiss Nora F. Jenkins,\nMrs. Agnes Lichter,\nMiss Anna H. Stoddart,\nMrs. Stella M. Kohne,\nMiss Helen Dolaney,\nMrs. Sylvia Candy,\nMrs. Leslie Glass,\nMiss Violet M. Daly,\nMr. Albert F. Smith,\nMr. Joseph G. Hill,\nMr. Vernon R. Harris.\n(b) Of the teachers listed, one employee is entitled to preference in respect of overseas service:\n\nMr. C. D. Street.\n\n(d) Due to the particular difficulties involved in hiring teachers, these positions do not come under the Civil Service Commission for appointment. However, we have advertised in newspapers across Canada but very few veterans have been interested in these positions.\n\n(e) Of the teachers listed, all hold teaching certificates granted by provincial Departments of Education across Canada. This means that they are all eligible for employment in various provincial schools. The various provincial Departments of Education have teachers' superannuation plans, and therefore all these teachers would be eligible for superannuation under these pension plans. The following teachers have been employed in provincial schools for the periods as shown hereunder:\n\nMiss Nora E. Jamieson 3 years\nMiss Nora H. Stockart 1 year\nMrs. Stella M. Knox 7\u00bd years\nMr. C. D. Street 5 \"\nMiss Ellen Delaney 1 year\nMrs. Sylvia Smith 1 \"\nMiss Viola M. Daly 5 years\nMr. Albert E. Smith 12 \"\nMr. Thomas H. Morris 3 \"\nMrs. Jane Murray 8 \"\nMiss Sarah Jane Morris 16 \"\nMrs. Flora Ross 6 \"\nMrs. Anna Robertson 4 \"\nMiss Laura K. Fleming 14 \"\nMiss Alice Frith 26 \"\nMiss R. B. Montgomery 11 \"\n\n..... Therefore -\nTherefore it can be seen from the above facts presented that these teachers qualify under clause 1, clause 2 and under the various categories of clause 3 as listed above.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\nR. B. Bryce, Esq.,\nFor Secretary,\nTreasury Board,\nDepartment of Finance,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, January 5, 1948.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have for answer your letter of December 29 and wish to advise you that we will forward your application for appointment as a permanent civil servant with the next group of applications.\n\nThe Treasury Board is at present considering the first group of applicants and we expect a decision within the near future.\n\nI note your comments concerning the prefabricated house and would like very much to have a report from you at the end of the winter as to its suitability for teachers' residences elsewhere.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend G. J. White,\nMontreal Lake, Sask.\nJanuary 14, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nFurther to our conversation of yesterday, please find attached a list of French speaking teachers who are employed in Indian day schools conducted in the French language.\n\nWe have omitted day schools located in the Province of Quebec which are conducted in the English language (e.g., on the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve and on the Oka Reserve). You will note that of the teachers listed all but two are members of religious orders. The two who are not, have only been teaching in our schools since the first of September and therefore do not qualify for permanency. In the June issue of our Teachers' Magazine we informed all our day school teachers of the proposal for making certain of them permanent Civil Servants. They were all told that they could make application for such classification, if they fell within certain regulations, insofar as qualifications, teaching experience, etc., were concerned and also within the regulations laid down in the Civil Service Superannuation Act.\n\nThe only applications which we received were for those teachers who are listed on the Order-in-Council about which you spoke to me.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F. Heery,\nDept. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEnc.\n\nH. V.

We have now just been informed that an Order-in-Council has been passed in which the first group of day school teachers have been granted permanency as civil servants within the meaning of the Civil Service Superannuation Act.\n\nIn advising teachers of our intentions to approach Treasury Board in this regard, we informed them of the following regulations:\n\n\"The classification of permanent civil servant for the purposes of superannuation will be applied only to certain of our teachers as detailed below:\n\n(a) Teachers who are in possession of permanent teaching certificates as granted by Provincial Departments of Education.\n\n(b) Teachers who have been employed for a period of at least two years as Indian Day School Teachers and upon whose work satisfactory School Inspectors' and Indian Agents' reports have been submitted.\n\n(c) Teachers who otherwise qualify within the regulations laid down in the Civil Service Superannuation Act.\n\n(d) Teachers of day schools in operation for a full academic year of ten months.\n\n\"Note: Married women to be eligible must provide proof of the fact that they are, or necessity, self-supporting.\"\nSome 22 teachers made application for inclusion, and all 22 have been made permanent civil servants, provided that they pass the necessary medical examination.\n\nI am also enclosing a copy of an abbreviated office form of Civil Service Superannuation Act, which I hope will provide other information for you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEmil.\n\nBernard F.

Barry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nFebruary 11, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Henry:\n\nI have for answer your letter of February 2, which was here when I returned from an inspection trip. I can answer two of the three points which you have raised:\n\n(a) Under the Dominion Government's Superannuation Act, civil servants are given the privilege of electing to contribute for previous years of service. They must make this decision within one year of being notified of their permanency. Our teachers would be in the same position, namely, they have a choice as to whether they contribute for past years of service, or not.\n\n(b) I am referring this point to the Superintendent of Superannuation for the Department of Finance and will write you further concerning it.\n\n(c) Only teachers of Indian day schools are classified as civil servants. Teachers at residential schools are employed by the denomination which operates the school for this Department. In other words, they are not paid directly by the Dominion Government but by the denomination which operates the school. Therefore, they do not contribute to the superannuation fund.\n\nThere has been some consideration given to having this condition changed but nothing definite has been decided as yet concerning teachers at residential schools. At the present time superannuation applies only to teachers of Indian day schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nS. H. Henry, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nSuperannuation Commission,\nParliament Buildings,\nToronto 2, Ontario.\nFebruary 17, 1948.\n\nSuperannuation for Indian Day School Teachers.\n\nDear Mr. Hazelton:\n\nWhile I was out of town on an inspection trip I had my secretary get these submissions, etc., off the file re teachers' superannuation.\n\nI hope they will be of help to you. Please phone me at 4465 if there is anything else I can let you have.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard J. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nB. T.

These new forms just reached me yesterday and I have prepared a draft form letter as attached, to send to the teachers concerned.\n\nI would appreciate the benefit of your experience in such matters in advising me as to the details contained in my letter. I discussed this matter with our Secretary, Mr. T.L. MacInnes, and he suggested that I seek your advice.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard P. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nH. Birnie, Esq.,\nSuperannuation Branch,\nDept. of Finance,\nNew Post Office Building,\nOttawa.\n\nEnclosure:\nBFN/HM.\nFebruary 3, 1948.\n\nDear Mrs. George:\n\nI have for answer your letter of January 20th addressed to Mr. Arnell. Mr. Arnell has now been moved to British Columbia where he will be the Indian Commissioner.\n\nThere are actually two separate plans under which we can offer some degree of superannuation. In order to become eligible for superannuation you have to qualify under the clauses as outlined in article No. 55 of the June issue of the Bulletin. In view of the fact that you do not possess a teacher's certificate, this would be very difficult. However, I would suggest that you discuss with your School Inspector the possibility of getting a Provincial Teacher's Certificate in view of your long years of experience. Following your interview with the inspector I will be pleased to hear from you again.\n\nIf it is found impossible for you to qualify for superannuation as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, it might be possible on your retirement, to allow you a gratuity of sixty days pay at the rate you were being paid at the time you leave our service. This latter method is somewhat involved and requires an order in council before payment can be made.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMrs. E.E.

It will, of course, be necessary to present the required evidence of age, health, character and habits to the Chief of the Superannuation and Retirement Fund Branch of the Department of Finance before such appointment is finalized.\n\nYou will find attached the following documents:\n\n(a) Two copies of Physical Examination Record (N.H. & W.

Form 502). It is suggested that you have this form completed by either your own personal doctor or by a doctor of the Indian Health Services of the Department of National Health and Welfare. This form, when completed, should then be sent to:\n\nCivil Service Health Division,\nDepartment of National Health and Welfare,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nPlease note that any expense attendant upon this examination will be borne by you.\nAction to Contribute for Past Service.\n\nWhen a Civil Servant has served in a temporary capacity, prior to being a contributor to the Civil Service Superannuation Act, he may, within twelve months of the date of his permanent appointment, elect to contribute five percent of the total salary received by him during such period of service with simple interest thereon at the rate of four percent per annum.

By reference to section II para 2 of the Civil Service Superannuation Act pamphlet (PA 74) attached, you can determine the rate of contribution in your instance.\n\nOur records show that you have been an Indian Day School Teacher for a period of approximately twenty-one years. Therefore, it will be necessary for you to pay contributions, if you so elect to the fund in either one lump sum or in installments. You will find a table of installments on page 2 of the election form (Fin No. 64).\n\nIf you desire to have this temporary service count for Superannuation purposes, kindly complete the enclosed forms (Fin No. 64) and return them in duplicate to this office. I may point out that by Section 7 A (1) of the Act, only service which is fully paid for shall be counted.\n\nWar Service:\n\nA memorandum is attached for the information of contributors who may be eligible to count their War Service for purposes of the Civil Service Superannuation Act.\nPensionable Employment:\n\nIf you have had service with the Dominion Government prior to your present appointment, you should immediately furnish this office with full particulars regarding the nature of such service and the salary received.\n\nIf you have had other pensionable employment (e.g., as a provincial teacher) you will find details as to conditions, procedure, etc., outlined in the memorandum attached, dealing with \"Pensionable Employment\" (6/1947).\n\nYour attention is directed to para 2 under \"Conditions\" in this memorandum in which you will note that your contribution \"for such employment shall be twice the amount that he would have contributed etc.,\".\n\nUnder para 2 of \"Exceptions\", you are not entitled to count provincial service for Dominion superannuation services, when you are already receiving or have received a provincial superannuation benefit.\n\nDeductions:\n\nI may add that from December 27, 1947, a percent (as determined by the Civil Service Superannuation Act - Form 74 A) will be deducted from your salary on account of the superannuation fund. Whether or not you decide to contribute for past service, I would appreciate being informed at the earliest possible date of your decision.\n\nI would finally remind you that you are given twelve months to make the election described above and that this offer expires on December 27, 1948. Therefore, it is most important that you inform the Department of your decision whether to allow for past service or not.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. C.D. Street,\nBerens River U.C.

In the past, these teachers were classified only as temporary civil servants and were not placed on a regular graded salary schedule.\n\nOn 1 September, 1947, there went into effect an \"Indian Day School Teachers' Salary Schedule\" which provided for grades of day school teachers, welfare teachers and principals. This schedule provides for regular annual salary increases, based upon qualification and satisfactory teaching experience. This schedule has done much to retain in our service the type of teacher who can render a great contribution to Indian education.\n\nThe introduction of a separate class of teachers now termed \"welfare teachers\" is a progressive advancement which, we hope, will do much to improve living conditions on certain isolated reservations. This category of teacher is paid on a twelve month basis and in addition to normal teaching duties carries out other activities such as the formation of homemakers' clubs, the sponsoring of community recreation, the encouragement of home gardens and home improvement clubs, the improvement of living conditions and co-operates with Indian agents and nurses in matters of family allowances, drug dispensing, etc.\n\nEarly in January or this year an Order-in-Council was passed making eligible the first group of Indian day school teachers for appointment to permanent positions in the Indian Affairs Branch for the purposes of the Civil Service Superannuation Act. This means that for the first time teachers who meet the requirements are eligible for superannuation privileges such as are enjoyed by other permanent civil servants. We feel confident that this step will do a great deal towards the provision of a more permanent group of teachers in these schools and will reduce the large turn over in staff that has previously occurred every summer.\n\nIn addition to the above two improvements in status, we have also endeavoured to provide a better type of living accommodation at our day schools. The new standard type of day school now being constructed provides for a comfortable teachers'age in the same building. We feel that in these isolated points, a sound and well furnished teachers'age will help to attract a more satisfactory type of teacher. We are also carrying out improvements in many of the present teachers'ages.\n\nTo summarize, then, the achievements of the past year with regard to improved conditions for our day school teachers are three-fold:\n\n1. the introduction of a salary schedule with regular increments as described above,\n\n2. the first group of such teachers has been made eligible for privileges under the Civil Service Superannuation Act,\n\n3. the provision of a better class of living accommodation for teachers.\nOttawa, March 1, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER,\n\nMiss Nora H. Stoddart,\nTyendinaga Eastern Indian Day School\nNo. 441.\n\nThe letter hereunder has been received from the above teacher with regard to the payment of back contributions to the Superannuation fund.

The Election Forms and the cheque are being forwarded by this office to the Department of Finance and when they are received there you will be officially informed in that respect.\n\nIn regard to your past service, the Civil Service Commission has taken the stand that service is to be calculated, based on actual teaching months, which means that since you have taught for 253 months in the period from March 1, 1922 to October 31, 1947, your credit for Superannuation purposes will be twenty years and three months. Being paid by the quarter in the past, does not indicate that you were paid for the time when no teaching was done.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Nora E. Stoddart,\nTyendinaga Eastern Indian Day School,\nDeseronto, Ontario.\n\nBFM/HM.\nOttawa, April 5, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Morris:\n\nThis is to acknowledge your letter of March 19. The Departmental records show that your arrears to Superannuation would be $553.77 giving you a credit of seven years and five months and twenty-two days towards your service for Superannuation purposes. From your letter of March 19th, it appears that you are not interested in paying the arrears for your service in the Airforce, although you can if you choose.\n\nThe arrears for $553.77 do not have to be made in a lump sum, but can be made in monthly payments as the chart will show you.\n\nIf you are interested in paying the arrears, fill out the front part of Form No. 64, enclosed and forward two copies to the Superannuation Branch, Department of Finance, Ottawa. You retain the third copy. Please note that these figures are subject to revision by the Department of Finance.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. Harold V.

It is not necessary for you to pay these arrears in a lump sum; you can pay it through a period of time, in payments as indicated on the chart. Since the chart on the Form No. 64 goes up to fifty years, I am sending you an extension to it.\n\nIf you are interested in paying the arrears on your Superannuation, kindly fill out the front part of the three copies of Form No. 64 and forward two copies to the Superannuation Branch, Department of Finance, Ottawa; you retain the third copy.

MacNeill - Robert I. D. S.\n\nYour letter of 30th March received, dealing with a permanent teacher's status in the Branch for the above teacher.\n\nMrs. MacNeill has been teaching in this Agency less than one full teaching year, and we are actually thus not in the best position to assess her capabilities. We have sought advice from School Inspector Greening, but he has not paid an official visit to the school this year, but anticipates doing so within a month's time.\n\nReports from the parents of those in attendance regarding Mrs. MacNeill's teaching ability tend to be conflicting - pro and con. I do feel that her services are of value to the Branch, that she is a hard worker, conscientious and devoted to her duties. She is inclined to be nervous and high strung by temperament and by standards of comparison with urban teachers, she is shaded, but undoubtedly conforms to an average insofar as our Branch is concerned.\n\nAll things considered, I feel that Mrs. MacNeill is deserving of permanent status. If Mr. Burk does not concur, he can write to that effect upon his return, for I shall draw this matter to his attention.\n\nN. V. Peltier\nPort Arthur Indian Agency.\n\nP.S.

I brought to his attention the fact that she was made permanent by an Order-in-Council as from November 1, 1947.\n\nMr. Cullock's reply was that since she is a seasonal employee, she comes under the Superannuation Act only when the Superannuation Branch receives her Schedule I, Medical, and Birth Certificate.\n\nThis is passed on for your information.\n\nMichael P. Track\n\nM.F.T. Track.\nDr. H.L. Keenleyside,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Keenleyside:\n\nI have had a request from one of my constituents, who happen to be the principal of an Indian residential school, asking for clarification of the statement you made before the Indian Act Committee in reply to a question by myself in regard to status of Indian residential school teachers. If you will look up pages 42 and 43 of the Second Report of the Committee, you will note that Statement \"teachers in the residential schools but not the rest of the staff\" are under the Civil Service now and as such would be eligible for annual increases and superannuation. As I believe this is not strictly in accordance with the facts at the present time, perhaps it would be wise to have this statement corrected, as the school teachers at the Indian residential schools might take the wrong impression from your statement.\n\nI would appreciate receiving your comments in regard to this matter.\n\nThanking you, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) J.L. Gibson,\nJ.L. Gibson\nM.P. for Comox-Albernia.\nApril 17, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOYT\n\nYou will recall that I discussed Dr. Keenleyside's statement to the Parliamentary Committee with you previously. At that time I mentioned that he was \"off the track\" on two of the points. This is one of them. It would seem that he will have to also write to the Parliamentary Committee and advise them of the mistakes which he made in his evidence. I presume that we will receive other letters concerning his mentioning of the payment of superannuation to residential school teachers.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMemorandum:\n\nYou will recall that I discussed Dr. Keenleyside's statement to the Parliamentary Committee with you previously.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOttawa, April 17, 1948.\n\nJ. L. Gibson, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Gibson:\n\nI regret very much the misunderstanding which I have caused with regard to the payment of superannuation to teachers in Indian residential schools.\n\nIt is only the teachers of Indian day schools who are entitled to superannuation privileges, as the teachers in Indian residential schools are not paid directly by the Department but by the denomination concerned, and it is not possible to extend superannuation privileges to them.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDeputy Minister.\nOttawa, April 19, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Gibson:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of April 13th, in which you quote a statement relating to the status of teachers employed in Indian residential schools made by me before the Special Parliamentary Committee.\n\nAll teachers employed at Indian day schools who are fully qualified academically and professionally and who have had the necessary years of service contribute to the superannuation fund and qualify for superannuation allowances. In such cases, the residential school teachers are not employed by this department, but by the churches; these teachers don't contribute nor do they qualify for superannuation allowances. It is my intention to have the Director of Indian Affairs explain this matter to the members of the Committee at the earliest opportunity.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\nJ. L.

Gillock\nChief, Superannuation Br.\nApril 26, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Street:\n\nThis is in connection with your letter of March 10th regarding the payment of the arrears for Superannuation purposes. There are so many points I want to bring to your attention that I will take them up one at a time.\n\nFirst, although your Form No. 64 is quite complete our records show that your estimated arrears are quite higher than you have, also we have more of the details, therefore, I am returning you your copies and am asking you to complete the front part of our three copies and forward two to this office. You keep the third. I wish to point out that the figures are, but an estimate and may be revised by the Department of Finance. Paying for these arrears will give you a credit of eighteen and one half years.\n\nSecond, your election to contribute for Active Service is quite in order and I shall keep the form on file until I get Form 64 from you and will forward the two with the copy of the Military Discharge Certificate to the Department of Finance. However, I will point out that you will not get credit for service during the World War II.\n\nThird, the Department has ruled that your service in Provincial Schools cannot be counted towards Superannuation purposes. The regulation reads that an employee must have been employed in a \"Pensionable Employment\", which is employment where there was an established Superannuation fund or plan. Such a plan was\nadopted in Manitoba in the Fall of 1925, while you were employed in Provincial Schools prior to that.\n\nFourth, it is noted that you have not forwarded your Birth Certificate. It will be necessary for you to send it in, as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. C.D. Street,\nBerens River U.C.

Assume the amount to be paid in one instalment is $1,357.41; that the age of the civil servant is 50 years; and that he has been employed continuously opposite No. 50 and in the Option column will be found the monthly contribution per $1,000 to be contributed, namely, $10.87. The monthly contributions for $1,357.41 would be $1,357.41 x $10.87 = $14,800 = $153.87.

Gov't,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWould it be possible for you to send me a copy of the Regulations affecting the superannuation of teachers in Indian schools at the present time? We (teachers working on superannuation problems) were ever so pleased to learn that the problem of super. of teachers in Indian schools has been largely solved. Now we are working on how & justly treat these teachers should they return to our state schools in Wales.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJean Beach\nMay 5, 1948.\n\nDear Miss Beach:\n\nI have for answer your letter of May 3, 1948. Our Indian day school teachers are now eligible to make application for superannuation privileges under the Dominion Government Civil Service Superannuation Act. I am attaching an office copy of this Act, which as you know applies to permanent Civil Servants of the Dominion Government.\n\nOur requirements before presenting a teacher's case to Treasury Board for the necessary Order-in-Council are as follows:\n\n\"The classification of permanent civil servant for the purposes of superannuation will be applied only to certain of our teachers as detailed below:\n\n(a) Teachers who are in possession of permanent teaching certificates as granted by Provincial Departments of Education.\n\n(b) Teachers who have been employed for a period of at least two years as Indian Day School Teachers and upon whose work satisfactory School Inspectors' and Indian Agents' reports have been submitted.\n\n(c) Teachers who otherwise qualify within the regulations laid down in the Civil Service Superannuation Act.\n\n(d) Teachers of day schools in operation for a full academic year of ten months.\n\nNote: Married women to be eligible must provide proof of the fact that they are, of necessity, self-supporting.\"\n\n..... As\nAs teachers at Indian Residential Schools are employed by the denominations operating those schools and not by this Department, the Civil Service Superannuation privileges do not extend to them.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEnc.\n\nMiss H.

Our calculations show that Miss Jamieson will have in arrears approximately $2700, if she chooses to pay for past service.\n\nI have just returned from an inspection trip of the Six Nations Schools. Miss Jamieson there raised the question with me of eligibility for payment under Section 6(1) (K) of the Civil Service Superannuation Act. She wanted to know whether the one to receive the allowance must be a dependent. Apparently she feels that the payment of this large sum in arrears is a rather big risk at her age. She also asked as to whether a will must be made before death to govern such allowance.\n\nI would be glad to have an opportunity of having one of our Education Officials discuss this point with one of your Officials. If this is possible, I would ask you to please contact Mr. Track at Local 2310.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. G.L.

You will notice that all the arrears have been accounted for and the Retirement Fund has been deducted. All you will have to do is to fill the front part of the three forms and forward two copies to \"Superannuation Branch, Department of Finance, Ottawa\". You may retain the third copy.

The superannuation committee will not give me my superannuation as the years I spent in Indian Schools is not allowed. So I was wondering if the Federal Government would help me get my superannuation by giving some assistance. Please write me and let me know thanking you.\n\nSincerely,\n(Miss) Cassie Troy\nMount Forest, Ont., R. 3.\nOctober 14, 1948.\n\nDear Miss Troy:\n\nYour letter of October 6th has been received and the contents of it carefully noted.\n\nAs you are not employed by the Department at present, your case for Superannuation cannot be considered. The Superannuation act for teachers in our Indian Day Schools became effective only last year, therefore, any teachers teaching at that time or subsequent to that time may come under the Act and draw benefits thereto.\n\nHoping that this is the information you require,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard E. Henry,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Cassie Troy,\nP.O. #3,\nForest, Ontario.\n\nMPT/HH.\nSUPERANNUATION PLAN\n\n1. It is anticipated that the amendment of the Civil Service Superannuation Act just completed by Parliament will make it possible for the employees of the Defence Research Board to participate in the scheme. Some time must elapse before all the administrative problems connected with employees of the Board becoming contributors be ironed out. In the meantime, however, the following outline of the provisions of the Act has been prepared for your information. It should be clearly understood that this summary has NO OFFICIAL STANDING and covers only those details of the scheme which are deemed to be of general interest.\n\nA. ELIGIBILITY\n\n2. All employees who meet the following qualifications are eligible to become contributors:\n\n(a) Measure up to the physical requirements prescribed in the Civil Service Act.\n\n(b)(i) Are in receipt of a stated annual salary and are designated by the Treasury Board as permanent employees, or\n\n(ii) Are employed for a fixed term of years (probably 3) and are designated by the Treasury Board as eligible under the Superannuation Act.\n\n3. Before an employee can be designated as permanent he must have served in a temporary capacity for at least one year and the position he is filling must be certified as one of continuous indeterminate duration. Part-time employees are NOT eligible.\n\nB. CONTRIBUTIONS\n\n4. Male\n\nSalary $1200 per annum or less - 5%\nSalary over $1200 but less than $1500 - 6%\nbut not in excess of an amount which reduces the remaining salary to a rate per annum of less than $1,147.50.\n\nSalary $1500 per annum or more - 6%\nbut not in excess of an amount which reduces the remaining salary to a rate per annum of less than $1,417.50.\n\n5. Female\n\n5% for a period not exceeding 35 years.\n\nNo one pays for more than 35 years.\n6. Any employee may elect to contribute in respect of prior service in the Civil Service. The contribution required for this prior service is in accordance with the provisions of Section B above with simple interest at 4%. Such payment can be made as a lump sum or by instalments with interest charged as required by the Treasury Board. This means that if you worked for 3 years as a temporary before becoming a contributor to the Superannuation Fund and your salary was $2000 per year, you would owe the Fund:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{100} \\times \\$2000 = \\$120.00 \\times 3 = \\$360\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{100} \\times \\$120 = \\frac{4.80}{\\$120} \\times (3 + 2 + 1) = \\frac{28.80}{\\$72}\n\\]\n\nTo this amount would be applied the amount of your credit in the Retirement Fund. You would then be required to make up the balance either in one payment or in instalments with interest.\n\n7. Contributors who resigned from the Civil Service to join the Armed Forces during the War and received a withdrawal allowance at that time may be reinstated as contributors for that period of their service by repaying the allowance plus 4% simple interest.\n\n8. A contributor who enters the service of the Board from an employment in which he was subject to a pension plan may count his period of employment therein as service under the Superannuation Act if his separation from such employment involves the loss of pension benefits under the said plan. He shall be required to contribute for such service twice the amount specified in paragraph 6 above.\n\n9. A contributor who served on active service overseas in the forces during World War I or World War II, and was not immediately prior to enlistment, an employee in the Civil Service, may count his active service under the Superannuation Act provided he contributes for the period involved twice the amount prescribed in paragraph 6 above. For this purpose his salary shall be deemed to be that payable to him immediately after he is employed by the Board.\n\nD. BENEFITS\n\n10. The term \"Retirement Age\" means sixty years of age, at which time the contributor may retire voluntarily. The compulsory age of retirement is 65.\n\n11. A contributor who has served 10 years or more (including temporary service, provided back payments have been made in accordance with paragraph 6 above) and has reached the retirement age or become incapacitated before reaching the retiring age or who became a contributor before 15 August, 1944, and is retired...\nbefore reaching the retirement age by reason of abolition of his position, may be paid an annual allowance equal to his average salary during the last 10 years of his service multiplied by one fifth for each year of service, not exceeding 35. Thus, if your average salary during your last 10 years of service was $2500, and you had the maximum number of 35 years, your allowance would be\n\n\\[ \\frac{35}{50} \\times \\$2500 = \\$1750. \\]\n\n12. A person who has served ten years or more but did not become a contributor until 16th August, 1946, or thereafter, if he is retired before reaching retirement age by reason of abolition of his position may receive an annual retiring allowance equal, until he reaches the age of 65, to 2/3 of the retiring allowance, and thereafter to the full retiring allowance.\n\n13. A contributor who has served less than 10 years, and retires either because he has reached the retirement age or because of disability may choose one of the two following options:\n\n(a) An adjusted annual retiring allowance, i.e., \\( \\frac{1}{50} \\) of the average annual salary\n\n\\[ \\frac{5}{50} \\times \\$2000 = \\$200 - \\frac{15}{100} \\times \\$200 = \\$170. \\]\n\n(b) A gratuity not exceeding one month's pay for each year of service.\n\n14. A contributor with less than 10 years service who retires because of abolition of his position may select one of the two following options:\n\n(a) A deferred adjusted annual retiring allowance, i.e., an allowance calculated as in paragraph 13(a) above but with the rights deferred until the age of 60 or until the person becomes permanently disabled so that he is incapable of pursuing a gainful occupation, whichever is earlier.\n\n(b) A gratuity not exceeding one month's pay for each year of service.\n\n15. A contributor who retires for any reason other than those above and other than misconduct (e.g., leaves to accept other employment) may select one of the two following options:\n\n(a) A deferred adjusted annual retiring allowance, calculated in accordance with paragraph 14(a) above, or\n(b) The payment in one sum of the total amount of his contributions, without interest.\n\n16. A contributor who is dismissed for reasons of misconduct shall receive only the amount of his contributions, without interest.\n\n17. The widow of a contributor who has served more than 10 years or who is in receipt of an annual retiring allowance may be paid an annual allowance until remarriage equal to \u00bd the superannuation allowance which might have been granted to the contributor if he had attained retirement age at the time of his death or retirement, as the case may be.\n\n18. Each child of a contributor who has served more than 10 years and who dies while in the Civil Service or while in receipt of an annual superannuation allowance may be paid an annual allowance equal to 1/5 the amount of the allowance paid to the contributor's widow, up to a maximum of $500. If both parents are dead the allowance may be doubled up to a maximum of $600. In no case must the total amount of allowances granted to children of a contributor exceed the amount of the allowance granted to his widow, nor must the total allowances granted to both widow and children exceed \u00be of the annual superannuation allowance which might have been granted to the contributor if he had attained retirement age at the date of his death or retirement, as the case may be.\n\n19. The widow and children of a contributor who has been awarded an adjusted annual retiring allowance or a deferred annual retiring allowance may be paid, forthwith, allowances calculated in the same way as those outlined in paragraphs 17 and 18 above.\n\n20. The widow or children or both of a contributor who has served less than 10 years in the Civil Service and dies while in the Service may be granted allowances calculated on the basis that the contributor had been awarded a deferred annual adjusted retiring allowance, or a gratuity not exceeding one month's pay for each year of service.\n\n21. When a contributor dies and the total amount of the allowances to which his widow and children are entitled is less than the total of his contributions without interest, a gratuity equal to the difference may be paid to his widow, children, or legal representative.\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT the teachers, Indian School, whose names are listed in the attached schedule, have been employed by the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources (formerly the Department of Indian Affairs) for the periods shown:\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends:\nThat in order to render them eligible as contributors under the Civil Service Superannuation Act, the employees listed in the attached schedule be appointed to permanent positions in the Indian Affairs Branch with effect from November 1, 1948, the rate of compensation shown in the schedule to apply.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nTeachers, Indian School, to be appointed to permanent positions in Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources.\n\n| NAME OF TEACHER | DATE OF BIRTH | YEARS OF SERVICE | GRADE OF TEACHER | ANNUAL SALARY |\n|-----------------|---------------|------------------|------------------|---------------|\n| W.J.

As I promised at that time, I am enclosing copies of two memoranda prepared by the Superannuation Branch of the Department of Finance and dealing with\n\n(a) Pensionable Employment,\n(b) War Service Eligibility.\n\nI have also requested a number of copies of the \"Civil Service Superannuation Act\" and will send you one when I receive them.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEnc.\nMarch 16, 1949.\n\nG. F. McIntyre, Esq.,\nOntario College of Education,\nUniversity of Toronto,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI visited Mr. Crookshank of the Canadian Teachers' Federation recently, and he told me of the work you are doing for the C.E.A. concerning teachers' salary scales and superannuation. You will therefore be interested in our procedure in regard to these two items:\n\n(1) Teachers' Salary Scale.\n\nThis scale applies to all teachers in Indian day schools in all the nine provinces of Canada, the Northwest Territories and the Yukon.\n\nWe classify a Grade I teacher as one who does not hold a Provincial Teaching Certificate based on a full year at Normal School. Therefore, into this category fall teachers with Permits, Third Class Certificates, Model Certificates, etc. Their scale is from $1,220 to $1,320 an academic year.\n\nA Grade II teacher is one holding a Second Class Teacher's Certificate (or equivalent requiring high school junior matriculation plus teacher training at a recognized school). These salaries range from $1,440 to $1,920.\n\nA Grade III teacher is one holding a First Class Teacher's Certificate (or equivalent requiring\nhigh school senior matriculation or first year university plus teacher training at a recognized school).\n\nOther details of our salary scale deal with high school teachers, welfare teachers and principals. I can provide you with a copy of the scale but it is under revision at the present time and we hope to have it completed within the next month or so. If this will be in sufficient time for you, I can then send you one.\n\nI would ask you to particularly note that we require only a certificate granted by the Provincial Department of Education. In other words, we accept teachers in our Indian schools in British Columbia who have certificates from Manitoba, Ontario, Nova Scotia, etc.\n\n(2) Superannuation.\n\nAfter two years of satisfactory service in our Indian day schools, our teachers can apply to become eligible under the Civil Service Superannuation Act.\n\nI have asked for additional copies of this Act and will send you one when they become available. In the meantime, I am sending you two memoranda dealing with recent revisions to this Act. I would ask you to particularly note the one dealing with \"Pensionable Employment\". This allows teachers who have been contributing to a provincial fund, to count the whole or part of such employment as service for the purposes of the Act, if he elects to make contributions in respect of such employment.\n\nI intend to come to Toronto for the O.E.A. at Easter and would be pleased to present to you any other details concerning our salary scales and the superannuation plan. We now have a large number of schools and are naturally interested in having our system explained in your brief.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

McCann, M.D., C.M., LL.D.,\nMinister of National Revenue,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Colleague:\n\nI have just acknowledged your letter of\nAugust 3, obtaining correspondence from the Reverend Father\nF. Eaton, S.J., of Hoggsdale College, Kingston, Ontario.\n\nI have asked for a report from officials of\nthe Indian Affairs Branch concerning the teaching record of\nMrs. Sheila Eaton, the mother of Father Eaton who wrote to\nyou on her behalf.\n\nShe taught in provincial schools in New\nBrunswick from 1895 to 1926. She returned to teaching in a\nprovincial school from January 1926, to June 1932. Presumably\non the death of her husband, in September 1932 she was appointed\nby the Department of Indian Affairs as teacher at the Red Bank\nIndian Day School, Red Bank, New Brunswick. She remained at\nthis school until she resigned in June 1949, when she was\n69 years of age. During the past two years we had obtained the\nnecessary authority by Order-in-Council for the retention of\nher services over the retirement age of 65.\n\nTeachers in Indian day schools were not accepted\nas contributors under the Civil Service Superannuation Act until\nJanuary 1948. At that time we made representations concerning\nMrs. Eaton, then 69 years of age, but as she was three years\npast the compulsory retiring age, she could not be accepted as\na contributor under the Superannuation Act.\nI attach a copy of a letter received at that time by the Superintendent of Indian Education from the Chief of the Superintendent Branch.\n\nOn April 10, 1948, Mrs. Eaton was advised of this ruling by the Superintendent Branch. I attach also a copy of the letter which was sent to her on that date.\n\nWe have had a number of similar instances of teachers who had been in our employ for a number of years but who for various reasons were not eligible for superannuation privileges. It has been our practice in these cases to recommend the payment of a retirement allowance of one month's salary per ten years of service. I recently submitted such a recommendation for Mrs. Eaton to the Treasury Board covering the period to her of $356.00.\n\nI regret that this is the only action which I can take concerning any payment to this teacher.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, August 10, 1949.\n\nThe Honourable James J.

Kehoe, S.J., of Regiopolis College, Kingston, Ontario.\n\nI have asked for a report from officials of the Indian Affairs Branch concerning the teaching record of Mrs. Stella Kehoe, the mother of Father Kehoe who wrote to you on her behalf.\n\nMrs. Kehoe taught in provincial schools in New Brunswick from 1898 to 1905. She returned to teaching in a provincial school from January, 1921, to June, 1924. Presumably on the death of her husband, in September, 1925, she was appointed by the Department of Indian Affairs as teacher at the Red Bank Indian Day School, Red Bank, New Brunswick. She remained at this school until she resigned in June, 1949, when she was sixty-nine years of age. During the past two years, we had obtained the necessary authority by Order-in-Council for the retention of her services over the retirement age of sixty-five.\n\nTeachers in Indian day schools were not accepted as contributors under the Civil Service Superannuation Act until January, 1948. At that time, we made representations concerning Mrs. Kehoe, then sixty-eight years of age; but as she was three years past the compulsory retiring age, she could not be accepted as a contributor under the Superannuation Act.\nI am attaching hereto a copy of a letter received at that time by the Superintendent of Indian Education from the Chief of the Superannuation Branch.\n\nOn April 10, 1948, Mrs. Kehoe was advised of this ruling by the Superannuation Branch. I attach also a copy of the letter which was sent to her on that date.\n\nWe have had a number of similar instances of teachers who had been in our day schools for a number of years, but who for various reasons were not eligible for superannuation privileges. It has been our practice in these cases to recommend the payment of a retirement allowance of one month's salary per ten years of service. I recently submitted such a recommendation for Mrs. Kehoe to the Treasury Board covering the payment to her of $324.00.\n\nI regret that this is the only action which I can take concerning any payment to this teacher.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBFN:EM\n:CH\nAugust 24, 1949\n\nMr. B.W. Vaughan,\nSurveyor General,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttached you will find a Death Certificate for Archibald Bateman and a Birth Certificate for Agnes McGirr.\n\nWould you kindly make two photostatic copies of each and return?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.
