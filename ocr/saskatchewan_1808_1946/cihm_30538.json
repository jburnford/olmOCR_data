McTAVISH, for information in regard to Lands and the best places for Settlement.\n\nPayments SPREAD OVER TEN YEARS, and no cultivation conditions imposed.\nIMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT.\n\nUnder the Land Regulations now in force (see next page) payments for land are\n\nSPREAD OVER TEN YEARS\n\ninstead of five as heretofore, without conditions requiring cultivation.\n\nINTEREST PAYABLE AT THE END OF EACH YEAR, AND NOT IN ADVANCE AS FORMERLY.\n\nUnder these Regulations, and considering that each settler, or son of a settler can obtain\n\n160 ACRES FREE\n\nfrom the Government, it is believed that no country in the world offers such favorable inducements to those desirous of taking up lands for settlement.\nRegulations for the Sale of Land.\n\nThe lands within the Railway belt, extending 24 miles from each side of the main line, will be disposed of at prices ranging from\n\n$2.50 PER ACRE\n\nupwards, according to location and quality, without any conditions requiring cultivation.\n\nThese Regulations are substituted for and cancel those hitherto in force.\n\nTERMS OF PAYMENT.\n\nIf paid for in full at time of purchase, a Deed of Conveyance of the land will be given; but the purchaser may pay one-tenth in cash, and the balance in\n\nNINE ANNUAL INSTALMENTS,\n\nwith interest at six per cent. per annum, payable at the end of each year. Payments may be made in Land Grant Bonds, which will be accepted at ten per cent. premium on their par value and accrued interest. These bonds can be obtained on application at the Bank of Montreal, Montreal, or at any of its agencies in Canada or the United States.\n\nGENERAL CONDITIONS.\n\nAll sales are subject to the following general conditions:\n\n1. All improvements placed upon land purchased to be maintained thereon until final payment has been made.\n2. All taxes and assessments lawfully imposed upon the land or improvements to be paid by the purchaser.\n3. The Company reserves from sale, under these regulations, all mineral and coal lands; and lands containing timber in quantities, stone, slate and marble quarries, lands with water power thereon, and tracts for town sites and railway purposes.\n4. Mineral, coal and timber lands and quarries, and lands controlling water power, will be disposed of on very moderate terms to persons giving satisfactory evidence of their intention and ability to utilize the same.\n5. The Company reserves the right to take without remuneration (except for the value of buildings and improvements on the required portion of the land) a strip or strips of land 200 feet wide, to be used for right of way, or other railway purposes, wherever the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, or any branch thereof, is or shall be located.\n\nLiberal rates for settlers and their effects will be granted by the Company over its Railway.\n\nFor further particulars, apply to the Company's Land Commissioner,\nJOHN H. McTAVISH, Winnipeg.\n\nMONTREAL, January, 1886.\n\nNOTE.\u2014SOUTHERN MANITOBA.\n\nThe Manitoba and South Western Railway (leased by the Canadian Pacific) has now been extended from Manitou to the neighbourhood of Whitewater Lake (see map), and applications for lands along this line will now be received. These are among the choicest lands in the Province, and will be sold on very reasonable terms to actual settlers. Apply to Mr. McTAVISH for prices and conditions.\nFACTS RELATING TO THE CANADIAN NORTH-WEST.\n\nMBODIED in the following pages are plain facts from farmers in the Canadian North-West on many points of interest to intending settlers. It should be stated that circular letters asking for information were sent out to all farmers in the country whose addresses could be secured. The replies received were so numerous as to make it quite impossible to embody them all in one pamphlet. Those given in the following pages relate chiefly to the main questions present, in the first instance, to the mind of an intending settler.\n\nThe full address of each settler is given in the first instance only. It is, of course, competent for any reader, by writing to the address given in each case, to verify the accuracy of the answers now published. Questions were asked as follows:\n\n- When did you first settle in the North-West?\n- How much capital did you commence with?\n- What do you consider the present value of your farm?\n\nThese questions elicited the following answers from actual settlers:\n\n| Name                  | Postal Address          | When Settled | Capital at Commencement | Value of Farm |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------------|\n| Hector, Henry         | Woodlands, Manitoba     | 1873         | Nothing                  | $12,000       |\n| Craig, John M.L.      | Moosomin, P.O., Ass.    | 1881         | I was in debt $10        | $1,600        |\n| Steele, William       | Chater, Man             | 1880         | Had no money to begin with, but made about $2,000 the first two years with warehouse on river | About $10,000 to $12,000 |\n| Cameron, G.A.         | Indian Head, N.W.T.     | 1882         | Carpenter's trade was all the capital I had | $2,000 to $2,500 |\n| Jackson, J.W.         | Arnaud, P.O., Man       | 1882         | None, but what it cost to build, and all of that I made by working out | $2,500 |\n| Wagner, W.

This will enable the intending settler to choose a locality in which to seek his farm. The land grant of the Canadian Pacific Railway along the main line has been divided into agencies as far west as the Rocky Mountains, within the limits of which lands belonging to the Company can be purchased from the Agents of the Company at the stations hereinafter indicated.\n\nBRANDON.\u2014Lands in main belt, ranges 11 to 23 (inclusive) west of First Meridian.\n\nVIRDEN.\u2014Lands in main line belt, ranges 24 to 28 (inclusive), excepting townships 14, 15, 16, west of First Meridian.\nMOOSOMIN.\u2014Lands in main line belt, ranges 28 (part of) to 33 (inclusive) west of First Meridian.\n\nBROADVIEW.\u2014Lands in main line belt, ranges 1 to 7 (inclusive) west of Second Meridian.\n\nWOLSELEY.\u2014Lands in main line belt, ranges 8 to 13 (inclusive) west of Second Meridian.\n\nREGINA.\u2014Lands in main line belt, ranges 14 to 23 (inclusive) west of Second Meridian.\n\nMOOSEJAW.\u2014Lands in main line belt, range 24 west of Second Meridian to range 10 west of Third Meridian.\n\nSWIFT CURRENT.\u2014Lands in main line belt, ranges 11 to 20 west of Third Meridian to Fourth Meridian.\n\nMAPLE CREEK.\u2014Lands in main line belt, range 20 west of Third Meridian to Fourth Meridian.\n\nMEDICINE HAT.\u2014Lands in main line belt, from Fourth Meridian to range 10 west of Fourth Meridian.\n\nCROWFOOT.\u2014Lands in main line belt, ranges 11 to 20 west of Fourth Meridian.\n\nCALGARY.\u2014Lands in main line belt, range 50 west of Fourth Meridian to summit of Rocky Mountains.\n\nThe business of the Swift Current and Medicine Hat Agencies is for the present being attended to by the agent at Maple Creek, and that of Crowfoot Agency by the Agent at Calgary.\n\nThe Agents at the Land Offices have, for free distribution, maps showing the lands open for sale, and those already disposed of, plans of the town plots, and pamphlets giving descriptive notes of the lands within their agencies.\n\nThe Government have established Intelligence Offices at various points along the line, in charge of officers, who will give the fullest information regarding homestead lands. Attached to these offices are Land Guides, whose services are always available gratuitously for locating those in search of homesteads.\n\nSettlers arriving in Winnipeg should, before going west, call at the Land Department of the Canadian Pacific Railway, the office of which is located in the station. There they can ascertain what lands are open for homesteads, and the situation of the Government Intelligence Offices.\n\nHow to Obtain Government Lands.\n\nThe Dominion Government makes a free grant of 160 acres of agricultural land to every British subject over the age of 18 years, and also affords settlers the right to pre-empt another 160 acres; that is, the settler may take up the additional 160 acres, making a payment of from 2 to 2\u00bd dollars (8 to 10 shillings) per acre at the end of three years of settlement. Settlers taking up Government free homesteads are required to reside on their farms for at least six months of the year during the first three years.\n\nIn the case of taking free homesteads; pre-empting or purchasing from the Government, the business will have to be transacted at the nearest of the following Dominion Land Offices:\u2014\nLiberality of Canadian Land Regulations.\n\nThe land regulations of the Canadian Government, combined with the advantages offered by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, are the most liberal of any on the North American Continent. The fee for taking up a homestead in the Canadian North-West is only $10, whereas it is $26, and in some cases $34 in the United States; and the taking of a homestead does not in Canada prevent the pre-emption of other government lands, or the purchase of Canadian Pacific Railway or Government lands.\n\nThe Climate.\n\nFollowing are the opinions of actual residents in regard to the climate. The questions asked were:\u2014\nAbout what time does winter regularly set in, and when does it end? Have you suffered any serious hardship or loss from the climate in winter? Is the climate healthy?\n\nFor postal address of each settler, see pages 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.\n\n| Name          | Answer                                                                 |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dickin, George | 1st week in November, and 1st week in April.

G.      | 5th November to 5th April. Three years ago I was living in a small tent until the end of November, my house not being built. The thermometer registered considerably below zero at times.

I like the winter, as it is always dry and a good deal of fine weather. Climate very healthy. Last year 10th November, and opened for seeding on the 25th March if I was ready.

Sowing commences from the middle to the end of April, and finishes in the beginning of May.\n\n**Summer.**\u2014June, July, August, and part of September. Weather bright and clear, with frequent showers\u2014very warm at times during the day; night cool and refreshing. Harvesting commences in August and ends in September.\n\n**Autumn.**\u2014Part of September and October and part of November, perhaps the most enjoyable season of the year, the air being balmy and exceedingly pleasant. At this period of the year the prairie fires take place, and the atmosphere has rather a smoky appearance, but it is not disagreeable.\n\n**Winter.**\u2014Part of November, December, January, February and March.\nIn the early part of November the Indian summer generally commences, and then follows the loveliest portion of the season, which usually lasts about a fortnight. The weather is warm, the atmosphere hazy and calm, and every object appears to wear a tranquil and drowsy aspect. Then comes winter, generally ushered in by a soft, fleecy fall of snow, succeeded by days of extreme clearness, with a clear blue sky and invigorating atmosphere. In December the winter regularly sets in, and, until the end of March, the weather continues steady, with perhaps one thaw in January, and occasional snow-storms. The days are clear and bright, and the cold much softened by the brilliancy of the sun.\n\n**Summer Frosts.**\n\nIn considering answers to the question \"Are summer frosts prevalent or exceptional?\" it should be remembered that last year a most exceptional frost appeared on one night in September throughout the whole northern part of the United States, and in some parts of British North America. The damage done to crops in the Canadian North-West was proved by Government statistics to be much less than that generally experienced on the continent of North America; and the facts that the following replies were given immediately after a frost, even though it was most exceptional, adds largely to the value of the testimony.\n\nIt should further be remembered, as will be seen from the testimony of many settlers, that ill-effects from summer frosts may be, in almost every case, avoided by a system of early ploughing; so that each settler has his remedy in his own hands.\n\n104 farmers answered, \"Exceptional!\" Following are replies of others, whose\n\n| Name          | Answer                                                                 |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dicken, G.    | Exceptional, doing little or no damage if wheat land is autumn ploughed.

Manitoba and the Canadian North-west are happily, for the most part, outside of what is sometimes called the \"storm belt,\" and it is but rarely that the country is visited in this way. This may be seen by the following testimony, and it is noteworthy how great a number have experienced no loss whatever; as many as 150 thinking the damage of so little real importance as to simply answer it by the words \"No\" or \"None.\" Storms do, it will be seen, occasionally visit some few parts of the country, but it is undoubted that they are exceptional.\n\nThe question asked was:\u2014\"Have you suffered any serious loss from storms during either winter or summer?\"\u2014In reply 112 farmers simply answered \"No,\" and 42 answered \"None.\" Following are the replies of the remainder. Their full names and postal addresses are given on pages 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8.\n\n| Name                  | Answer                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Urton, W.

Still, it is interesting to study the chemical properties of this extraordinary agricultural tract excelled by none and equalled only by the alluvial delta of the Nile.\n\nDr. Stevenson Macadam, of Edinburgh University, an undoubted authority, says the soil is \"very rich in organic matter, and contains the full amount of the saline fertilizing matters found in all soils of a good bearing quality.\" The soil is in general a deep black argillaceous mould or loam resting on a deep tenaceous clay subsoil, and is so rich that it does not require the addition of manure for years after the first breaking of the prairie, and in particular places where the loam is very deep it is practically inexhaustible.\n\nThe question asked on this point was: \"Please state the nature of soil on your farm, and depth of black loam?\" The description of one farm in each district only is given to economise space. Where, however, the description of lands in the same district differ, the answer of each settler is given.

The coal-beds in the Bow and Belly river districts, tributary to Medicine Hat on the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, are the first to be worked, and settlers now obtain this coal at moderate prices. Other mines have been discovered immediately on the line of the railway, between Medicine Hat and the summit of the Rocky Mountains, and some of these will be in operation during the present season. Valuable and extensive coal-beds also exist in the Souris district in Southern Manitoba and the south-eastern and western part of the North-West, and these will shortly be opened up by the projected Manitoba South-Western and other railways.\n\nAs regards the water supply, the North-West has not only numerous rivers and creeks, but also a very large number of lakes and lakelets in almost every part of the country, and it has been ascertained definitely that good water can be obtained almost anywhere throughout the territory by means of wells; in addition to which there are numerous clear, running, never-failing springs to be found throughout the land. An ample supply of water of different qualities may always be found on the prairie by sinking wells which generally range in depth from eight to twenty feet. Rain generally falls freely during the spring while the summer and autumn are generally dry.\n\nOn these two points the farmers were asked: \"What sort of fuel do you use, and is it difficult to obtain?\" \"Have you plenty of water on your farm, and how obtained? If from a well, please state depth of same.\" The full name and postal address of each settler may be found on pages 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8.\n\n| Name                  | Answer                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dickin, George        | Wood getting scarce; will be able to get coal.

They are in no reported instance infested by flies or other insects. Mangold-wurzels and carrots are not cultivated as field crops to any great extent.\n\nAll garden vegetables produce prolific crops, and the Province sustains an extraordinary reputation for their production. During recent years a very large and general increase has taken place in the acreage devoted to the cultivation of garden products. In the earlier years of the Province's history new settlers had but little time to devote to gardening, but once having got their farms into good working order, they are devoting more attention to it, with most satisfactory results.\nThe following are instances taken from farmers' reports of success in the growth of vegetables, and in conjunction with these reports it must be remembered that very few, if any, of these farmers used special means to produce these results. The question asked was: \"What yield of vegetables have you had, and what is your experience in raising them?\" For postal address of each settler, see pages 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8.\n\n| Name          | Answer, in bushels per acre.                                                                 |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dicken, George | Have had carrots 12 inches round, and grown cucumbers successfully in the open. Beans and potatoes very good, better than I ever raised in England with 20 years' experience; Turnips very good, and mangolds good. |\n| Yardley, Henry | Potatoes, 300. I have grown in the garden beans, peas, carrots, parsnips, beets, cabbage, (several kinds), onions. With attention all do well. |\n| Proctor, Henry | Potatoes, 300, well manured; turnips, 600, well manured; Carrots and peas, beans and flax, have also done well in small lots. I have grown almost all kinds of vegetables with the best results. |\n| Knight, W. G.  | Potatoes, about 160. All kinds of garden produce grow luxuriously; that is, all and every kind that can be grown in England, and do not require manure for some years. |\n| Jeffrey, William | I have grown almost all kinds, and the quality is splendid. |\n| Blythe, R.     | Potatoes, 150, on the breaking; my beans were frozen. The first year it is not well to sow vegetables on the breaking, except for home use, otherwise, after the ground has been properly worked, nearly all vegetables thrive well. |\n| Field, Edward  | Potatoes, 300; turnips, from 500 to 700. Carrots, peas and beans, I have only grown on a small scale; the yield is good. Vegetables are a great success in this country, and come on very rapidly. I have grown potatoes, onions, carrots, beets, corn, cucumbers, parsnips, radishes, lettuce, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, melon; in fact same as we grow in England. |\n| Pollard, Alfred | Potatoes, 300. An abundant crop of turnips, carrots, peas and beans. My vegetables have this year generally been a failure. I have grown almost every description of vegetables with great success. |\n| Orr, James D.  | Potatoes, 300; turnips, 400. I have only grown vegetables in the garden, but they all do extremely well. |\n| Lothian, James | Potatoes, 300. Have raised cabbages, carrots, onions and beet, all of which did well. With a little experience of the climate, I believe gardening can be made a success in all sorts of vegetables. |\n| McGhee, Jas.   | Potatoes, 100. This country is second to none for vegetables. |\n| Gibson, Wm.    | Potatoes, 200. Cabbage, Scotch kail, rhubarb, onions, carrots, turnips, parsley, peas, pumpkins and sage, all do well with climate and soil. We have used potatoes two months after planting them. |\n| Bruce, George  | Potatoes, 400. I have grown almost every kind of cabbage and garden stuff you can mention. I have lifted cabbage this fall 20 lbs. in weight. |\n| Mitchell, John | Potatoes, 180. Turnips, carrots, onions, beets, parsnips, parsley, lettuce, and radishes all grow well. I have not made such headway with cabbage. Rhubarb grows splendidly. |\n| Middleton, Alex | I find no difficulty in growing any of the vegetables I was acquainted with in Scotland. They all require to be sown early in the season. |\n| Name                  | Answer, in bushels per acre.                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Perley, W. D.         | Potatoes grow splendidly, and of fine quality, without manure. Carrots will grow fine, but have not had much experience. Peas grow splendidly. I believe manure would help and produce a large crop, but for quality, the present can't be excelled. |\n| Prat, Jno.            | Have some parsnips grown on land which had a crop of peas and potatoes on it last, and no manure put on it, and took one or two potatoes, a week ago, which were 2\u00bd inches in diameter, and long in proportion. |\n| Miller, Solomon       | Potatoes, 400; turnips, 750.                                                                |\n| McGill, George        | Potatoes average 250 bushels (of 60 lbs.) per acre. Never saw a better crop of potatoes, in any country, than I have this year. Turnips, carrots, peas, beans, and flax, are good. |\n| Smith, William        | Potatoes, 300; turnips, 800. Have also grown carrots, parsnips, onions, cabbage, cauliflowers, pumpkins, melons, citrons, cucumbers, lettuce, squash, tomatoes and radish. |\n| Ingram, W. A.         | Potatoes, 300 to 500; turnips, carrots and beans do well; peas 30, and flax 20. Everything in the way of vegetables does immensely, except Indian corn and tomatoes, which I do not find as yet a success. |\n| Lawrie, J. M.         | Potatoes, 250. Only raised turnips and carrots in garden, but they would do well here. My experience is that vegetables cannot be raised more successfully in any other country. |\n| Doyle, W. A.          | Potatoes, about 250; peas, about 25. Have never seen vegetables equal to those of Manitoba. We cannot raise squash, melons or pumpkins to maturity, however. Carrots, beets, maize, onions, salsify, celery, chicory, radishes and cucumbers all do unusually well with us. |\n| Sheppard, Jos.        | Potatoes, 200; peas, 60 lbs. per acre. Vegetables very good; you can raise every kind to perfection. |\n| Stevenson, T. W.      | Potatoes, 300. Turnips not attended to would have produced 400 or 500 bushels per acre. I never saw as fine vegetables anywhere else, except turnips. |\n| Depell, John          | Potatoes, 3591 turnips, 800. Peas do well. Vegetables do very well. |\n| Walker, J. C.         | Potatoes, 300; turnips, 600; carrots, 300; peas, 30 and beans, 40. Have grown with good results; potatoes, turnips, mangold-wurtzels, beets, carrots, parsnips, onions, radishes, cabbages, cauliflowers and many others. |\n| Mooney, Jno.          | Potatoes, from 300 to 400. Turnips 600, and peas 30. All vegetables do well. Have also grown carrots, beets, cabbage, tomatoes, squash, citron, onions, rhubarb and pumpkins. |\n| Horner, T. R.         | I never saw vegetables grown to better success than here; in fact, they are the surest crops we can grow. I have grown potatoes, turnips, carrots and beets with perfect satisfaction. |\n| Davis, Jno. B.        | Potatoes 300, turnips 600, carrots 600, peas 30, beans 25, and flax 30. Have also grown cabbage, beets, tomatoes, radishes, onions, salsify, pie plant, lettuce, pumpkins, grapes, artichokes, pepper and parsnips. |\n| Powers, C.

Turnips generally have not done well this year, the weather being very dry when they were sown in the spring. I never grew any except in the garden; these are excellent. Have grown peas two years; they do first-class here. Beans can be grown here in abundance. I have grown the finest potatoes that I ever grew in my life, both in quantity and quality. Carrots, cabbage, cauliflowers and other garden stuff grown in this country, are of the very best quality. |\n| Patterson, Abr.       | Potatoes, from 250 to 300, and turnips, 500. Carrots average 450. All kinds of vegetables grow well. I have also grown beet, onions, radishes, cabbage, cauliflower, melon, citron and cucumbers. |\n| Fraser, D. D.         | Potatoes, turnips, carrots, peas, beans and flax do very well, without any care and trouble. If the seed is only sown early, with care and cultivation, the yield is enormous. |\n| Osborne, Daniel       | Potatoes, 200 bushels from half acre. The yield of turnips and carrots was poor, owing to the drought in the spring. Flax was good. Vegetables did fairly. All cullender vegetables do well here. |\n| Harrison, D. H.       | Potatoes, 300; really magnificent. Also turnips, carrots and mangolds; the latter yield well. Cabbages and cauliflowers do well. |\n| Thompson, S.          | Potatoes, about 350. I had nine waggon loads (about 30 bushels each) of turnips off half an acre last year. Carrots, 500; peas, 50 bushels off two acres one year; beans, 40 to 60; flax 15. All kinds do well here; cabbages, cauliflowers, beets, melons, cucumbers, &c. Onions do splendidly. Tomatoes are not a success; we have lots of them, but they are green yet (September.) |\n| Stevenson, G. B.      | My potatoes are the best I ever saw in this country. Turnip, very heavy yield, also carrots; peas, 30. This equals any country for the growth of vegetation. Have grown beets, onions, melons, citrons, cucumbers, pumpkins, tomatoes, radishes, celery and lettuces. |\n| Stirton, James        | Potatoes, 400, and peas 40. All garden vegetables usually grown on a farm, grow first class. Onions and cabbages grow extra large and are of fine quality. |\n| Slater, C. B.         | I had a fair crop of potatoes this year. My turnips were poor on breaking. The yield of carrots was good, but frost killed my beans. Carrots, cabbages, onions, parsnips, potatoes and beets are all doing well. |\n| Burgess, J. W.        | Potatoes 500, turnips 1,000. Have also grown beets. |\n| Connerson, James      | Potatoes 200, turnips about 250, and peas and beans from 14 to 15. I think I could raise about 300 bushels of carrots per acre. Vegetables grow first-class. Sweet corn, cabbages, carrots and long and turnip beets grow to perfection; tomatoes splendidly; onions in abundance. Have also grown celery, musk and water melons, &c. Took $15 prize money two years ago. |\n| Rawson, James         | Yield of potatoes and turnips heavy; carrots are simply immense; peas are not good here, the land is too heavy; beans do well, and flax yields from 20 to 30. This is a splendid country for vegetables. I have also grown mangold-wurtzels, onions, beets, parsnips, tomatoes, cucumbers, melons, citrons, squash, celery, cabbage, cauliflower, radishes, kail, brussels sprouts, lettuce, salsify and mushrooms. I have the Provincial Diploma for the best collection of garden vegetables. |\n| Name          | Answer, in bushels per acre |\n|---------------|-----------------------------|\n| Chambers, W   | Potatoes 300, turnips 1,000, and white Belgian carrots 500. Drought affected my peas this year, but they will yield 25; beans do well here. A little capital invested in flax seed culture and the manufacture of twine or cord for our self-binding machines, would result in great wealth. Onions, table carrots, parsnips, beets, turnips, radishes, lettuces, melons, tomatoes, peas, parsley, and all sorts of garden and field vegetables can be grown here to perfection; at least, that is my usual experience. |\n| Bole, J       | Potatoes 300. All kinds of vegetables do well in the North-West when the ground is properly prepared. |\n| Day, S. D. A  | Potatoes about 400; turnips 600, and peas 20. Have very fine cabbage, carrots, turnips, beans, parsnips, beets, onions, lettuce, spinach, rhubarb, radishes and cucumbers. Have raised tomatoes and Indian corn, but not with success. |\n| McDonald, W. M | Potatoes 500; turnips 1,000, and peas 30. |\n| McLean, J. A  | Potatoes 409, sometimes more; turnips from 400 to 600. Peas and beans do well. Any and every kind of vegetable does wonderfully well in this country. I believe there is no better country in the known world that can come up to the country for vegetables. |\n| Speers, A. R  | Potatoes 400, turnips 1,000, peas 30, flax 40. Carrots remarkably good crop; beans yield splendid. |\n\n**The Use of Manure.**\n\nFertilizers are not used in the North-West, for they are not needed, and common manure is used but sparingly. The land is, indeed, in most cases, so rich that the using of it during the first years of cultivation would be apt to encourage the growth of straw, and make the crops too rank. After the second year manure in limited quantities may be used with advantage to prevent any exhaustion of the land.\n\nThis is the general experience of settlers to be found related with their opinions on many other useful subjects in an additional pamphlet, to be had free on application to Mr. Begg, Canadian Pacific Offices, 88 Cannon Street, London:\u2014\"When you have it, put it on your light land, don't waste it; but it is not necessary for years.\" One settler, Mr. William Gibson, of Loganstone Farm, Wolseley, says: \"I have used manure to a few potatoes to try the effect it had along with others planted without manure, and they did no better with it.\"\n\n**Stock Raising and the Hay Supply.**\n\nThe general healthiness of the climate and the favorable conditions for feeding horses, cattle, and sheep, make stock-raising a most profitable industry. The boundless prairies, covered with luxuriant grasses, giving an unusually large yield, and the cool nights for which Manitoba is famous, are most beneficial features in regard to stock; and the remarkable dryness and healthiness of the winter tend to make cattle fat and well-conditioned. The easy access to good water is another advantage in stock-raising. The\nabundance of hay almost everywhere makes it an easy matter for farmers to winter their stock; and in addition to this there is, and always will be, a ready home market for beef.\n\nOwing to the abundance and excellence of prairie hay, little has hitherto been done in the cultivation of grasses, though what small quantity is cultivated is largely of the Timothy and Hungarian classes. The average yield of hay per acre is $2\\frac{1}{2}$ to 3 tons; sometimes 4 tons are gathered, and in wet seasons as many as five tons. The crop of 1882 was an abundant one, and was generally saved in good condition, while, in 1883 almost a double yield was gathered.\n\nOn these points the experience of settlers is especially valuable. Their statements answer the questions: \"How many horses and cattle have you? Have you plenty of hay, and do cattle thrive on the wild prairie grasses? How do your animals thrive in winter, and where do you stock them?\" For postal address of each settler, see pages 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8.\n\n| Name          | Answer                                                                                                                                 |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dickin, George| 17 cattle.

Yes. Cattle do well; wintered first-class.                                                             |\n| Urton, W. S.  | 5 horses and 1 cow. Yes. Cattle do splendidly, better than on English hay. They are stabled in winter during very bad days, but are turned out most days. |\n| Yardly, Henry | I have 3 oxen and two yearling steers. I have sufficient hay for 20 head of cattle; they thrive first-class. Last winter I took 12 head of cattle from a neighbour. They came out in the spring equal to when I was in England. I kept them in open sheds with yards last winter. My neighbour has his in stables, and they do not do as well as mine. |\n| Phillips, S.   | 30 horses and 20 head of cattle. Plenty of hay; cattle get fat in summer on the prairie grasses. I house them in a log stable during winter. |\n| Hutchison, A.  | 20 head of cattle, 3 horses, 19 sheep and 2 pigs. Yes; cattle get very fat on the prairie grass in summer; they do well in the stable in winter. I fed them on hay alone last winter; this winter I intend using grain and roots in small quantities. |\n| Mercer, Jas.   | 9 head of cattle at the present time. Plenty of hay. Cattle thrive well on wild grasses. I have wintered over twice the above number of cattle. I stable young cattle, large cattle run loose in open sheds. |\n| Knight, W. G.  | No horses, 45 head of cattle. Plenty of hay. My thoroughbred short-horns have nothing but the wild grasses of the country, and they are in splendid condition, in fact quite fat. I should take a prize for Christmas beef in England; the beef cannot be beaten. Cattle thrive well in winter, on hay only. Some are in stables and some out. |\n| Field, Edward  | Plenty of hay. Cattle undoubtedly thrive well in winter, and get very fat in summer. Both horses and cattle do well in the winter in the stable at night. Heifers, steers, &c., in open sheds.

Sheep have been entirely free from disease in the North-West, and foot-rot has never occurred so far as can be ascertained.\n\n\"Do sheep thrive in the Canadian North-West, and is sheep-raising profitable?\"\n\nIn answering this question 57 settlers replied \"Yes.\" The replies of the others are given below.

There are few countries where the horses have such immunity from the diseases of stock as they have in the North-West.\n\nAs to pigs, the Berkshire breed seems best suited to the country, as the pigs of this class mature rapidly and fatten easily, living on the grass and making good pork in six or seven months with proper feeding. The breeding and fattening of pigs increased considerably in 1882 and subsequent years, and no disease was reported among them.\n\nPoultry do exceedingly well in the North-West, especially turkeys, owing to the dryness of the climate. Manitoba is itself the home of the wild duck, goose and chicken, and those who devote care and attention to the raising of poultry are sure of a good return.\n\nIt is important to add that no disease of a contagious or infectious character exists among the cattle and sheep of the North-West, and that every care is taken by the Provincial Government to promote the interest of breeders. Among the more recent measures adopted is the appointment of veterinary surgeons in each county, to look after the interests of stock raisers, and to carry out the stringent regulations now in force to prevent the introduction of disease among cattle and horses.\nRaising of Bees.\n\nApiculture is successfully carried on in the North-West, as bees require a clear, dry atmosphere and a rich harvest of flowers; if the air is damp, or the weather cloudy, they will not work so well. Another reason why they work less in a warm climate is that the honey gathered remains fluid for sealing a longer time, and if gathered faster than it thickens, it sours and spoils. The clear bright skies, dry air and rich flora are therefore well adapted to bee culture.\n\nFruits.\n\nWild fruits, attaining to great perfection, abound in Manitoba and the North-West. Wild plums, grapes, raspberries, gooseberries, strawberries, cherries, cranberries, and other berries of various kinds abound and are of luscious quality. Little attention has hitherto been paid to fruit growing, owing to the time of settlers being too much occupied with the important work of erecting buildings, and getting their lands fairly under cultivation, but as the general improvement of the farms progresses, fruit culture will doubtless receive its due share of attention. Following are but a few representative statements from farmers on the subject; a remarkable array of testimony on the subject may be found in the pamphlet to be had free on application to Mr. Begg, Canadian Pacific Railway Offices, 88 Cannon Street, London, E.C.\n\n\"Strawberries, currants, gooseberries, raspberries, and in fact all small fruits, bear in the greatest abundance and give every promise of being very profitable.\n\n\"W. A. Farmer, Headingly.\"\n\n\"Planted twenty apple trees two years ago, which are growing very well.\n\n\"Arthur J. Moore, Nelsonville.\"\n\n\"I have over 1,000 apple trees doing very well, and also excellent bleck currants.\n\n\"James Armon, High Bluff\"\n\n\"Strawberry, raspberry, brambleberry, gooseberry, black currant, cherry, cranberry, saskatoonberry, and others. Mrs. Gibson has made over 100 lbs. of jelly this summer from wild fruit.\n\n\"William Gibson, Loganstone Farm, Wolseley.\"\n\n\"I planted this spring currants, gooseberries, and mullberries, and so far they are doing well.\n\n\"John Pratt, Rounthwaite.\"\n\n\"Currants, gooseberries, strawberries, plums, cherries, raspberries, huckleberries, in profusion. Only commencing with apple trees and cultivated fruits; going in for a nursery.\n\n\"Thomas Rogers, Railway View Farm, Moose Jaw.\"\n\n\"Plums, black, white, and red currants, strawberries, raspberries, and saskatoons. Rhubarb does remarkably well.\n\n\"W. F. Sirett, Glendale P. O.\"\n\nHops.\n\nWild hops, pronounced by brewers to be of excellent quality for brewing purposes, attain to a luxuriant growth in nearly every portion of Manitoba, the soil and climate being apparently thoroughly suited to them. Hops from these parts have for some time past commanded good prices, and the cultivation of the hop plant is believed to be most profitable to the grower. A resident settler, writing on this subject, says:\u2014\n\"Hops will do well cultivated. I have planted wild hops out of the bush into my garden along the fence and trained on poles, bearing as full and fine and as large as any I ever saw at Yalding and Staplehurst, in Kent, England.\n\n\"LOUIS DUNESING (Emerson).\"\n\nFlax and Hemp.\n\nThese important crops were cultivated to a considerable extent by old settlers many years ago, the product being of excellent quality; but the universal complaint at that time was the want of a market, or of a machinery to work up the raw material, and this led them to discontinue this important branch of husbandry. Its cultivation has been renewed extensively by the Russian Mennonite settlers, on whose reserves in the southern portion of Manitoba a considerable quantity is produced. At West Lynne alone over 6,000 bushels were brought in during the first week in December, alone, in one year, averaging 80c. (3s. 4d.) per bushel. Flax is peculiarly suited to the Province, and so much is this felt that an English capitalist has started in Winnipeg an extensive linseed-oil mill. This fact and the demand for flax seed that must necessarily arise, will still further increase the area of its cultivation. It can only be raised successfully in a cool region, the warm climates of the south causing the bark to become brittle and hard, and the rapidity with which it there matures preventing the lint from obtaining consistency or tenacity. On account of their extremely favourable climate for this cereal, Manitoba and the North-West territories are likely to prove formidable rivals to northern Europe in its cultivation.\n\nShooting and Fishing.\n\nThere is excellent shooting everywhere in the woods and on the prairie, as may be seen by the following list of birds and animals to be found:\u2014Small Game; Prairie chickens, ducks, geese, pheasants, partridges, pigeons, cranes, snipe, plover, rabbits, &c.; Large Game: Moose, deer, antelope, buffalo, elk, and a large number of fur-bearing animals.\n\nThe rivers and lakes abound with the following fish:\u2014Sturgeon of large size, white fish, pickerel, pike, bass, perch, suckers, sunfish, gold eyes, carp, trout, and maskinonge.\n\nMarkets.\n\nSmall centres of trade are continually springing into existence wherever settlements take place, and these contain generally one or more stores where farmers can find a ready market for their produce. The stations along the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway are not more than eight or ten miles apart, and the liberal course adopted by the railway company in dealing with persons willing to undertake the erection of elevators for the storage of wheat and other grains has led to the establishment of a large number of these warehouses along the line of the railway in Manitoba alone. These have a total capacity of over 1,500,000, and enable farmers to dispose of their grain at good prices almost at their doors. A glance at the map demonstrates that Manitoba,\nvia the Canadian Pacific Railway, will have closer connection with the seaboard than Minnesota, Dakota, or any of the more Western States now have with New York; so that the export of grain from the Canadian North-West at remunerative prices is assured. The very large influx of people, and the prosecution of railways and public works will, however, cause a great home demand for some years, and for a time limit the quantity for export.\n\nSuccess of Settlers.\n\n\"Are you satisfied with the country, the climate, and the prospects ahead of you?\" This is, after all, the most crucial question. For what are enormous yields and substantial profits, if the country cannot be made a home\u2014a resting place of comfort, of independence and of freedom? There are, of course, drawbacks in the Canadian North-West, and in these pages the settlers speak their own minds fully on these points. But what country under the sun has not some drawbacks? If so, it were indeed an earthly paradise. How will old England or bonnie Scotland stand in the matter of drawbacks? The point is this:\u2014Are the drawbacks of the Canadian North-West anything approaching in importance those under which I am now living? Is the North-West a desirable place for settlement in my own peculiar circumstances? Can I hope to live there with greater comfort and less anxiety for the future of myself and my children than in the old country? No impartial reader will have difficulty in answering for himself by the aid of these pages.\n\nIn regard to the replies to this particular question, it should be borne in mind that the Canadian North-West is an immense country. Its perfect development is naturally a work of some time. Railways have been during the past year or two built there at a rate perhaps unknown in human history, and the work still proceeds. But there must yet be districts without immediate contact with the iron horse, though another year may see these very districts the centre of a system as has been the experience in the past. It is of course natural that each farmer should want the railway running through his farm and even close to his own door. But such a thing is impossible even in long established Britain; how can it be expected in newly-settled Canada? It rests with each intending settler to choose his own land; there is still ample to be had with good railway facilities.\n\nIn answering the question, Are you satisfied with the country, the climate, and the prospects ahead of you? 84 farmers replied simply \"Yes.\" Following are the answers given by others.

The arrivals from Europe are principally English, Scotch, and Irish, including tenant farmers, laborers, servants and others, most of whom readily adapt themselves to their new life. There are also a good number of Germans and Scandinavians, hard-working, law-abiding citizens, whose co-patriots have proved themselves to be among the most valuable settlers in the United States. Some settlers are contributed by the American Union, a small portion being repatriated French-Canadians, principally from the State of Massachusetts, and the balance, farmers and farmers\u2019 sons, almost entirely from the Western States, while there is also a large settlement of Russians, Mennonites, and Icelandics, who are now comfortably settled, contented and prosperous, the last named having formed an Icelandic settlement at Big Island, Lake Winnipeg. The French-Canadians settled along the Red River, who emigrated from Boston and other cities in the New England States of America, are reported to be in good circumstances, and, their crops having yielded largely, their prospects are excellent. Speaking generally, the people of the North-west are highly respectable, orderly, and law abiding.\n\nFarm Labour.\u2014It is difficult to give definite information on this point. There is no doubt it has been high, especially during harvest time, when there is a great demand for men to take in the crops, but the very large number of people going into the country during the past few seasons has tended materially to reduce the scale of wages. One point should be remembered\u2014that the farmer in Manitoba, with his immense yield and fair prices, can afford to pay a comparatively high rate of wages, and still find his farming very profitable.\n\nChurches.\u2014The utmost religious liberty prevails everywhere in Canada, Churches of nearly all denominations exist and are in a flourishing condition, and where\na settlement is not large enough to support a regular church, there are always visiting clergymen to do the duty.\n\nSchools.\u2014Means of education, from the highest to the lowest, everywhere abound in the Dominion. The poor and middle classes can send their children to free schools, where excellent education is given; and the road to the colleges and higher education is open and easy for all. In no country in the world is good education more generally diffused than in Canada. It is on the separate school system, and receives not only a very considerable grant from the local government, but there are also two sections in each township set apart by the Dominion Government, the proceeds of which, when sold are applied to the support of schools. There is a superintendent to each section, and teachers are required to pass a rigid examination before they are appointed. A high class of education is there administered.\n\nMunicipal Government.\u2014There is a very perfect system of municipal government throughout the Dominion. The North-West country is divided into municipalities as fast as settlement progresses sufficiently to warrant it. These municipal organisations take charge of roads and road repairs\u2014there being no toll charges\u2014and regulate the local taxation of roads, for schools, and other purposes, so that every man directly votes for the taxes he pays; and all matters of a local nature are administered by the reeve and council, who are each year elected by the people of the district. This system of responsibility, from the municipal representative up to the General Government, causes everywhere a feeling of contentment and satisfaction, the people with truth believing that no system of government could give them greater freedom.\n\nLast Words of Settlers.\n\nThe last request made of settlers in the course of the enquiries dealt with in this pamphlet was that they would supply such information as they might \"deem desirable to place the Canadian North-West before the world in its true position as an agricultural country and a land suitable for successful settlement.\" Space will allow of the publication of but a very few here.\n\nC. H. Bonesteel, of Pheasant Plain, Kenlis, P. O., Assiniboia, N.W.T., says:\u2014\"I consider this country a grand field for emigration for all that are homeless and farmless, not only in the old country, but in Ontario. Why, I know of hundreds where I come from that are working for daily and monthly wages, who, if they only knew or could be persuaded what this country is, or the chances that there are here for them to get a home of their own, they would come at once. Even if they only took a homestead, 160 acres, which they get for 10 dollars (\u00a32), it would make them a good farm and home, which they can never hope to get where they are. This is my honest belief.\"\n\nMessrs. Campior Brothers, per R. E. Campior, who omit to forward their Manitoba address, says:\u2014\"This country is surer and safer for a man with either small or large capital, being less liable to flood and drought than any part of the Western States of America, speaking from experience. Intending settlers on landing should first know how to work and drive a team and stick to it, and they are bound to succeed.\"\nWILLIAM WAGNER, M.P.P., of Woodlands, Ossowa, Manitoba, writes:\u2014\"Very few inhabitants have visited Manitoba and North West as myself. I have seen the settler in his first year, and again after three and four years, and what a difference. The first year much misery, then again comfort. I have seen a good many English settlers in the first year; they are a great deal disappointed; but after they have been accustomed to our ways, they are happy and contented. We have in Woodlands about thirty English families, who had but little, and they belong to-day to our best of farmers, and with us we have never heard of any discontent.\"\n\nJAMES CONNERSON, of Minnewashta, Manitoba, writes thus:\u2014\"Keep back from whisky, contract no debts, sign no notes, stick hard at work for two years, and be up and at it. If one has no means, work out with a farmer for a time; pay as you go along. That is my humble advice to all intending settlers. I know hundreds of very decent people in Glasgow (Scotland), also in Holland, who would be thankful to come out here and get a homestead free.\"\n\nJAMES LITTLE, Postmaster, of Oak River, Manitoba, says:\u2014\"This is the best country in the world for settlers to come to; for instance, they can get their land for nearly nothing, and in three years be worth between 4,000 and 5,000 dollars (\u00a3800 to \u00a31,000) just in the rise of the price of the land; besides, he can raise all the stock he requires, perhaps the same amount or more. There is not much work to do, it can be done with machinery, and a man that is fond of sport can shoot all the fowl he wants, I can kill hundreds of all sorts of wild fowl here, geese, ducks, prairie chickens, snipe and wild turkeys in abundance.\n\nTHOMAS CARTER, of Woodlands, Manitoba, says:\u2014\"The Canadian North-West needs no vindication. It will soon be as well known to the world as is the Rock of Gibraltar. As for the cold, I have been more miserably cold on the heights of Shorncliffe, Kent (England), than I ever have been in the North-West. Of course a man may allow himself to freeze to death if he chooses, or if he is standing near a fire he may allow himself to burn if he chooses\u2014it's all a matter of taste.\"\n\nG. A. CAMERON, of Indian Head, N.W.T., writes\u2014\"As good a place as a man can find if he has plenty of money and brains, or if he has no money, but muscle and pluck. Send as many here as you can and they will bless you for it.\"\n\nWILLIAM TAYLOR, of Beulah, P.O., Man., says:\u2014\"Settlers should be used to labour with their hands without kid gloves, unless provided with ample means. The grumblers here are composed of men raised idle at home, who have not means to carry it out here. Labouring men and hired girls coming out with those that hire them do not want to be bound for any length of time, as wages rule much higher here than in the old countries.\"\n\nCHRISTIAN TROYER, of Sec. 22, T 2, R 2, W 2, Alameda, Assiniboia, N.W.T., says:\u2014\"I should advise intending settlers to encumber themselves as little as possible with extras, with the exception of clothing, and be cautious on their arrival to husband their resources. As I claim to be a successful north-wester I would be pleased and most happy to give advice and information to intending settlers free.\"\n\nJ. R. NIFF, of Moosonim, N.W.T., states:\u2014\"The fact that I settled shows that I had confidence in the country, and after two seasons' experience I am more than satisfied. As a grain growing country I believe, with proper cultivation and energy, it cannot be exceeded.\"\nGeorge Vandervoort, of Alexandria, Man., says:\u2014\"I consider Manitoba or the North-West is the proper place for a man to go to get a home with ease.\"\n\nGeorge H. Wood, of Birtle, Man., writes:\u2014\"Speaking from what I know as one of the leaders of one hundred and fifty in this locality, I don't know a single instance of a sober, industrious person who has not benefited by coming here, and I do know of many who always lived \"from hand to mouth\" in Ontario, who are getting rich. All we require is a railway to get on well, and all get rich. Farming pays here, the Farmers' Union grumblers to the contrary notwithstanding.\"\n\nS. W. Chambers, of Wattsview P.O., Man., writes thus:\u2014\"After more than five years' experience in this country, I am satisfied that no other country in the world can approach the Canadian North-West as a field for agricultural productions. And to the man who is willing to rough it first and to roll up his sleeves and work for two or three years, it offers a comfortable independence in a very few years, with very little capital expenditure.\"\n\nG. R. Black, of Wellwood, County Norfolk, Manitoba, says:\u2014\"This country is the best place for a man with a small capital to make a home that I have seen, and I have been through eight states of the United States, and I have seen nothing to compare to this Canadian North-West. I would advise settlers coming from Europe to bring nothing but clothes and bedding and light materials. I would say in explanation that I have raised as high as 40 bushels of wheat and 75 of oats, but that is not the rule.\"\n\nMr. A. R. Speers, of Griswold, Manitoba, writes:\u2014\"I consider this the greatest grain producing country in the world without any exception, and as I have handled considerable stock here I know that to pay well. Last spring I sold one stable of cattle for 100 dollars (\u00a320) per head for butchering. My sheep have paid well. Milch cows do very well, and also poultry, and in fact everything I have tried. No man need fear this country for producing anything except tropical fruit.\"\n\nMr. P. R. Todd, of Griswold, Manitoba, writes:\u2014\"I believe that any man who is willing to work, no matter how small his means, can improve his circumstances financially in this country, and there is a good chance for a man of means or large capital to run business on a large scale profitably.\"\n\nMr. W. H. Hayter, of Alameda, Assiniboia, N. W. T., writes:\u2014\"A single man can come here and farm on a small capital, say 500 dollars (\u00a3100). I have a family of six boys to start. We are well satisfied with the prospects ahead.\"\n\nMr. James Rawson, of Mountain City, Sec. 16, Township 2, R. 6, W., Manitoba, writes:\u2014\"Persons coming to this Province should have 500 dollars (\u00a3100) in cash to start with; not but what a person can get along with less, as I have done, but it is difficult. Magnificent country for persons who have plenty of money. Climate healthy, water good, plenty of game.\"\n\nMr. Thomas McGee, of Burnside, Manitoba, writes:\u2014\"I think that the Canadian North-West is well for industrious hard working people, either laborers, farmers or mechanics. I was a mechanic before I came here, and am satisfied that the country is a good one for people that want to make homes for themselves.\"\n\nMr. John Kemp, of Austin, Manitoba, writes:\u2014\"The soil is immensely rich, and will raise large crops for a long time without manure. I am a Canadian by birth, and have travelled over a good part of the States and Canada, and, all things considered, I have seen no part of America to equal this country for agricultural purposes.\"\nMr. Thomas L. Morton, of Gladstone, Manitoba, writes:\u2014\"My land is all brush, which I consider the best in the end, but more labor. I have twenty acres dark loam, sown with Timothy, red top and clover; 25 head of stock, and 50 acres of crop, which pays far better than 100 acres of crop. Pigs pay well. Native hops grow well.\"\n\nMr. Robert Campbell, Bridge Creek, P. O., Manitoba, writes:\u2014\"My opinion is that any man with, say, from 500 to 1,000 dollars (\u00a3100 to \u00a3200) and energy to go to work, will have no difficulty in making a comfortable home for himself and family.\"\n\nMr. John T. Cox, Box 44, Rapid City, Manitoba, writes:\u2014\"As an agricultural country it is a splendid one\u2014that is the crops must be put in early, and then they will do all right.\"\n\nMr. Duncan McDonell, Baie St. Paul, Manitoba, writes:\u2014\"The Canadian North-West, if once settled, will be and is the best agricultural country of all I have travelled through.\"\n\nMr. Joshua Elliott, of Sourisburg, Man., says:\u2014\"I consider this country the best in the world for all classes of farmers. For the capitalist, plenty of room and safe returns; and the man of limited capital, to secure a good home and be independent. I have given you a true statement of my own experience. You have my address above, and persons wanting information by sending a stamped envelope I will answer it, and give them the benefit of all my experience.\"\n\nMr. Samuel Day, Sec. 34, T. 13, R. 30, Fleming, N.W.T.\u2014\"I should like to see the emigration agents go more into the farming districts of England, and induce more farm laborers to come to this country. I would suggest Devonshire, as labor is plentiful there and wages low. I am afraid some of those city people will not make good settlers, and hence have a bad effect by writing home bad accounts. I am satisfied this is one of the best countries for an industrious man with energy.\"\n\nBolton, Ferris, of Calf Mountain, Manitoba, says:\u2014\"I firmly believe that this country has advantages over all others for growing grain and raising stock, and would advise all young men who have not made a start, and all tenant farmers with limited capital to come here.\"\n\nTestimony such as is contained in the foregoing pages could be produced indefinitely.
