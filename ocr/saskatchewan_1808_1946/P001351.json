On the following day the 90th Battalion was ordered to hold itself in readiness, and on Wednesday and Friday the regiment left in detachments for Troy, N.W.T., the Major-General Commanding accompanying the second detachment. The route taken by the regiment; on foot, was from Troy to Prince Albert 274 miles, passing through Fort Qu'Appelle, the Touchwood Hills, the Salt Plains, Humboldt, Clarke's Crossing on the South Saskatchewan, Fish Creek, Gabriel's Crossing, Batoche, crossing the Saskatchewan at Garrieppy Crossing, and reaching Prince Albert on the 19th May. The march from Fort Qu'Appelle to Clarke's Crossing on foot, a distance of 210 miles, was made in nine days and a half. At Fish Creek, April 24th, an engagement with the rebels took place, the regiment losing six killed and fourteen wounded. At Batoche, a four days battle was fought, May 9th to 12th, ending in the capture of the rebel stronghold. Here the regiment lost three killed, and nine wounded. A few days later, Riel was captured by some of the scouts.\n\nFrom Prince Albert, the battalion was ordered to proceed up the North Saskatchewan river by Steamer, passing Fort Carleton, and stopping at Battleford, where Poundmaker and his force surrendered. From Battleford the 90th went to Fort Pitt, June 3rd, where they were stationed for a month, during which time the chase after Big Bear took place, ending in his capture by the Mounted Police.\nOn July 3rd, the regiment received orders for home, going down the North Saskatchewan by steamer, passed Battleford, Carleton, Prince Albert, Fort \u00e0 la Corne, Cumberland House, Pas Mission, through Cedar Lake to Grand Rapids, there embarking in barges, and thence across Lake Winnipeg, up the Red River, disembarking at Selkirk, and arriving at Winnipeg on the 15th July. The total distance covered by the regiment was nearly 1800 miles. The strength leaving Winnipeg was 316, returning was 232, of which the difference 84 was made up in 55 killed and wounded in action or invalided, and 29 either granted leave or ordered off on escort or detachment duty.\n\nWhile stationed at Fort Pitt, some of the monotony of camp life was relieved by writing and rehearsing the following burlesque.\n**DRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6, WITH THE CAST.**\n\n**PRINCESS OPERA HOUSE, WINNIPEG, 1885.**\n\n| Character                                      | Actor          |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| The General                                    | Lieut.

It is with great pleasure indeed, that I see you have all your accoutrements clean, every buckle and strap polished, and your arms in perfect order. You must all remember that clean accoutrements, and a polished appearance are the first requisites of a good soldier. In the grand and noble profession of the soldier, which you have all for a time adopted, we none of us can expect to achieve much success, unless we pay particular attention to these small matters of detail. The fact that I stand before you today, in the position I occupy; having risen from the ranks as it were, should be an incentive to your ambition and should excite your emulation. I began from the humble duties of an officer's orderly, cleaning boots, spurs and such-like articles of a warrior's outfit. But from base sources have we come. In 1869, as probably you may know, I led the gallant and heroic charge of Kindersley. Last fall I conducted the campaign against the Apaches-Kawnee, who respected not the peaceable vocation of a missionary or the tender donation of a Ladies' Aid Society, and finally today I stand a Major General in Her Majesty's Service.\"\n\n(Turns to the front and advances to footlights, centre.)\n\n(Sings.)\n\n[Orchestra.]\n\nTHE GENERAL'S SONG.\n\nWritten by Serot.

All nature sighed with infinite joy and gladness; and the camp as seen, when it first broke upon the vision of your scribe, lay calmly at ease, on the banks of the mighty Saskatchewan, peacefully gentle, as the breath of a sleeping babe. I saw the General to-day, and he seemed much pleased to see me. I understand that his capability for recognizing true genius, when he sees it, is remarkable. I have already drawn his attention to several minor errors in his plan of the campaign, referring him to that great military work \"Writings On Campaigning,\" and also to the Memoirs of the Transport service. I will urge strongly on him the advisability of following up the Hoo-doo trail, to which I have already referred, in a former dispatch, and the military policy which is clearly shown in \"Letters to Friends,\" 5th Edition, page 320. The General, in my opinion, should have a supply of ammunition with him, but I neglected to assure him. Now that I have arrived at the scene of action, I may say, that I confidently feel that we will crush this rebellion.

On Saturday morning the engagement commenced with the Gatling and guns of 'A.' Battery opening fire\u2014the Grenadiers were extended in skirmishing order to the front, the 90th supporting and the Midland acting as a rear-guard. On Sunday the Grenadiers re-opened the attack, and yesterday the 90th took up their places, carrying the line of advance beyond the church. This morning there is a cessation of hostilities, and it is my intention to reconnoitre on my right front with all my mounted men, with a view of withdrawing as many men from my left attack, which is the key of the position.\"\n\n[GENERAL rises, exit R.

(Rising)\u2014I'll to the wire and make the columns of the great luminary in the East ring with news and sensation. I'll dwell in language dashing and pictorial on the possibility of Riel escaping all punishment through political influence, should we capture him. Ah, that is a case I'll revolve in this brain of mine, and then hurl it, dashing over the wire, to that musty, little, dirt-begrimed office called a sanctum; to be tantalized by the editor, mutilated by the typo, and slain by the proof-reader, until it blazes before the world with typographical errors and distortions without number. In the interval, while cogitating my synonyms, I'll roll me like a Mohican in my blanket. For though in times of peace I revel in war, yet no stray bullet shall lay low all that there is of J. Michael Cesar O'Flynn, 'Invincible in peace, and invisible in war.'\" (Rolls himself in his blanket again.)\n\n1st Soldier\u2014\"Say, Bob, suppose we capture Riel, and he should escape justice by means of political interference.\"\n\n2nd Soldier (excitedly.)\u2014Escape! No\u2014Never!! Shall Riel escape after all this? Boys, think of our dead and wounded at Fish Creek, and here at Batoche; of those lonely graves we left on the banks of that creak yonder. Think of the unburied dead and defenceless captives of Frog Lake and Fort Pitt and then ask\u2014shall Riel escape? No, political interference, no technicality of law, no trumped up plea of insanity, must stay the hand of Justice. Boys, for the sake of the mourning wives, sisters and mothers in our county, Riel shall not escape.\"\n\nChorus (refrain beginning R. and gradually taken up by all.)\u2014\n\nOh! love, dear love, be true, this heart is only thine,\nWhen the war is o'er, we'll part no more, at Ehren on the Rhine.\n\n[Orchestra.]\n\nEHREN ON THE RHINE:\n\nSung by Lieut. H. M. Arnold.\n\nA soldier stood in the village street, and bade his love adieu,\nHis gun and knapsack at his feet, his company in view.\nWith tears she kissed him once again, and turned away her head,\nHe could but whisper in his pain, and this is what he said:\n(Chorus.)\u2014Oh! love, dear love, be true, this heart is only thine,\nWhen the war is o'er, we'll part no more, at Ehren on the Rhine.\n\nThey went far away down the village street, the banners flapping gay,\nThe children cheered for the trapping feet that went so far away;\nAnd one among them turn'd him round to look but once again;\nAnd though his lips gave out no sound, his heart sighed this refrain:\n(Chorus.)\u2014Oh! love, dear love, etc.\n\nOn the battlefield, the pale cold moon is shedding her peaceful light;\nAnd is shining between a soul that soon will speed its eternal flight.\nAmid the dying the louder law, a comrade was close at hand,\nAnd he said: \"When I am far away, and you in our native land.\"\n\n(Chorus.)\u2014Oh! say to my love be true, he only, only mine,\nMy life is o'er, we'll part no more, at Ehren on the Rhine.\"\n\n[GENERAL and A.
