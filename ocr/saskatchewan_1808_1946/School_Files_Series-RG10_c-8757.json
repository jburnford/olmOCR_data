ONT.\n\nSir:-\n\nre Fire Equipment, Girls' Home, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nIn view of the recent serious loss by fire of our Old Sun School at Gleichen, Alberta, I made another careful survey of both these buildings from the point of view of fire risk and facilities for escape from the building. The result of this inspection prompts me to write and ask if the Department would sanction the purchase of the following supplies:\n\n2 - Guardene Fire Extinguishers, 2\u00bd gallon type.\n\n1 - only 30' Extension Fire Ladder.\n\n2 - Pyrene Fire Extinguishers, 1 gallon type.\n\nThere are only two extinguishers in this building and I feel that these are not sufficient. The ladder is needed, in order to approach and get into this building from the outside. Being a Girls' Home, you will clearly understand that we must keep this building tightly locked at night and, in the event of fire being observed from the outside of the building, a ladder of this type would enable us to get into the building from the outside and help in clearing the dormitories.\n\nThe Pyrene extinguishers are needed for the oil house, as the Guardene type are useless in fires breaking out amidst oil, gasoline or other inflammable substances.\n\nThis equipment, coupled with systematic and frequent fire drills, will make this building reasonably safe from loss of life in the event of fire.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nFEA:M\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI find that I have not yet acknowledged the receipt of your very kind letter of the 13th ult., giving an account of your visit to Alert Bay, and of your decision with regard to the site for the proposed new School at this centre. As we discussed during your recent visit to Winnipeg, various aspects of this question, further reference, I think, need not be made to them here. There was one point, however, to which I omitted to refer at that time, and that is with regard to the pupilage which the new School should have. I have recently received a letter from Mr. Anfield, the Principal, suggesting that it should have accommodation for 175 pupils, namely, 100 boys and 75 girls. It is not very clear to me how such accommodation could be provided without sacrificing the symmetry of the School building, and I am of the opinion, that it would be better to have a building with a capacity of 200 pupils. Mr. Anfield states that he has 100 applications waiting, and as there are 4,640 Anglicans in B.C., according to the Departmental Report for 1926, with only two residential Schools, namely, the one at Lytton, and this one at Alert Bay, it seems to me that accommodation should be provided for 200 pupils or more. As our General Secretary will probably call on you early next week, I shall be glad if you will further discuss this important matter with him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.O.\nOttawa, September 13, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Alert Bay Residential School in which he requests the following additional fire equipment for the girls' school:\n\n- 2 Gardene fire extinguishers, 2\u00bd Gal. type,\n- 1 only 30' extension fire ladder,\n- 2 Pyrene fire extinguishers, 1 gallon type.\n\nPlease visit this school at an early date and report to the Department what additional fire equipment you consider is required.\n\nOn the requisition forwarded for supplies for this school, the Principal requested 5 No. 3 single desks, also 2 rears and 2 fronts, to replace worn out desks in the girls' school. Please let me know if you consider these are necessary, and, if so, you should state the name of the manufacturer of the desks at present in the classroom.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nOttawa, September 13, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 12th, requesting additional fire equipment for the Alert Bay Girls' School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Agent Halliday is being written in connection with this matter and your request for additional desks.\n\nThe Department would appreciate if you would conform with the general practice of principals of Indian residential schools by forwarding all your requests to the Indian Agent, who will write to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. Earl Airfield, Esq.,\nPrincipal, Indian Res. School,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nSeptember 7th, 1928.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Pratt,\n\nWe will shortly be advertising for tenders for the Alert Bay Indian school building. Some time ago Mr. Neill, M.P., requested that when the advertisement is issued it be placed in the:\n\nComox Argus, ... Courtenay, B.C.,\nFree Press, ...\n\nWe think it should be inserted in Vancouver and Victoria papers, at least, in addition to the above. Would you kindly let me know what papers you would suggest for the advertisement?\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nCustomer Places Fifteenth Repeat Order\n\nThe above installation is typical of the 15 repeat orders placed with us by the United States Indian Service for a total of 18 ENGBERG Generating Sets and Engines.

(RG 10, Volume 6427, file 875-5, part 2)\nVancouver, B.C.\nAugust 29, 1928.\n\nSir: Re - Alert Bay Industrial School,\nWater Supply, Sewage Disposal\nand Fire Protection.\n\nIn compliance with your instructions\nof recent date, an investigation having refer-\nence to the suitability of the site, water supply\nand sewage disposal for the new industrial school\nat Alert Bay has been completed. I submit as\nfollows:-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe new school buildings at Alert Bay\nas proposed are similar to those recently com-\npleted at Lytton, with an accommodation of\napproximately 175 persons. The site selected is\nin close proximity to the present structures.\nThis selection was contingent on the finding of\nsuitable ground to bear the weight of the new\nbuilding.\n\nBUILDING SITE\n\nTests were carried out over the ground\nto be occupied by the new buildings.\n\nThe soil on the site was found to be\ngravel for the first four feet in depth. This\ngravel is very loose and unsuitable for footings.\nHowever, at a depth of four feet the gravel\nbecomes finer and it was at approximately this\ndepth that all tests were made.\nThe test pits were continued down to a maximum depth of 7\u00bd feet. The soil between 4 and 7\u00bd feet consisted of layers of fine and coarse gravel.\n\nTests were carried out as follows:- one at each of the four corners and two in the centre of the largest and heaviest portion of the building. These tests were made on bearing surfaces of 1 sq. ft. and 2.25 sq. ft at each hole. The log of the various holes is appended herewith as well as sketch showing location of the holes.\n\nA safe bearing load of 4 tons per square foot is indicated by these tests.\n\nHowever, as the weight of this building is not very great and the footings may be spread to carry a load of two tons per square foot without adding materially to the cost, I would recommend that this latter amount be not exceeded.\n\nWATER SYSTEM\n\nThe supply of water on the island on which the Alert Bay school is situated is derived entirely from wells.\n\nThe well at the school has been supplying a sufficient quantity of excellent water for a number of years.\n\nA test run of the pump showed a capacity of 10 gals. per minute for 13 hours without diminution of supply.\n\nThe system proposed for the new school is to consist of a pumping unit, reservoir and gravity pipe line.\nThe pumping unit is designed to deliver 20 to 25 gals. per minute and consists of a crude oil engine, belt connected to a deep well pump.\n\nThe reservoir, of reinforced concrete, is to have a capacity of 25,000 gals. and the pipe line, of cast iron pipe, a capacity of 480 gals. per minute. The excess capacity of reservoir and pipe line is to provide for fire protection purposes.\n\nUnder these conditions two fire streams of maximum capacity and pressure would be available for one hour. The cost of this system, including outside fire hydrants, would be $8320.00.\n\nRAIN WATER SYSTEM\n\nDue to the necessity of pumping water for all purposes a rain water storage system has been provided. This consists of a concrete storage tank of 6000 gals. capacity into which the leads from the roof are to empty. An automatic pumping system, to operate off the electric light plant, is provided to supply the laundry. The cost of this equipment would be $1452.00.\n\nSEWAGE\n\nAt the present time sewage is disposed of directly into the sea, not only from the school but also from the village of Alert Bay which stretches along the coast for a distance of two or three miles to the south of the school.\n\nStrong tidal currents prevail close inshore and carry all deposits away. There\nappears to be no reason why this method of disposal could not be continued as the provincial Department of Public Health is agreeable to such practice.\n\nHowever, the sewer system has been designed so that a septic tank may be added at any time without disturbing the present arrangement. The outfall of the sewer into the bay has been protected and it has been removed as far as practicable from the vicinity of the school.\n\nA separate outlet has been provided for the laundry and kitchen, as well as overflow from the rain water tank.\n\nManholes are provided at suitable locations for the clearing of obstructions.\n\nThe cost of the system as designed would be $1508.00; with the addition of a septic tank the cost would be $2960.00.\n\nDRAINS\n\nDrains have been provided for the low area to the rear of the school to prevent seepage into the new building. The cost of this would be $652.00.\n\nFIRE PROTECTION\n\nSufficient water is to be supplied for fire protection purposes. However, equipment for the proper application of this water is necessary if the fullest measures for fire prevention are to be provided. The equipment suggested is:- for outside, a hydrant cover with doors\nat each hydrant and each equipped with 150 feet of hose, nozzle and hose wrench; for inside, two hydrants on each floor of the main building, and one each on the two of the rear wing, equipped with hose hanger, 75 feet of hose and nozzle.\n\nThe cost of this equipment, exclusive of installation of water supply pipes within the building, would be $1142.50.\n\nPROVIDING ROAD FROM WHARF\n\nTo provide a road from the sawmill wharf to the school, several old, disused buildings would have to be disposed of. These are the property of the Coast Missionary Society, and, I believe, their permission could be readily obtained. The accompanying sketch of the location shows the buildings to be demolished. I believe that no question of compensation would arise. The cost of demolition and the necessary grading would amount to $450.00.\n\nHEATING\n\nHeating is provided in the old school buildings by a furnace and stoves. The cost of wood fuel has become very great and of coal the same may be said. Coal of approximately 10,000 B.T.U. is delivered at the beach for $11.50 per ton. I believe that there would be a saving in operation if fuel oil was used. This, however, would be contingent on the securing of a suitable gravity system capable of burning oil of a gravity of at least 28\u00b0 Baume.\nA suitable location for tanks well above the height of the boilers is immediately to the rear of the boiler room. Shelter could be provided and steam pipes run to the tanks. If, however, pressure tanks are necessary, the motor feed type burner would be preferable as it would burn an oil of a lower gravity and consequently cheaper.\n\nADDITIONAL WORK TO BE INCLUDED IN SPECIFICATIONS FOR NEW SCHOOL\n\nWhile there are some details in connection with the construction of the new plant at Alert Bay upon which I have not been asked to report, I should perhaps point out that these details are not included in the specifications for Lytton school. Among these are: the supply of water and light to the new barn to be erected, and the installation of inside pipe lines for fire purposes. I presume, however, that these details will be included in the new specifications and I have accordingly shown them on the attached plan.\n\nThe water supply system for the laundry should be provided with a shut off from the main domestic supply and outlets provided for connecting up the automatic pump from the rain water system.\nIn respect to disposal of the excavated material from the school site, it is suggested that the surface soil for a depth of at most one foot be placed immediately to the front of the new building. The remainder should be disposed of along the foreshore immediately adjoining the playground.\n\nThe foregoing is respectfully submitted for your consideration.\n\nAttached hereto are plans of work proposed and additional information on tests carried out respecting stability of ground for school site.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Engineer at Vancouver, at the request of Dr. Scott, on the proposed building site and water and sewage systems for the new industrial school at Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nMr. Webb states that the report has been prepared with considerable haste and that it has not been possible to have it checked in detail without considerably delaying its transmission; he is satisfied, however, that Mr. Warren, who prepared the report, has given the conditions careful and serious consideration.\n\nThe estimated cost of the water supply and sewage systems without a septic tank amounts to $14,855. It does not appear under the circumstances that a septic tank is necessary at the present time.\n\nMr. Webb states that the matter of sewage disposal was fully discussed with Dr. Young, in charge of the provincial Department of Health, and the latter is quite agreeable that the installation should be built without a septic tank, with the understanding that provision be made for installing a tank in the future should it be found necessary. This is provided for in the report and the additional cost of a septic tank is estimated at about $1450.\n\nI shall be glad to have your further instructions with regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nMr. J. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nRe Alert Bay School.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI received from Mr. Webb a copy of Engineer Warren's report with regard to the suitability of the foundation on the lower level. A copy of this report has also been forwarded to Mr. Johnston, of the Dominion Water Power Branch, which, no doubt, you will receive in due course.\n\nIt is noted on Mr. Warren's big sketch he has made a location for the proposed barn. Mr. Webb, however, deems it important that this barn should be further removed to the North away from the water supply, and I fully concur with him in this suggestion. I do not suppose, however, that the barn will be built until after the School has been constructed and the exact point may be determined later.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nDr. Duncan G. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSept. 27, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th inst., addressed to the Deputy Superintendent General, and in reply to say that a copy of Mr. Warren's report has been received here. It is not the intention to build a barn this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLennan,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E.

They had run it without water and when they turned the water on it cracked the head so that it was leaking when it came in.\n\nIt was a case that had to be dealt with immediately so I instructed the Principal to wire to the B.C.Equipment Company and get a new head, and that I would recommend it and the Department would pay for it.\n\nOf course it was their carelessness in the first place to allow this head to get broken and really the Missionary Society should be responsible, but where approximately ninety people are to be supplied with water it was absolutely necessary that it should be done immediately and the voucher is enclosed for your consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.Halliday\nIndian Agent\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\nDept.

(RG 10, Volume 6427, file 875-5, part 2)\nOffice of the Kwanakewlth Indian Agency,\n\nSeptember 27th, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 112, amounting to $100.00 in favour of Alert Bay Saw Mills, Alert Bay, B.C., for lumber for general training at Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental.\n\nLetter No. 156-0-5 dated September 12, 1928.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101.\nReplying to your letter of September 13th, I have given very carefully into the matter of fire extinguishers and desks necessary to keep up the equipment for the Alert Bay Residential Schools.\n\nThere is a new kind of fire equipment called the \"Shar-stop\" manufactured by the International Fire Equipment Corporation, West New Brighton, Staten Island, New York, which consists of thin glass shaped somewhat like a pear and contains pink fluid. They contain each probably one pint of fluid and the result with their use is marvellous, particularly where gasoline or oil is the cause of the fire.\n\nAn experiment was made in Vancouver harbor with one of these when a gallon of gasoline was thrown into the engine room of a boat and a match thrown in and allowed to get a good hold on it and in less than a half a minute all vestige of a fire was gone. I do not know the prices nor who sells these fire extinguishers, but I think the cost is about $7.00 or $7.50 each. If authority is given I could order them through a wholesale dealer in Vancouver, and I would recommend that five be purchased, two each for the Girls' School and the Boys' School and one for the pump house.\n\nWith regard to the other fire extinguishers mentioned, I took up the matter with the principal and I understand that this equipment as suggested would quite fill the requirements.\n\nWith regard to desks, the last desks purchased were from the Tait Pipe & Foundry Company, Limited.\nand called the \"CROWN DESK\". After going into the matter thoroughly I would recommend that 2 complete desks for single pupils be purchased, No. 1 size, and one back No. 1. One front, No. 2. One complete desk No. 2, and 3 backs No. 3.\n\nThe last purchase was made from the Tait Pipe & Foundry Company in Vancouver, in November, 1927.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nWMH, S\nOttawa, October 11, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the fire equipment and extra desks required for the use of the Alert Bay Residential Schools.\n\nWith reference to the fire extinguishers, I beg to say that we are placing an order with the Pyrene Mfg. Co. of Canada, Ltd., Toronto, to forward, addressed to you, the following:\n\n4 - 5 Gal. Pump Tank Extinguishers, complete with non-freeze chemicals.\n4 - 1\u00bd Quart Pyrene Extinguishers,\n\nThe above firm have been requested to make early shipment, and to forward their account, in triplicate, to you. When these extinguishers arrive, you should certify the account and forward same, in duplicate, to the Department.\n\nThis is the type of extinguisher we are now supplying to Indian residential schools, and I enclose for the information of the Principal and yourself copies of the pamphlet showing the characteristics of these extinguishers and the use to which they are to be applied. The 1\u00bd quart size is excellent for use where there is danger of fire from oils, greases and electrical machinery. The pump tank extinguishers should be distributed at strategic points throughout the building.\n\nIt is noted that the Principal requested that one only 30' extension ladder be supplied for the Girls' Home. Please state whether you consider that this equipment is necessary, and, if so, where it could be obtained and the cost of same.\n\nRelative to the extra desks required, I beg to say that you may place an order with the Tait Pipe & Foundry Co., Vancouver, for the supplying of the following:\n\n3 No. 1 Single Desks,\n1 No. 1 Rear,\n1 No. 2 Front,\n\n1 No. 3 Single Desk,\n3 No. 3 Rears.\n\nYou should obtain a price from this firm F.O.B.

Sir:\n\nThe Department has received the enclosed account for material supplied in repairing the engine used to pump water at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. In forwarding this account, the Agent states as follows:\n\n\"The Principal reported to me recently that the pump would not work and on investigation it was discovered that it was the engine that was the cause of the difficulty. They had run it without water and when they turned the water on it cracked the head so that it was leaking when it came in.\"\n\nAs it would appear that the pump was broken through carelessness on the part of the staff, it is considered that the Department should not be called upon to pay for the repairs, which should be a charge against the per capita earnings or other receipts of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The capacity of the plant is limited by the kiln to four hundred thousand brick per month, or an equivalent of tile.\n\nThe material used is shale. The plant has been in operation since 1912, and many structures for public and private use have been erected with our brick in the cities of Victoria, Vancouver, Nanaimo and the surrounding territory. We verify believe that our brick and tile made of shale, and carefully burned in our special kilns are much superior to the ordinary clay product. We have never had any complaints against our brick. A considerable number of important buildings in Victoria have used our brick for finishing resulting in good red pressed brick finish.\n\nWe are sending you, by express, samples of the dry press brick and of the Barr-Lock tile. This tile is patented by a Victoria man, and we have the exclusive right to manufacture it in this territory. If it should be desired to finish the building with the rough faced brick, usually called tapestry pattern, we could supply them.\n\nWe respectfully request that you submit the samples to the Architect of the Department, and have the specifications allow the use of our brick and tile in the said building.\n\nOur plant is situated much closer to Alert Bay than any other in British Columbia. It is on the waterfront, so that scows or barges are placed immediately in front of the kiln, thus making it possible to load and convey the brick and tile by barge to site of the proposed building at the minimum cost.\nHoping that we are yet in time for our products to receive proper consideration, we beg to remain,\n\nYours very truly,\nGABRIOLA SHALE PRODUCTS LTD.\n\nPer: J.O.

DIA.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th inst. #156-0-5 embodying a statement from the Indian Agent at Alert Bay relative to the difficulty in operating the pump at that School and stating that the difficulty was due to engine trouble, the engine having been run without water, \"and when they turned the water on it cracked the head so that it was leaking when it came in\".\n\nA copy of your letter was forwarded to the Principal with a request that he should furnish an explanation as to the cause of the difficulty, and I enclose herewith for your information a copy of his reply.\n\nIn a further letter from Mr. Anfield, dated Oct.24, he writes with regard to this subject, in part, as follows:-\n\n\"With further reference to my letter of the 22nd, dealing with the pumping situation here, I have to advise you that I paid a call on Mr. Halliday, the local Indian Agent, today and had a long talk with him about the whole matter. To sum it up, he took back his statement about the trouble being caused by running the engine without water, but as to whether he will so notify the Department, I do not know. I assured Mr. Halliday that I was most anxious to work with him and he promised me his support and help. In fact he was very nice, and seemed to feel that perhaps he had been at fault in not helping us more. It would be a good thing to forward my letter or a copy of it to the Department, but it might be wise to withhold the last page as I have no desire whatever to make any trouble for the gentleman in question.\"\nFrom the information set forth above it seems to me to be quite clear that the difficulty with the pump and engine was not due to any carelessness on the part of the School Management, but rather to the fact that the engine which passed through the fire when the pump-house was burned down, was patched up and made to continue in service instead of being replaced by a new one. It had already been in service for five years, but despite the request of the School Management for a new engine at the time, the Indian Agent insisted on having the old one repaired, and it has been giving trouble ever since.\n\nI am returning the bills for your further consideration and trust that you may agree to a prompt settlement of the same.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nTo,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian and Eskimo Commission, M.S.C.C.,\nThe Bible House, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRef. yours of the 15th instant dealing with the Dept.'s 156-0-5 of the 11th October, addressed to you, and enclosing an account of $21.80 plus 55\u00a2 freight, on goods ex B.C. Equipment Co., Vancouver. I am compelled to take exception to the statement made by the Indian Agent in forwarding this account to the Department. It might be best at this time to submit a full report on the whole pumping situation.\n\nImmediately after my arrival here it was found necessary to install a new foot-valve in the pump at this school. This was purchased and installed by the order of the Indian Agent, and I purposely refrained from having anything to do with it. I should say, however, that the pump sent up by the Marshall-Wells Co. was equipped with a foot-valve which came attached to the pump itself. Apparently the persons installing this equipment were unaware that this foot-valve was to be disconnected and inserted in the bottom of the pumping cylinder, as the mechanic who made the repairs manufactured a foot valve on the half-ball type, enclosed in a cage also made locally. This was installed and for a while all went well, although the pump never worked at the capacity intended. Then came the fire and the subsequent repairs made to both pump and engine. I should mention that when the fire took place, the top rods of the plunger were burnt to ashes, and the whole plunger fell to the bottom of the barrel, and quite conceivably caused damage to the cage containing the foot-valve. Previous to this I should also mention the trouble we had had with the engine, due to the absence on it of an automatic lubricator. After some delay authority was granted by the Department for the purchase of a Madison-Kipp type of lubricator, but less than a month after installation, the pump house was burned to the ground, necessitating the purchase of a new one after repairs had been made to the engine.\n\nFrom this time on, we have had serious trouble with the pump, which would stick on the up stroke and jam the engine. This to my mind indicated one of two things, either trouble with the pump itself, or an obstruction in the pipe line. I consulted experts, including the local machinists, Fairbanks-Morse Co. who made the pump, and finally Mr.\nC.W. Warren, hydraulic engineer for the Dom. Water Power Branch of the Dept. of the Interior. They were all of the opinion that it was an obstruction of the line, but all stated emphatically that the reduction system on the pipe line caused a lot of needless pressure. I then applied to the Indian Agent for permission and help in taking up the line, and was turned down as far as the help was concerned. So I proceeded with the help of the boys in digging up the line and taking up the pipe, and found nothing. At this stage we were in a serious state, as it was quite impossible to even get the tank half full, and were compelled to keep someone in the pump house while the engine and pump were running. Only a negligible quantity of water was going into the tank, yet the whole system was under terrific pressure, ranging at times as high as 150-200 lb. taken on a gauge. I became convinced that the foot valve was the trouble and that it must somehow or other have become locked, and that the back pressure on the line trying to work against the pump which was working against a near vacuum in the pump cylinder was causing the pressure. I proceeded to the Indian Agent's office and informed him of the situation and also that the schools had been without adequate water supply for some weeks at least, and he authorised the taking out of the whole pump, and himself went down to the mechanic and told him about the job to be done. He also authorised the overhauling of the engine, which due to the terrific pressure on the pump, had had its bearings worn down to the danger point. I should also state that the pressure on the engine had caused it to overheat tremendously in the head and this in my opinion caused the leaking which was apparent prior to the taking down of the engine at all.\n\nThe pump was taken out and it was found that the guides holding the cage into place had been either cut or worn off, resulting in the foot valve becoming loose and both cage and foot valve must have been riding up into the barrel of the pump proper. What happened when they came down with the stroke of the pump, I do not know, but I imagine that at times they must have jammed and finally become completely stuck. The old footvalve and cage were removed and are in my possession now, and the bent and twisted condition of the guides is indicative to me that some great weight must have fallen on them, thus bearing out my theory that when the pump fell in during the fire, that the plunger struck the valve with sufficient force either to break off or seriously weaken the guides holding the cage in place, because the trouble started then and has continued ever since.\n\nThe engine was removed bodily to the machine shop and thoroughly over-\nhauled. Due to a shortage of help and pressure of work, the mechanic could only put one man on the job, and so, on account of the schools having been without water for some days, I worked myself for sixteen hours on the engine without a stop, and we had it installed that night. The engine was set up with the head complete, the water connections made and the water turned on. Then the engine was started but it refused to work, although we used several starters on it. I thought perhaps that it was the gasket at fault and that water was running into the cylinder, and as it was then midnight, I took the boys down to bed, after turning off the water into the cylinder. The next morning, Sunday, I sent for the mechanic who came up and tried for an hour to start it. Then we removed the head and re-set the gasket. In order to seal the gasket, the mechanic started the engine without turning in the water, and it started right off, and as soon as it was running, the water was turned in and the engine stopped, thus proving that there was a leak in the head prior to this action. Mr. Halliday, the Indian Agent, was present when this took place. I think that any engineer will admit that it is not dangerous to start an engine and immediately turn in the water, thus rendering easy the starting of an engine in cold weather. In fact Mr. Halliday informed me himself in his office that he does the same thing with his boat engine. We then borrowed a head from the Sawmill engine and ran with it until the new one, authorised by Mr. Halliday for purchase, after I had been down to see him and taken the old head with me, arrived on the S.S. Louise the following day. The engine now runs well, and the pump works perfectly, and I should inform you that we only have to pump for three or four hours at the most, three times a week, whereas prior to this overhauling, we pumped for as long as fourteen hours a day and got but little for our trouble.\n\nThese are the facts of the case, and whilst this report is lengthy, it is necessarily so, as I want both you and the Department to realise why we have been up against the equipment since the fire of a year ago. Mr. Halliday's statement is a grave misstatement of fact, and how he can say that the pump would not work because the engine was giving trouble, I fail to see. Never once, and I have the word of the engineer and the boy who has charge of the engine, has this engine been run without the water being turned in, outside of the one time when it was done by the mechanic in question who was apparently doing it intentionally to find out if it was water that was causing the trouble with starting. In any case this man was working for the Indian Agent who had given authority for the work to be done.\nIn conclusion I must inform you that I am in receipt of a letter from the Department asking me to place all matters pertaining to the School through the local agent. They are quite right, and I recognise to the full the justice of their request, and I am afraid that I have been rather stern in their flesh of late. However in face of such statements as this, you will realise how difficult it is for me to administer these schools with such help as I receive from Mr. Halliday. I have tried repeatedly to work with him, but when he writes back to me that he will not even pass my suggestions on to the Department for consideration, it is small wonder that I try to approach them in other ways.\n\nWhen I wrote to him about the truck provided by the Department, he informed me that he would not send in the request to Ottawa for their consideration, and if I had not have taken it up with you, we would not have got the truck, which has paid for itself already in work performed. I have always been willing and am yet to work through Mr. Halliday, and will go the limit to meet the wishes of the Department in this respect, but though I regret to say it, if we only had what Mr. Halliday has got for the school, we would have mighty little. There is a big work to be done here and it has not been developed as it should have been, due to lack of financial help in the past. Now, with the advent of the new and enlarged school, wants have become necessities, and the money involved has been considerable. Let me assure you that I will do my best, though if you feel that I am at fault in the matter of co-operation as far as Mr. Halliday is concerned, I am willing to step aside and let someone else try.\n\nTrusting that this will convey fully the whole situation,\n\nBelieve me, most sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOctober 17, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Anfield,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant with which you furnished a sketch of what you consider should be the lay-out of the barn and hog house for the new school at Alert Bay. While it is a little early to consider matters pertaining to the out-buildings, I may say that the sketch which you sent conforms generally with the plans of other such buildings which the Department has erected in the past at other schools. I note you want provision made for twenty cows, but I may say that with the small amount of land which will be available for pasturage and hay-growing at Alert Bay, I can not see how you can possibly take care of a herd of that size. Surely they will supply more than enough milk for the School. Twelve animals, to my mind, would be sufficient. I, however, will send your sketch on to our Architect at Ottawa.\n\nWith regard to the temporary school room now in use, I may say that the plans and specifications deal only with the main building and no mention is made about moving this building or the cottage. This work, no doubt, will be attended to by the contractor as an extra, after a price has been submitted through the Inspector of Works who will be in communication with the Department as the work progresses. The most important thing at the present time is to get the main buildings under construction as early as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nRev. Earl Anfield,\nPrincipal, Alert Bay Indian Residential School,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nMISSIONARY SOCIETY OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND IN CANADA.\n\nIndian Residential School,\nAlert Bay, B.C. Oct. 10th, 1928.\n\nTo W.E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 666, Victoria, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn:\n\nWhilst realizing that it is hardly my province, I enclose herewith a sketch of what we consider to be the most suitable layout for a barn and hog house for this school, bearing in mind future requirements rather than the immediate present. I leave the matter entirely in your hands, however, realizing your greater experience in these matters.\n\nI have received the plans and specifications for the new school from the Department in Ottawa, and wish to thank you most sincerely for your kindly efforts which has now brought our hopes for a building to fruition. My only hope is that an early start will be made on construction before the really bad weather of the winter sets in.\n\nMr. Halliday and I had a talk on the proposed site of the barn, and we are both, I think, of the opinion that there will be no detrimental advantages to the pump house and water supply due to its proximity.\n\nMight I have your views on the following:- I notice in the location plan sent with the plans of the building that the temporary schoolroom is shown as moved into its new location. This plan also shows the building as equipped with steam and electric light. Are the contractors to figure in the moving and plumbing of this building in their estimate? Are they also to figure the moving of the cottage which will right on the front steps of the new building? I would appreciate your views on these matters.\n\nWith kind regards and best wishes,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) F. Earl Anfield,\nPrincipal.\nRe--Alert Bay School.\n\nDear Mr.Orr,-\n\nI am attaching hereto for your information a copy of a letter I have received from Rev.Earl Anfield, Principal of the Alert Bay School, with which he submits a sketch of a proposed lay-out of the barn and hog house. A copy of my letter to Mr.Anfield is also attached for your information.\n\nThe plan which Mr.Anfield refers to is that gotten up by the engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch showing the site of the new building, and you will note that it indicates that steam heating and electric light system are to be carried to the temporary class room which will be moved to the rear of the new main building. It may be that this is the engineer's idea, though probably Dr.Scott authorized him to make this provision. You might consult the Deputy Minister on this point.\n\nAs regards the size of the barn, it will be noted that Mr.Anfield wants provision made for the housing of twenty cows, which, I feel, are too many, taking into consideration the amount of land there is for growing and hay-growing purposes at Alert Bay. It is all bush with the exception of about twenty-five acres cleared and now in clover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosures:\n\nH.

Whilst in town I had a long chat with Mr. Webb, the Chief Engineer of the Water Power Branch of the Dept.; of the Interior, whose Dept. handled the report on the water and sewage systems for the new school here. Mr. Webb assured me that the new plant would be well and safely handled by the outfall system recommended, but that should a situation arise that would demand the installation of the septic tank system, that provision is being made in the plans for such a system to be installed without interference with the building at all. I feel that it would be best to leave this matter as it stands now and abide by the expert advice in possession of the Department.\n\n3. Heating plant. The plant installed in the Lytton school is a 6 and 3 K.W. Lister-Bruston Automatic gas plant. I understood from Mr. Lett that the plant was ample for the requirements of the school there, where the plan provides no power at all outside of lighting. The situation here should be carefully watched as the engineer's report and location plans show that the same plant in addition to lighting the building, is to have lines run to the proposed new barn up the hill, and in addition is to provide power for pumping purposes, both for the main and auxiliary systems. This is a considerable load to put on a plant of this type, and although the Department will doubtless consult expert opinion, we should make it our business to see that adequate power is provided for all the requirements of the new institution.\n\n4. Refrigeration plant. A large ammonia plant is installed in the Lytton building, which is to be used as a main supply refrigerator and also as a kitchen refrigerator. This means that the refrigerator is opened and closed many times during the day and if large pieces of meat are to be stored there safely, the operating costs of keeping this refrigerator going are going to be high. It should also be borne in mind that the door of the refrigerator is only a stone's throw from the kitchen range. When the time comes, it might be wise to suggest that the main refrigerator be placed elsewhere and kept only for storage of meat, and a small type such as the \"Frigidaire\" be placed right in the kitchen and hooked on to the power plant, for it is apparent that a plant will be needed here capable of providing power for several purposes.\n\n5. Alterations in plans. I enclose sketches of alterations desired. In connection with the kitchen corridor, as far I can see, this corridor is not needed and if taken out would enlarge the kitchen and the staff dining-room, both of which are too small, especially the latter. This would undoubtedly save money as two walls and two doors less would be needed. My purpose in asking for the door at the other end of kitchen to be moved is that it is too near the range which will not fit in if this door is left as at present shown on the plan.\nDouble doors are required at both ends of corridor on main floor as the children undress for bed in the basements and proceed upstairs in their night attire, and with no doors at either end it is liable to lead to trouble. There should also be a door on the left end of the corridor on the second floor as it means that any boys proceeding to the infirmary would have direct vision into the Girls' dormitories. Little changes like this involving but little money will mean all the difference as far as supervision is concerned.\n\nJust whether or not this is the right time to bring these matters before the Department I leave to you, though I feel that it might be better to hold off until the contract is let and an inspector of works is on the job.\n\nMost sincerely yours,\n\nF.

My understanding is that this school is being modelled after the one recently built at Lytton, B.C., but as I have not been furnished with any blue print copy of the plans, I am unable to offer any comment with regard to the alterations suggested by Mr. Anfield. It seems to me, however, that the changing of the girls' wing to the opposite end of the building from that which it occupies at the Lytton School, must carry with it the changes which Mr. Anfield indicates in the enclosed letter. I commend the suggestions which Mr. Anfield has made to your careful consideration, and remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nTo,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian and Eskimo Commission, M.S.C.C.,\nThe Bible House, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nIn connection with the proposed new building to be erected by the Department of Indian Affairs at this centre during the coming winter, I am venturing to bring to your attention certain suggestions that I feel might aid the Department in erecting a building which will enable the Commission to administer it with a minimum of inconvenience, and which will in addition possibly save the Department some money in extras. I should say that I have but recently returned from a visit to Lytton where in conjunction with the Principal, I went over the building recently built there by the Department; a replica of which building is to be erected here. It is a magnificent institution and well worthy of the Department that built it. However, there are certain circumstances at Alert Bay that are totally different from those existing at Lytton, and a few changes might be helpful.\n\n1. Reversal of plans. On his recent visit to Alert Bay, I asked Dr. Scott if it would be possible to have the plan reversed, and he assented. This would necessitate the removal of the Principal's residence to the right of the plan, and the boys' and girls' sides would also change. This will leave the boys and girls on the same side as they are here now in the two separate schools. Such action is absolutely necessary on account of the placement of woodsheds, and the layout of the farm, etc. On talking this matter over with Commissioner Ditchburn in Victoria this past week, he seemed to be of the impression that the reversal would only mean the changing of the residence and then automatically making the right wing into a girls' wing and the left for the boys. It should be clearly understood before work commences that the reversal of the plan must be complete, including the reversal of the laundry and boiler rooms. In fact the plan should be read in its entirety as a left hand plan. If for example the laundry were to be left as at present shown, it would mean an acute disciplinary problem, as the girls would be working on the same side as the boys' wing, and the same would apply to the kitchen, whilst the boys who would be working in the boiler room would then have access to the girls' wing. The upper floors, especially the ground floor would have to change to suit the plumbing arrangements of the basement. This matter should be most carefully watched or we are going to have an appalling time with supervision in the new building.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 3rd NOVEMBER 1928.\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a Report, dated 2nd November, 1928, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, submitting that the same being necessary, tenders were called for the new Alert Bay Indian Residential School, at Alert Bay in the Kawakewlth Indian Agency, in the Province of British Columbia, and that the following tenders were received:\n\nA.

Scott,  \nDeputy Superintendent General,  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs,  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: 4 Story Residential School.\n\nWe have been informed through the United States Department of Commerce that you are receiving tenders for the erection of a 4 story residential school at Alert Bay, B. C.\n\nWe are very anxious to bring to your attention, in connection with this project, the outstanding superior merits of two types of ceramic tiles made in the United States which are especially adapted to places where extremely hard floors and walls; where attractive colorings in the floors and walls; and where easily cleaned and sanitary surfaces are demanded.\n\nOne of these is the line of Romany Tiles made by the United States Quarry Tile Company. The various colors and sizes in which these tiles are made, together with a brief description, will be found on the attached sheet under the heading of \"Romany Quarry Tiles\". The other is the Spartan Ceramic Tiles which are described on the attached page under the heading of \"Spartan Ceramic Tiles\".\n\nWe are pleased to refer you to W. T. McArthur Ltd., 1012 Granville Street, Vancouver, B. C. who are handling our tiles, for more detailed information and prices of tile delivered in British Columbia - or if you prefer we shall be pleased to quote you from this office if you will let us have blueprints or sketches of the spaces to be covered with tiles.\n\nOur tiles are most suitable for use in corridors and halls of schools where attractiveness and durability are of equal importance, and are most appropriate for use in dining rooms and kitchens where cleanliness is the main feature.\n\nWe shall be pleased to send you samples of our tiles and any further information which you may desire.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRGF:MW\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6427, file 875-5, part 2)\nUNITED STATES QUARRY TILE CO.\n\nMANUFACTURERS OF\n\nQUARRY TILES FOR FLOORS AND WALLS\n\nMEMBER, ASSOCIATED TILE MANUFACTURERS\n\nFACTORIES:\nPARKERSBURG, W. VA., EAST SPARTA, O.\n\nROMANY QUARRY TILES\n\nThese tiles are made of \"Shale Clay\" - which is a form of natural stone ground to a fine, carefully screened powder; mixed with water; formed and burned extremely hard. They have an unglazed, but very pleasing surface that is free from blisters, cracks and other imperfections and which is very easily cleaned. They are vitreous (glass-like) throughout and do not absorb water, oil, grease or stains of any kind - which insure their permanent good appearance.\n\nROMANY RED TILES have long been the standard Quarry Tiles used in the United States. They are known for their superior hardness, and are extremely durable, retaining their good appearance permanently, even under the most severe service. These are very commonly used on floors and walls of office buildings, stores, theatres, schools, railway stations, automobile show rooms, hospitals and other public buildings where other tiles break, chip or become discolored from dirt and stains. These are made in sizes 2 1/8\" x 2 1/8\" to 12\" x 12\", with all the necessary pieces for trim.\n\nROMANY BROWN & GREY TILES are suitable for the same uses where their own colors are desired, or in combination with the Romany Red Tiles for borders or ornamental designs. They are equally hard, vitreous and beautiful in appearance, but are made only in sizes from 2 1/8\" x 2 1/8\" to 6\" x 6\", together with trim pieces.\n\nROMANY RAINBOW TILES are very beautiful in their full range of colors. As can be quickly seen on the inside page of this folder, their colors range from the dark russet through the salmon and tan shades to a very delicate green, and when laid present a medley of golden shades. These beautiful tiles will make floors and walls which will never discolor with age or change their appearance under the most severe service. They are popular in the United States for use in halls and plazas of private homes, lobbies, hotels, dining rooms, restaurants, churches and other public buildings where marble adds a too formal or severe atmosphere to the surroundings. They are made in the same sizes as the Romany Brown and Grey Tiles.\n\nROMANY REDFLASH TILES are made in all of the shapes listed on our price list and shown in the accompanying illustrations. They range in shade from our dark red colors to steel blue which is obtained by \"Flashing\" the red and brown tiles in the process of manufacture. These tiles are appropriate where very rich, dark floors of extremely hard texture and variegated tints which do not easily show dust or marks of foot prints are desired. They can also be used with very attractive effects in combination with our Romany Rainbow Tiles, either as borders or mixed at random through the floor. They are just as suitable for use in private homes, hotels, restaurants and churches as the Rainbow Tiles, but produce a more subdued and darker effects.\n\nPrinted in U. S. A.\nReprinted for your personal attention on the opposite page is an advertisement of Romany Tiles which will appear in the following publications:\n\nHouse Beautiful - July issue\nArchitectural Forum - July issue\n\nNew Improvements\n\n1. Recent improvements in manufacturing methods make it possible to furnish Romany Improved Tiles, square and true, even more accurately sized than the tile we have heretofore supplied. With these tiles \"trim-jointing\" may be avoided, adding beauty to the appearance of the tiled surface.\n\n2. To the list of colors already available has been added Romany Reddish\u2014variegated tiles ranging in color from deep reds to rich brown and gunmetal.\n\n3. Elongated Hexagon Tiles, formerly furnished only in Romany Rainbow are now also supplied in Red, Brown, Gray and Reddish so that even more beautiful effects may now be obtained.\n\nA bath done in colorful Romany Rainbow Tiles provides the utmost in comfort, style, durability and sanitary qualities. It immediately stamps the house with a modern touch and provides a warmth of color which effectively dispels the chilly feeling so often associated with the old-fashioned bath.\n\nRomany Tile are an American Product\n\nROMANY TILES\n\nManufactured by\nUNITED STATES QUARRY TILE COMPANY\nPARKERSBURG, W.

The idea of the \"R.O.\" child spends most of their waking hours in school and the impressions they gain of appropriate and comfortable surroundings are as important in after life as the information they glean from books.\n\nElements which contribute to attractiveness, cleanliness and sanitation are important not only from the standpoint of their present health and aptitude, but for development of their future standards of living and their ambition to obtain the better things in life for themselves and families.\n\nThere is no doubt but that this factor has been the outstanding reason for our present expenditure of four times as much per school building as was spent ten years ago.\n\nThe use of pleasingly attractive materials for the interior decoration of the modern school building is in line with the present trend toward making schools inspiring, homelike and comfortable.\n\nWhere appearance, durability and low cost are equally important considerations, Romany Quarry Tiles stand alone among desirable floor and wall surfacing materials for school building uses.\n\nRomany Reds \u2022 Romany Greys \u2022 Romany Browns \u2022 Romany Rainbows\n\nROMANY QUARRY TILES\nTHE warm tones of Romany Rainbow Tiles are most appreciated when blended in random, airy effects.\n\nUNITED STATES QUARRY TILE CO.\nParkersburg, West Virginia\n\nROMANY QUARRY TILES are an American product.\n\nField Pattern No. 1500\nA Pattern Service\nWhich Is Yours For The Asking\n\nYour local Romany Quarry Tile dealer or the nearest direct representative listed below will be glad to show you the beautiful and attractive designs which may be worked out with Romany Quarry Tiles.

These tiles can be laid in a large number of designs for both body and border, all of which are pictured in the Spartan Ceramic Catalogue. They are mounted upon heavy paper in sheets 12\" x 24\", which makes them very easily laid.\n\nSPARTAN \"GOLDEN PHEASANT\" TILES are especially recommended for bathrooms, halls, porches and plazas of private homes, for floors and walls of toilets in public buildings, for corridors of office buildings, for floors of stores, banks, automobile showrooms, restaurants, and many other places where an attractively beautiful floor is desired.\n\nSPARTAN \"MCKI\" TILES have all the quality of the other Spartan Ceramic Tiles and are frequently used where more subdued colors than a bright \"Golden Pheasant\" are desired.\n\nSPARTAN GREY, RED AND BROWN TILES are arranged in many patterns as shown in the complete catalogue of Spartan Ceramic Tiles which we shall be pleased to send you upon request. They will give more pleasing effects (with much greater wear), than the plain white tiles now commonly used, at very little additional cost.\n\nPrinted in U. S.

The flamed buffs, grays and browns also serve well where quieter treatments are more acceptable.\n\nTHE COLOR LASTS\nA product of the hottest fire, quarry tiles hold their beautiful colors and textures indefinitely. Neither sunlight nor weather affect them. They will not fade, warp, corrode or stain. The rich natural shades of these tiles are burned-in and permanent. They never change with age.\n| ADVERTISING DURING MONTH OF | DISPLAY INCHES | LEGAL LINES | FOREIGN LINES | RATE | AMOUNT |\n|-----------------------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|------|--------|\n| Oct.                        |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 1                           |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 2                           |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 3                           |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 4                           |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 5                           |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 6                           |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 7                           |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 8                           |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 9                           |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 10                          |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 11                          |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 12                          |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 13                          |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 14                          |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 15                          |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 16                          |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 17                          |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 18                          |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 19                          |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 20                          |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 21                          |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 22                          |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 23                          |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 24                          |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 25                          |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 26                          |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 27                          |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 28                          |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 29                          |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 30                          |               |             |              |      |        |\n| 31                          |               |             |              |      |        |\n\nTOTAL: $31.20\n\nBalance Due as Per Bill Rendered: $48.22\n\nIndian Affairs.

D. Nelson,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Carson, Esq.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI wish to advise that I have just returned from an inspection of the site for the new building on the Industrial School Reserve and I find the work is proceeding very satisfactorily. Approximately one-third of the excavating has been completed and a portion of one trench for the concrete has been completed to its proper depth.\n\nIn looking over the conditions very critically, I feel more than ever satisfied that the Department was wise in selecting this site for the building. In spite of the heavy rains which we have had lately, the ground is absolutely dry and if a drainage system is installed at a slight distance from the building when everything is complete there never should be any trouble as there has been in the Girls Home Building.\n\nI have not yet been advised as to who will inspect the work as it goes along, but I thought it wise to inform you that the contractor was making good headway and that he expects his first shipment of cement in three or four days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Halliday,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nTo,\nThe Secretary,\nIndian and Eskimo Commission M.S.C.C.,\n29-43 The Bible House, Winnipeg.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nAfter long and careful consideration, I have reached the place where I consider it necessary that this school should in the near future be provided with a gas-boat, and I must ask you to give careful consideration to my request that a recommendation in this respect go forward to the Department of Indian Affairs, with a view to an estimate for same being included in the Departmental expenses for next financial year, should the Department give favourable consideration to our request.\n\nPersonally speaking, I am much averse to having a boat at this school, as I realize quite well that they are a liability and a worry. But there are features that quite offset these, and I will detail them as follows:-\n\n1. Food supply, fish of different kinds. Although this school has been running for thirty-seven years, as far as I can find out, the school has never put down a winter's supply of fish, certainly not since the Commission took over the schools. For the past two years I have been in possession of a permit to take out up to one thousand fish from the Nimpkish River, but I have been unable to take advantage of this permit on account of lack of boat facilities. At the time when it is best to take these fish the Indians are all fishing on seine boats, and it is impossible to get an Indian to give one any fish, as they are being paid big money for them. The few small gas boats available for charter are expensive, and in most cases are unsafe for crossing over to the Nimpkish in rough weather. As this type of fishing is done in the early morning at a fish trap, it means that we have to go over the river in the dark, and this needs a good boat with a good engine. We have been over three times this year, and took out two hundred fish, which we have salted down for use during the winter. We could have gone over more often, but the only boat I could charter was too small, and the owner would not take it out, (It is a 16 ft. boat) on account of rough weather. With a boat of our own, we could go over to the river and camp there for two or three days at a time, and thus get enough fish to keep the school in food, and thus save on the meat bills which are outrageously high. The children need, and should have fish for food.\nFish is the natural food of the Indian of the coast, and both the Indian and Fisheries Departments go to great lengths to see that the Indian people have ample facilities for getting fish for winter food. Yet here in the schools, in the centre of the fishing district of the whole coast, it is impossible for us to get fish at any price unless we go and get it ourselves. It might be asked why do the Indians not give us fish for their own children. This is answered by the fact that all fish caught are the property of a whole crew, and in any case the prices received for their catch are so high that it does not pay to be generous. Another feature that I am well aware of is the fact that the local Indians are not any too well disposed towards the schools on account of the presence of the northern children. Many years ago, when the locals refused to send their children to school, children from the north were bought down, and have been here ever since, we now having on the rolls children of parents who were in their turn pupils at Alert Bay. This action brought about a feeling that has never quite disappeared. This might also be the reason why they are not keen on taking us over the river to gaff fish out of their (as they put it) fish traps.\n\nApart from the fall-fish which we would salt down, we could get fresh fish from the same trap from the month of June on, including sockeye and other types. We could also engage in halibut fishing on a small scale when they are running this way in the spring, as we have all the necessary gear here now, but no boat from which to use it. I fished halibut with my small gas boat a year ago, and with great success, but I had to sell the boat as it was unsafe for rough weather being only a sixteen foot boat. In the new school, with a large pupilage, it is almost imperative that we have facilities for securing fish for food purposes.\n\n2. Towing and freighting. As you are aware, the Department are making extensive clearing on the school reserve. This is going to mean a tremendous amount of fencing. In addition, all our other fencing much of which has been up for many years, needs replanning and replacing to suit the new conditions at this centre when the new school is completed and in operation. Fence posts on this coast, to be worth anything at all, must be of cedar. There is no cedar at all on this island, and we are going to have topay Indians to go out and haul in cedar logs for fence posts. This will cost money, as they will charge for the logs as well as the towing. If we had a work boat of our own, the cost would be that of fuel alone. I can assure you that we are going to need hundreds and hundreds of posts when we do start fencing in earnest, as the Department of Animal Health demand that the school land be entirely enclosed, and at present, although the Department authorized it, not even the line fence is in. In addition to this need, a boat could be very useful for hauling freight from the different wharves to the school. Although it is possible that the Department will fix the Sawmill wharf, or make arrangements to have it declared a public wharf and placed under the Public Works Department, there are many boats that bring freight to us that will not call at any wharf but the Cannery, and in summer when we are short handed, it is no light task for a couple of men to have to truck or pack freight for a mile, especially\nWhen the goods might be large and cumbersome such as W.A. bales, a boat would make short work of such a task.\n\n2. Visiting out-stations and villages. We have quite a number of children who live in villages only a few miles from the school, yet during the summer months, when the parents are busy fishing, and all boats are employed either seining or trolling, we have had cases of children who have been weeks late in returning to school solely because there was no way for them to get down. Whilst I grant that the fathers should make arrangements to bring them in on time, yet you know that it is hard to get an Indian to quit fishing just to take their children back to school. At any rate, they don't do it, and if we had a boat, we could run up and pick up all these children in short order. A great deal of work, and valuable work too, could be done in the way of recruiting trips during the winter, when the Indians are in their winter village which in most cases are only accessible to small gas-boats.\n\nThe foregoing matters more or less convince me of the necessity of our having a boat, and the remaining factor to consider it what kind of a boat. I would suggest a boat of at least 30 feet in length, and equipped with a heavy duty type of engine. Such a boat could be procured second hand for about $1,000.00. Mr. Halliday, the Indian Agent, is a good judge of boats, and I think that should the Department decide to make a grant, that the purchase could safely be left in the hands of Mr. Halliday, whose knowledge of this coast and the needs of the school, would enable him to select a type that would be both useful and serviceable to the schools.\n\nMay I commend this matter to your most careful consideration,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(sgd) F.

It is furthermore, a witness to the keen interest taken by the people of Canada in the Indian peoples. The building and its equipment will cost in the neighborhood of $60,000.\n\nIn view of the acute economic situation among the Coast Indians at present, the Alert Bay school principal and staff, as well as the Indians themselves, are hoping that the Department of Indian Affairs will equip the school with such shops and machinery so that the children may leave with sufficient technical knowledge to be able to earn their living as fishermen with some useful trade or industry.\n\nA high school section is to be provided for in the new building, and when the school is opened for some pupils, it is anticipated, will be ready for classes in this.\n\nThe school is modern in every respect. In addition to the five classrooms there are big dormitories, infirmaries for both boys and girls, and spacious playgrounds. The auditorium will seat 300 persons and will be convertible into a gymnasium. One of the classrooms will be used as a chapel. If the school is completed, either by the Diocese of Columbia or the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe school is fitted throughout with electric lights and modern machines are being installed in the technical school.\nFEB. 6, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 24th ultimo in which you recommend the furring of the interior of the outside walls on the south-east side of the new Alert Bay School, I would ask you to kindly obtain from the contractors and submit a price for the water-proofing of all of the inside of the outside hollow tile walls with a tar and asphalt water-proofing, also for the strapping and lathing of all interior of outside walls.\n\nReferring to your letter of the 24th regarding some changes asked for by the Reverend Principal, I would ask you to please obtain and submit a price for each of the items separately as mentioned in your letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The writer knows many hollow tile and brick veneer walls in the city of Vancouver less exposed than this one, which are continually wet. It is too late to carry out the proposed except in the three upper stories as you will see, owing to the basement concrete wall having already been poured according to plan. It would then leave the wall three-quarters of an inch too narrow to come out flush with the plaster of the tiles forming the upper part of the basement wall. However, this floor is not of such a serious character as the upper floors where living and sleeping quarters exist. The cost in this connection should not exceed $200.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nInspector of Works.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJanuary 24, 1929.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe attached letter addressed to me from Mr. Anfield, the principal of Alert Bay Residential School, will in itself be almost self-explanatory. May I, however, be permitted to deal with the matter in the same order in which Mr. Anfield does.\n\nEncs. 4 Ground Floor:\n\n(a) From a practical standpoint of view I consider the request for these doors of great importance, and would, therefore recommend them.\n\n(b) You will readily see the importance of the toilet in question. I may add that the cost would not be excessive, as it is immediately above the C.I. drain in the basement beneath. In this connection, in order to create sufficient room for the toilet, the cupboard shown on the plan in the Indian's room will be done away with, and the partition between the said room and the cupboards will be placed two feet further south, thus slightly reducing the size of the bedroom, but making the cupboard now quite large enough for a toilet. By my explanation you will see that I propose to still run the partition straight across the room. By this it will be seen that the cupboard in the adjoining room will also be made larger. It will, however, leave the Indian's room amply large enough.\n\n(c) The connecting door here asked for is quite in order, judging from the explanation, and is therefore recommended.\n\n(d) Recommended as above.\n(e) The request for this item can be readily seen after reading Mr. Anfield's explanation. The cost is not excessive, as he does not ask for any heat, simply an installation of one push switch and two lights. By looking at the plan you will, however, see that the present windows lighting this corridor will, of necessity, have to be placed in the opposite exposure to where they are, in order to still light the passageway. Two extra windows, of course, will be necessary to light the new room, and also one entrance door. Shelving will be placed at intervals of approximately two feet, commencing from the floorline, and carried out to a depth into the room just leaving sufficient space to handle the clothing in question. It will be noticed that the walls of this portion of the building are in any case of stucco construction, therefore easily run up to the necessary height to complete another story.\n\n(f) This request is similar to the preceding one, but the cost would be slightly in excess per cubic foot owing to the fact that approximately fifty feet of radiation will be necessary in addition to the lighting, and that the walls must be of tile and brick construction corresponding with the story beneath. Necessity of it, however, I would consider warranted.\n\nFirst Floor:\n(a) In this request Mr. Anfield's views are recommended.\n\n(b) In connection with this item I have carefully studied the proximity of the nearest staff bedroom, and in recommending it would say that there should not be any additional cost in connection with it.\n\nSecond Floor:\n(a) Considering Mr. Anfield's explanation here, I would judge that this request be quite in order and it will be seen that the cost in connection with it would be very small.\n\nI trust my explanation may readily grasped, and it is only owing to a temporary shortage of plans on the job that I have not traced all the alterations on a full set of plans and mailed same to you. It so happens that all the sets of plans belonging to the contractor happen at this moment to be in the hands of the separate sub trades, and in consequence not available.\nThe cost of these alterations carried out in conformity with the rest of the building would be approximately $2,400.00. I have not taken the matter up with Mr. Carson, but I know that this sum is pretty close to what he or any other contractor would ask for carrying out such work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nInspector of Works.\nTo,\nA.M. Gow, Esq.,\nInspector of Works,\nNew Residential School, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Gow:\n\nI have to request that you will give consideration to the following suggestions in connection with the new building, and to report on them with your recommendations to the Department. From the administrative point of view, the additions or changes are wholly desirable, and will render the administering of the new plant very much easier than would otherwise be the case. For ease I will deal with the building floor, by floor.\n\nGround floor\n\n(a) That double swing doors be placed at each end of this main corridor, and placed next to the stairs leading up from the basement. These doors are most necessary, in view of the fact that the children will undress for bed downstairs, and will proceed upstairs in their night attire. The present layout would mean that boys and girls would both be in full view of each other at this time, and such is not conducive to ease of supervision.\n\n(b) That a toilet be placed in the Indians' room on this floor. As at present laid out, the Indians would have to use the staff toilet or go downstairs into the children's quarters, neither of which conditions are desired at all.\n\n(c) That a connecting door be placed between the office and the class-room. This room will not be used as a classroom here, but will be an office for the Matron in charge, and will also act as a stock room for office supplies, and will further be used as a stenographer's room later on.\n\n(d) That a connecting door be placed between the sewing room and the classroom shown adjacent thereto on the plan. We will not be using this room as a classroom for quite a while, but need it urgently as another sewing room, for the making of clothes, keeping the other as a mending room.\n\n(e) That the roof of the kitchen be built up on one side to the level of this floor, said space to be then used as a storeroom. May I stress most urgently the need of further provision of store room. With our system of bales, and the fact that all our supplies come in large quantities four times a year only, the provided store space is hopelessly inadequate. I\nquite realise that the request is rather a large one, as it involves considerable money, and also the question of a window in the staff bedroom lying at the end of the corridor, but I would appreciate your serious consideration to our request, as the space is urgently needed.\n\n(f) That the roof of the coal cellar be raised up one floor also, and that a door be provided to connect the new room thus formed with the auditorium. A little explanation is needed here. No chapel is provided in this building, and the local church will not nearly accommodate the number of children that will be enrolled in this school. This means that we will have to utilize the auditorium as a temporary chapel until the local church is enlarged or other provision made. If our auditorium is used in this way, we will have a temporary and movable altar, prayer desk, lectern, etc., and we must have somewhere to store them when the auditorium is used as a gym, or play room, or concert hall. We would further require a vestry for the presiding clergyman to robe in. This corner room would just suit the situation ideally, as well as providing a store room for auditorium chairs, etc. I wish to press this item most strongly.\n\nFirst Floor\n\n(a) That a door be placed at the end of the main corridor on the girls' side. This is needed so we are going to have segregation of the sexes, and keep the girls from the infirmary.\n\n(b) That all switches for the night toilets in the entire building be placed in the staff supervisor's rooms, and not in the toilets as shown on the plan. We wish to allow children no access whatever to switches. We would put in 20 volt lamps in these sockets, and let them burn all night.\n\nSecond Floor\n\n(a) That a door be placed between the boys and girls wings, allowing the use of this one dormitory for boys. I should say in this connection that we will have more boys in this school than girls, and hence it will be necessary for us to have more dormitory space for the boys. By utilizing one dormitory on the girls' wing on this floor for the boys, and by locking the door into the remainder of the girls section, we could accommodate the 25 boys then I expect to have in excess of girls. In the event of the number of girls increasing in the future, the connecting door could be locked, and the entire wing given back to the girls. In the event of the Department sanctioning this change, the fire escape on this side could be locked, and in case of emergency, the boys would run through the new connecting door and go out on their own fire escape.\nWharfage\n\nI wish you to take a careful survey of the present Sawmill Wharf, with a view to reporting to the Department what I consider to be a most dangerous situation. From my own personal observations and from conversation with those who in a position to speak with authority, I have reached the place where I consider the present wharf and its approaches to be nothing short of a death trap, so much so in fact, that I refuse to allow any children from the schools to be on it at all. There is hardly a pile in the entire structure that is not rotten, and I think that the Department should be notified, and further that the contractor should be warned of the danger. As it is more or less incumbent on the Department to provide the Schools with facilities for the bringing in of the large supplies that will be required to operate the new plant, and as I understand that some arrangement has been arrived at between the Department and the Diocese of Columbia, who are the present owners of the wharf; and in view of the large amount of money that will be required to repair this wharf and the condition of the present road over which supplies have to be hauled from this wharf; I would ask you to give serious consideration to an alternative proposition of extending the wharf recently built by the contractor to a point where it could be utilized as a permanent school wharf, with a suitable freight shed built thereon.\n\nSunday Work\n\nAs this is a Mission school and as we object strongly to the contractor working here on Sunday, I must ask you to obtain a ruling from the Department as to what constitutes necessary work that must be performed on Sunday. The contractor has stated to me that he is compelled to work on Sunday in order to clear his scows, but when a scow is securely lashed to the wharf he is using, I do not consider that the situation is then a state of emergency. We do not wish to be narrow minded on the matter, but we owe a duty to the Indians under our spiritual care. We cannot teach them not to do what we ourselves perform.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nFeb. 1, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 19th ultimo,\nI would say that I am sending you, under separate cover,\ntwo blue print copies of the plans for the Alert Bay School\nalso two prints of the plans reversed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. H. Holliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nAlert Bay, B. C.,\nJanuary 16, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing you a copy of a letter which I have just received from Mr. A. M. Gow, regarding an extra in the completion of the new residential school building at Alert Bay.\n\nOccasionally at Alert Bay we have four or five days of excessive rain, sometimes two inches of rain falling in twenty-four hours, and when this occurs the surrounding country becomes saturated.\n\nIf you study the contour plan prepared by Mr. Warren, you will notice that immediately behind the new building is a depression, which is marked on his plan to have a drain, and during these periodic rain storms this becomes a small lake.\n\nIn doing the excavating for the building, hard-pan was struck, and when this heavy rain came on, the contractor found it necessary to put in a six inch tile drain to carry off the overflow. I make periodic visits to the new building, and I discussed this matter with Mr. Gow about putting in some extra drains, so it would prevent all danger of the basement of the new building ever flooding as has occurred on numerous occasions at the old girl's home.\n\nIt is possible that when the drainage system is shown on the contour plan is carried out that there may be no danger of the water from this valley at the back ever going into the basement, but on the other hand it is possible that this surface water may follow a strata in the hard-pan and pass completely under the proposed drainage system and crop out where\nit showed during the last heavy rains and as the total expense in putting in the extra drainage will only come to $100.00, I would recommend that it be done, and it will be money well spent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Halliday,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nW. M. Halliday Esq.,\nAlbert Bay P.E.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to our conversation of recent date regarding the advisability of a 4\" tile drain around the base of the building, may I suggest that this matter be taken up with the proper authorities.\n\nFrom the evidence I have seen it will be readily seen that such a drain would certainly be of great value to go all around the base of the building. The cost would be approximately $100.00. It would take 465 ft. 4\" tile (16 - 4'8\" + 4'7\") at the whole of the excavation for same would have to be performed in hand. There also a good deal of labor involved under the existing conditions, thus making the cost look somewhat excessive.\n\nIn my opinion for such a small outlay it would consider the expenditure more than well worth the careful attention given to the matter (for having seen the flow) so that immediate steps may be taken (in the event of having the work performed) to remove the necessary material from view.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Christie Indian School, Alert Bay.\n\nThe contract for building the above new School has been let to one Carson and the Heating Contractor is Carl Beck of this City.\n\nThis Contract specified that the Heating Units shall be two Taylor-Forbes Fire Box Type Boilers. We find that for installations in B.C. that locally built boilers are preferred, because these boilers are built under the supervision, and according to designs approved by the Boiler Inspection Department of the Province of B.C., and on this account a Government guarantee comes with the boiler.\n\nWe have been in touch with Mr. Beck, and Mr. Beck has agreed, providing we get your authority, to substitute what is known as the Class S. # 16 \"Inglis\" SUPREME Boiler. This is a Boiler which we are building in Vancouver from designs developed by the John Inglis Co.Ltd. in Toronto, and modified by us to suit British Columbia requirements. It is a steel welded boiler, passed by the Government Inspectors for 15# working pressure, and is an exceedingly well-built and efficient boiler.\n\nWe have asked the John Inglis Co. to not only send you bulletins covering this boiler, but to\nvisit you in Ottawa and explain to you the merits of this boiler.\n\nWe might say that in this matter we are working with the British Columbia Branch of the Taylor Forges Company and have got their consent to this substitution.\n\nWith Kind Regards,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nVANCOUVER IRON WORKS LTD.\n\n(Geo.

Guernsey Orr Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nMr. W.E. Ditchburn, Commissioner of Indian Affairs for British Columbia, visited this school on the 18th and 19th instants, and at his request I am writing you with regard to two or three matters pertaining to this building which he thinks, if attention is called to them, you would be desirous of changing in the school at Alert Bay now under construction.\n\nMr. Ditchburn states that the plans and specifications for the Alert Bay school are practically identical with what were used here, and this being the case, that it would be well to advise you of anything that might be changed to advantage before the newer building is far advanced.\n\nIn my letter of the 17th instant I drew attention to the failure of hot water service here when depending on steam from the heating boilers, and pointed out the difference between what was provided for St. Paul's School for instance, and that installed here. Mr. Ditchburn asked me to make the request on his behalf that a hot water storage service similar to what has proved so satisfactory at St. Paul's be authorized for Alert Bay, and that the specifications be changed accordingly. This would call for taking steam from the boiler header through a larger steam line, and for the substituting a \"Darling-Whitlock Type K Storage Heater No. H-3\" or approved equal, in the place of the one specified at present.\n\nIt is desired that in planning the heating of the Principal's residence a separate steam main be taken direct from the boiler room to the residence. The Rev. Principal tells me that during last winter it was found impossible to get sufficient heat in the residence without overheating the rest of the school; and Mrs. Lett remarked that never before did she suffer such discomfort from cold rooms as she has done here. I recall that Canon Middleton also complained of the same condition in his residence at St. Paul's. In the latter case I tried to have a separate steam line carried to the residence during construction, and submitted an estimate from the heating contractor, but it was refused by the Indian Commissioner at Regina. This extra service can be installed much cheaper during construction than afterwards, as you will readily understand.\n\nIn this school all doors into corridors on ground and first floors were specified to have glass panels to give borrowed light. This was mentioned in the carpentry specifications, and repeated in the glazing specifications, but owing to an inadvertence in the markings on the plan, the glass panels were not provided, and have been omitted. Mr. Ditchburn would like this corrected in the plans for Alert Bay.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6427, file 875-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nApril 8, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Hanbury,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st April dealing with some proposed work in connection with the Indian Residential School at Alert Bay.\n\nThe Department is obtaining information as to repairs necessary to the wharf. There will undoubtedly be some other work in connection with fences and outbuildings, and I should think that the present Inspector, Mr. A. M. Gow, would be the proper person to carry out this work. I will instruct Dr. Scott to look into these matters and to take note of your suggestions.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW. F.

They have to do with repairs to a wharf, construction of a fence and out buildings, moving some buildings and doing some draining. You have as inspector Mr. A. M. Gow, who is very capable and well qualified to be placed in charge of this extra work as foreman to handle the work with day labor.

It seems to me that the authority was not thorough enough from Ottawa when the work was executed but this window is being taken care of in the best way possible.\n\n2. The plans simply say plastered area so the contractor took it to mean a square trip. To now change to semi-circular would cost approx. $700. Would you please give a ruling on this as to interpretation of \"plastered area\" or whether I changed the contractor is entitled to compensation.\n\n3. I have taken upon myself to authorize the plumber to rough this in between studs, just the same as we would do under City by-laws. Please give ruling on this as I do not feel quite following Mr. Anfield. The specifications call for plastic culverts.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6427, file 875-5, part 2)\nI concur with the principal here that in so doing the crown are but cut up to the healing qualities not materially concerned.\n\nYou will note that with the exception of item \u2461 there is no cost to the Dept., and would like to know if in future correspondence trifling matters you would rather be dealt with than referring them to me.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6427, file 875-5, part 2)\nMarch 19th/29\n\nTo,\nA.M.Gow, S.S.O.,\nInspector of Works,\nResidential Schools, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Gow:\n\nI have to ask for your kindly consideration to the following proposed changes in the new building.\n\n(a) That a window of suitable type be installed in the toilet sanctioned for the Indians' room on the first floor.\n\n(b) That the arch marked on the plan for installation in the front hall be of semi-circular type and not of square construction as mentioned to me by the foreman.\n\n(c) That the plumbing in the Principal's residence be of the enclosed type so that stand pipes do not run through the living room.\n\n(d) That the ceilings of the residence in the principal rooms be plastered instead of having metallic ceilings as shown on the plans.\n\n(e) That the radiators shown for installation in the two south-east bedrooms of the residence be converted into one large unit instead of two small radiators, and that they be placed where I have mentioned to the plumber.\n\nAs some of these little changes are necessary immediately, I would appreciate that where no extra cost is involved, that you would so inform the contractor that such changes are to be made using your authority as Inspector of Works to do so. If on the other hand, you feel that Ottawa should be approached, you will do so, and we will await their sanction.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6427, file 875-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Anfield, the Acting Principal of our Society's School at Alert Bay, has expressed to our Commission his very deep concern that the recommendation he made to the Inspector of Works on the new school building, with regard to the provision of proper chapel accommodation, has not been accepted. His recommendation as set forth in his letter to the Inspector of Works on Jan. 19th last, was as follows:\n\n\"That the roof of the coal cellar be raised up one floor also, and that a door be provided to connect the new room thus formed with the auditorium. A little explanation is needed here. No chapel is provided in this building, and the local church will not nearly accommodate the number of children that will be enrolled at this school. This means that we will have to utilize the auditorium as a temporary chapel until the local church is enlarged or other provision made. If our auditorium is used in this way, we will have a temporary and movable altar, prayer desk, lectern, etc., and we must have somewhere to store them when the auditorium is used as a gym, or playroom, or concert hall. We would further require a vestry for the presiding clergyman to robe in. This corner room would just suit the situation ideally, as well as providing a store room for auditorium chairs, etc., I wish to press this item most strongly.\"\n\nOur Commission have very carefully considered this recommendation with the blue print plans before them, and they feel that it deserves re-consideration by your Department. I beg to suggest, therefore, that the attention of your architect be directed to this important matter, and that steps be taken, if at all possible, to incorporate in the new building, the improvement suggested.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\nThe Secretary\nDept.

When the tenders are received he should forward an analysis of same with a recommendation. It will then be necessary for us to obtain an Order-in-Council authorizing the awarding of a contract. Mr. Carson, the contractor for the school should of course be given an opportunity to submit a tender.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nDominion Water Power Branch,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nRe: Alert Bay School, Proposed Water Supply and Sewage System.\n\nIn further reference to my letter of September 7 enclosing a report prepared by Mr. Webb on the proposed building site and water and sewage systems for the new industrial school at Alert Bay, British Columbia, Mr. Webb reports that the early authorization of these works might mean a considerable saving. It is understood that the contractors for the school building will probably be at work for some time and if they had the opportunity of tendering while their plant is still at the school they might be in a position to offer a better bid than others.\n\nMr. Webb states that at present some changes are being made in the design of the system, and when these are completed full detail drawings will be forwarded for approval. The alterations proposed will not affect the connections to the school as originally proposed.\n\nI shall be glad to have your instructions with regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Although I am far from being an engineer, I would not think that it would be necessary to grade the floor for such a drain, as my idea is merely to have a drain into which the water could be guided with brooms or mops, rather than to have a gravity flow towards such a drain.\n\nThanking you for anything you may be able to do in this matter,\n\nBelieve me, Mr. Gow, Most sincerely yours,\n\nPrincipal.\nAnd Dept.

McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. M. Gow, Esq.,\nInspector of Construction,\nAlert Bay,\nB.C.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJune 5, 1929.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir:\n\nThe enclosed letter from the Reverend Principal,\nMr. Anfield, will explain the purpose of my letter.\n\nI have studied his letter carefully, and concur\nin all he says, noting particularly with reference\nto paragraph three in his letter the difficulties under\nwhich they are working in the manual training school\nin order to finish their work.\n\nIt will be understood that the matter really has\nnothing to do with me; but as it is proposed to eventually\nmove the building, I consider this would be an appropriate\ntime to do so.\n\nI would also draw your attention to paragraph four.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.M. Gow\nInspector of New Residential School.\nTo,\nA.M. Gow, Esq.,\nInspector of Works,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Gow:\n\nI have to request that you will bring to the Dept.'s attention the advisability of having the manual training shop (at present used as a schoolroom) moved from its present site to the newly prosed site during the coming summer holidays, which commence on June 27th and end on the last day of August.\n\nIn view of the possibility of the new building not being ready for occupation when the children return from their vacation, this building could then go on in its present use, without interruption, whereas if the moving were left till later, we would be without a schoolroom for a while, should the new plant not be ready, and if it were ready we would be without a manual training shop. I am sure that the Dept. will see the urgent need of having this building moved from its present site, primarily from the point of view of fire-risk.\n\nIn my opinion, it is essential that this building when moved, should be fitted up with radiation and electric light. Steam heat is necessary so that even temperatures may be kept for varnishing and other woodworking operations of this nature.\n\nWould you also please inform the Department that we will require the use of the Principal's cottage, at present in front of the new building, for the use of married staff agents. Hence its removal rather than its demolition is strongly urged.\n\nBelieve me, Yours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir,\n\nBetween the 15th and 30th of June it may be anticipated that I have to go to Vancouver on business for three days. I desire to know if I have free permission for such leave providing I make certain arrangements, namely to have Mr. Haldane visit the work twice daily to assist such work to me during my absence. I have no wish to have the job undone I have to do there is a chance I may get away having to go. Should I however have free permission to finish the trip unavoidable I would arrange that during my absence to special work such as the covering in of pipe planting in of same or such like be carried out.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

C.,\nAugust 14, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to draw your attention to the fact that although Mr. Carson, the contractor on the new school has almost finished with the building proper, nothing has been done yet about the out-buildings nor about the water supply. I heard indirectly that a firm in Vancouver, by the name of Bartholemew & Montgomery, had got the contract, but they have not yet appeared on the ground, and if the building is to be ready for occupancy by September first they will have to make the most of their time, and to use a common expression, \"get a move on\".\n\nWhen the school closed for the summer holidays, it was decided that, if possible, it would open in the new building on September first, or if there happened to be a few days delay, a timely notice would be sent to the pupils so it would not be necessary to re-open in the old buildings, as I understand there will be a large influx of new pupils, and if they could not come in with the others, it would only lead to confusion, delay and unnecessary expense for the pupils concerned.\n\nIf you can do anything to expedite matters, it will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Halliday,\nIndian Agent.\n\nWMH/SMT\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAlert Bay, B.C., August 3, 1929.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nActing under instructions from Mr. Ditchburn, and in company with the Principal, Mr. Anfield, I have made a complete list of certain mill work - boarding for cupboards, etc. - necessary for the new Indian Residential School here, a short specification of which is herewith attached. It was found necessary, in order to quote on such a large order accurately, to get prices from Vancouver on small panel doors, tables, benches, etc. This I have done, and find a difference of only $48.00 between the two companies which submitted prices.\n\nIn my opinion, the present contractor, Mr. Carson, would be the only man capable of carrying out this work satisfactorily, and at the price which I am about to quote, it must be borne in mind that this material is of such a nature that it requires a lot of handling. He has the facilities for draying, and his own dock immediately adjacent to the building, whereas if a stranger was to attempt the work, it is possibly the nearest place he could have the material dumped would be Cook's dock, which is fully half a mile distant, and there is no other motor truck in the village save Mr. Carson's. Besides, he has on hand, and will have for the next four or five weeks, competent workmen, such as are really necessary to carry out the installation satisfactorily. I must here remark, however, that Mr. Carson impresses upon me that while he is willing to do the work providing it is done before he completes the school, he at the same time also states that if his men have left he would be unable to undertake it. He should, at the present rate of progress, be finished with the main building not later than the 5th of September; so in the event of this work meeting with your immediate approval, may I ask that the advice of it being carried out be sent me by wire.\n\nThe following is roughly what Mr. Carson gives me as his definition of the different costs in connection with the work; the total sum being $5,922.50.\n-2-\n\nAll work ........................................ $4255.00\nStaining, shellacking, varnishing ........... 690.00\nAssembling and erecting cupboards and shelving, placing of hardware, etc. ......... 805.00\nCartage from dock and placing in the different rooms ......................... 172.50\n\n$5922.50\n\nTrusting this may be all the information you may deem necessary,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nInspector of Works.\nThe GURNEY FOUNDRY CO., Limited\n\nBRANCH OF\nTHE GURNEY FOUNDRY CO., LIMITED\nTORONTO\n\nSOLD TO\nDEPT.

McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am attaching hereto copy of a letter received from Mr. Earl Anfield, Principal of the Alert Bay School, pointing out the desirability of cutting a door through the wall between the Store-room and the Bake-room as per rough pencil sketch enclosed, on which it will be noted that Captain A.W. Gow, Superintendent of Works, has recommended the work be done owing to the fearfully cramped quarters between the bake oven and sink. This doorway will make it considerably more convenient for the removal of flour from the Store-room to the mixing trough and also the loaves, when baked, can be put in the Store-room.\n\nIn view of the fact that it would take over two weeks to get approval of this extra work from Ottawa, I have authorized Mr. Gow to have the work done at the lowest cost possible in keeping with the necessities of the case and I, therefore, beg to inform you accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

Box 666, Victoria, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn:\n\nThe bake oven purchased for this school has now been installed and we will be trying it out tomorrow. It is certainly a fine oven and should give great satisfaction.\n\nFrom the attached sketch you will be able to size up the layout of this room, and I have consulted Mr. Gow with a view to having a door cut between this room and the next one in which the flour will be stored and the baked bread kept. Mr. Gow suggested that it would be best to write to you with a view to getting your approval to this extra, which would cost in the neighbourhood of $100 to complete. I feel myself that it is necessary to have this door made as it is going to be extremely difficult to transport sacks of flour past the oven to the mixer. The bakery could then be got at from the storeroom and the bakery door kept only as an emergency door.\n\nI should say that we had a long conference with the man sent to install this oven, and he was firmly of the opinion that the present position was the only suitable one for this oven. This man stated that he was informed that he would be given help in putting this oven up, so using your wire to Mr. Gow as authority, we put two men on for one half day, and one man an extra half day to help, and vouchers for this go forward to Mr. Halliday.\n\nWe would appreciate your views as to the desirability of making this change.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) F. Earl Anfield.\nPrincipal.\nSept. 26, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 23rd instant, with reference to the fire equipment required outside the building for the new Alert Bay School, I would say that the Department approves of the purchase of the necessary equipment, also the segregating of the stand pipe system inside the building from the domestic system, as recommended in your District Chief Engineer's report.\n\nI would ask you also to kindly arrange to have 60 feet of hose installed on each floor of the interior of the building, in place of the six feet already installed. This was an error in the specifications, six feet should have read sixty feet.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. R.

C.,\nSept. 9, 1929.\n\nINSPECTION REPORT ON KWAWKEWLTH AGENCY NO. 1.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nAlert Bay Residential school.\n\nWith Mr. Halliday I went over the new building very nearly completed. This will be a fine school though it strikes me that the dining room is going to be small. I was pleased to see that an improved form of flooring in the basement is being used, consisting of a sort of mosaic chip. This will save the constant trouble and dust nuisance as in other schools where straight cement or composition has been used. I did not meet the principal unfortunately being away. The builder informed me that he anticipates trouble with the windows leaking as at present constructed. Apparently here the rain blows in with considerable force against the glass, and owing to wind pressure will not easily get away. He suggests the use of wood or copper strips on the outside of the windows leading over the edges of the windows where they leak.\n\nG. S. Pragnell.\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nSir,\n\nRe: Alert Bay School.\n\nI enclose herewith copy of a letter received from Mr. Webb dated September 16th, dealing with tenders for the supply of hose, nozzles and equipment for outside fire hydrants for the Alert Bay school; also a copy of the form of tender and the names of the firms to whom they have been sent.\n\nYou will notice that Mr. Webb makes some recommendations with regard to the fire equipment regarding which I shall be glad to have your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nMr. J.D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nRe: Alert Bay School\n\nI should be pleased if you would inform the Department of Indian Affairs that tenders are being called for the supply of hose, nozzles and equipment for outside fire hydrants for the above mentioned school.\n\nThis material was not included in the contract of Messrs. Bartholomew, Montgomery and Company. Copies of tender forms are enclosed for your information.\n\nIn connection with the inside fire equipment for the school, I would be pleased to have you call the attention of the Department of Indian Affairs to the specifications for the school building. These state that the inside fire hydrants shall be equipped with 6 feet of hose. I presume this was intended for 60 feet but the contractor has supplied only 6 feet.\n\nThe specifications also state that the pipe supplying the inside hydrants shall be connected to the domestic service pipe. This should not be, as in the event of fire, so much water pipe is exposed to the fire hazard that a break anywhere would so reduce the pressure as to make the inside hydrants almost useless. In addition, when the fire engine is put in operation, no water would be available for inside use when the reserve in the tank is used up.\n\nAs the cost of segregating these pipes would not exceed $100.00 and as outside connections have already been provided for this purpose, I would advise having it done now.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

Canadian\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nOn the 24th January last you wrote me with regard to the possibilities of installing oil burners in the new school at Alert Bay, but I did not feel disposed to write to you until I could get some definite information as to whether there was any likelihood of electric power being available at that place.\n\nFor your information I may say it is proposed to establish a large power plant on the Nimpkeesh River, but so far as I can learn this is not liable to take place for a number of years and if current was to be supplied to Alert Bay it would be necessary to run a submarine cable across Johnson Straits about two miles. In view of this I feel it can be taken that any current that would be supplied to Alert Bay would be at a very heavy cost.\n\nThe Principal of the School has recently taken up with me the question of installing some sawdust burners at the School, one for the big boiler and a smaller one for the high pressure tank for the laundry, and I am now looking into the matter of cost. The Principal has informed me that he can be assured of a supply of sawdust from Telegraph Bay for the next five years at least and at a very reasonable price. The sawdust burners, I may say are being used somewhat extensively on the coast and are proving very satisfactory not only in residences but also in the larger buildings. There is one installed in the Sayward building, Victoria, and the engineer informed me yesterday this building is heated at a 30% less cost than was the case when they were using slab wood.\n\nI am attaching hereto for your information copy of a letter I received from Mr. Anfield on this particular subject in order that you may have it before you in the event of my making a recommendation at a later date that two sawdust burners should be installed. You will observe, however, that the Principal has stated a 24-inch burner would be sufficient for one of the larger boilers and a 16-inch burner on the boiler for the laundry. I have my doubts as to whether either of these burners would be sufficiently large for our purposes as in the Sayward building, the burner for one of the main boilers, which are about the same size as those at Alert Bay, is a No. 40, 60-inch over all, and on the high pressure tank supplying hot water for this building, it was a 20-inch burner. Therefore, it would appear to me that sawdust burners of practically the same dimensions as those in the Sayward Building would be needed for\n\nR. Curney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nthe Alert Bay School. I have written to the manufacturers in Vancouver on this particular point and at the same time suggesting if they are interested it would be advisable for their expert to go to Alert Bay and give me a report as to just what is necessary and the cost of the burners installed.\n\nAs soon as I receive this report I will write you again on the subject.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nEnclosure:-\nDear Mr. Ditchburn,\n\nRelative to the question of fuel for the heating plant for the new building shortly to be completed at this centre, please be advised that I have made a careful investigation into the possibility of burning sawdust in standard sawdust burners, and beg to submit the following information for your consideration.\n\nA. Suitability. It is pretty generally conceded that where conditions are equable, this type of fuel is from all points of view more economical and more easily handled than any other, excepting oil, which as far as this plant is concerned, is not at present very practicable, due to lack of electrical energy.\n\nB. Storage. We have a coal cellar here of 20' x 20' x 10', or 4000 cu. feet, or 20 units of sawdust. There is also available the coal cellar of the Girls' Home, with a capacity of 5000 sacks, or 120 units of sacked sawdust. Working on a basis of 200 units per year or at the most 300 units, it will be seen that we have sufficient storage space for all our needs.\n\nC. Source of supply. Whilst it is conceded that the sawdust burner is suitable, yet everything depends on a guarantee of supply. This has been very carefully gone into, and the Telegraph Cove Mills, Ltd situated only 48 minutes towing time from the school beach, is prepared to guarantee unconditionally a full supply of sawdust for at least five years. We have at present, on a personal check, sufficient sawdust on hand to last us for three years, and as their investment is sufficiently large to preclude any quick closing up of the business, we are reasonably safe for that time, and the saving on this type of fuel in that span of time will have been sufficient to offset the capital expenditure made for the initial installation of this equipment. This firm proposes to ship the sawdust in large 100 lb. sacks, which worked on a basis of 4000 lb. to the unit, means 40 sacks to the unit.\n\nD. Comparative Heating values. In order to ascertain the comparative heating values of sawdust and coal, our present fuel, I have approached the Forestry Dept. for a report. Remembering that the \"unit\" of sawdust is derived from the approximate equal content of 1 cd. of wood, they find as follows:\n\n- 1 cord or unit of fir equals 1 ton of coal\n- 2.10 = cedar =\n- 1.60 = hemlock =\n- 1.60 = spruce =\n- 1.15 = larch =\n\nThe wood in these tests was air dried, with 12% moisture only.\n\nThe coal on which the test was based was of 14,000 B.T.U's per ton. We should remember however, that the sawdust to be supplied here would have a considerably greater moisture content than 12%. On the other hand, it must be borne in mind that the coal used here is of only approx. 10,500 B.T.U's, or at the outside 12,000 B.T.U's per ton. The exceptional comparison would therefore remain approximately the same. The Telegraph Cove Mills cut over a year is on an average 50% hemlock, 40% fir, and 10% cedar which would give us a norm of 1.50 units of sawdust to the ton of coal. Taking into account the moisture content of this sawdust, which on account of open air storage would be somewhat heavy, we could reasonably say that we would use 2 units of sawdust to the ton of coal.\n\nE. Cost.....\n\nIndian Affairs. (Rc 10, Volume 6427, file 875-5, part 2)\nPost. The Telegraph Cove Mills Ltd., offer inwriting with a five year guarantee of supply, 100 lb. sack of sawdust for 1\u00bd\u00a2 per sack, the school to provide the sacks. This price is f.o.b. the mills at Telegraph Cove. Assuming 40 sacks to the unit, this would mean a price of $2.50 a unit. (Victoria and Vancouver prices are $2.25 - $2.50 a unit delivered.) The Mills are prepared to haul our small scow to and from the Mills for $1 a unit, and the scow would hold approx 3 units. On the other hand, if the school had a boat of its own, we could haul ourselves and save 50% of the hauling cost. The scow will be delivered at the school wharf, and we could empty the 120 sacks in about one half hour, enabling the scow to return on the same trip.\n\nAssuming that we would use 100 tons of coal per annum, we would use 200 units of sawdust.\n\nCost rate on Coal, including scow, and purchase of coal,\n\n| Item                                      | Cost       |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------|\n| 100 tons, del'd. on beach                 | $1025.00   |\n| Cost of 200 units sawdust, 800,000 lb. at 1\u00bd\u00a2 per 100 lb. | $120.00    |\n| Cost of hauling 200 units at $1 per Unit  | $200.00    |\n| Total cost of 200 units delivered         | $320.00    |\n| We would require 20 tons coal for stoves  | $212.00    |\n| Total cost of fuel for year               | $532.00    |\n| Estimated saving per year                 | $493.00    |\n\nF. Objections to Sawdust burners. The primary objection to these burners is of course instability of fuel supply. This, in my opinion is reasonably covered. Another objection which we have given serious consideration is the question of the action of salt water sawdust to the tubes of the boilers. Whilst I have record of certain of these burners being removed for this reason yet we have close to hand the case of the Alert Bay steam boiler, which for fifteen years has burned sawdust in a saturated state direct from the saws. They have not had to replace a tube in the fifteen years of operation. One other objection raised is the question of blow-back through the hoppers. This is danger only met with in certain types of burners, but any burner well guarded with triangular plates in the feed lines should not have any trouble in this connection.\n\nG. Recommendation. In view of the foregoing, I would recommend that serious consideration be given to trying out these burners on the following basis:\n\n1. To install on one only of the two furnaces a 24 inch burner of approved and satisfactory make. I might mention here that the Fuel Mills, Ltd., Vancouver, B.C., have a 24 inch burner, second hand, that they are willing to install for $150.00, subject to satisfaction. Should the burner be not satisfactory, it may be returned and we will only be out the freight.\n\n2. To install on the high pressure steam boiler for the laundry one only 16 inch burner of approved type. This would give us the other furnace and the jacket heater for coal, providing double protection in the event of either not functioning.\n\nI attach hereto measurement form on the two boilers in question that lettered \"A\" being the large low pressure heating boiler, and that lettered \"B\" being the high pressure boiler for the supplying of steam to the laundry machinery.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

Principal will in itself explain his difficulty.\n\nI realised from the specifications in the first place that this six feet of hose while being inadequate, had probably been stated as six in place of sixty. However, as Mr. Anfield explains, it will take for each of the four fire stands, at least another fifty feet, and as the installed six-foot lengths are already equipped with couplings, there will be no difficulty in making the connections and transferring the nozzles to a new piece of hose.\n\nIf these are the same specifications that were used at the construction of the Lytton School, no doubt the matter familiar to you. In any event, I would appreciate your letting me know what your intentions will be in the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nInspector of Works.\nSeptember 13, 1929\n\nA.M. Gow, Esq.,\nInspector of Works,\nIndian Residential School,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Gow:\n\nI would appreciate your bringing to the attention of the Department the matter of fire hose for the hydrant stands in the new building. You will have observed that there is but six feet of hose on each stand pipe, and whilst I realize that these have been installed in accordance with the specifications, yet it does not seem very practicable, nor does it provide sufficient fire protection for this plant.\n\nThinking that the purchase of this hose might have been left with Mr. Warren, the Water Works Engineer, I have not brought this matter to your attention before, but on asking Mr. Warren yesterday regarding this, he informed me that it was no part of his work. I would recommend that at least fifty feet additional hose and possibly more, be added to each hydrant stand in the building.\n\nThank you for bringing this to the attention of the Department,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir,\n\nDept.

BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., October 1, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nFurther to my letter of the 5th ultimo having reference to the recommendation of the Principal of the Alert Bay School that a large sawdust burner should be installed on one of the big boilers and a smaller one on the high pressure boiler, I beg to say the Mill Fuels Limited, of Vancouver, have had a representative go to Alert Bay to see what size sawdust burners would be most suitable and he has now reported that a 40\" one would be necessary for the big boiler and a 15\" one for the high pressure boiler. The cost of these two burners installed at the School would be $950.00.\n\nAt first they wanted 20% down and the balance on installation but they were informed that the Department did not purchase on terms of this nature and it would be necessary to give some kind of guarantee as to their proving satisfactory. I have received a further letter stating they are willing to install these burners for the Department and payment to be made after thirty days trial upon the same being found satisfactory, failing which the burners will be removed at the expense of the Company. I am, therefore, of the opinion it might be a good idea to give these sawdust burners a months trial as undoubtedly if they are satisfactory the cost of fuel at the Alert Bay School will be a very great percentage less than would be the case if they had used coal. As stated in my previous letter the Sayward Building, Victoria, has a saving of 30% over the cost of slab wood which is also a very cheap fuel, but with coal the saving should be a much larger percentage.

He states that, in his opinion, a 32\" burner will carry the load but, of course, agrees that with a 40\" burner there will be more reserve on hand. Under these conditions we shall be pleased to furnish you with an Empire B 15 Sawdust Burner for the high pressure boiler and an Empire 40\" Burner for the low pressure steam boiler, total cost, installed at Alert Bay, $950.00. Our usual terms are 20% with order and balance on installation.\n\nWe have no 40\" burner in stock and shall have to build one for you if you order it so that if you decide to place this order please do so without loss of time as it will probably take from two to three weeks to build it and install it.\n\nFor your information, as quoted to you verbally in Victoria, a 32\" burner costs $500.00 installed in Vancouver.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMILL FUELS LIMITED\n\n(Sgd) G.H.

It might please be noted that the first two items (clearing ground, etc. and A.G. Tile), for $190.00 and $100.00 respectively, were included as extras on Certificates Nos. 1 and 2, but Mr. Carson advises me that so far as he knows, they were not included in the sum total of the cheques issued. In this event, they will now be payable with the rest of the extras. The last four items on the list of extras, you will notice, were done under my authority, as being urgently needed during the course of construction and no time to obtain authority from the Department. By way of explanation.\n\nIn the specification there is no provision made for door bumpers; it would be, as you are aware, perfectly fatal to be without them in a building of this nature; I therefore had them placed on the various doors at a cost of $40.00.\n\nThere was also no mention of a front door lock; a first-class combination double night latch Yale lock in solid brass, has been placed on the front door at a cost of $20.00.\n\nItem No. 3, extra sewer connection for bakery and kitchen sink at a cost of $20.00 really became necessary on account of the switch-over of the building, bringing all the sewerage and rain water out on the one side in place of, as shown on the original block plan, part coming out on either side.\n\nConcerning item 4, we discovered towards the close of the contract that there was no provision made for hot and cold water and steam mixing taps to soap barrel. This I authorized to be done in the laundry. Also a flush-out tap to attach hose to, there being nothing, as you are aware, on the laundry tubs excepting spring bib-cocks, and also had provided a tap in the boiler room.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nInspector of Works.\nCERTIFICATE\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nCertificate No. 10\n\nAlert Bay, B.C., September 30, 1929\n\nI hereby Certify that Thomas Carson\n1836-14th St. W., Vancouver\nhas supplied material and performed labour on Indian Residential Schools, Alert Bay\n\nContract for all work\nentitling him to a final payment of $47,900.00\n\nCertificate No. 1. $6348.00\nContract $47,900.00\n\nExtras:\n1.

Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B.C.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nDecember 2, 1929.\n\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water Power & Reclamation Service,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nSir:\n\nRe - Alert Bay Water and Sewer System.\n\nI am enclosing herewith certified account in triplicate rendered by Messrs. Bartholomew, Montgomery & Co. for extra work undertaken in connection with the above. The reasons for this extra work are stated numerically as they appear on the account.\n\nItem No.1.\n\nOwing to the fact that the contractor for the school building placed all the sewer outlets on one side, there was no longer a necessity for the centre farm drain. In consequence the drain at the east side had to be deepened and owing to the nature of the soil, slouching was liable to occur to a serious extent. It was considered advisable to till and backfill an additional length of the ditch as stated in the account.\n\nItem No.2.\n\nIt was considered advisable at points where the sewers passed in close proximity to the new building to provide revetment or the trenches owing to their depth in order to obviate any chance of settlement occurring and orders were given to provide the necessary shoring.\n\nItem No.3.\n\nOwing to the limited time that the water system could be shut down if trouble developed in any way, it was decided that a bypass should be available for the employment of the old storage tank and water system. This expenditure was incurred in this connection.\n\nItem No.4.\n\nThis was for a valve box not originally intended to be provided with a cover.\n\nItem No.5.\n\nThis incurred for the same reason as Item No.1.\nItem No.6.\n\nIt was found that the sewer of the cottage had its outlet too close to the high tide mark and had become blocked up. As the sewage outlet at that particular point was considered undesirable it was decided to lengthen it and to provide a suitable end to prevent it being buried. This sewer had not originally been provided for.\n\nItem No.7.\n\nThis expenditure was suggested to the Department of Indian Affairs as being desirable and was subsequently authorized by them.\n\nItem No.8.\n\nIt was found necessary to provide anchorage for the intake pipe of the fire pump. Owing to the backpressure developed by the pump on priming, the joints were damaged. To obviate this and to prevent the possibility of future damage or break in the pipe line, it was thought necessary to provide suitable anchorage for the exposed portion of the pipe line and was authorized on a contract basis of $125.00 for labor plus the cost of material to be provided by the contractor. This outlay also included providing a float indicator for the storage tank.\n\nItem No.9.\n\nA change in the size of the wire was found necessary owing to the added connections placed on the line by the inclination of outbuildings not originally provided for. This expenditure included only the difference in cost of the two sizes of wire. If this work had to be done later, it would mean an outlay of possibly $175.00.\n\nIn connection with these extra expenditures it was considered advisable that this work should be done in the best interests of the Department of Indian Affairs and as found necessary by modifications of the original plans of both the school building and of the sewer and water system.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd.) W. C. Warren.\n\nP.S. Enclosed herewith is the final estimate certificate due to the contractors.

Water Power & Reclamation Service,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOTTAWA.\nJanuary 16, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is now considering the erection of a stock barn for the Alert Bay School and I should like to have some information from you as to just what size herd you propose keeping in order that the Department may know what accommodation should be provided.\n\nEnclosed herewith please find blue print of a barn erected at the Cariboo Indian Residential School at Williams Lake which has thirty cow stalls. The dimensions of this barn are 71'6\" by 33'. It will, of course, be unnecessary to build a barn at Alert Bay with as many cow stalls as is the case at Williams Lake in view of the fact it would be absolutely impossible for you to feed a herd of thirty cows and a bull owing to the fact there is very little feed on the land which has been cleared. At Williams Lake, however, the Roman Catholic Church have thousands of acres from which feed can be obtained. Generally I would think that provision for twelve cows with calf and bull pens would be all that would be required at your School, but before writing to the Department I thought I would like to hear from you on the subject.\n\nKindly let me have your reply by return mail as I wish to report on this and other matters in connection with the Alert Bay School at as early date as possible.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Sgd) W.H. Ditchburn.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure:\n\nF. Earl Anfield, Esq.,\nPrincipal Alert Bay Indian School,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nOttawa, February 6, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 270/23 of the 29th ultimo, with reference to the old school buildings at Alert Bay. The Department is in correspondence with Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn in this connection, and instructions will be issued at a later date. Concerning the kitchen ranges and any other movable equipment, whatever cannot be used in the new school or stored there for future use should be sold and the proceeds forwarded to the Department for deposit to casual revenue.\n\nI may say that the Department is considering the demolition of the old boys' building, by day labour, under your supervision. You will receive instructions at a later date.\n\nThe future use of the girls' building is now receiving consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay,\nB. C.\nOttawa, February 6, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to a safe for the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. In reply I have to state that the Department regrets there are no funds for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. G.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir-\n\nWould you kindly advise me what is intended to be done with the surplus material in the old school buildings. The Missionary Society of the Church in Canada have an idea they have some claim on it, but on the other hand, a great deal of the material was purchased directly by the Department. There are two kitchen ranges, one in each building, and unless something is done with them, they will very quickly deteriorate.\n\nI should also like to be advised what is intended to be done with the old Boys' School, whether it should be sold for the material that is in it, or whether it should simply be destroyed and burned. I do not think that any great sum could be obtained from it, as when a building is torn down and the lumber taken, it is usually so full of nails and other blemishes as to be not worth very much, in fact hardly worth the tearing down.\n\nHas any decision been arrived at yet regarding the old Girls' Home? There has been a good deal of discussion regarding this building, and personally I am of the opinion that if the Department intend establishing a tubercular sanitarium for the Indians, that this would make a good central station for it, being used as an administrative building, while the patients themselves could be put in small huts outside. As you are aware, there have been many recommendations made on this matter, and some of the most eminent specialists on tuberculosis have made extensive researches regarding this disease. If this place was set aside for incipient cases, more particularly for children, and a competent staff appointed to look after it, the children could be educated, as there are classrooms in this building itself, and I think there would be very little danger on account of its close proximity to the new building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M. Halliday)\nIndian Agent\n\nWMH/ST\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a letter just received from Mr. Anfield, Principal of the Alert Bay School, he directs my attention to the urgent need of a steel safe wherein may be deposited for safe keeping valuable documents belonging to himself and the School, as well as those of various staff agents. The need of this item of equipment is so obvious that I do not think it necessary to add anything further in this connection. It will be a great help to the School management and also to our Commission if your Department will either provide the same or authorize our Commission to do so. For some time I have felt that our Indian Residential School buildings should be provided with a vault wherein valuable account books, important letters and other such like things could be securely placed. On different occasions I have suggested to your Department that a vault should be placed in every new School constructed, but for some reason or other the suggestion has not been acted upon. In the absence of a vault at the Alert Bay School, a steel safe becomes an absolute necessity, and I shall be glad to have your decision with regard to the purchase of the safe at your earliest convenience.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\n\nDictated but not personally signed because of absence from the office.\n**BOILER INSPECTION ACT**\n\n**NOTICE OF ANNUAL FEES**\n\n| BOILER No. | Arrears | Current Year's Fees | Deductions | Balance due |\n|------------|---------|---------------------|------------|-------------|\n| 44325-B.C. |         | 5 00                |            |             |\n| 44261      |         | 8 62                |            |             |\n| 44262      |         | 9 62                |            | 22 24       |\n\n**PLEASE RETURN THIS ACCOUNT WITH YOUR FEES.**\n\n**Statutory Interest 6 per cent.**\n\nTotal due January 1st, 1930 (Last day for payment, January 31st, 1930)\n\n**NOTE.\u2014At the commencement of each calendar year a tax by way of a fee is levied on the owner of each boiler, as required by the \"Boiler Inspection Act.\" No Certificate of Inspection permitting further use of a boiler can be issued until all fees have been paid.

It is understood, of course, that this building is urgent. He was asked also for a recommendation regarding the urgency of other outbuildings.

As it is necessary that these accounts be received at the Department in triplicate and properly certified by either the local Indian agent or the principal of the school, I am returning herewith the accounts referred to and would request that you have them prepared in triplicate and forwarded to the principals of the various schools, in order that they can certify same, after which payment will be made by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The Department is satisfied that a stock barn should be provided without delay, and I have to request you to make a recommendation concerning the best method of construction.

Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn is being written regarding the other outbuildings which you mentioned and concerning the disposal of the buildings of the old school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo in which you inform me that the Church authorities have requested the Department to arrange for the following outbuildings at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School: stock barn, root house, hen house, hog pen, implement shed, wood shed and dairy.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I consider it is necessary that a new barn, implement shed, wood shed and dairy should be constructed at this School as all the present outbuildings are very old and have outlived their usefulness.\n\nSo far as the barn is concerned, I may say I am of the opinion that a structure similar to that put up at the Cariboo Indian School, shown on plan No. 563, would suit the purpose except that possibly its length could be cut down approximately seven feet as the number of cows which will be housed will not be over sixteen. I am attaching hereto a pencil sketch of a layout as proposed by Principal Anfield, but he has not reduced the length, also blueprint No. 563 of the barn for the Residential School at Williams Lake. If, however, eight stalls for cows on each side of the barn are provided for, this could be quite easily done and would, no doubt, materially reduce the cost of the structure from what it would be if it were built of the same dimension as that at the Cariboo School, which is 32' wide by 71'6\" in length, particularly as the principal would like to have the cement walls run up 4\u00bd\" above the flooring. The Principal would also like to have all floors and mangers of cement; but I do not think this would be a good thing to do as the cement floor in the cow stalls would be too hard on the feet of the cattle and in the long run we might have to cover these over with boarding afterwards. Cement litter alleys and gutters should be sufficient so far as the floor is concerned.\n\nIt is proposed to have the dairy form part of the building with the root cellar under the dairy, and I think this is a good idea instead of having to put up separate buildings.\n\nI am of the opinion there should be a small building erected to be utilized as a cooling plant, the same as we have at Lytton and Sechelt. This building could be of\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nheavy wood construction, but insulated with cork or shavings and the capacity should be not over one ton. Mr. George E. Mitchell, of Vancouver, installed the plants at Sechelt and Lytton and would be ready to undertake the installation of the one at Alert Bay. The building could be erected by the contractor and the compressor and engine installed by Mr. Mitchell.\n\nYou mention in your letter the removal of the old workshop at the Boys' School to the manual training building and attached thereto for a blacksmith shop. This I approve of.\n\nSo far as the barn is concerned, I am of the opinion it should be done by contract and a separate figure be obtained from the contractor for the removal of the old workshop at the Boys' School to the manual training buildings.\n\nIt is essential that an implement shed and wood shed should be erected and this work should also be done by the contractor after it is known just what is required.\n\nSo far as the hen house and hog pen are concerned, Principal Anfield has agreed to put these up if supplied with the material, but I am of the opinion that there ought to be sufficient lumber from the old wood shed and school when torn down which could be utilized for this purpose. I do not see it will be necessary to have any concrete work in either the hog pen or the hen house.\n\nI would also recommend that the Principal be supplied with sufficient cedar poles for a bull corral as he has agreed to erect this if supplied with the material.\n\nThe tearing down of the old school and the wood shed could be done by day labor, preferably by some of the local Indians under the supervision of Mr. Indian Agent Halliday who should see that the old material is stacked up as it will be of some use to the school for fuel purposes at least after what has been taken for the chicken house and hog pens. The site on which the old building stands should be properly leveled off and this can be done by day labor also with the utilization of the school tractor and scrapers.\n\nI am attaching hereto for your consideration a copy of a letter received from Mr. Anfield in which he sets forth his views with regard to the barn.\n\nIt would be in the interest of the Department if Mr. Gow's services could be again utilized as Inspector of Works for these new buildings. If the plans and specifications are gotten up at an early date and tenders called for, I would suggest that the work of repair to the wharf be carried out at the same time and by the same Authority for the wharf repair has already been given me by Mr. Scott, but it could undoubtedly be done at less cost when the other construction, referred to above, is going on. I have, however, asked Mr. Thomas Carson, the contractor who built the\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6427, file 875-5, part 2)\nIndian Residential School,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nJanuary 18th, 1930.\n\nW.M. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commission for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn:\n\nWe have to acknowledge with pleasure your 15/6/16520 of the 16th instant, conveying the information that the Department is contemplating the early construction of a stock barn for this School. The enclosed blue print has been carefully studied in conjunction with your request, and we have the honour to place before you the following suggestions:\n\n(1) Size of herd.\n\nThis in our opinion should take into consideration our capacity for providing feed, and also and very important the capacity of the school, which we might say will average less than 175. It is, we know, the earnest desire of the Department that their Indian children receive as much milk as possible, and we must expect to have to provide hay and feed for some two years or more yet. May we amend your suggested number of 12 to a total stall capacity of 16.\n\n(2) Additional needs to stalls:\n\nWe would suggest that the plan include a bull pen, calf pen, and calving pen for cows. A sketch is enclosed which we pass on to convey our ideas to you. Instead of the large amount of space allocated to cow stalls we would suggest accommodation for one team of horses with harness room, one dairy with concrete cooling pit, and beneath this a root cellar with a capacity of at least 25 tons of roots and vegetables.\n\n(3) Weather conditions:\n\nIn view of the vast amount of rainfall at Alert Bay, we place before you for consideration:\n(a) The need of a concrete manure pit.\n(b) The essential need of careful tile drainage around this barn.\n(c) That the walls of the weather side be waterproofed as much as possible (we draw to your attention the fact that the weather side walls of the residence of the new school are always damp).\n(d) That the concrete walls of this barn be built up to 4 feet 6 inches from the floor.\n(e) That all floors and mangers be of concrete rather than plank. We would estimate that the weather here especially in winter would render plank floors a poor investment.\n\n(4) Ventilation Shafts.\n\nWe have only one man on the farm here and......\nand the boys will necessarily have a lot of work in the barn, and in view of the fire risk, would recommend metal vents rather than wood.\n\n(5) Water:\n\nProvision is made for connections for the barn on the present pipe line from the well, by closing off certain valves on the pump, a constant pressure can be maintained from the storage tank.\n\n(6) Equipment:\n\nWe would be most grateful for your favourable consideration to the installation of the barn complete with either Beatty (BT) or Louden Barn equipment, with a preference for the former as we really believe that in the long run such equipment is cheaper than wooden materials. It is important in our opinion, that the steel stanchions be of the swivel type and that the manger partition be movable for cleaning purposes.\n\n(7) Bull Corral:\n\nWould the Department consider a cedar post corral. There is no cedar on this island and we can ill afford to buy.\n\n(8) Electric Light:\n\nProvision is made on the present power line for a hook up to barn. We suggest that the necessary lights be installed.\n\n(9) Colour:\n\nWe place before you the suggestion that the roof be painted green, the walls light grey with green trimmings.\n\n(10) Chicken House (a), Hog pen (b), Implement shed (c).\n\nOur Commission are anxious that these subsidiary buildings be erected as soon as convenient to the Department. We are anxious to aid in every possible way and would be pleased to recommend to our Commission that should the Department care to include in this contract the plans and materials for (a) and (b), that we would undertake the construction ourselves. In the case of (b) we would suggest that if the contract included the concrete work necessary, and the materials were provided, we would build this also apart from the concrete.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted and thanking you for this opportunity of placing our views before the Department.\n\nBelieve me, very truly yours,\n\n(Sgd.) F. Earl Anfield.\n\nPrincipal.\n\nEnclosures 1 and 2.\nOttawa, February 7, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15/6/16602 of the 25th ultimo, with reference to outbuildings and related matters at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. Under separate cover, you will receive instructions regarding the stock barn with combined dairy and root house facilities and concerning the demolition of the old boys' building.\n\nThe Department regrets that there are no funds for the erection, this year, of the cold storage, implement shed and wood shed. I am pleased to learn that the school authorities are prepared to erect a hen house and a hog pen, without cost to the Department, using the materials from the demolished old boys' building and wood shed.\n\nWhoever is responsible for the erection of the stock barn should arrange for the removal of the work shop at the old boys' school to the manual training buildings on the new site and also for the repairs to the wharf, which have already been authorized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nBox 666, Victoria,\nB. C.\nFebruary 6, 1930.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Commissioner Ditchburn has replied to the Department's request for a recommendation concerning outbuildings and related matters at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. He recommends the erection of a barn with dairy and root house combined, at an early date; and, as funds will be available, I wish to recommend that the work be proceeded with. Mr. Orr states that it could be done by contract or day labour. Mr. Ditchburn recommends a contract, but Mr. Orr believes it might be done at less cost if on a day labour basis.\n\nWhoever builds the cow barn should be responsible for the repairs to the wharf, which have already been authorized, and also for the removal of the old work shop at the old Boys' School to the manual training building on the new site.\n\nMr. Ditchburn recommends an implement shed and wood shed and a hen house, hog pen and cold storage; but, as there are no funds available for these purposes, their provision will have to wait, unless the school authorities can arrange to erect some of the outbuildings without cost to the Department. They could use the materials in the old boys' building.\n\nMr. Ditchburn recommends the early demolition of the old boys' building and the levelling of the ground. Funds for this also are available. You will remember that there is included in the Main Estimates an item of $10,000 for these purposes.\n\nRussell T. Senier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n| QUANTITY ORDERED | CAT.

This is a large and high building, and in the event of a conflagration at the rear of the building, there is no way of getting children out from the top floors.

Will you please advise me the name of a competent foreman who may be engaged to look after this work. Also the names of firms from whom lumber and hardware may be purchased.\n\nARCHITECT.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nMarch 31, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nIn making allotments of the money appropriated for\nthe coming fiscal year which begins tomorrow, kindly bear in\nmind the requirements of the new Residential School in the\nmatter of barns and outbuildings. You wrote me some time ago\nthat later on I would receive instructions about tearing down\nthe old Boys' School; with regard to this building I would\nlike to make a suggestion.\n\nAttached to the building, but separate from it, is\na building that was used for a class-room and a workshop, which\nis in fair condition, and could be used for other purposes. I\nwould recommend that when this old building comes to be des-\ntroyed, that it be allowed to move the old shop and class-room\nreferred to, to be used for a tool-shed. It would require a\nlarge door cut in each end, but would make a splendid building\nfor the purpose mentioned, and the expense would be not much\ngreater than it would be to tear it down.\n\nWhen the appropriation is given for the barn, I would\nnot consider it necessary that an inspector be appointed. I\nthink the most satisfactory way would be that I should get a\ngood foreman, and have the work done by day labor, as the De-\npartment then would pay for exactly what they got, and it would\nbe much more satisfactory in every way.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M.

(RG 10, Volume 6427, file 875-5, part 2)\nVancouver, B.C.,\nMay 2, 1930.\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb:\n\nRE - Alert Bay School,\nWater and Sewer System\n\nWork was commenced on the above project on the 22nd of August and completed early in November.\n\nSome few alterations were made and some additional work required as outlined in my memorandum of December 2nd, 1929.\n\nThe total cost of the work was $18,095.20 including all extras, fire equipment and supervision. The equipment supplied by the contractors, Messrs. Bartholomew and Montgomery Co., was procured through Messrs. Pumps and Powers, Ltd., as manufacturers' agents. Types and manufacturers' names are given below.\n\nFire Pumping Equipment.\n\nPump. Worthington Pump Co. Type 4L5.\n6-inch suction and 4-inch discharge which has been enlarged to 8-inch suction and 6-inch discharge.\n\nEngine. The pump is direct connected to a 60 H.P. 6-cylinder 4-cycle continental engine, with a governed speed of 1800 R.F.M. This engine is provided with dual ignition consisting of magneto and battery type. This pumping unit is capable of a considerable increase in output over its specification rating of 500 g.p.m.\n\nDomestic Pumping Plant.\n\nThis plant, also supplied through Messrs. Pumps & Powers, Ltd., consists of Petters 5 H.P. crude oil engine (Mfrs. agents B.C. Equipment Co.) belt connected to a Pomona deep well pump.\n\nThe installed length of pump and casing is 65 feet, the depth of the well being 76 feet and depth to water 55 feet.\n\nThe pump is a 15 stage type fitting into a 6 inch casing. A full description is given in Messrs. Pumps & Powers quotation, dated March 22, 1929.\nTests run of the pump showed a capacity of 45 g.p.m. into the reservoir but the engine at this output was apparently overloaded and the pump capacity was reduced to 30 g.p.m., the output for which the plant was designed.\n\nWhen it was originally decided upon adopting this type of pump no information was available as to the capacity of the well, nor was there means at hand for testing this, the greatest output possible with the old pump being 12 g.p.m. The object in view was the development of the well to its full capacity so as to obviate the necessity of long hours of pumping. When it becomes necessary to renew or overhaul the present Petters engine I would suggest that an 8 h.p. size be installed in its place. This will allow an increased output to 60 or possibly 65 g.p.m., which is more desirable for the school where so much water is used.\n\nAlterations have been made in the working drawings corresponding to the changes noted in my memorandum previously referred to herein.\n\nW.C. Warren\nAssistant Hydraulic Engineer\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, relative to the request which you received from the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School to be supplied with one dozen Firegas fire extinguishers.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that in October, 1928, the Department supplied 4 - 5 gallon pump tank extinguishers and 4 - 1\u00bd quart extinguishers made by the Pyrene Manufacturing Company, and it may be that there are other extinguishers on hand. Before considering the request of the Principal, please inform the Department as to the number and size of the fire extinguishers on hand, and the name of the manufacturer, also if they are kept in good condition. Should the extinguishers on hand require to be recharged, you may arrange for the purchase of the chemicals required for the purpose, and the Principal should see that the extinguishers are thoroughly overhauled and placed in good condition.\n\nThe Department is not favourably impressed with the terms under which the Firegas extinguishers are furnished, being on a rental basis. While the Department is anxious that sufficient fire equipment be provided, we will await your report as to the number of extinguishers on hand before giving consideration to authorizing any further supply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Holliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Alert Bay Residential School, with regard to fire extinguishers, and asking that one dozen fire gas extinguishers are necessary to complete the equipment for fire protection at the school. This \"Firegas\" comes in small glass vials which are sealed. They do not deteriorate with age, nor is there anything in them to corrode. They are put up by the \"Firegas Service Limited, 536 Yonge Street, Toronto\", and I would recommend that they be purchased.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M.

(RC 1C, Volume 6427, file 875-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nMr. W.E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner of B.C.,\nVictoria.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of April 15th, 1930, #15-6-17399 and also your letter of more recent date, I deeply regret that I have been for the last few weeks quite ill, and unable to attend to this matter at an earlier date.\n\nI now have pleasure, however, in submitting my report together with a letter given me by Principal Anfield at the residential school at Alert Bay, of May 5th. This letter I am glad to say will show that with the exception of the remarks which I have to make regarding the seepage and the raising of the chimneys that Mr. Anfield appears to be from the enclosed letter perfectly satisfied with all else in connection with the building.\n\nI now beg to submit my report. Upon arriving at Alert Bay, I first got in touch with your Indian Agent, Mr. Halliday. He seemed to be perfectly satisfied that I should simply act upon the former list of complaints submitted to you by the Principal, of which at the time he also sent me a copy, with the result that I went up to the school and for two or three days made a thorough investigation of everything even before going up I was convinced that it was not the roof which was leaking, and upon investigation was further convinced that this was the case. I know of two or three places in town here which have given exactly the same trouble, and it is simply a matter of heavy drifting rains penetrating the brick and getting into the plaster. The methods used here have always been to thoroughly waterproof sections of the outside, and I feel sure that if this is done on certain portions of the school at Alert Bay, that the question of dampness will be eliminated. I need scarcely go into the matter of which portions of the building this need be applied to, but would say that the extent needing such a thorough waterproofing is not one half of the entire exterior of brick work. The front of the building, as you are probably aware was done under instructions at my request. Mr. Halliday however appears to be fully conversant with the portions needing such treatment and has even got prices of certain waterproofing material. I imagine I need not go any further into this matter. It is not that the job of necessity would be very expensive, except for the fact that at Alert Bay there would be no one capable of carrying it out. It would therefore mean that men and equipment must of necessity go from Vancouver. This matter I took up with the Principal and his wish in the matter was that the work in any case be not carried out until July, when the summer holidays started, and of course we were both agreed that if the proposed barn was going to be built, that the question concerning the waterproofing with the contractor on the job would be materially lessened.\n\nThe only other matter as seen by the principal's letter was the matter of the raising of the chimneys. These chimneys are constructed according to specification (or at least within a few inches of such) but I am fully convinced that to get...\ngot the best results from the large chimney carrying the two main boilers, that it should be raised to a height of twenty feet in excess of what it is at present. The chimney from the kitchen and laundry would not of necessity need to be raised more than another four or five feet to obtain good results I think. The only remaining one then, is that on the residence, which undoubtedly should be carried up to a height two or three feet in excess of the main building, or I am afraid no matter how they cap it, with certain winds it would be liable to give trouble.\n\nI am deeply sorry that this report has not been submitted at an earlier date, but it was absolutely unavoidable.\n\nReferring again to your letter of May 27th, 15-6-17821 and referring to the last paragraph re account for services rendered, I herewith enclose accounts in triplicate as requested and would ask that owing to having been laid up for such a length of time, that if possible the account be forwarded to me from Victoria instead of Ottawa.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

Gow, Esq.,\nInspector of Works,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nWe have to acknowledge your instructions from Mr. Ditchburn, Indian Commissioner, under his file 15/6/17399 of the 15th inst., to inspect the building with a view to ascertaining any defects, and to report on what remedial measures should be taken, if required.\n\nAfter a careful inspection of the plant, we, the school, find that following Mr. Carson's last trip, no structural defects are now apparent, other than some abnormal shrinkage in wood work. The roofs and coping are, in our opinion, now water tight.\n\nWe however suggest that you report fully on the question of water coming through the walls, and also of the necessity of raising the main and other chimney stacks.\n\nSomething must be done about waterproofing the brickwork, if the health standard of our children is to be maintained, and in the interests of economical administration, the stacks should be hoisted. We also would appreciate your report on the condition of the Principal's residence.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) F. Earl Anfield.\nPrincipal.\nVancouver, B. C.\nJune 3rd, 1930.\n\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHaving been ill for some time it is only now at this late date that I am able to forward the enclosed accounts, which undoubtedly entitle Mr. Carson, the contractor to certain extra sums.\n\nHaving left the building myself before all this correspondence took place I do not feel that I can actually state just what Mr. Carson is entitled to.\n\nI however, trust that from the enclosed correspondence you may be able to do so, and as a result Mr. Carson may be forwarded the necessary cheque, covering what he is entitled to.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEnc.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nP.O. BOX 166\nVICTORIA, B.C., March 21, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant from which I am pleased to learn that Mr. Carson, the contractor of the Alert Bay Indian School, has visited that institution since I wrote you on the 7th ultimo and made the necessary alterations and repairs and that the Principal is now perfectly satisfied. I, however, have not received any report from the Principal in this matter but, no doubt, your statement is correct.\n\nIn connection with that part of your communication which states Mr. Carson requests you take up with me the matter of some three hundred odd dollars still owing to him, I beg to say this apparently has to do with the work mentioned in the letter to myself from Principal Anfield, dated October 31st, 1929, which you certified as correct. A copy of that communication I forwarded to you on the 20th December, addressed to the Angeles Hotel, Vancouver, but in the event of your not receiving the same a further copy is submitted herewith. I may inform you, however, that as no accounts in connection with the construction of the school were sent in by this office, the information contained in the latter of Mr. Anfield was taken as information only. You were the man representing the Department during the construction of this school and had the duty of authorizing any accounts for expenses which were authorized and that procedure should have been taken in connection with this particular work. If Mr. Carson is fully convinced that he was not paid for this work, the only thing for him to do is to make out an itemized account and have it submitted to the Department after being fully certified by yourself. This may be either forwarded to my office or to the Department direct at Ottawa. A checking will have to be made at Ottawa as to whether or not this work has already been paid for.\n\nNow your information I may say Mr. Carson called at my office some little time ago, but I was over at the Parliament Buildings when he called. He, however, promised to come back before he returned to Vancouver, but did not do so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.E. Ditchburn\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure:-\n\nCaptain A.M. Cow,\nP.O. Box 1244,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDecember 20, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Gow:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th instant in which you inform me that Mr. Carson has asked you to look into certain matters for him and that you would like some information with regard to an expenditure of $240.00 and you can not recollect whether it was for the uncrating of furniture and the placing of desks, etc., in the school and also Mr. Carson seems to be of the opinion that he omitted to charge the sum of $16.50 for four sets of castors for the laundry trucks.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the $240.00 item apparently covered the work mentioned in a letter written by Principal Anfield on the 31st of October, and which was certified to by yourself. A copy of the same is attached hereto for your information. It is anticipated that you sent in a voucher to Ottawa for this amount in favour of Mr. Carson.\n\nAs regards the $16.50 for the four pairs of castors for the laundry trucks, I may inform you that I was under the impression that Mr. Carson charged for these, when he made the trucks, for on the 7th of September last Principal Anfield, when writing to me with regard to the laundry trucks, intimated that these were being manufactured at the School and asked if he could purchase castors and forward the bills to myself. On this point he was informed on the 10th of September that it would be more advisable that the carpenter who was making the trucks should fit them with castors of a proper size.\n\nIn the memo. which you furnished me with on Nov. 2nd, the day of the opening of the School, there is an item of $5,922.50 for \"separate contract for lockers, cupboards, shelving, etc.\" and it would appear to me the cost of the laundry trucks complete with castors would be included in this item.

Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 31st ultimo with reference to the new Alert Bay Indian Residential School I am today writing to Commissioner Ditchburn asking him to have an inspection made of this building immediately and report to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing, Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nDr. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\n41-43 the Bible House,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nApril 8, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th February regarding the new Alert Bay School, I have received further complaints from the Indian Agent that the roof of the new building is leaking and that other defects have appeared. Can you arrange to have Mr. Gow, who was the Inspector of Construction on this work, go to Alert Bay and make an inspection of this building and submit a report to you which should be forwarded to the Department with your comments.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing, Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B.C.\nWinnipeg, Man. March 31st, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received various letters from the Principal of our Alert Bay School advising me of the damage sustained by the new School building through the heavy rains which obtain in that part. As the Principal had reported the situation fully to your local Indian Agent, and requested him to submit the same to your Department for immediate action, I did not consider it necessary to address any communication to you in this connection, as I felt assured that immediate steps would be taken by you to remedy the defects in the flat roof and to make the walls of the building weatherproof. As I have not been advised by the Principal that any remedial action has as yet been taken, I shall be obliged if you will kindly let me know if this important matter is receiving your attention. The seriousness of the situation is revealed by the following statement in a letter received from the Principal, and dated Feb. 22nd:\n\n\"During one recent heavy rain, I visited the Jr. Girls' dormitory, and the walls were literally running water into pools on the floor. This is going to be fatal to the children's health........ and will ruin the plaster of the entire face walls of the building.\"\n\nIn his letter of the same date to Mr. Indian Agent Halliday he gives a list of the other rooms where the inside walls literally ran with water. From this information it is obvious that prompt and vigorous action is necessary to make it possible for the School management to carry on their work. The Principal has reported different staff agents who are suffering from minor ailments and it is possible that these have been either brought on or aggravated by the damp condition of the building. I shall be deeply obliged, therefore, if you will kindly let me know\nThat remedial action is being taken by your Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRN/JF\nSir:\n\nSeveral reports have been forwarded you regarding leaks in the new Residential School. During the past winter we have had several extremely heavy rains with wind, and the walls all through on the south-east end of the building were saturated; in fact one night it ran over the floor. The building, as you are aware, is a brick and tile structure, with only one thickness of brick on the outside walls, and it is quite apparent that the moisture comes through the walls themselves. I have taken this matter up with a view of finding a remedy for it, and I wrote to Marshall-Wells B.C. Ltd to see if they had any paint that could be used.\n\nIn reply they sent me a small pamphlet on a water-proof cement which is called \"Bondex\" and which comes in sixteen different colors. It seems to be made of Portland Cement with other materials in it. In their pamphlet they say it can either be put on with a large kalsomine brush or can be sprayed on, and will only adhere to such substances as brick and concrete. If it is sprayed onto wood it will wash off. The cost would not be very great. It sells at $19.00 a hundred pounds, and will cover approximately 25 square feet per pound with one coat. It is usually mixed seven pounds to a gallon of water. They add that \"Bondex is a dry powder type of paint made on a basis of white Portland Cement and for this reason only tends to harden in rain, and will wear like iron under any and all weather conditions.\"\n\nI would recommend that this matter receive consideration of the architect or those in charge of the buildings, as it would appear from the reports that I have received from it that it would be a splendid thing to use on the building, and would not cost a very great deal. Of course I am aware that nothing can be done\nduring the present fiscal year which is now almost expired, but it might be done before the next fall rains start in. Owing to the fact that it is a compound of cement, it should be put on in rather damp weather, or the walls damped before being applied, so that it will adhere to the brick work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M. Halliday)\nIndian Agent\n\nWMH/SMT\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing a letter from the Principal of the Indian Residential School at Alert Bay regarding leaking roofs on the new building. This letter speaks for itself, and needs no comment from me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M. Halliday)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Halliday:\n\nWe have to advise you that during the recent rains on Monday and Tuesday of this week, the roofs of this building leaked terribly, to the extent that pools of water formed in the laundry, top dormitories, and the upstairs rooms of the residence. The face walls of the building in the laundry and residence were soaking wet.\n\nWe would appreciate your drawing this matter to the attention of your Department, as we understood the roof was to be guaranteed against leakage for five years.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nP. O. BOX 66\nVICTORIA, B.C., February 8, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo with which you enclosed copy of a letter from the Principal of the Alert Bay School, supplied to Mr. Indian Agent Halliday and his comments on the same, this matter having particular reference to the omission by the contractor in carrying out certain clauses in the Specifications and the defect in the roofing.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that while I have written to both Mr. Cow, the Inspector of Works, and Mr. Carson, the Contractor, on this matter, I may inform you that as regards item No. 3 in the Principal's letter which deals with storm windows not having been supplied, these were not installed at his own request, nor when I was at Alert Bay myself about the 17th July last, the Principal informed me that the double windows would not be necessary and it was thought the amount of money which these would cost could be very well utilized for the building of necessary fixtures. This point, you will observe, I referred to in my letter of the 24th July last.\n\nWith regard to the Principal's desire to be supplied with copies of the drainage plans, I will write to the Dominion Water Power Branch asking that a set should be gotten up and forwarded to the Principal as the plans for the drainage system were compiled by that Branch of the Dominion Government.\n\nIt is noted the Principal states a number of cracks are appearing in the corners of the different walls which he seems to be of the opinion is due to subsidence taking place in the two heavier wings of the building. These cracks, however, I believe are due more to shrinkage of the green timber that was put into the building, which, in the case of heavy timbers, are never thoroughly dried out, particularly in a place such as Alert Bay.\n\nI will write you further when I hear from Mr. Cow and Mr. Carson.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. E. Ditchburn\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJan. 30, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith copies of letters received from Indian Agent Halliday with reference to the new Alert Bay School, and I would ask you to kindly get in touch with Mr. Thomas Carson, the contractor, and Mr. A. M. Gow, who acted as Inspector of Construction on this work, and advise me what you recommend.\n\nIf the complaints are correct it would appear that Mr. Gow has not properly carried out his duties as Inspector of Construction on this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing, Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nM. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVICTORIA, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter which I have just received from the Principal of the Indian Residential School at Alert Bay. With regard to the last paragraph of his letter, in which he states that wide cracks are showing in the corners of the rooms, suggesting to him that subsidence is taking place in the two heavier wings of the building, I have to advise you that I went into this matter very carefully and there is no appearance of any subsidence, but there is an appearance that the walls have not been properly tied to the floor joists, and that there is a certain amount of shrinkage, leaving a crack on both walls of about one-quarter of an inch. This, however, could be very easily repaired.\n\nThe roof and walls of the Principal's residence are leaking badly, and on the time of my inspection, on the 4th instant, the wall in one of the bedrooms was saturated, and he advised me at the same time that on the sleeping porch of the residence, the water poured through freely with the heavy rains.\n\nTo my mind, the most serious defect in the construction has been entirely overlooked by the Principal, although we discussed it on the 4th instant. There are two chimneys or flues in the back part of the building. One takes away the smoke from the heating furnaces and the steam boiler, while the other takes away the smoke from the kitchen and bakery. Both these chimneys are altogether too low, and should be raised at least fifteen feet higher. The winds are very variable here, and when it blows in certain directions, it strikes from the main building, and blows down the chimney, filling the whole place with smoke. I understand they had the same trouble with the Lytton school, and that they raised the chimney three or four times, but I would recommend that this be brick to a height of not less than three feet higher than the top of the main building, to absolutely protect it from the squalls which strike the building and blow the smoke down.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M; Halliday)\nIndian Agent\n\nWMH/SMT\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nIndian Residential School,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nJanuary 3rd, 1930\n\nW.M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Halliday:\n\nWe have to advise you that after a careful inspection of the school and a study of the specifications pertaining to the construction, we find that the following items have been either omitted by the contractor or are in need of attention from him:\n\n(1) Specifications call for 2 coats whitewash for boiler room. This has not been done.\n\n(2) Liquid door checks are specified for all outside doors with exception of residence. None are installed and they are badly needed.\n\n(3) No storm windows have been supplied. Whilst it is possible that they are not needed for all windows, we recommend that they be installed on all windows on south and southeast walls.\n\n(4) Section 13 calls for a drainage plan to be supplied. We would appreciate a copy of this for use in locating drains, sewers, etc.\n\n(5) Specifications call for new slip safety treads on all outside steps. None are installed.\n\n(6) Section 25 not carried out at all, as no steel plates have been put on any doors in school.\n\n(7) No screen doors have been supplied (Section 37).\n\n(8) There are no ventilating registers in bathrooms or kitchens.\n\n(9) No fastenings or catches installed on windows in kitchen corridor.\n\n(10) Several cupboards without necessary fittings.\n\n(11) One large pane muranese glass broken by carpenters not replaced.\nWe have to advise you also that the roof and walls of the Principal's residence are leaking badly, one inside wall of bedroom being continuously in a soaked condition. The roof of the corridor between auditorium and main building also require attention.\n\nIt is also necessary that we inform you that in several places (chiefly in the central part of the building) wide cracks are showing in the corners of rooms, suggesting to us that subsidence is taking place in the two heavier wings of the building.\n\nWe will be grateful to you for advising your Department of these conditions.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Sgd)\"F.Earl Anfield\"\n\nPrincipal\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring my recent visit to Alert Bay, I went carefully over the new Indian Residential School building provided by your Department on behalf of our Society, and also over the land attached thereto, which is in process of being cleared, and made a list of certain requirements which I now beg to submit for your early and favourable consideration. These are, in part, as follows:\n\n1. Furniture for the Principal's residence. (The only room in this part of the building which may be said to be fully furnished is what is known as the guest room).\n\n2. A dairy with full dairy room equipment, including cream separator, churn, etc.\n\n3. Mechanical dough mixer with a capacity of one barrel of flour. (The school management will make the kneading trough, if the materials are supplied).\n\n4. Enlargement of the storage space for the coal required for the kitchen ranges. (The freight on coal is much cheaper if delivered in large quantities, and the coal bin provided can be extended without great additional cost).\n\n5. Storm windows for the front and South-east walls of the main school building.\n\n6. Rug for the staff sitting room. (Size of room, 14' x 16').\n\n7. Chesterfield suite for the staff sitting room.\nLinoleum rugs for the visitors room. (Size of room 11' x 14').\n\nTo complete the ceiling of the boiler room with metallic sheets. (This will add to the appearance as well as to the safety of this part of the building. At present only the space above the boilers is covered in this way).\n\n10. To exchange the 33 vertical tubular boiler for one with a capacity of 10, as the smaller one cannot possibly meet the needs of so large a School.\n\n11. To cover the main lead pipe in the store room, and all uncovered pipes with asbestos lagging. (At the time of my visit the lead pipe in the store room was sweating badly, and injuring the supplies).\n\n12. To provide a steam mangle for the laundry and a suitable stove for heating the smoothing irons. (The stove provided is altogether too small, the top having a diameter of about 18\" only).\n\n13. To put a V-joint ceiling in the work shop, 20' x 40', and to install 4 radiators of the long wall type in this building for heating purposes.\n\n14. To make a roadway from the School to the Cannery wharf to facilitate the transportation of supplies. (The Deputy Supt. General received an estimate of the cost of this, I was informed, at the time of his visit last year).\n\n15. To raise above high water mark, and to extend further out from the shore, the temporary wharf built by the contractor in front of the School. Pender logs should also be provided.\n\n16. To make a path from the School to the salt water fire defence engine house. (This is very necessary, as this house is approximately 300 yds. from the School, and if it is to be reached quickly, a good path should be provided.\n\n17. To build a stock barn, root house, implement shed (100' x 30') poultry house and piggery. These buildings are very urgent, especially the stock barn, as the provincial authorities have informed the Principal that they cannot place the School herd on the pure-bred stock list until a suitable building for the herd's accommodation has been provided. In the Deputy Superintendent General's letter of March 30, 1927, 160-2, he expressed the hope that the contract for the new School would be let as a unit, and that there would be no interruption in the activity.\n\n18. To build a wood wheel or provide the materials for the same.\n\n19. To provide a 1\u00bd ton refrigerator plant, the same to be housed in a separate concrete building.\n\n20. To provide fencing material, milk cows (Red Foles desired) pigs and poultry.\nTo provide 12 dozen Yale locks, 300 lbs. red clover seed, and 100 lbs. lawn grass seed.\n\n22. To provide a motor truck for hauling supplies from the wharf to the School, also a motor boat.\n\nIn addition to the above, all of which, I think you will agree, are very necessary, and for the most part urgent, I beg to request that the services of a man be provided by the Department for one year, to assist in getting the School grounds, especially around the main School building, levelled up, in building fences, making roads, planting trees, etc. The salary expected would be about $50.00 a month, and if your Department will agree to this for one year, our Commission will undertake to find the man and to give him his board and accommodation. The condition of the grounds at present make it practically impossible for the School management to keep the School clean, especially in wet weather, and that is the kind which usually prevails in that part. Moreover, there are certain old buildings to be removed, and play ground space provided for the children. The services of the man requested will be a great help to the School management, and I shall be obliged if you will let me know at the earliest date possible, if your Department will agree to his appointment.\n\nThere are a number of other requirements which I wish to submit to your Department, but I am awaiting certain measurements and further information with regard to kinds and quantities, which the Principal undertook to send me. When these have come to hand I will write to you again.\n\nThe question of the disposal of the buildings which constituted the old schools is one which should receive your immediate attention, especially the disposal of the Boys' Industrial School building. This stands at present on ground which should be incorporated in the recreation space for the boy pupils, and unless it is removed, the work of laying out the School grounds will be delayed.\n\nWith regard to the building which was used as a class room and work shop at the Boys' Industrial School, before the new frame class room was erected, and which is now used for manual training, I beg to suggest this building be placed at the end of the building which is used for manual training and carpentry work, and equipped for giving manual training in iron work. The two buildings might be connected with a closed passage, and heated from a central heating plant.\n\nI commend the above matters to your earliest and most sympathetic consideration, and have the honour to remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Gow, however, is of the opinion that the exterior of the building should be covered with a waterproof mixture to keep out dampness, though he does not say just what this mixture is or where it is obtainable. Mr. Gow states all the chimneys should be added to in height, this, no doubt, to increase draught and prevent smoking though there were no complaints in this regard when I was at Alert Bay in October last at the time the school was opened.\n\nI am also attaching hereto Mr. Gow's account for $61.00 being balance due him for his trip to Alert Bay and work of inspection, the sum of $50.00 having been advanced to him by the Department about the 24th of April.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

The equipment supplied by the contractors,\nMessrs. Bartholomew and Montgomery, Co., was pro-\ncured through Messrs. Pumps and Powers, Ltd., as\nmanufacturers' agents. Types and manufacturers'\nnames are given below.\n\nFIRE PUMPING EQUIPMENT\n\nPump. Worthington Pump Co. - Type 4L3.\n6-inch suction and 4-inch discharge which\nhas been enlarged to 8-inch suction and 6-inch\ndischarge.\n\nEngine. The pump is direct connected to a 60 H.P.\n6-cylinder 4-cycle continental engine,\nwith a governed speed of 1800 R.P.M. This engine\nis provided with dual ignition consisting of magneto\nand battery type. This pumping unit is capable of a\nconsiderable increase in output over its specification\nrating of 500 g.p.m.\nDOMESTIC PUMPING PLANT\n\nThis plant, also supplied through Messrs. Pumps and Powers, Ltd., consists of Petters 5 H.P. crude oil engine (Manufacturers' agents B.C. Equipment Co.) belt connected to a Pomona deep well pump.\n\nThe installed length of pump and casing is 65 feet, the depth of the well being 76 feet and depth of water 55 feet.\n\nThe pump is a 15 stage type fitting into a 6-inch casing. A full description is given in Messrs. Pumps and Powers quotation, dated March 22, 1929.\n\nTests run of the pump showed a capacity of 45 g.p.m. into the reservoir but the engine at this output was apparently overloaded and the pump capacity was reduced to 30 g.p.m., the output for which the plant was designed.\n\nWhen it was originally decided upon adopting this type of pump no information was available as to the capacity of the well, nor was there means at hand for testing this, the greatest output possible with the old pump being 12 g.p.m. The object in view was the development of the well to its full capacity so as to obviate the necessity of long hours of pumping. When it becomes necessary to renew or overhaul the present Petters engine I would suggest that an 8 h.p. size be installed in its place. This will allow an increased output to 60 or possibly 65 g.p.m., which is more desirable for the school where so much water is used.\n\nAlterations have been made in the working\ndrawings corresponding to the changes noted in my memorandum previously referred to herein.\n\nW.

You also stated an accountable cheque in payment of labor would be sent me upon application.\n\nIn reply I beg to say Mr. Indian Agent Halliday was furnished with the plans and specifications of the barn for the Cariboo School and pencil sketches of what is considered necessary at Alert Bay. Mr. Gibbons has been employed as working foreman at $6.00 per day and rough carpenters will be paid at the rate of $4.80 per day, these being the prevailing wages of the district. A start has been made on clearing the ground and the demolition of the old Boys' School as it was found that there would be plenty of 2\" planking, joists and rafters to floor the new barn, thus effecting considerable economy, and there will also be enough other material to make the cement forms at any rate up to the ground level of the barn. No Indian labor has been so far employed as none are available owing to the fact that they are all out fishing, but as soon as any are available, they will be employed as far as possible on unskilled work.\n\nI would be obliged if you would immediately wire to me through the Royal Bank of Canada, the sum of $3,000.00 in order that I may draw on the same to pay the labor accounts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Ditchburn\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nFunds wired your credit Royal Bank, Victoria, re Alert Bay School.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\n\nCharge Dept. Indian Affairs.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJuly 14, 1930\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of June 27, relative to a request received through this office from the Principal of the Residential School at Alert Bay, to be supplied with one dozen Fire-Gas Fire Extinguishers, I have to advise you that the Principal reports as follows:\n\n\"The following equipment is on hand in good condition and all of which is kept regularly charged and ready for use:-\n\nA. \u2713 4 only \"Pyrene\" hand extinguishers, 1\u00bd qt., installed in engine houses, generator room, and Caterpillar Tractor.\n\nB. \u2713 8 only 4 gallon \"Guardene\" chemical extinguishers, installed on all landings of main building.\n\nC. \u2713 4 only 5 gallon \"Pyrene\" pumping extinguishers, for use in wood working shops and boiler room only.\n\nThe Principal adds that his reason in requesting the Fire-Gas type was that they act without human aid. An extinguisher is only as good as the man who finds the fire, but the Fire-Gas type works alone.\n\nThe Principal says he wishes to stress the need of a 30 foot extension fire ladder for use in emergency at the infirmary balcony. Regarding this, it would appear to me that when the Department is partly providing for the salary of a manual training instructor, it should be good training for the boys to make this ladder themselves.\n\nIn conformity with your instructions, I am ordering some material for recharging, for which an account will be sent later.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M. Halliday)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, July 26, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, stating the number of fire extinguishers on hand at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School and where same are installed. In checking over this equipment, and noting where the extinguishers are installed, it is thought that there is a sufficient number on hand for adequate protection, provided they are kept in good condition. It is noted that you have ordered materials for recharging the extinguishers on hand. You should see that the Principal overhauls all the extinguishers, putting in the recharges, and that they are placed in good condition and ready for immediate use in case of fire.\n\nAs stated in letter of the 27th ultimo, the Department is not favourably impressed with the terms under which the Firegas extinguishers are furnished by the Company manufacturing same. The Department prefers to purchase outright any equipment for use in its schools.\n\nRegarding the request to be furnished with a 30' extension fire ladder, it is considered that the same could be constructed by the pupils under the supervision of the manual training instructor. It should be a good training for the boys to make this ladder themselves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. H.

JULY 21ST, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn the 20th instant, I visited the Alert Bay School and was pleased to learn from Mr. Indian Agent Halliday and Mr. Principal Anfield that steps were being taken by your Department to build a stock barn for this institution. I carefully examined the plan of the barn which you have authorized, and although I am of the opinion that it will not provide sufficient accommodation to meet the needs of a school with so large an enrolment, I fear it is now too late to alter it, as your representative informed me that he had ordered the material, and this was ready for delivery, for a building of the dimension authorized, namely 35 x 65' 8\".\n\nAs I learned from your representative and from the Principal, that a competent man was not available locally to supervise the work of construction, I beg to submit the following suggestions for your immediate and sympathetic consideration:\n\n1. That Beatty Bros. Ltd., 1100 Hamilton St., Vancouver, B.C., be asked to send one of their men to take charge of the erection of this building. In this connection I may state that Mr. Indian Agent Halliday informed me he had placed an order with this firm for the metal manger fixtures required. I may also state that I met a representative of this firm on my way back from Alert Bay, and he informed me that an expert in cement and carpentry work was available at once if required. Where so large an expenditure is involved I consider it would be a prudent step to take to engage the services of this man.\n\n2. As the barn is to be built on the slope of a hill, I beg to recommend that cement walls be installed in all four sides of the foundations, and that these walls be raised to the height of the top of the windows. Mr. Indian Agent Halliday stated that he purposed raising these walls to this height on the\nupper side only, but the representative of Beatty Bros. Ltd., whom I consulted stated that the results would not justify the saving effected, and this coincides with my own opinion in the matter.\n\n3. That eight steel tubular standards be installed to support the loft instead of six as recommended by Mr. Halliday.\n\n4. That the cement wall facing the upward slope of the hill be waterproofed to prevent seepage. Mr. Indian Agent Halliday stated that he was having weeping tile installed, but the representative of Beatty Bros. Ltd., the Principal, and I, all felt that the waterproofing process should also be undertaken.\n\n5. That the feed room be made rat proof with metal lining such as tin or galvanized iron. Rats are very numerous, hence the necessity of this action.\n\n6. That a cement closed receptacle, not less than 6' x 8' x 6' be constructed, forty feet from the barn, with gutter traps and drainage, so as to receive the washings from the stable gutters. Where the terrain contains so much gravel and so little soil, it is important that all nitrates be conserved, and I strongly recommend that this receptacle be provided in addition to the manure pit. The manure pit will be located on the slope above the barn, and this receptacle on the slope below.\n\nWhile writing about matters pertaining to this School, I beg to direct your attention to the necessity of having the brick walls of the main School building waterproofed before the autumn rains begin. It would be a help to the School management if this work could be done while the pupils are on holiday. Mr. Indian Agent Halliday stated that he had recommended to you that Bondex Waterproof Paint be used, and I beg to suggest that you wire him to have the work undertaken immediately.\n\nI also beg to direct your attention to the urgent need of a motor truck. As the school has no private wharf and all supplies, coal, etc., have to be transported from the cannery wharf about \u00bc of a mile distant, the need of this item of equipment is obvious. When the main school building was under construction your Department kindly provided a grant of $200.00 to buy a second-hand truck. This truck rendered sufficient service to justify its purchase. When it became useless another used truck was purchased by the Principal, but this is now practically worn out, and must soon be replaced. At one time the Principal felt that a boat would be necessary, but if the road to the cannery wharf is completed, or the saw-mill wharf is repaired and made available for the school's use, the cost of the boat may be saved. A good Ford truck can be delivered at Alert Bay for $900.00 and I beg to strongly recommend that this expenditure be authorized at the earliest date possible.\nOn the whole, I find that very satisfactory progress is being made towards placing this institution on a basis which will enable it to fulfil the purposes for which it is intended, and any steps your Department may be able to take to meet the requirements mentioned will be greatly appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBR/JF\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE\nP.

F. MacKenzie,\nActing, Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of July 21st, dealing with certain matters pertaining to our Alert Bay School, I now beg to direct your attention to certain other important requirements at this institution, and to ask you to kindly undertake to provide the same. They are as follows:\n\n1. The height of the brick chimney above the engine room should be increased by not less than 15 ft., so as to improve the draught. The Principal's residence was not warm last winter, as the heat from the central heating system failed to reach it with sufficient power to affect the temperature. He believes that this will be remedied when the furnace room chimney has been heightened.\n\n2. A larger box stove for heating the sad irons is required for the laundry. The stove already installed for this purpose would be suitable for a smaller school, say for one with a capacity of 25 or 30 pupils, but is practically worthless in a school like Alert Bay.\n\n3. Either bedside chairs or stools with a box top should be provided for each bed. The Principal pointed out that the pupils when dressing and undressing generally sat on the side of the bed with the result that bed springs are broken and the bedding worn out prematurely. The provision of chairs or stools with box tops for holding smaller articles of clothing such as collars, ties, etc., would prevent this. Possibly if the material were supplied the stools which I have suggested might be made as part of the manual training course. The chairs would cost about $2.00 each, and approximately 200 of these would be required. The stools could probably be made for less if the material were supplied by your Department.\nThe school management will require some help in removing the multitude of big stumps from the land which has been cleared of the forest. I spoke to Mr. Indian Agent Halliday about this and he informed me that the services of a man could be procured at once to blast the stumps with dynamite. He felt sure that the man he had in view could blast at least 100 stumps a day. If the stumps were dynamited the school management could do the rest, and I beg to suggest that Mr. Indian Agent Halliday be authorized to engage the man he has in view and ask him to undertake this work at once. The enclosed photos, (1) and (2) will give you some idea of the number of stumps to be removed and the difficulty of the task.

It is represented that the brick chimney above the engine room should be heightened at least fifteen feet so as to improve the draught and that a larger box stove is required in the laundry. I shall be grateful if you will let me have your recommendation, with estimate of the cost.\n\nBedside chairs or stools with box top are requested for each bed in the children's dormitories. As a rule, the Department does not supply this equipment but it has been suggested that the materials necessary be allowed and that the manual training class make up the stools. Please make inquiries in this connection and let me have your recommendation, with estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nOttawa, August 8th, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, with further reference to improvements at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. I am today writing Mr. Indian Agent Halliday for his recommendation regarding the chimney, the laundry stove and bedside chairs or stools. I may say that chairs or stools are not regularly supplied for the dormitories in our institutions. I am going to make the suggestion to Mr. Halliday that the manual training class make them if the materials are provided.\n\nThe Indian Agent is being authorized to engage the services of a man to blast stumps on the property.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T.B.R.

Ltd., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nfor Recharging supplies for fire equipment at Indian Residential School, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 156/0/5 dated June 27th, 1930.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nSir:\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter of August 2, with reference to water-proofing the walls of the Alert Bay Residential School.\n\nI have given this matter considerable study, and I find that Bondex Cement Paint is recommended as being the best obtainable. I have a quotation from a wholesale firm in Vancouver in which they state that Bondex sells at nineteen dollars a hundred pounds, and each pound covers twenty-five square feet. It is usually mixed seven pounds to a gallon, and requires two coats to give a perfectly satisfactory job. This will make the material for the painting amount to probably three hundred and fifty dollars. It is made in white and sixteen tints, but as all the building does not require to be done, only the portions exposed to the south-east storms, it would be as well to use the brick-red, which is practically the same color as the other walls of the building.\n\nThis can either be put on with a spray or by means of brushes like whitewash, and the advantage of it is that if it touches the woodwork or the glass windows, it washes right off, while on the brick it sets and wears like iron, according to the advertisements, under any and all weather conditions. I would suggest that the work be done by day labor, as it would only require two men with a portable scaffold which would hang from the roof, and there are men living at Alert Bay, who while not expert painters, could do the work perfectly, and would keep the money in the village. I could not say definitely how much it would cost to put on the paint, but there will be close to fifteen thousand square feet to cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M.

(RG 1C, Volume 6427, file 875-5, part 3)\nSeptember 8, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 27th ultimo, No. 285/23/1A, with reference to the new Alert Bay Indian residential school, I beg to say that you may arrange to have the chimney heightened as recommended in your letter in which you give an estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW.M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nSir:\n\nSince the receipt of your letter of August 8th, referring to the heightening of at least fifteen feet to the top of the brick chimney above the engine room at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, I would advise you that I have gone into this matter and I find that it will take 4500 brick and about four barrels of lime to do the necessary work. I have a quotation from Evans, Coleman & Evans, who handle practically all the brick on the coast of B.C., and they give me a quotation delivered at Alert Bay, for common brick $34.16 per thousand, and lime per barrel $3.71, making a total cost of material $168.58. It would require about $20.00 worth of material for scaffolding. Mr. Gibbens, who is the foreman on the building of the new barn at the School is a fair bricklayer, and he estimates the labor at about one hundred dollars.\n\nI may say that this really should be done, as being situated in a hollow, the wind blows down from the top of the hills and strikes on the chimney and creates a bad smoke through the whole building.\n\nRegarding a larger box stove for the laundry, I would recommend that a 36\" box stove be obtained for them instead of the one they have. It is used for heating the irons for their work, and the one they have is too small to keep their irons hot for the number of girls needed to carry on the ironing, and a new stove 36\", all cast-iron, would cost in Vancouver $23.75, with a probable extra $5.00 for packing, shipping and freight.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M.

(Rc 10, Volume 6427, file 875-5, part 3)\nDoctor Scott\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nGovernment building\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing you to let you know how I have been treated by the Indian Agent at Alert Bay B.C. I was appointed as foreman by someone at Ottawa or Vancouver Department to be sure to build a barn 38 x 60 ft. on the Indian Industrial School grounds at Alert Bay B.C. I never did get any notice of the appointment until I got a note from the agent here saying he was instructed to put me on as foreman. He gave me the blueprint but refused to let me have the specifications saying he would tell me when the time came, but never did, not until he would see that I was not following the plans then he would hollow me out of my job. He had changed the plan of the ground floor a number of times, he made it miserable for the man as well as me. At the end he gave the order to quit.\n\nWe started to excavate the ground on the 18th of July and finished on the 24th of August. It's a bank barn site, but the farm is a flat one. I told him...\nbefore we started that it was no place to build a flat barn, it will cost another thousand or so dollars before they can drive at the ends to unload the wagons; as there are no roads to it. We started at nothing but when we got the 33 ft. the barn was 7 ft high. She says its costing too much to build this blasted thing on me. She had no grounds to fire me the whole substitute as this, she had hired a man to be foreman from Vancouver and I was appointed by some gentlemen from Vancouver or Ottawa and that made him sore. He has ordered stuff that he did not know what they were for.\n\nI was never consulted when anything was ordered. I blame that I have had a helluva deal from start to finish and claim that I should be paid until this barn is finished.\n\nIf you wish to write any of the men write to J.E.

(RG 10, Volume 6427, file 875-5, part 3)\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing you voucher No. 169 in my own favor for $112.00 for cash paid out on account of wages for the raising of the chimney at the Indian Residential School.\n\nIt will be noted that I have slightly exceeded the estimate in the matter of labor, but it was found when the work came to be done that it cost a great deal more for the erection and destroying of the scaffolding than what had been figured, on account of it having to be built on the flat roof of the auditorium, and an extra floor had to be laid there to insure the safety of that building, and then the floor taken up again after the work was done.\n\nThe chimney was raised about seventeen feet, and has materially increased the draft from the furnaces, and the engineer in charge tells me has very materially reduced the consumption of fuel.\n\nThe school is, as you know, under a hill, and occasionally even when the wind is blowing toward the hill it circles down and blows down on top of the building, and this was the cause of the trouble before. Since the completion, we have had two very windy days, and it has been very closely watched, and while occasionally a puff of wind seems to cut the smoke off at the top of the chimney, none of it has ever come back, so it is to be hoped that the cure has been effective.\n\nI also wish to make some reference to the chimney from the two fireplaces in the Principal's residence. This has proved very unsatisfactory, as if there is any wind at all both fireplaces smoke very badly. It had been my inten...\nto submit an estimate for material to raise this chimney above the coping of the roof, but before doing so I have arranged with Mr. Anfield for him to conduct two different experiments to see if the chimney cannot be remedied without raising it. The danger in raising the chimney is that it would have to be well stayed, or the wind might cause it to topple over, and it would require some sixteen or eighteen feet additional height to get above the top of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M.

Ditchburn, Indian Commissioner for B.C., a voucher for $503.90 which has not yet been received by the Telegraph Cove Mills, in whose favor payment was to be made.\n\nWhile I was in Victoria few days ago Mr. Ditchburn advised me that the Department had forwarded cheque No. 3838 for $503.90, and asked me to prepare the usual indemnity bond and forward it direct to the Department, which is enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M. Halliday)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nTHIS is to certify that\nI or we have not received cheque No. 3688 for $203.90 covering account dated .\nIN the event of the Department issuing a duplicate cheque in my or our favour should the original cheque ever come into my or our possession I or We, hereby undertake not to cash same, but to cancel and immediately return it to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nSigned\n\nWITNESSED.\n(DATE) Dec. 10, 1930\nSir:\n\nI have to advise you that during the past week we have had unusually heavy rains at Alert Bay which probably only occurs at periods of some five or six years; the last one was four years ago. It brought a serious condition of affairs at the Residential School at Alert Bay; it so happened that I was away for a few days holiday, and while I was in Vancouver I received two letters from the Principal of the School drawing my attention to the state of affairs.\n\nIn past letters, particularly to those of March 22nd and August 11th, attention was drawn to the fact that the walls of the School were not water-tight, and a recommendation was made to the Department in these communications that they should be covered with a water-proof paint on the stormy side of the house, and while a complete estimate of the cost was not given, it being rather difficult to figure on the cost of labor in this place, a complete inventory of the cost of the paint was submitted, but to this there has been no reply received up to the present time. I have just returned from an inspection of the school, and have before me the letter from the Principal referring to the walls. He says the outstanding defects are:\n\n(a) The two girls' dormitories on the first floor had walls, the entire face of one and large sections of the other, streaming with water.\n(b) Serious leaks were discovered in the boys' two top dormitories.\n(c) Five electric light shades were found half filled with rain water, which apparently had followed the conduit and got into the lamp shades. This must be looked into or we will have serious trouble with our light plant.\n(d) Six window sills in the basement were allowing water to leak through, one in the boys' side so badly that children have been kept mopping up the floors almost all day.\n\n(e) Bad leaks, with consequent flooded floors, were noted at the rear kitchen entrance, in the laundry, one of the infirmaries and in the electric light room.\n\n(f) The entire face wall of the residence abutting the main building has streamed water all day, and those occupying these rooms have had to move.\n\nRegarding the above, which are copied from the Principal's letter, I may say that I looked into them all, and find that the statements are quite correct, and in my opinion if the walls were water-proofed these would all be avoided. Had the water come in through leaky roofs it would come in during any ordinary heavy rain, but these conditions have never prevailed excepting during continuous heavy rains accompanied by south-east winds, and as you are aware, the building is built of tile with a brick veneer, and all brick will absorb water up to a certain point and hold it, but after that point it will leak through. This, getting into the hollow tiles is, in the opinions of all who have looked at it, the reason for the walls being wet, and this can easily be avoided by having the building water-proofed.\n\nOn December 10th the Principal wrote again, but this had to do more with outside matters. If you will look at the plan of the drainage system as prepared by the Department of the Interior Dominion Water Power Reclamation Service, their file No. 114, you can see the layout of the outside drainage. On the extreme right of the blueprint there is an open drain approximately 320 feet long, and a twelve inch tile drain coming through the bank to the fields at the back of the school. This tile drain has an inlet made of a concrete block in which the tile is set, and at the exit has another concrete block, but for 250 feet of its length there is very little fall, and apparently it chokes.\n\nWhile in Vancouver I took the matter up with the engineer who had laid out the works, Mr. W.C. Warren, and obtained from him blue-prints showing all the drainage system for which his Department was responsible, and I discussed the matter with him, and he was of the opinion that had the inlet end of the pipe been kept clear, the water would have been kept down, but\non examination today I find that this is not quite the case. When the water rose in the field, which it did all in one night, they tried to clear the end and found nothing there, and so went about six or eight feet down the length of the pipe, shovelling the earth from above it, and broke open the tile, and immediately a rush of water ensued which drained the field fairly well, and in doing so it washed away the bridge at the road next the beach.\n\nI have gone all over this matter today, and have compared it carefully with the profile plans of the blueprint, and I am of the opinion that the system should be somewhat changed. I would recommend that I be allowed to take up all the covered drain, give it at least two feet more pitch, as there is plenty of fall available, put in sixteen inch tile at the upper end with three man-holes so it can be cleaned out in event of any dirt getting in, and continue the twelve inch tile right to the beach, and make a concrete culvert commencing at the bridge and coming right through to the beach, where the water would be discharged. The expense would not be very considerable, excepting for labor, which could all be done by Indians, but it is urgently recommended. It would require possibly forty sacks of cement and one hundred feet of sixteen inch tile and possibly one hundred and fifty feet of twelve inch tile, which is not very expensive. This is urgently recommended, although possibly there may not be another flood such as we have had in the past week for several years; but there is no reason why it should not occur again within the next month, as it has occurred several times before, to my recollection.\n\nThere is another difficulty equally as bad, and that is in connection with the drainage of the boiler room. When I was there this morning there was six inches of water in the floor of the boiler room, and from what the Principal tells me, during the worst of it they had to work practically day and night with buckets and pumps to get any fire at all, and I believe for one day they were without any fire in the furnaces. This condition, in my opinion, has arisen from two sources. The clogging of the drain from the field behind allowed the ground around the building to become super-saturated with water, and in the drainage system there is no evidence to be found of any outlet from the small drain which shows in the floor of the boiler house. There was a row of weeping tiles put round the building which\nshould have been connected with the sewerage system, but I can find no evidence of it having been done, and Mr. Warren tells me that he does not know if this drainage was connected with the sewerage, for which he was responsible. The Principal is of the opinion that this little drain that was put in only was connected with a weeping tile drain which ran a short distance and then died away in the gravel. This would take care of a small amount of water, as gravel does not hold water, but during the last flood time that they had the water came into the boiler room through this pipe, showing that it is choked someplace, but nobody knows where it is, or with what it is connected, and I would recommend that a six inch glazed tile be put from the beach following round the west end of the School and being connected with the engine room, to prevent any such things in the future, with one clean-out manhole about twenty feet away from the boiler house. The chief expense in doing this would be the labor in digging the ditches, as the cut through the bank would require to be about seven feet deep, and there is always trouble with the banks caving in while the work is being done. However there would be no occasion to have any engineer or inspector come to take charge of the work, as I am quite capable of looking after it myself, and I can get local labor to do the work, as a number of the Indians are idle and looking for work, and there are several white people who would be glad of a few days work at even minimum wages.\n\nAs mentioned before, it might be that we have flood conditions again this year, or it may be that we do not have them again for three or four years, but with an institution of this kind having upwards of two hundred people living under the roof, their health should be the first consideration, and I would earnestly recommend that immediate authority be given me to have the necessary work done along the lines that I have suggested.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. W.C.

The situation appeared to our Commission to be of sufficient magnitude and urgency to demand your own personal attention, and for this reason my Night Letter was addressed to you instead of to the Secretary of your Department.\n\nWhile our Commission very deeply regret the difficult situation which has arisen, they feel that in view of the very strong objection they raised to the school being built on the present site, (see my letter Jan. 23, 1926) they cannot assume any responsibility for the expenditure which will have to be made to clear it up, nor for any injury to the health of staff agents or pupils which may result therefrom.\n\nOur Commission will be relieved to learn from you that the situation is receiving prompt and careful attention.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nDecember 9th, 1930\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Halliday:\n\nDuring the past two days rain has fallen almost incessantly, with the result that the building once more presents a deplorable picture to those charged with maintaining the health and welfare of the pupils of this school. The following outstanding defects were noted on an inspection of the school:\n\n(a) The two girls' dormitories on the first floor had walls, the entire face of one and large sections of the other, streaming with water.\n\n(b) Serious leaks were discovered in the boys' two top dormitories.\n\n(c) Five electric light shades were found half filled with rain water, which apparently had followed the conduit and got into the lamp shades. This must be looked into or we will have serious trouble with our light plant.\n\n(d) Six window sills in the basement were allowing water to leak through, one in the boys' side so badly that children have been kept mopping up the floors almost all day.\n\n(e) Bad leaks with consequent flooded floors were noted at the rear kitchen entrance, in the laundry, one of the infirmaries and in the electric light room.\n\n(f) The entire face wall of the residence shutting the main building has streamed water all day and those occupying these rooms have had to move.\n\nWe might say that we have carefully inspected all the roofs and have to advise that all the rain hoppers are clear and functioning normally.\n\nThe urgent attention of your Department is requested so that this condition may be remedied. We are of the opinion that the Department hardly realises that we have children in this school sleeping in dormitories, the walls of which are streaming with water, and are hardly ever free from damp.\n\nWe are having enough worry with health these days, and we really cannot be asked to take the responsibility for what must inevitably result unless conditions are remedied forthwith. Our regret is keen indeed that you are not here today to see for yourself the prevalent condition of affairs.\n\nAt the same time we must report that, in spite of the drainage provided, the fields behind the school are now badly\nflooded, and though we have opened emergency ditches, the water is still steadily rising and we are becoming somewhat worried about the boiler rooms and basements. In our humble opinion, the concrete drainage is totally inadequate to handle flood conditions which periodically visit Alert Bay in the winter time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) F. Earl Anfield.\nPrincipal.\nDecember 10th, 1930\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to ours of the 9th instant, we have to advise you that the rains of the past three days have caused most serious flood conditions at this school. The field behind the school flooded and the water rose to such a level that we were compelled to break open the concrete drainage to release the pressure on the building. This caused a wash out at the main gateway, washing out the bridge and a part of the roadway.\n\nMore serious still is the fact that the boiler room is flooded with nearly two feet of water, rendering it impossible to operate any of the heating apparatus of the building. The coal cellar is flooded and there is imminent danger of the electric light room being flooded as well. In fact only prodigious efforts continuous day and night for the past 48 hours has prevented the entire basement floor from being flooded out. We have had nearly twenty boys at a time bailing water out, in addition to a two line gasoline pump borrowed from the Cannery, and combined efforts of both have only held the water level. The walls are leaking in all directions. There is a drain in the boiler room but instead of discharging the water it has been the place where most of it has come in. Water has poured up this drain in huge quantities. We may say that this drain has been a source of trouble ever since entering this building. It was put in very early during construction to drain water from the boiler room excavation - made of tile we think. As far as we know it was never hooked into the main drainage system and was supposed to run out somewhere in front of the building. Put in as a temporary drain it was made to act as permanent drainage hooked into nowhere at all. It was surrounded with weeping tile and now all the flood water has rushed up this drain into the building. We are today wiring Mr. Carson as follows:-\n\n\"Boiler rooms out of commission under two feet water.

Warren.\n\nVancouver, B.C.,\nJanuary 5, 1951.\nVancouver, B.C.\nJanuary 5, 1931.\n\nSir: Re - Alert Bay School.\n\nAs requested by you, I made an inspection of the above mentioned school and submit for your consideration as follows:\n\nOn arriving at Alert Bay I interviewed the Principal of the school, Mr. Anfield, and was informed that prior to my visit by about two weeks, a very heavy rain had occurred extending over the greater part of a week, and as a result of insufficient drainage facilities, the boiler room had become flooded to a depth of two or three feet. He also pointed out that a considerable amount of seepage had taken place through the exterior walls of the building on the exposed face, that is the south east side. The evidence of this was quite noticeable and the outside wall was still in a saturated condition.\n\nFrom examination of the premises and from information obtained from others, it is apparent that extremely heavy rain prevailed for three or four days, quite possibly in excess of that recorded by the meteorological station. To the heavy rains and to the fact that the relief drains were not in working condition, owing to accumulation of debris in them, may be attributed the flooding which occurred. Material damage was very small but the discomfort must have been very great owing to the dampness within the building and to the impossibility of keeping the heating plant operating.\n\nC.E. Webb, Eng.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDom. Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\n739 Hastings Street, West,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDESCRIPTION\n\nThe school is situated about 200 feet from the seashore and on ground approximately 20 feet above high tide. Immediately to the rear of the school is a depression about 1000 feet long and several hundred feet wide. Beyond this depression the ground rises with a moderate slope for a quarter of a mile or more.\n\nAt the time the school was built a drain was installed to prevent the accumulation of water in the depression. A part of this drain is open ditch and part covered, the covered portion consisting of 12-inch pipe 385 feet long. This drain has an ordinary capacity of 2.5 c.f.s., and was designed for a maximum rainfall of 3 inches in 24 hours, the heaviest recorded at Alert Bay between the years 1923 and 1929. It is, however, capable of handling double this quantity without serious flooding.\n\nThe floor of the boiler room of the school is several feet below this depression and is provided with its own drain. The contractor for the school installed this for his own use and did not connect it to drains leading from other parts of the school system, but carried it out under the school to its outlet at a point about 50 feet in front of the school. To this drain in the boiler room he connected all the tile drains around the rear of the school.\n\nOn examination I found this drain blocked at some point under the school and several inches of water on the boiler room floor. Apparently the intercepting tile at the rear of the school had brought its drainage into the room without means of exit.\nAll other drains were reported as functioning satisfactorily, and I found them quite clean.\n\nRELIEF FROM FLOODING\n\nTo obviate the possibility of future flooding of the boiler room it is necessary to provide a new drainage system for this part of the building, either in whole or in part.\n\nThe interceptor drain at the rear of the school should be provided with a different outlet, preferably to the existing system. This may be attained by re-laying this drain and reversing the direction of flow and providing it with an outlet into the inspection chamber immediately to the east of the school.\n\nThe boiler room floor drainage may be taken care of by a sump pump discharging to the laundry drain if it is found impossible to recondition the present drain. The cost of this work would be $599.00, including the cost of the pump installed.\n\nTo provide a gravity drain from the boiler room including connections from interceptor drain and additional outlet for the depression at the rear of the school would cost $1286.35. While the cost of this is high, it has the advantage of providing additional drainage facilities, should a storm of such proportions or, for that matter of greater intensity, again visit the locality.\n\nImprovements and repairs to the farm drain are suggested at a cost of $329.00. These include a new road crossing to replace that washed out and a gutter from the present end of the pipe to the new culvert, as well as a screen on the intake.\nIn addition it is suggested that the boiler room walls be waterproofed on the inside and that the leaky windows in the basement be caulked at an approximate cost of $50.00.\n\nA summary of the cost of carrying out the suggested improvements including the alternatives suggested for drainage is appended.\n\nWALL SEEPAGE\n\nThe most serious result of the heavy rains was the seepage through the outside walls, especially those with a south east exposure. The effect of this was quite noticeable along the wall above the adjoining Principal's residence and between the engine room and boiler room and as reported to me, around a number of windows. Some seepage was reported as coming through the basement walls of the boiler room and coal bins, below ground level, although this had ceased at the time of my visit.\n\nThe seepage through the exterior walls I am informed has taken place ever since the school was built and that it attained maximum proportions during the heavy rain previously referred to.\n\nWhile I am not able to confirm these statements, I observed that the walls were in a saturated condition and a very heavy efflorescence was evident on the interior surface.\n\nThe only solution of this difficulty appears to be the complete waterproofing of the exterior walls on the south and east exposures. While the expense involved is considerable, the probable resulting damage under present conditions may exceed any expenditure for such a purpose by a wide margin.\nAside from the material damage such conditions, if allowed to continue, would undoubtedly seriously affect the health of those resident in the institution.\n\n**WATERPROOFING**\n\nSeveral methods are available for waterproofing. The most widely used and possibly the best commercial form is Minwax, a colourless preparation of bitumen which does not discolour the brick. This preparation is applied by brush or spray to a clean dry surface.\n\nThe Sylvester process consists of the application of one or more pairs of soap and alum solutions, alternately. While the cost of materials in this process is very reasonable, the cost of application is high and as the method of application determines the effectiveness of the process, it is hardly to be preferred to the first mentioned preparation, especially as the ultimate cost would be about the same.\n\nThe area of walls necessary to process is about 14,000 sq.ft., consisting of the south and east faces and projections.

Of this amount $3176.60 was expended on labor and $3060.91 on material, less credits $140.10. Owing to delay in receiving credit from Messrs. Evans, Coleman & Evans, it was impossible for me to send in a full report until today. I am attaching hereto final statement in connection with the transaction.\n\nI am also herewith submitting cheque No.7 for $123.40 from self, being a refund of the balance of the $3,300.00 forwarded to me to be expended in the payment of wages, also cheques amounting to $140.10 as refunds from Messrs. Beatty Bros.-$36.55; Evans, Coleman & Evans-$66.35; and Marshall-Wells, $37.20.\n\nWage accounts have been submitted to you from time to time during the course of construction.\n\nAgent Halliday informs me that it will be necessary to resurface a portion of the cement floor in the barn during the coming summer on account of the cement not setting as well as it might have during the wet weather.\n\nIn conclusion I beg to say that the amount above mentioned ($6097.41) covers also the work of removing the workshop from the old school to the new one as well as demolishing the old boys' school, from which considerable good timber was salvaged.\n\nTwo snapshots taken of the building are attached hereto for your information. The dimensions of this barn are 33 x 66, being a few feet less in length than the barn constructed by the Department for the Cariboo Indian School. I think you will agree with me when I say that this is a very creditable building for the money expended.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E.

A copy of this memorandum is enclosed and I would suggest that it be attached to the copy of the report sent to you on January 13th last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nVancouver, B.C.,\nJanuary 10, 1931.\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb:\n\nRe: Alert Bay School\n\nSince forwarding you my report of the 7th inst., I have received information that the heavy rain storm referred to, occurred during the 7th, 8th and 9th of December, when the precipitation was 1.75, 3.95 and 0.36 inches respectively, as recorded by the Meteorological Service. My visit to the school was on the 19th and 20th of the same month.\n\nIt will be noted that the precipitation on the 8th was about one inch greater than on any date previously recorded and was no doubt an exceptionally heavy storm.\n\nThere need, however, be no uncertainty as to the ability of the drain to handle storm water. There is sufficient evidence to that effect in the fact that when the pipe end was cleared of debris, the accumulation in the depression, which was estimated at from three to four feet in depth, was removed in less than 24 hours.\n\nAs stated in my report the drain was designed for a normal capacity of 2.5 c.f.s. It will, however, convey 4 c.f.s. without topping the ditch, a comfortable margin over any anticipated runoff.\n\nAside from the inconvenience of having water lie in this depression there is no danger whatever to the school building attending the accumulation of water in the depression and had the intercepting drain around the school been provided with a proper outlet the flooding of the boiler room would not have occurred.\n\nW.C. Warren\nAsst.

(RC 1C, Volume 6427, file 875-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nFebruary 26, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School stating that Mr. Engineer Warren, of the Dominion Water Power Branch who has recently been superintending the necessary repairs and alterations and draining of this building, has stressed to the Principal of the School the imperative need of systematic flushing for the water drain from the boiler room, such action being made most necessary by a wrong directional flow of the outlet of this drain, for the first fifteen feet from the boiler room. The Principal states that Mr. Warren is insistent that only constant care can prevent this drain from giving further trouble and expense to all concerned.\n\nThe Principal also states that in the drafts and specifications of the building the contract called for the installation of a fire hydrant with necessary hose, etc., in the boiler room, and that although he has drawn the attention of the contractor and the Department to this matter, nothing has yet been done; the hydrant has not been installed, and its need is now more imperative than before. He asks that the following material be provided:\n\n- 1 only 2 - 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" reducer bushing, brass,\n- 1 only 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" 45 degree brass hydrant valve,\n- 2 only 25 foot lengths 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" rubber hose with connection\n- 1 only 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" tapered 10\" fire nozzle, brass.\n\nIn connection with the above I may say that I discussed the drainage system with Mr. Warren, and he was decidedly of the opinion that about once a month the hose should be inserted into the drain from the boiler room and water turned on, so that any little sediment that otherwise might gather would...\nbe washed out. I may say that in doing this work, Mr. Warren has made a pit below the outlet that will gather any dirt or sand or coal dust etc. that may come through it, so that only clean water will go out, and it would be a very easy matter to turn the hose on and at the same time send a boy to the outlet at the beach to see that it was going through properly. I would recommend that this material be granted.\n\nWith further reference to the same matter, I am enclosing voucher No. 237 for $16.25 for repairs to a pump which was borrowed from a fish freezing plant at Alert Bay for use during the time they were flooded at the School. So much dirt, etc. came in during that time, mostly coal dust, that in spite of screens being put on, the high speed that the pump had to run was detrimental to it, and it cost $16.25 to put it in commission, and I would recommend that it be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M. Halliday)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nSir:\n\nRe: Alert Bay School.\n\nI wish to inform you that the works proposed for Alert Bay School in connection with the improvements to the drainage system as outlined in Mr. Warren's report of January 5, 1931, have been completed with exceptions as noted.\n\nThe intercepting tile drains at the rear of the school were relaid and diverted to the inspection chamber nearest the school. All former drains which collected in the boiler room were disconnected outside the building and plugged. The boiler room floor drain was cleaned out and a sump installed for the reception of a pump if found necessary. As the drain functioned satisfactorily under test the pump proposed will for the present at least be unnecessary.\n\nAdditional tile drains were laid along the footing of the west wing and carried to the nearest line.\n\nThe farm drain was provided with a screen at the inlet and an inspection chamber midway along the pipe. A new culvert was installed and a gutter laid from the end of the pipe to the culvert. Owing to unsatisfactory weather conditions the use of this gutter was not completed in a workmanlike manner and should be refinished during the summer when waterproofing work is undertaken. The cost of this should not exceed $30.00.\n\nIt is not possible to give at the moment an accurate summary of the cost of the installation but the outlay was in the neighborhood of $900.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

WARREN\n\nVancouver, B.C.,\nApril 20, 1931.\nVancouver, B.C.,\nApril 20, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nRe: Alert Bay School\n\nIn accordance with your instructions, repairs and replacements were carried out to the drainage system at Alert Bay School, as suggested in my report of January 5th. The work was commenced February 9th and completed February 24th.\n\nThe accompanying plan shows in red the location of the improvements. Detailed description of work carried out follows:\n\nINTERCEPTING DRAIN\n\nThe intercepting drain, which had originally been laid around the rear of the school building, with its several outlets in the boiler room, was relaid and diverted to the inspection chamber immediately to the east of the building. This drain throughout its length was laid below the footing so as to intercept all seepage to that depth. In all 220 feet of tile was laid for this purpose, consisting of 110 feet 6\" tile and 110 feet 4\" tile.\n\nBOILER ROOM DRAIN\n\nIt had been intended to provide\n\nC.E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\na pump for taking care of the seepage into the boiler room but efforts to clean out the old drain were successful.\n\nThe drain was therefore reconditioned where it could be got at, and extended to the beach. Sizes of tile are as shown on plan. Underneath the building the slope is very flat so that the drain soon silts up. In clearing the drain it was found that about fifty feet had been completely filled up with silt. The old inlet in the boiler room was unsuitable as it did not provide access to the drain for cleaning purposes.\n\nIn re-constructing this drain a sump 3' x 3' x 3' was installed to allow for the accumulation of debris and to provide means of access for cleaning. A cover and screen were installed and a cleaning cable provided.\n\nIt will probably not be necessary to install a sump pump if reasonable precautions are observed in keeping the drain in working order.\n\nSEEPEAGE\n\nAs stated in my report of January 5th, seepage occurred through the walls of the boiler room and coal bin. I have since found that such was not the case but that the seepage occurred along the joint between the floor and the walls. Nowhere could I find the concrete basement walls porous.\nThe new drains and the clearing of the boiler room drain should provide for all surface water likely to accumulate around the boiler room which is the lowest part of the building.\n\nWhile excavating for the sump constructed in the boiler room, at a depth of four feet below the floor surface, a water bearing stratum was encountered. Although water rose in the pit to the drain outlet or about three feet in depth it is not anticipated that trouble will be experienced from this source, as sufficient drainage has been provided. This seepage would appear to be from a source not in the immediate proximity of the school.\n\nSURFACE DRAINAGE\n\nOwing to stoppage of the covered portion of the farm drain during the extremely heavy precipitation of last December it was found necessary to provide a screen chamber to prevent a recurrence of such obstruction. In addition an inspection chamber was added midway in the length of this drain to facilitate cleaning. The screen chamber consists of a concrete chamber with a sump and supporting a substantial steel trash rack 3' x 3'. The inspection chamber is of sufficient size to provide for the ordinary cleaning operations.\n\nAs a result of the release of the accumulated water by the clearing of the drain, a very heavy washout occurred from the end of\nthe covered drain to the beach including the road culvert. The metal road culvert was replaced by one of reinforced concrete 24\" x 20\" x 25' long and a concrete lined gutter 160 feet long, with 24\" bed, provided from the end of the covered drain to the culvert.\n\nThe gutter should be re-surfaced at some future time as it was spoiled by bad weather at the time it was laid. The cost would be approximately $30.00.\n\nCOST OF WORKS\n\nThe cost of the works carried out was $819.49, expended as follows:\n\n| Item          | Cost   |\n|---------------|--------|\n| Labour        | $430.76|\n| Material      | $277.68|\n| Supervision etc.| $111.05|\n\n$819.49\n\nThe estimated cost of the work was $1166.00, which included a sump pump to be installed at a cost of $265.00 but which is, for the present, considered unnecessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.C. Warren\nAsst. Hydraulic Engineer\n\nAPPROVED:\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 1C, Volume 6427, file 875-5, part 3)\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of January 16th regarding flooding conditions at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School I enclose herewith a report received from Mr. Webb which deals with the repairs and replacements found necessary to improve existing conditions.\n\nThe changes made have cost $819.49, which is materially less than the original estimate owing to the fact that it was expected that the sump pump would be necessary to drain the boiler room, but it has now been found that the water can be led away through drains under the cellar floor and present conditions indicate that a pump will not be required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nApril 29, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, stating that a fire drill inspection had been held in the school during the visit of Captain Barry, Inspector of Schools, and the building was cleared in one and one-half minutes, which time is considered reasonably satisfactory.\n\nHe adds that \"a check-up of staff members showed that the children employed in the boiler room and laundry where machinery was operating, did not hear the fire gong, and their only intimation of fire drill was when they saw the other children being marched out of the building. This prompted Captain Barry to suggest that another gong should be installed adjacent to the laundry and boiler room in this school.\"\n\nThis matter is brought before you for your consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M. Halliday)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, May 12, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, reporting the result of a fire drill inspection at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School during the visit of the Inspector of Schools.\n\nRegarding the request that a fire gong be installed adjacent to the laundry and boiler room, I have to say it is considered that it should not be necessary to have a gong installed at this point. Any children employed in these services should be able to easily escape from the building in case of a fire occurring in the laundry, boiler room, or in any part of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. P. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nFire Protection:\n\nThe fire escapes were badly placed in the rear of the school. The greatest fire risk in the school is within thirty feet of the foot of the fire escapes.\n\nThe doors from the girls' dormitories to the Fire Escapes are kept locked. The supervisors in rooms quite near but across a corridor had keys to these doors. This for various reasons seems a very dangerous plan. I pointed out some of the dangers to the Principal and suggested the provision of small glass boxes with spare keys placed near the doors leading to the escapes. The Principal had these glass boxes and keys in position within 48 hours.\n\nFire Drills are regularly held. At the one held while I was inspecting the school, everyone was clear of the building in less than two minutes from the first sound of the fire gongs. Delay was caused by those in the laundry and boiler room not hearing the alarm. A large fire gong, at least 10 inches, is required. It should be placed near the laundry. The present system of gongs is quite inaudible there when machinery is in operation.\n\nI also beg to recommend that a 50 foot rope ladder with wooden steps be placed in the sun-room off the infirmary, one end being bolted into the wall or the verandah under the window. This would aid the escape of patients under extreme emergency.\n\nSanitary Conditions:\n\nThe drains run to the sea. The school is experiencing trouble at times with the sewers. These are, I understand, FOUR INCH to the outlet. The Principal has had to place a temporary wooden man hole clean out at the outlet. A permanent cement man hole will be necessary here. May I please be permitted to state that a four inch sewer pipe in such a building as this is in my opinion quite inadequate. If you will please refer to the plans for the building, you will see that a SIX INCH sewer was called for under the floors of the basements. The kitchens, lavatories, toilets and boiler rooms are kept clean.\n\nFloors:\n\nThere is considerable shrinkage in the soft wood floor of\nof the auditorium.\n\nWalls:\n\nThe rain has been driven through the walls on the S. E. side of the buildings. During the wet weather, the rain came in by gallons and collected in the dormitories. Effervescence has set in badly in the plaster of the dormitories and in the Principal's Residence. Mr. Indian Commissioner Ditchburn has this matter in hand. The school will need replastering in part at an early date.\n\nLaundry:\n\nAbout 2600 articles pass through the laundry per week. No proper guards were placed over the belting and the more dangerous parts of the machines. The Principal is having wooden guards placed wherever there is any danger. There is far too much hand ironing required. One steam ironer is needed as soon as funds will permit the Department to supply such a machine. The 5 H. P. boiler for laundry steam is far too small. At least a 10 H.P. boiler is required. I watched the engineer try to keep the pressure up to 100 pounds in the present boiler. When the laundry machines were turned on the pressure fell from over 100 pounds to less than 80 pounds in less than 30 seconds.\n\nFarming:\n\nThere is a small Dairy Building. The concrete cooling tank leaks. The rectifying of this is in the hands of the Indian Agent. A large new barn has been constructed. In this a hopper system of feed bins has been constructed by the manual training class. The concrete floor of this new barn has been very badly laid. The concrete did not set properly, hence it is very uneven. Temporary planking has been laid over the concrete to act as cow stands.\nVancouver, B.C.,\nMay 14th, 1931.\n\nMr. Ditchburn,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to yours of the 5th re the stand pipe in boiler room, I am enclosing Mr. Beck's letter of explanation. It seems there was an understanding between the Supt. of Construction and Mr. Beck for the few extras mentioned and the omission of the stand pipe. Mr. Beck was up to Princeton for some time and could not get in touch with him hence the delay in reply.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"Thos. Carson\"\nCARL BECK.\n\n2895 McGill Street,\nVancouver, B.C., May 10, 1931.\n\nMr. Thos. Carson,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn regards hose and valve which was to be placed in boiler room at Alert Bay Indian School and which was omitted, as you will remember there was an extra room added above coal room which meant raising roof drainage pipe 11 feet also hose tap and piping over floor drain in boiler room and steam and hot water connections to soap barrel in laundry. As the arrangements at the time with Clerk of the Works if no extra charge were made for above, hose and valve could be omitted in this place. However, a tee was left in main for valve in future.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"Carl Beck\"\nDear Sir:\n\nIn connection with the flooding which took place in the basement of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School during the past winter, I beg to say that as a result of an investigation made by Mr. Engineer Warren it was found that a drain pipe from the boiler room had become blocked up apparently from ashes, and in order that this might not occur again I wrote to Principal Anfield pointing out the necessity for him taking precautions to see that the drainage works did not again become clogged.\n\nOn the 29th April in a letter received from Principal Anfield he pointed out that although the specifications called for a hydrant stand in the boiler room and ample hose, the same had not been installed when building the school, and that in his opinion the safety factor in regard to flooding conditions would be considerably augmented if a proper hydrant stand and hose were supplied for the boiler room in question.\n\nIn looking up the specifications for this school I found a clause which stated that the contractor was to \"provide and put up a stand pipe protection service at centre of main corridor on each floor and in the boiler room\".\n\nI, therefore, deemed it essential to write to Mr. Carson, the contractor, asking him why this connection had not been made, and I am today in receipt of a letter from him to which he has attached a letter from the contractor who installed the plumbing system. From this communication it would appear that there was an extra room added above the coal room which meant raising the roof drainage pipe 11 feet, also hose tap and piping over floor drain in the boiler room, as well as steam and hot water connections to soap barrel in the laundry. The contractor states that he was arranged at the time with the Clerk of the Works that if no exceptions were to be made for the above, the hose and valve could be omitted in this place, but that a tee was left in the main for valve in future use.\n\nI am attaching hereto copy of Mr. Carson's letter also that of Mr. Beck, the plumbing contractor, but I would like to know from you as to whether the Department was made cognizant of the arrangement referred to at the time the building was in progress of construction.\n\nI am of the opinion, however, that it would be advisable to install a suitable hydrant with sufficient hose for the proper flushing out of this drain from the boiler room.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.D./K.D.\n\nEnclosures:-\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6427, file 875-5, part 3)\nSir:\n\nThe Department is aware that W.C. Warren of the Dominion Water Power Reclamation Branch was at Alert Bay and had some repairs done to the drainage system at the Residential School, and there was a proper flush-out drain built for the boiler room. Attention has been drawn to this matter before, and there should be a hydrant and hose in the boiler room so that this can be flushed out periodically to keep any coal dust or other foreign matter from lodging in the drain. The expense will not be very great, and I would recommend that it be done as early as possible, but as I understand that Mr. Warren will be at Alert Bay in July or August to look after the waterproofing of the building, he might attend to this at the same time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M. Halliday)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of January 16th last regarding the water-proofing of the outside walls of the Alert Bay Indian residential school, Mr. Webb reports that the present is the most feasible time to carry out this work. He states that it can not be satisfactorily undertaken after September as the weather then would be uncertain and warm dry weather is necessary for a good job.\n\nFrom four to six weeks time would be required to secure delivery of the material, as it is not carried in stock at Vancouver, before work could be commenced.\n\nThe estimated cost of this water-proofing is $1,890, and I shall be glad to have your instructions in regard to it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RO 10, Volume 6428, file 875-5, part 4)\nSir:\n\nWith reference to past correspondence regarding the water at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, in which it was promised that a report of the analysis would be forwarded, I would advise you that I have just received from Mr. Anfield his correspondence regarding it. In the letter which I wrote you I stated that the Boiler Inspector believed that there must be a heavy vegetable matter in the water, but the report from the G.S. Eldridge Company, who are probably the best chemists operating in British Columbia, states as follows:\n\nMarks - None\n\nReaction - Very slightly (PH 6.8-6.9.)

We would suggest as a\ncorrective that 0.15 to 0.20 lbs of tri-sodium phosphate be added to every 1000 gallons of feed water. This should prevent scale formation and precipitate the solids in the form of a sludge, which can be readily eliminated by means of \"blowing off\" after suitable periods of operation.\"\n\nYou will see from this that they are in error as to the presence of organic matter being the cause of the trouble in the boilers; it is a scale which forms in the water through the combination of Silica and Lime, and they suggest a corrective for it.\n\nMr. Anfield has informed me that he has sent another sample of water for a bacteriological analysis, and when this is received, I will again forward it to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Halliday\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nDecember 7, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing voucher No. 198 for $49.37 in favor of the Vancouver Iron Works for repairs to the upright boiler at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, used in connection with the laundry.\n\nThe Principal has forwarded this account to me on instructions from the Commission who have informed him that it is the obligation of the Department to keep the major items of mechanical repairs at the School in working order. They found that the tubes in the boiler were leaking, and it was necessary to send the machine to town for retubing. They are in receipt of a letter from the Vancouver Iron Works stating that the trouble was caused by water conditions, being impregnated with vegetable matter, and requesting a sample of the water for chemical analysis. The Principal states that this has been forwarded, and the results will be sent to me on receipt of the analysis. However with regard to the water conditions I cannot see how it could be at fault, as it is artesian water and is pumped from a depth of ninety feet in the earth, and I cannot see how it could be impregnated with vegetable matter.\n\nThe Boiler Inspector recently went over the three boilers at the school, and reported the same thing to the Principal in person, and he advised the use of Milk of Lime in the water in all the boilers. He stated that otherwise there would be a constant recurrence of the trouble.\n\nThe Commission have also desired the Principal to draw the attention of the Department to the fact that the high-pressure boiler is too small for the requirements of the laundry, for which it supplies the necessary steam. The Boiler Inspector's report shows this plant is registering 3.6 H.P., but they state that the specifications for the installation of this equipment in the school on page 87, paragraph 1, state as follows:\n\"The Contractor shall furnish and install where indicated on plan or directed a five H.P. vertical tubular steam boiler of standard type, subject to a hydrostatic test of 150 lbs. before shipment.\"\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nVictoria, B.C., August 5, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith the report of the Inspector of Indian Agencies for B.C. upon his inspection of the Kwawkewlth Indian Agency.\n\n\"4 School\".\n\nIn regard to the washing, lavatory and steam heater for laundry purposes, reference to the specifications accompanying plan 577 (St George's school, Lytton) on which the Alert Bay school was apparently built and equipped shows (on the last page but one) that a 5 H.P. boiler was to have been installed. There is nothing on file to either support or question the statement of the Principal to the Inspector of agencies that the allegedly inadequate steam heater is only 3\u00bd H.P. nor have we any previous reports that the washing and lavatory accommodation has been found to be inadequate.\n\nIn regard to the smoky chimneys in the principal's house, however, I would refer to the letter of Indian Agent Halliday to the Department dated January 7th, 1930 and also the Department's file No. 156-0-18 especially letters dated January 30th, 1930 and April 1st, 1930. The complaints subsequently dealt with by correspondence between the Commissioner and the Department touch rather upon certain deficiencies of attention to requirements of building specifications than upon new work to be done. Hence the question of raising the chimneys appears to have been held in abeyance. In a letter received here by the Commissioner from Principal Anfield, dated May 5th, 1930, he stated:\n\n\"Something must be done about waterproofing the brickwork, if the health standard of our children is to be maintained; and in the interests of economical administration, the stacks should be hoisted. We would also appreciate your report on the condition of the Principal's residence.\"\n\nIn a letter to Mr. Ditchburn, dated June 3rd, 1930 M. Gow, the Building Inspector who was appointed to supervise the erection of the Alert Bay Residential school stated:\n\n\"I am fully convinced that to get the best results from the large chimney carrying the two main boilers, that it should be raised to a height of twenty feet in excess of what it is at present. The chimney from the kitchen and laundry would not of necessity need to be raised more than another four or five feet to obtain good results I think. The only remaining one then, is that of the residence, which, undoubtedly, should be carried up to a height of two or three feet in excess of the main building, or I am afraid no matter how they cap it, with certain winds it would be liable to give trouble.\"\n\nThe foregoing was sent to the Department by Mr. Ditchburn on June 16th, 1930, under cover of a letter for the attention of Mr. Orr.\nThe Department by letter No. 156-0-5, dated January 16th 1931, advised the Commissioner that the Dominion Water Power Branch were being instructed to have the outside walls of the building waterproofed. This, however, was not carried out and the Department advised, by letter dated August 6th, 1931, that it would be impossible to authorize the work in that year as there were no funds available. Hence the waterproofing has not been done, and the raising of the chimneys seems to have disappeared as an issue until the receipt of Inspector Pragnell's report.\n\nWe have no estimate on the cost of raising the chimneys, but if the Department is now able to have this attended to, I shall be pleased to obtain an estimate of the cost, if instructed to do so. The Department will also be able to advise if or when funds can be made available for the waterproofing of the brickwork.\n\nPerhaps it would be advisable to have Mr. Orr consider the questions, mooted by the Inspector, as to his idea of the inadequacy of the washing and lavatory accommodation as well as the question of the laundry steam heater referred to previously herein.\n\nChas. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nKamloops, B.C., July 30, 1932.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to submit the following report upon the above agency. (Kwawkewlth Agency No.2.)\n\nSCHOOL\n\nDuring my visit the Indian residential school was closed for the holidays, a few children being in residence for various reasons. I went over the school with the Reverend Principal, Mr. Anfield. The washing and lavatory accommodation in this school seems to me to be inadequate. Some classrooms were being moved to the old building to make more room in the new. The principal informs me that the steam heater for laundry purposes is inadequate being only 3\u00bd h.p. and should be 10 h.p. The chimneys in the Principal's house smoke badly and should be raised in height. I found the building well kept and in good order, though the leaks through the porousness of the brick on the window sills show up badly. I believe the Department is attending to this. I found cultivation being well attended to and greatly improved since my last visit. The rather scrub stock of cows at the school are being gradually replaced by guernsey cows.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSept. 21, 1932.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your report of August 5th on the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, I beg to advise you that there is $2500.00 available for work at this school.\n\nI would be glad if you would advise me what you consider the most urgent repairs, with an estimate of the cost; also please state how you would recommend having the work carried out.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.

Perry, Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B.C.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nSeptember 23, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, copy of which is enclosed herewith, regarding the construction of a covered walk from the new building to the old Girls' Home, which is now used as classrooms for the pupils, and which has been renovated to allow classrooms to be held therein.\n\nThe total cost, according to the estimate submitted by the Principal, is $202.51, and the work to be done by the pupils who are doing manual training, and I would recommend that the same be granted. The Principal has also sent me a sketch of the proposed structure which I enclose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M. Halliday)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nST. MICHAEL'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nSeptember 20, 1932.\n\nW.M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Halliday:\n\nAt the opening of the present term we placed four of our five classrooms in the building previously known as the \"Girls' Home\", now utilized as an Academic Block. In this building we have placed electric light, have done a great deal of painting, and have overhauled and put into first-class shape the heating plant, all at the cost of school grants. Tremendous relief has been experienced in the main building as a result of moving the classrooms to the academic block; we have more room available for play room space during the long wet winters, and we have been able to turn one of the former classrooms into a manufacturing room where the girls can under proper tuition take dressmaking and sewing in a proper way.\n\nWe have already formed a conclusion, however, that it will be necessary to build a covered walk from the rear of the present main building to the front steps of this academic block. As you are aware, the rainfall here during the winter is extremely heavy, and though all our children are equipped with coats or slickers, yet we feel that the health of the youngsters demands that there be a covered way from one building to the other. In this connection we have drawn a rough sketch plan which we attach herewith showing the proposed arcade or covered walk from the laundry entrance of the main building to the front steps of the academic block. The material required to complete this structure would be as follows:\n\n| Item                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|-----------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| 2000 F.B.M. 2 x 4\"    |          | $14.00     | $28.00|\n| 400 \" 4 x 4\"          |          | $15.00     | $6.00 |\n| 6400 \" 6\" Shiplap     |          | $14.00     | $89.60|\n| 70 bdls # 5X Shingles |          | $2.50      | $35.00|\n| 1 keg Shingle Nails   |          | $6.75      | $6.75 |\n| 1 \" 3\" Nails          |          | $3.86      | $3.86 |\n| 1 \" 2\" Nails          |          | $4.30      | $4.30 |\n| 5 gals Shingle Stain  |          |            | $11.00|\n| 5 \" Battleship Grey   |          |            | $18.00|\n\nTotal - $202.51\nWould you please consider a request to the Department that they provide the materials as outlined above for this work, which we would be glad to undertake as a major project for the boys of the manual training class, thus involving no labor charges whatever. It would be a very useful piece of construction for the youngsters to undertake, and it would at the same time provide what we consider to be a major want for this institution.\n\nThanking you for your consideration of this request,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\"F. Earl Anfield\"\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, October 1st, 1932.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, enclosing a communication which you received from the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School regarding the construction of a covered walk from the new building to the old Girls' Home, also a sketch of the proposed structure, and giving an estimate of the cost of the material.\n\nIn this connection, I have to say that there is available in our Estimates for the current fiscal year for work at this school the sum of $2,500., and Mr. C. C. Perry, Assistant Indian Commissioner, Victoria, has been requested to advise the Department what are considered to be the most urgent repairs and work required. He will, no doubt, take up this matter with you at an early date and the building of the covered walk could then be considered in conjunction with other repairs, etc., necessary to be carried out at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Dr. Westgate, stating that the bake oven at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School is out of commission, through burnt out flues caused by back draught in chimneys. It is stated that, to place the oven in workable condition, an expenditure of approximately $150 would be required for new brick flues and labour.\n\nThe Department will approve of you incurring an expenditure not exceeding approximately the amount stated, to cover the cost of material and labour in having the work required to the flues carried out. Please obtain accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the brick and other materials necessary and also covering the labour employed in having the work performed. These accounts you should certify and forward to the Department for payment. The Department will leave the carrying out of this work in your hands, to make the best arrangements and at the lowest possible cost.\n\nDr. Westgate states that the chimneys should be heightened next year, in order to provide better draught. I shall be pleased to have an estimate of the cost of material and labour in this connection and it is possible that funds for the purpose can be provided.\n\nIf the work now required in placing these chimneys in workable condition for the use of the bake oven can be deferred until the Department has an estimate regarding the cost of heightening the chimneys, it might now be necessary to carry out same at the present time, as the heightening of the chimneys would overcome the difficulty now experienced in the use of the bake oven. However, if you consider it necessary to have the work mentioned above performed immediately, you may proceed to have it done, as instructed above. However, you should take into consideration the question of cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nF. Earl Anfield, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter dated September 21st, No.156-0-5, in regard to the amount of $2500.00 which the Department has been good enough to make available for work at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, and in which it was requested that I advise the Department what I considered the most urgent repairs and estimate of the cost, and also state how I would recommend having the work carried out. In reply I beg to say:\n\n1. The special report dated January 5th, 1931, prepared by Mr. Engineer W. G. Warren of the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau on repairs and improvements to the school draining system and waterproofing of building indicates that the cost of what is known as the Minwax treatment to be given the school walls on the south and east exposures will amount approximately to $1890.00, which waterproofing could only be carried out in dry weather, preferably in the month of July. It appears therefore out of the question to undertake any expenditure on waterproofing since the rainy season has now begun. It is to be hoped therefore that this appropriation could be held in abeyance for expenditure after the end of the current fiscal year.\n\n2. The raising of two chimneys to an additional height of 15 feet each, from the kitchen and laundry on the one hand and from the Principal's residence on the other, should be proceeded with immediately. It is understood from Mr. Indian Agent Halliday that the main chimney was raised at the same time a barn was constructed recently at Alert Bay. It may be necessary to secure the services of a carpenter at Vancouver to go to Alert Bay to attend to the scaffolding, while the services of a bricklayer may be obtainable in the vicinity of Malcolm Island, and such a man I am informed by Agent Halliday resides there and is able to do excellent work. Under separate cover I am writing the Department in regard to the removal of old buildings from a sawmill site recently acquired under lease by the Department from the Synod Authorities of the Anglican Church. It is thought that the carpenter who does the work connected with the chimneys might also be able to supervise the demolition of the old buildings at the same time and his rate of pay for such work will not of necessity be the same as paid for ordinary carpenter work. The prevailing rate of pay for this work would be that of the Public Works Department, whatever that may be. It is estimated that the cost of erecting the chimney extensions together with material, freight and fare of the carpenter to and from Vancouver should not exceed approximately the sum of $425.00. Of course the cost would be kept as low as possible compatible with a satisfactory job. I would suggest that Mr. J. Woods of Vancouver, who has done some very good work for the Department before at the Indian villages of Klahoose, Homalco and Pemberton, be sent to Alert Bay to supervise both of the above mentioned jobs. He is sober and reliable and understands the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nC.C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6428, file 875-5, part 4)\nOttawa, October 27, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15/6/26641 of the 18th instant, relative to the repairs required at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nIn connection with the water-proofing of the building, this work is to be held in abeyance, as it is noted that it is too late in the season to have it carried out. An item to cover the cost will be noted for our Estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nRegarding the raising of two chimneys to an additional height and giving an estimate of the cost, I have to say that the Department is giving this matter consideration, and, if this improvement is to be proceeded with, you will receive the necessary authority later and also the name of a competent foreman-carpenter to oversee the work.\n\nYou might also defer the matter of removing the old sawmill buildings until you are informed as to the name of the foreman-carpenter whose services are to be engaged to supervise the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. C. Ferry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nOttawa, October 27, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to official letter of the 22nd instant, regarding the authority granted to you to incur the expenditure covering the cost of material and labour in having the work required to the flues at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School carried out. Mr. C. C. Perry, Assistant Indian Commissioner, has given an estimate of the cost of raising two chimneys - one from the kitchen and laundry and the other from the Principal's residence. In due course, Mr. Perry will be given the necessary authority to have the work in connection with the raising of these chimneys performed. Therefore, you will please take no action in carrying out any work on these chimneys.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. Earl Anfield, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nSir:\n\nKindly find herewith copy of telegram received today from Captain G.H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, dated Alert Bay, October 20th, instant, in regard to the desirability that the fire engine at the Indian Residential School be thoroughly examined by an engineer. This telegram will be self-explanatory.\n\nMr. C.E. Webb, District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau, at Vancouver, was in the office this morning when I showed him the telegram. He suggested that if the Department wished to have an engineer look into the matter he would be prepared to send one to Alert Bay for this purpose if instructed to do so. With this in view the matter is being referred to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.

Develops seventy five pounds in pump minimum necessary 100. No water escaping relief valve only possible throw water through two lines hose to roof main building not over. Recommend immediate inspection by Engineer Warren if in vicinity. Arrive Victoria Monday afternoon.\n\nInspector Indian Schools.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith copy of a letter dated October 21st, instant, signed by Reverend Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary, Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, together with copy of a letter covered thereby, dated October 21st, addressed to the Secretary, Indian Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C., Winnipeg, Man., by Mr. Anfield, Esq., Principal, Indian Residential School, Alert Bay, B.C., these letters being in regard to certain financial grants asked for from the Department for expenditure upon the St. Michael's Indian Residential School at Alert Bay, Kwawkewlth Indian Agency, B.C.\n\nIn this connection I beg to inform the Department that Reverend Dr. Westgate called at the Victoria office on October 17th, instant, at which time our discussion was brief but pleasant. Dr. Westgate referred incidentally to the matter of an issue in March last which arose from the inquiry made by the Inspector of Indian Schools regarding the financing of the Alert Bay School from per capita grants, in which connection the report of the Inspector dated March 14th, last, together with Commissioner Ditchburn's covering letter dated March 15th, 1932, so the Department's reply dated March 23rd, 1932, No. 156-0-6, might be referred to. Dr. Westgate said he did not wish to have the Principal of the Alert Bay School interrogated in regard to the School's financing as the Department was furnished with statements from the Winnipeg office. I replied that I was given to understand that such an arrangement existed, and that Inspector Barry had considered it his duty at the time of his inspection, having no instructions to the contrary, to ask for particulars of school financing as in the case of other schools under his general directions. I told him, further, that I understood that Inspector Barry belonged to his Church, and hoped that the Doctor would be able to find a mutual ground for understanding in his contacts as well as those of his officers with him.\n\nSince Dr. Westgate's visit to Victoria, he has been to Alert Bay, where he met Inspector Barry and had a lengthy discussion with him. I understand from Inspector Barry that during his interview with Dr. Westgate, the latter suggested that the former might make a charge of fraud against the Missionary Society if he felt that there was anything wrong with the Society's method of financing the Alert Bay School, the suggestion having been offered as a result of the Inspector's hesitancy in the matter of supporting the Society's requests for further Departmental grants unless he was satisfied that the per capita grants voted for the School were being used wholly for this purpose, of which he was not then satisfied.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nInspector....\nInspector Barry returned to Victoria on the 24th October, instant, and the enclosed correspondence above referred to was received here on October 25th.\n\nSince that time I have been fortunate in being able to have a full discussion regarding the correspondence jointly with both Inspector Barry and Mr. Indian Agent Halliday, the latter being in Victoria and now on retiring leave since October 2nd, instant. As a result of this conference, it has been agreed by the officials mentioned, as follows:\n\n(1) Since the 1933-34 Estimates of Kwawkewlth Agency show the sum of $40,000.00 required for Alert Bay Indian Residential School, the sum of $36,000.00 represents the per capita grant of $180.00 for 200 pupils; the remaining $4,000.00 is for \"incidental expenses.\"\n\n(2) From the abovementioned item of $4000.00 might be drawn, if approved, the undermentioned items shown in the Principal's letter of October 21st, herewith, viz:\n\nNo.1. 1 - 8 H.P. Petters engine approximate cost $545.00 (old engine to be used eventually in technical training)\n\nNo.4. Waterproofing walls of school, already available but may have to be carried over to next Fiscal Year on account of need for work being done in month of July in dry weather. Also raising of chimney stacks for laundry and residence. (See letter from Commissioner's office to Department dated Oct. 16th, 1932\u2014also Dept. file 156-0-8) \u2014 Joint work to cost, approximately $2,500.00\n\nNo.11. Dynamite, caps and fuse to complete clearing of all land slashed under contract made in 1927-28, provided Department is satisfied that contract, of which neither the Alert Bay Indian office nor Victoria Indian office has any knowledge is in order, it being understood the contract was made on advice of Mr. Anfield direct to Department, and in which connection one Myers was seeking permission to do some fir logging for the school and receive payment in spruce timber which he could sell. Cost approximately $265.00\n\nNo.12. Grant to remove verandah from face of schoolroom block, $115.00\n\nCost of inspection and repair if necessary to fire engine pump as reported on separately from Commissioner's office (See letter of October 21st, 1932) Approximate cost, $50.00\n\nOther incidental expenses not yet classified, $265.00\n\nTotal provided in 1933-34 Estimates, $4,000.00\n\n(3) that......\n(3) That apart from the item mentioned above, the undermentioned items as numbered in the Principal's letter of October 21st, be recommended for favorable consideration, viz:-\n\nItem No.2. To substitute for steam cabinet a larger boiler as there is not enough steam to operate such a drying cabinet: Instead of doing away with the boiler at present in use in the laundry which was considered too small in the first instance, it is suggested that the steam radiator system be extended by installation of two radiators for drying purposes.\n\nAlternative: Construction of drying shed for drying by natural air, as clothes are dried successfully by this method in other places at Alert Bay including the Agency. --------------- Cost cannot be given without estimate.\n\nItem No.3. Instead of purchasing new set of storage batteries, there are two alternatives suggested in the interests of economy:-\nThe first is to have the present set examined by a battery expert as positive plates only may be affected;\nThe second is the purchase of a new set and trade in the old set.\nThe cost cannot be given without an estimate.\n\nItem No.5. Wooden Arcade, already recommended by Agent to Department that material be provided, the work to be done by the boys under supervision.\nThe cost is not stated, except by Principal whose estimate is $250.00 but whether for material or labor, or both, will be shown in official correspondence on this item.\n\nItem No.6. Replacement of oven flues in bakery.\nIf tin flues provided, cost will be approximately $30.00;\nIf brick, which is more permanent, cost would be approximately $150.00.\nThe Principal asks for $250.00 which is considered too high. An estimate would settle the matter if called for.\nWhile this work is not strictly urgent, it should be done when funds permit.\n\nItem No.7. One 2-bottom 14\" Oliver gang plow for Tractor at a cost of $160.00 is not considered necessary since not sufficient land cleared at present to warrant this in addition to plows already on hand which are as follows:-\nSingle bottom tractor plow, 2 horse plows.\n\nIt is....\nIt is thought boys learning the use of a plow should do the work by hand if the training is to be of value to them when they leave school for the coast reserves.\n\nItem No.8 Bread Slicer at cost of approximately $90.00 not deemed necessary as a rotary slicer of satisfactory kind and in good condition already there.\n\nItem No.9 A Potato Peeler at cost of approximately $140.00 not deemed necessary since training of children does not make such a machine necessary. I am not opposed to providing the slicer as a time saver.\n\nItem No.10 Utility building. Estimate cost considered much too high. It is thought that for around $5000.00 - $6000.00 at today's low prices for material and labor, a suitable building could be erected. Such a building is considered necessary, but since the item was not mentioned in time for inclusion in the 1933-34 Estimates for B.C., which were sent to Ottawa in September, it may be possible to obtain funds for the purpose a year hence.\n\nIn considering such a building provision should be made for its usefulness in technical training in machinery and boat building, as at Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.\n\nAs before stated the deductions offered above are those of the Inspector of Schools and Indian Agent and I am inclined to agree with their recommendations, unless sufficient reasons can be given for changing any of them to meet conditions not hitherto explained.\n\nIt seems unfortunate that it is necessary to withhold information from the Inspector of Indian Schools that would enable him to make his recommendations for expenditure without equivocation or mental reservation, in which connection his recently reported unpleasant interview with Dr. Westgate is much to be regretted since our officers wish to be in a position to co-operate with the Church Authorities in every appreciable way and are committed to such in their activities in many directions, as their records will show.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nTo,\n\nC.C. Perry, Esq., Asst. Commissioner,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, VICTORIA, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Perry:\n\nI have gone carefully into the more urgent requirements of the Alert Bay Residential School, along with Mr. Principal Anfield, and you will find a list of the items embodied in the attached letter addressed to our Indian Residential School Commission.\n\nThis list will be incorporated in a comprehensive list which I will compile for all our Society's Schools immediately after I return to Winnipeg at the beginning of November and which will be in the hands of the Department at Ottawa about the middle of next month.\n\nAny help you may be able to give in having these requirements provided by the Department next year will be greatly appreciated by our Society, and also by the school management.\n\nVery kind regards,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n\"T.B.R.Westgate\"\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\nIndian Residential School Commission\n\nMr. F.

They are placed in order of approximate greatest need.\n\n1. An 8 H.P. Petters semi-diesel engine for the domestic pumping plant, approx. cost to be $940.00. This machine is needed to replace the present 5 H.P. engine which is seriously overloaded.\n\n2. Steam drying cabinets for the laundry. Cost unknown at present but on receipt of word from the Agents in Vancouver, we will advise further. With the weather experienced here in wintertime it is almost impossible to get the clothes dry with the equipment now provided.\n\n3. New set of storage batteries for the lighting plant. The present set is almost out of commission, having served for over three years. Approximate cost of 54 Exide set, $500.00.\n\n4. Waterproofing south and east walls of main school, and raising the residence and kitchen chimney stacks, approx. cost $2500.00 (voted)\n\n5. Wooden arcade with concrete footings between main and school blocks. Approx. cost $500.00\n\n6. Replacement of oven flues in bakery. Approx. cost $150.00\n   K.B.

A safety bread, bacon, and vegetable slicer, approx. cost $90.00\n\n9. Potatoes peeler with at least 50 lb capacity, approx. cost $140.00\n\n10. Utility building, with gymnasium on upper floor, and provision on ground floor for technical and vocational instruction.

BUSKARD.\n\nThere is available, in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, an amount of $2,500 to carry out certain work at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nMr. C. C. Perry, Assistant Indian Commissioner, was requested to advise the Department what he considered the most urgent repairs and to give an estimate of the cost. He recommends the raising of two chimneys to an additional height of 15 ft. each, at an estimated cost of $425, also the removing of old sawmill buildings from the school site, at an estimated cost of $500, in connection with an agreement with the Anglican Synod of British Columbia regarding the lease of certain land and a wharf for use in connection with the school. He recommends, further, that the work be done by Indian labour under the supervision of a competent carpenter foreman. He has suggested that Mr. J. Woods, of Vancouver who previously was employed in charge of the work of erecting Indian houses on several of the reserves, be sent to Alert Bay to supervise both of the above mentioned jobs.\n\nI shall be pleased to be advised as to the name and address of the foreman-carpenter, whose services should be engaged to oversee the Indian labour in performing the above work. Alert Bay is in the federal district of Vancouver North.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nSir:\n\nMr. F.E. Anfield, Principal of St. Michael's Indian Residential School, Alert Bay, has placed before me two propositions for providing Indians with labour during the present winter.\n\n(1) A considerable amount of clearing and slashing to be carried out on land belonging to the school. The school authorities will be able to expend $400.00 for the supply of dynamite and stumping powder, also supplement the relief wages of men actually employed in handling the dynamite by $1.00 a day.\n\n(2) The dismantling of a sawmill building now in disuse, the property of the Diocese of Columbia. Some economy could be effected here by the careful dismantling intact of all the framework and the salvage of good lumber, which could be used in the erection of work shops at the Residential School, another project which is on tap.\n\nKindly inform me if authority could be furnished to proceed with this work as soon as possible, so that the Indians may have something to do; making allowances for weather conditions, it is likely that this work would extend through the entire winter, and thus curtail the direct relief issue to a considerable extent. I would request that the rate of wages be the same as last winter, i.e. $2.00 per day for married men, and $1.50 per day for single men.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(E.G. Newnham)\nA/Indian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nWinnipeg, Man. November 10, 1932.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Bake Oven at Alert Bay School.\n\nOn October 20th, I sent you the following night lettergram from Alert Bay re the above:\n\n\"Bake oven at school here practically out of commission through burnt out flues caused by back draft in chimneys which must be heightened next year stop to place in permanently workable condition cost new brick flues and labour estimated at one hundred fifty dollars please wire authority principal Anfield incur this expenditure immediately as smoke from bake oven disfiguring building and spoiling the bread.\"\n\nNo reply was received to this message before I left Alert Bay on October 23rd., but I have just learned from the Principal, in a letter dated November 4th, that the repairs requested were authorized by your Department in a letter dated Ottawa, October 22nd., #156-0-5 and subsequently cancelled in another letter from your Department, dated October 27th, #156-0-5. From copies of the above letters which the Principal has forwarded to me, I am of the opinion that he has misunderstood the same. I understand your letter of October 22nd, as giving the authority requested in my night lettergram of October 20th., to spend approximately $150.00 to have the bake oven repaired immediately, and I understand your letter of October 27th, to mean that you desire the work of having the chimneys raised to be deferred until next year. If my understanding\nof these letters is correct, and I think it is, then I beg to state that the question of raising the chimneys next year will be agreeable to our Society. But this work should certainly be undertaken as soon as weather conditions will permit early next summer. I understand that the sum of $2,500 was made available by your Department for this work to be done during the current fiscal year, but for some reason or other, the work was not done, and the school management have been greatly inconvenienced as the result. For one thing, as the Principal could not light a fire in either of the fire-places in his residence, without filling the building with smoke, he was obliged to purchase a gasoline heater to heat his study. Another result of the short chimney from the kitchen is the burning out of the flues in the bake oven and which prompted me to send the telegraphic message quoted above. Nothing but the most urgent need of immediate action, would have prompted me to send that message, as I saw for myself how the bread was being ruined and the walls of the bake oven room being blackened by the clouds of smoke which came from the bake oven itself as soon as the fire was lighted.\n\nOn behalf of our Commission, as well as on behalf of the school management, I desire to thank your Department for authorizing the expenditure necessary to place the bake oven in serviceable condition again. I am hopeful that the school management may be able to use it without any further great inconvenience from smoke until the kitchen chimney is heightened by about fifteen feet. I feel well assured that the draught will never be satisfactory either from the bake oven or from the kitchen range until the kitchen chimney is heightened, and this will explain my request that this work be undertaken not later than the early summer of next year.\n\nThe Principal informs me that the repairs to the bake oven have already been effected, the necessity of the same being clearly revealed by the fact that every flue in the oven was burned out and the furnace grates and protecting bars were in the same condition. Vouchers for the work done will be forwarded by the Principal to your Department through the local Indian Agent, and I am instructing him to quote your letter of October 2nd, #156-0-5 as his authority for incurring this expenditure.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nWINNIPEG, MAN. November 12, 1932.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring my recent visit to the Alert Bay School my attention was directed to a number of very urgent needs, only one of which has been specifically brought to the attention of your Department, namely, that of repairs to the bake oven. The other needs have been tabulated in the comprehensive list of requirements sent forward to you on the 7th inst., and most of which our Society hopes you may be able to supply next year. There are some, however, which cannot, with safety, be allowed to stand so long, and I now desire to direct your attention to these, in the hope that it may be possible for your Department, despite existing financial stringency, to provide the same.\n\n(1) A 6 H.P. Petters semi-diesel engine to take the place of the 5 H.P. engine now in use in the pump-house. The 5 H.P. engine is seriously overloaded, and should it break down, the school will be left without a water supply. The estimated cost is $845.00.\n\n(2) A steam drying cabinet for the laundry. This is unquestionably a very urgent need, as clothes can seldom be dried in the open air and must be dried in the main building. The laundry work is so heavy that without better drying equipment the work of the school is disorganized, and the health of the children endangered. I enclose herewith the original of a letter received by the Principal of our Alert Bay School from the Stanley Brock Ltd., giving a quotation on their Canadian Wood Truck Dry Room. You will note that they estimate the cost at approximately $845.00. The Principal states that the sum of $40.00 should be added to this amount for a pulley for the main shaft and for a suitable oak tan belt.\nThe drying tumbler installed at this school is altogether too small for the amount of work to be done, and to install the second-hand referred to in the latter part of the enclosed letter would not help matters very much.\n\n(3) A wooden arcade with concrete foundations between the main school building and the class-room block. The cost of materials is estimated at \u00a3250.00, and if these are delivered at the school, the school management will do the work. When I visited the school last month it rained practically all the time I was there, namely, from Wednesday October 19th, until Sunday, October 23rd. The children were unable to take much exercise in the open air and I thought it a great pity that they should have to walk from the main school building to the class-room block through heavy rain when an arcade could be built at such a moderate cost.\n\nI fully realize, Sir, the difficulty in securing funds to meet requirements such as the above, at the present time, but the need in each case, is so urgent that I feel I would be neglecting my duty if I did not direct your attention to the same. I must ask you, therefore, to give to these needs the prompt and sympathetic consideration which they demand and deserve, and to do your utmost towards supplying the same with a minimum of delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, H.S.C.C.\nVancouver, B. C.\nOct. 27, 1932\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nPlease accept our apologies for not replying to your letter of the 21st previous to this time but several of our staff have been away during the present week with the result that we are much behind with our correspondence.\n\nNote that it is possible that Mr. Westgate may be in to see us in person and if such is the case we will be very glad to go into this matter thoroughly with him.\n\nIn referring to your second paragraph we note that the tumbler is inadequate for your needs and the question arises as to whether you have enough steam to really get production out of this machine. Believe you would be well advised to check this up and write us telling what steam pressure you have.\n\nIt is possible that you could use a Truck Dryroom to advantage in your plant and we are enclosing leaflet giving specifications on this type of Dryroom. The #3421 is a 2-door dryroom with two trucks and we believe it would be large enough for your requirements in conjunction with the present tumbler that you have. This Dryroom with wood cabinet, belt driven, would cost you $630.00 f.o.b. factory, Toronto, plus Government Sales Tax of 6%. If motor driven the same cabinet would cost you $845.00. Might state that if you have a lot of woolens to be dried there is no doubt but what a drying cabinet would be much more effective for your purpose, and your woolens would come out very much better in shape than if they were dried in a tumbler.\n\nAt the present time we have on hand at Calgary a used tumbler 40 x 64, and if this is of interest to you it is possible that we could take your old tumbler in exchange on this machine. It is in\nSt. Michael's Indian School. Oct. 27, 1932\n\ngood condition and ready for installation. On this exchange we could offer you this tumbler, f.o.b. Calgary, and accept your tumbler f.o.b. Alert Bay, at a difference of $200.00. Would be very glad if you will give this your consideration and advise just what you think would work out to the best advantage. On receipt of your reply we will be very glad to check up on the freight rates for you and give you the estimated costs f.o.b. Alert Bay on either the dry-room or the tumbler, whichever you feel would suit your purpose best.\n\nWe appreciate your inquiry very much and can assure you that we will be only too pleased to do everything possible in our power to give you a satisfactory deal.\n\nThanking you for past courtesies,\n\nWe are,\n\nYours truly,\n\nSTANLEY BROCK LTD.\n\nper\n\nJBJ/HD\nThe Canadian Wood Truck Dry Room\n\nSize\n\n| Section | Doors | Coils | Trucks |\n|---------|-------|-------|--------|\n\nCabinet\n\nShall be constructed of kiln-dried lumber, tongued, grooved and beaded, and built in sections securely bolted together.

The situation appears to me to be fraught with so much danger to the staff and pupils, as well as to the material structure itself, that immediate remedial action is imperative. As the principal has not made any suggestion in this connection, and as the weather-proofing of the brick walls cannot be undertaken in weather such as he describes, I am of the opinion that the best course to take would be to have the upper half of all walls affected covered on the outside with tarpaulin or water-proof canvas. May I further suggest that you authorize by wire Assistant Commissioner Perry of Victoria, or some other representative of your Department with a practical knowledge of building construction, to proceed to Alert Bay at once, and take such protective measures as he may consider most expedient under the circumstances.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nST. MICHAEL'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nALERT BAY, B.C.\n\nNovember 16, 1932.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Residential School Commission,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been raining steadily here for approximately seven weeks, and it would be as well to make a report on the condition of the building under such circumstances. An inspection made this afternoon showed the following:\n\nBoys' Basement - The boys have been engaged three times today in mopping up the floor following the serious leak coming through the walls. It would appear that the rain is beating through the bricks higher up in the building, and the water is running down either between the bricks or in the hollow tile and settling on the top of the concrete foundation, and from there running back into the building. We would estimate that water is coming in at this source at approximately a gallon in every three minutes.\n\nPrimary Class Room - The rain is beating heavily against the south-east wall of the boys' wing and has worked itself through and is now running down the walls of this classroom, and also on the wall of the store room immediately next to this room.\n\nChildren's Dining Room - A similar condition exists here to that in the boys' basement; water is quite obviously getting through the bricks and is running down and on the inside of the dining room on which we spent a great deal of work this year applying three coats of paint.\n\nElectric Light Room - The entire south-east face of the auditorium is soaked through, and water is running into the electric light room from the face wall of the auditorium above. We would estimate that it is running here at about a gallon in two minutes.\n\nNo. 8 Dormitory, Girls' Side - The entire south-east face of this dormitory is soaking wet, and is running in streams of water. We held our hand against the plaster and filled it with water whilst we counted fifteen.\n\nNo. 7 Dormitory, Girls' Side - This is also running water on the south-east face.\nOffice of the Kwawkewlth Indian Agency,\n\nNovember 12, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 201, amounting to $150.00 in favour of Almond's Supply House Ltd., 400 East Pender St., Vancouver, B.C., for repairs to bake oven at school (Alert Bay Residential).\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 156-0-5 dated October 22, 1932.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nNovember 28, 1932.\n\nWith reference to the improvements at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, Mr. Samuel Dodson, of Calverhall Road, North Vancouver, may be engaged as a Carpenter-foreman.\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\nOttawa, November 29, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School regarding the leakage through the walls of the main building.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department regrets the inconvenience and damage caused. Upon taking this matter up with the Assistant Indian Commissioner, he recommended that the waterproofing of the walls be carried over until next year, and that it would be necessary to have this work done during dry weather in the month of July. An item is being included in our Estimates for the next fiscal year to cover the cost of this work. The Assistant Commissioner is being requested to bring this matter to the attention of the Department in May, next, and to give a recommendation as to the treatment that should be given the walls in order to make them waterproof.\n\nAuthority is being given the Commissioner to have the old saw mill buildings on the school site dismantled and the two chimneys raised to an additional height of 15 feet; also for the supplying of the material required in the erection of a wooden arid between the main school building and the classroom block. He is also being requested to have an engineer visit the school to report on the condition of the fire engine.\n\nEnquiry is being made as to which is the more urgent - the supplying of an 8 H.P. engine or a new set of storage batteries for the electric lighting equipment. There are sufficient funds only to supply one or other of the above.\n\nOther requirements at this school are being noted for our Estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Enclosed herewith you will find - (1) a copy of his statement, dated November 23rd, and (2) the original of quotations for new batteries given by Coyle Batteries Ltd., and John Redden Co. Ltd., both of Vancouver. I would direct your attention to the recommendation made by Mr. Principal Anfield that the offer made by the Coyle Batteries Ltd. be accepted. The 80 ampere hour capacity is not sufficient for the load which has to be carried at this school, and the Globalite batteries have never stood up very well at any of our schools where they have been installed. I am advised that the Coyle Battery is one of the most serviceable on the market today.\n\nTrusting that this important matter may receive the immediate attention it demands,\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nSt. Michael's Indian Residential School,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nNovember 23, 1932.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Residential School Commission,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to items submitted for replacement by the Department next year, we wish to draw the attention of the Commission to the condition of the batteries in the electric light room, bearing in mind a statement in the press that the recent fire at the Roman Catholic School in Saskatchewan was caused by short circuiting.\n\nMr. Cowling our engineer reports, and we have investigated and found his statements correct, that the batteries in the lighting room are worn to such an extent that they are short circuiting within themselves, causing serious leakage of electric current which is impregnating all the metallic surfaces of the engine room, and so much so that on climbing up to fill the water tanks for the main engines one gets a decided shock on handling the valves. These tanks are approximately ten feet from the batteries. What is really happening is that the contact plates within the batteries are fusing causing complete short circuits within the cells.\n\nAs the engines operating this plant are gasoline type, it is our opinion that this condition should be brought immediately before the attention of the Department, and to this end we are forwarding today under separate cover quotations on new battery installation.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Sgd) F.

Sam's submarine boats... the kind that pulls powerful electric donkey cars... the same kind of a battery that drives sounder and electric delivery trucks. It's the kind of a battery that's used wherever there is a need for an extremely powerful battery that can be depended upon when ever there is a heavy drain on wheel current. It is a battery that is still going strong long after the ordinary type battery has been replaced or has required expensive rebuilding and re- pairs.\n\nThe superiority of the Delco-Light IRONCLAD battery is due to the con- struction of the positive plates.\n\nYou've often seen a pot of tea made. You know how the boiling water passes through the little cloth bag and extracts the tea, the leaves remaining enclosed in the cloth bag.\n\nThis same principle is used in the Delco-Light IRONCLAD battery. The positive plates are made up of a series of finely slotted hard-rubber tubes as shown in the picture. These hollow tubes contain the active material. They allow the liquid solution in the cell to reach this active material without releasing it from the plate.\n\nYour Delco-Light Dealer Will Gladly Demonstrate This Super Battery to You\n\nDELCO APPLIANCE CORPORATION\nRochester, N.Y.\n\nDEI CO-LIGHT IRONCLAD\nTHE GREATEST STORAGE BATTERY OF ALL TIME FOR INDIVIDUAL ELECTRIC PLANTS\nThese Slotted Rubber Tubes Revolutionize Battery Construction\n\nHere are illustrated four of the finely slotted, hard-rubber tubes which form the actual \"backbone\" of the Delco-Light IRONCLAD battery. In ordinary storage batteries the active material is applied to the positive plate, in the form of paste.\n\nUnder heavy duty work, the active material is apt to crack, peel off and shed. This happens because there is nothing to hold the active material in place and keep it from breaking away from the plate.\n\nBut this is not true of the IRONCLAD. Here the active material is confined within hard-rubber tubes exactly like the inside of a bottle. These tubes are finely slotted in order to permit the cell solution to come in contact with the active material. The positive active material in the Delco-Light IRONCLAD is held firmly in place\u2014it can't get away!\n\nBecause of this special construction, IRONCLAD plates are thicker, heavier and more rugged. The IRONCLAD is always ready for any emergency\u2014with a tremendous reserve of power\u2014regardless of weather or atmospheric conditions.\n\nAnd in addition to all these advantages, the hard-rubber tubes act as special separators and assist the specially selected wood separators in maintaining the proper amount of spacing and insulation between the plates. This results in longer life, better service and greater all-around satisfaction.\n\nThe battery is one of the most vital parts of your individual electric plant. That's why a good battery is highly important; why it has so much to do with the service and satisfaction you get from your plant.\n\nYour battery must function instantly and always. You depend on it for constant, reliable, year-after-year service without break or interruption. It must answer every call you put on it\u2014from the smallest electric bulb to the unusually large output required in starting a motor. It must take care equally well of every load demand, small or large.\n\nA 16-cell, 52-cell, Delco-Light IRONCLAD battery has an average lifetime of service of over 4,000,000 watt hours.\n\nThis amount of energy is more than 50% in excess of the energy which can be obtained from any equal sized individual electric plant battery of the ordinary type.\n\nThus, it is easily seen that the IRONCLAD represents a greater value for the money than can be obtained by the purchase of any battery of ordinary design.\n\nThe long continued and constantly increasing use of the IRONCLAD type of battery by large industrial firms demanding dependable service with reduced operating costs, is additional proof of its exceptional value.\n\nWith every Delco-Light IRONCLAD battery sold, a Delco-light issues a written warranty. Should the battery prove defective during the term of the warranty, it will be replaced.\n\nGet in touch with your Delco-Light dealer. He will explain how easy it is for you to own this new IRONCLAD battery.\nOttawa, November 29, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to your Nos. 15/6/26641 and 15/6/26780 of the 18th and 28th ultimo, respectively, regarding the work to be undertaken at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nYou may arrange to have the work carried out in the raising of the two chimneys to an additional height of fifteen feet each, from the kitchen and laundry on the one hand and from the Principal's residence on the other. It is noted you estimate the cost of erecting the chimney extensions, including material, freight and fare of foreman-carpenter from Vancouver to be approximately $425. You or the Principal should arrange for the purchase of any materials required, from firms on the list to receive consideration. All costs should be kept as low as possible, compatible with the carrying out of a satisfactory job. Mr. Samuel Dodson, of Galverhall Road, North Vancouver, is to be engaged as carpenter-foreman. The prevailing rate of wages will be allowed. Indian labour is to be utilized as far as possible.\n\nThe removing of the old sawmill buildings from the school site should also be carried out. Indian labour for this purpose should be utilized as far as possible, with Mr. Dodson as foreman-carpenter. The sawmill buildings should be carefully dismantled and all good material salvaged and properly piled. This material may be disposed of as mentioned in official letter of the 26th ultimo. The cost of the work should not exceed the sum stated in said letter, viz. $500.\n\nThe Church authorities have requested that a wooden arcade, with concrete foundations, be erected between the main school building and the classroom block. It is estimated the cost of materials for this purpose would be approximately $250, and, if delivered at the school, the school management would\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\nperform the labour in having the arcade constructed. You may arrange for the purchase, from firms on the list to receive consideration, of the materials required. It would be advisable to consult the Principal as to what will be required for the purpose; it being understood that all labour will be performed by the school authorities without cost to the Department.\n\nReferring to your No. 15/6/26698 of the 21st ultimo, in regard to the desirability of having the fire engine thoroughly examined by an engineer, I have to say that you may arrange with the District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power and Hydroelectric Bureau, Vancouver, to have an engineer proceed to Alert Bay to examine and report on the condition of the fire engine. It is noted you have estimated the cost of the inspection to be approximately $50.\n\nItemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of all materials supplied in carrying out the above authorized work should be forwarded for payment. Proper time sheets, in triplicate, should be kept of the labour employed. These should be signed by the individual labourers, certified by you and forwarded for payment.\n\nRegarding the waterproofing of the walls of the main school building, I have to say that the Department has received a report regarding the difficulty the school has been experiencing by rain beating through the bricks. While this inconvenience is regretted, it is noted you recommend that the work be carried out during the dry weather in July, next. An item will be noted for our Estimates for the next fiscal year to provide funds for the purpose, and I would request that you draw this matter to the attention of the Department not later than May, next.\n\nIt is noted that the Principal requested that an 8 H.P. Petters semi-Diesel engine be supplied, to replace the present 5 H.P. engine in use for the domestic pumping plant, also that a new set of storage batteries be supplied for the lighting plant. You should report which of these items is more urgently required at the present time, giving an estimate of the cost of the equipment which you recommend be supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\nVancouver, B.C.\nJanuary 12, 1935.\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb:\n\nI visited Alert Bay School on the 4th to 7th of January for the purpose of examining the fire pumping plant of the school. The principal of the school, Mr. F. Anfield, had reported under date of December 16th that on frequent trials the pump would not deliver water in sufficient quantity or at a great enough pressure to cover the school building. He further reported that the difficulty was probably due to stoppage of the intake screen which had frequently become corroded.\n\nUpon examination I found that the cause of the difficulty reported by Mr. Anfield was due to clogging of the pump impeller, several pieces of wood and some small stones having become lodged in the suction side. No damage was caused to the pump however, and it functioned perfectly when cleared. It is probable that this foreign material found its way into the suction pipe when first laid and took some time to work up to the pump. On test two streams of water at 85 lbs. pressure were obtained which were capable of covering the roof of the building with a moderate wind blowing and without making use of the reserve power of the engine.\n\nThe suction screen was found to be fairly free having recently been cleaned by the school engineer. It appears that the screen, which is of cast iron and has an aggregate opening area in excess of 200 square inches, grows tubercles over the openings and requires frequent cleaning in order to be kept open. The intake may only be reached during very low tides and in winter time it is exceedingly difficult to reach at all due to the prevailing wind. It would be desirable to have the cast iron screen changed for one of cast bronze which would not grow tubercles and which could readily be cleaned with a wire brush on a pole if found necessary.\n\nFrom observations I have come to the conclusion that the intake is now in shallower water than when first laid. This appears to be due in part to the shifting of the pipe line about 8 to 10 feet and to the movement of sand. While ordinarily the working of the pump is not affected, during very low tides it is possible that the pump might not operate due to insufficient water over the intake. To overcome the difficulty the pipeline should be extended for about 40 feet.\n\nThe cost of the proposed alterations has been estimated at $265.00 and could be most cheaply\ncarried out in June or July when extremely low tides prevail.\n\nThe suggested changes are recommended to maintain the fire preventive service at its greatest efficiency.\n\nEstimate\n\n40 feet 8\" blk. wrot iron pipe $306.21  $122.40\n4 - 8\" flanges on pipe @ $5.80  15.20\n24 - 1/2 x 3/4 bolts  2.40\n3 - lead gaskets  3.00\nBronze screen 70 lbs. @ 40\u00a2 flanged for 10\" x 16\" steel flange  28.00\nfreight and cartage  12.00\nLabour & alterations treating pipe etc.  50.00\nSupervision and contingencies  32.00\n\n$ 265.00\n\nW.C.

These returns should give the names of the individual labourers employed, the time they were engaged in the work and the rate paid. You should have the parties to whom you make payment sign the returns, in triplicate, in the column for that purpose. You should certify the returns and forward them to the Department in accounting for the expenditure from the cheque. It is necessary that these labour returns be forwarded by you before the end of the present fiscal year, viz., March 31st, next. At the same time, you should furnish a report as to the progress that has been made in carrying out the work which was authorized at this school, viz., the raising of two chimneys to an additional height of 15 feet each, the removing of the old saw mill buildings from the school site and the building of a wooden arcade, with concrete foundation, between the main school building and the classroom block.\n\nIf you make the purchase of the materials, properly certified accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost, should also be forwarded before the end of March, next. The Department is not aware as to whether you or Mr. Commissioner Perry arranged for the purchase of the materials, but the carrying out of the work as mentioned above should, if possible, be completed in order that payment can be made for material and labour before the closing of our books for the present fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

Those at present in operation can hardly last out the present month, and we are removing fused cells almost every day. Of the 55 cells originally installed, seven have now been removed, leaving us hardly enough current to turn the engines over, and further requiring that we should run the engines twice as often as usual for charging purposes. The cells remaining on the battery stand are going fast, and we most strongly urge that the Department's choice of replacement should be the batteries rather than the engine.\n\nWe received quotations from the John Reden Co., Ltd., Vancouver, and from Coyle Batteries Ltd., Vancouver, B.C., and these are before the Department now.

This battery is a new departure in battery construction and our success in the field with this particular class of merchandise has been such that we have no hesitation in living up to the recommended guaranteed period of five years. From experience we would say that they would last considerably longer than that due to their rugged construction. The enclosed folder will show you the construction of this battery, which is a radical change from Globalite you have at the present time.\n\nWe trust that you will give our quotation your favorable consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJOHN REDDEN COMPANY LIMITED,\n\nOffice Manager.\n\n(Undoubtedly a good battery, but expensive & non-Canadian)\n\nGL/NP Encl.\nTo St. Michael's Indian Residential School,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nWe wish to quote a price of Six Hundred and Seventy-two Dollars ($672.00) f.o.b. Alert Bay, for 56 cells Ironclad, 7 plate, 95 ampere hour, batteries. Guarantee - 5 years, replacement policy.\n\nJOHN REDDEN COMPANY LIMITED,\n\nOffice Manager.\n\nGL/NP.\nOttawa, December 9, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, forwarding copy of a communication which you received from the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, in which he requests that new batteries be supplied for the electric lighting plant. It is noted he encloses quotations for the supplying of a larger type battery than is at present in use.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department is communicating with Mr. C. C. Perry, Assistant Indian Commissioner, Victoria. He is being requested to take the matter up with the Principal and to arrange for the purchase and delivery of a battery of the capacity that will be satisfactory for use at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, December 9, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to the last paragraph of official letter of the 29th ultimo, regarding the request of the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, that an S H. P. Engine be supplied for the domestic pumping plant and also a new set of storage batteries for the lighting plant.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that a communication has been received from the Reverend Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary, B. S. C. G., enclosing copy of a letter which he received from the Principal, together with quotations for the supplying of batteries. It would appear that the batteries are more urgently required than the engine for the pumping plant. I am enclosing, for your information, copy of letter from the Principal, as well as the quotations which he received. From the correspondence, it appears that a larger battery than the one now in use should be supplied. The Principal requests a battery of 106 ampere hour capacity.\n\nFunds are available for the purpose of providing this equipment. Therefore, I would request that you take the matter up with the Principal, ascertain definitely what is required and place the order for the batteries immediately with a firm on the list to receive consideration in either Victoria or Vancouver. It is noted, from the quotation enclosed, that the cost for the supplying of a 106 ampere hour battery, f. o. b. Alert Bay, will be approximately $435.\n\nPlease obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost, together with receipt for the freight charges. You should ascertain from the Principal that the shipment has been received in good order and then attach the account to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and send it to the Department for payment. The Rev. Dr. Westgate is being informed that you have received instructions to purchase and forward the new batteries. This matter should receive your prompt attention. The enclosed correspondence should be returned with the voucher in payment for the batteries.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nSir:\n\nIn regard to the project of raising chimneys an extra fifteen feet for the Kitchen, laundry and Principal's residence at the Alert Bay Residential School, for which an approximate appropriation of $425.00 has been granted, less the payment of labour and fare of a foreman-carpenter to and from Vancouver who is now employed supervising the demolition of old sawmill buildings, and who was also to have been employed in supervising the erection and demolition of scaffolding around the said chimneys, I beg to state that Mr. F.E. Anfield, the Principal, has now raised the question as to the safety of erecting brick chimneys, and has suggested as an alternative that steel metal jacks be used instead. A copy of an estimate for this latter work is attached.\n\nTo my mind Mr. Anfield's idea is quite logical; to erect chimneys single-ply an additional fifteen feet undoubtedly would be dangerous, but the whole proposition needs to be viewed from many different angles. The price quoted on the attached copy of estimate would make this extremely difficult to cover within the appropriation of $425.00 and pay the foreman-carpenter also. There is also the disadvantage of giving the school building a most unsightly appearance; this would also be the case if the original idea was proceeded with and they were raised another fifteen feet with brick, but not so much so as by the use of metal jacks.\n\nHowever if it is possible to use brick the necessary safeguards will have to be provided to ensure that the three chimneys will not collapse in the course of another three years or so. I would therefore ask if you would be good enough to forward if possible the plans of the Residential School at Lytton, where I understand similar alterations were carried out some years ago. These will enable us to arrive at some decision in a more satisfactory way. So far it has not been possible to carry out Mr. C.C. Perry's suggestion that the bricklayer who has already been selected should examine the work before writing to the Department for authority, owing to this man being sick.\nTo my mind this work is a totally distinct project to the work at present being undertaken in connection with the demolition of old sawmill buildings in accordance with the Department's agreement with the Columbia Anglican Synod. Some saving could be effected if the services of a foreman-carpenter had been dispensed with. Mr. Dodson, although probably a good carpenter has not proved to be a good foreman, and in any case in the demolition of these old buildings rough carpentry was all that was needed, and many of the Indians are adept at this. What was needed was an experienced foreman who would conscientiously push the work forward and who knew how to handle men. However I have instructed that this work is to be completed in another two days in order to keep somewhere within the bounds of the appropriation of $500.00 which was allowed for this.\n\nReferring again to the matter of erecting chimneys, I would state that if it is decided to use brick, the bricklayer already referred to, who has been previously employed in similar work at this Residential School, would erect and demolish the necessary scaffolding himself with the aid of his son and two Indians. Therefore this work could be delayed until authority is furnished to proceed with it, but at present I am handicapped in not being able to immediately furnish you with the cost of raising these chimneys with brick and having the work done thoroughly with the necessary safeguards provided.\n\nMr. C.C. Perry also suggests that the Department architect who designed the building would probably advise as to the advantage of either one or the other, either metal work or brick, and also as to the possibility of the appearance of the building itself not being unduly spoiled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.G.

Newnham, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to raising the chimneys at this school, we find that to use galv. iron, #14 gauge, the following materials will be required:\n\n| Item                        | Quantity | Cost |\n|-----------------------------|----------|------|\n| 1446 lbs. #14 gauge galv. iron |          | $85.00 |\n| 400 ft.

This would include all freights and other charges.\n\nWe recommend, should the Dept. consent to having metal chimneys, that this man's tender be accepted and that authority be wired to you to proceed with the work at once.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n\"F. Earl Anfield\"\nPrincipal.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJanuary 21, 1933.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn January 7th last Mr. Samuel Dodson of North Vancouver took passage from Vancouver to Alert Bay on your S.S. \"Cardena\" to perform some work for the Department of Indian Affairs. He was not informed of your special return rates, and paid full fare amounting to $11.50. He will be returning to Vancouver on Wednesday next, the 25th instant, and I presume a single fare will again be paid of $11.50.\n\nAs I am under strict instructions regarding rigid economy in connection with the expenditure of Government funds, would it be asking too much if you could refund the amount of $2.70, being the difference between two single rates at $11.50, totalling $23.00 and your return rate of $15.30. Thanking you,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n(E.G.

This pump has been placed in good working order, and, upon test, satisfactory pressure was obtained.\n\nIt is recommended, however, that the pipe line and intake be extended about 40 feet into deeper water, at an estimated cost of $265, and that this work be carried out in June or July, next, when low tides prevail. I am unable at the present time to give definite assurance whether funds for this purpose can be provided. You might draw this matter to the attention of the Department early in May, next, at which time we will be in a position to state if the necessary funds are available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\nOttawa, January 26, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge, with thanks, receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, enclosing copy of a report on the fire pumping plant at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. The recommendation that the pipe line and intake be extended - the work to be carried out early next summer - together with an estimate of the cost, has been noted. I can give no definite assurance at the present time that funds will be available for this purpose.\n\nIt is also noted that the pump is now functioning perfectly and that a satisfactory supply of water could be obtained, if required, for fire purposes. Mr. C. C. Perry, Assistant Indian Commissioner, Victoria, is being communicated with in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector, Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nRe: Alert Bay Indian Residential School, Fire Pump.\n\nAt the request of Mr. C.C. Perry, an inspection has recently been made of the fire pumping plant at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School by Mr. Warren. A copy of Mr. Warren's report dated the 13th instant is enclosed from which it will be noted that the pump was out of order due to the fact that several pieces of wood and some small stones had become lodged in the working parts. This has been rectified and the plant is now working satisfactorily.\n\nIt is recommended in the report that the pipeline and intake should be extended about 40 feet into deeper water at an estimated cost of $265.00.\n\nThis recommendation is concurred in by Mr. Webb and the suggestion is made that this work if authorized, could best be carried out in June or July when extremely low tides prevail.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ.T.

(RG 10, Volume 6428, file 875-5, part 4)\nJanuary 27, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter No.156-0-5, dated January 20th, instant, in regard to the accountable cheque sent to Mr. Acting Indian Agent E.G. Newnham of Kwawkewlth Agency, B.C., wherewith to meet the cost of labor in connection with certain improvements and repairs in course of execution there, all labor being under the direction of the Acting Agent in concert with the school principal, Mr. Anfield.\n\nIn reply I beg to advise the Department that the hardware and cement were purchased on tender through this office and accounts will reach the Department through the office of the Acting Agent who has been instructed in regard thereto. The lumber is being purchased by Mr. Newnham at Alert Bay, as it can be obtained more cheaply and with better facility at that point, also at a saving of freight charges which would necessarily attend purchase at Vancouver.\n\nIt is hoped that it will be possible to have the work as authorized completed before the end of the fiscal year. A question concerning the erection of galvanized, instead of brick, chimneys has been referred by the Agent to the Department upon instructions from this office. I did not care to authorize any change in work which had been considered by the Department on the recommendation of a building inspector and on plans calculated to bring the work into accord with the main construction without having the matter submitted to the Department for its consideration and instructions. There may be a little delay on this account. If for any reason of unavoidable delay it is not possible to complete the erection of the chimney before the end of March next, I hope it will be possible for the Department to either avoid the lapse of the appropriation or renew it in the new fiscal year. Every effort will be made to see that the work is expedited.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst.

Dodson, Foreman-carpenter at Demolition of Sawmill, from Alert Bay to Vancouver.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Asst. Commissioner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nOttawa, February 9, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, regarding the removal of the old sawmill buildings from the school site at Alert Bay and informing the Department that, in order to complete this work, it will be necessary to employ ten Indians for a further six days at relief rates and that the sum of $120 in excess of the amount already authorized will be required for the purpose.\n\nThe Department is anxious that the work in demolishing the old sawmill buildings and having the site cleaned up be completed as soon as possible and that all good material be disposed of partly to the Residential School and local Anglican Church and the balance to deserving Indians who may wish to obtain same. All the other unusable debris should be burned and the site left in a clean condition. If possible, this work should be completed and accounts covering the entire cost forwarded in time for payment before our books close at the end of the present fiscal year, viz., March 31st, next.\n\nAccounts already received from you towards the cost of the removal of the sawmill buildings are as follows:\n\n- Coucher 270 - Supplies given in lieu of wages ... $327.25,\n- 265 - Payment of G. S. Dodson ... $90.00,\n- 265 - Nails supplied ... $.60,\n- 261 - Supplies given in lieu of wages ... $196.00.\n\nBesides, there are accounts for the fare of Mr. Dodson from Vancouver to Alert Bay and return, to a total amount of $23.00.\n\nMr. Commissioner Perry, in a letter to the Department dated October 18th, last, stated as follows: \"I would judge that the sum of $500 would be an absolutely outside figure in demolishing the buildings and removing the debris from the site\".\n\nRegarding the chimneys referred to in your letter of the 21st instant, I have to say that on the 3rd instant you were forwarded a telegram, as follows:\n\n\"May arrange for raising chimneys Alert Bay School, using galvanized iron\".\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. G. Newnham, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJanuary 28, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter dated January 20 re the above, I beg to state that with reference to your first paragraph that an accountable cheque for $250.00 has not yet come to hand, but no doubt it will be received here by the next mail.\n\nWith reference to the second paragraph of your letter, in which you state that labour returns in triplicate should be kept, I would state that these are being made out in accordance with your instructions and are being forwarded to the Assistant Commissioner in Victoria as instructed.\n\nThe work on the demolition of sawmill buildings in accordance with the Department's agreement with the Columbia Anglican Synod or Diocese is not completed, but has been stopped owing to the appropriation for labour of $500.00 having been slightly exceeded. This was referred to in my letter to you dated January 21, and also in my letter to the Assistant Commissioner of January 24th.\n\nOther work provided for was the raising of three chimneys, not two, at the Alert Bay Residential School to an additional height of fifteen feet each. This is held in abeyance owing to the Principal raising the question of safety. This is referred to in my letter to you of January 21 in which I requested that plans of the Residential School at Lytton if possible might be forwarded as similar work was undertaken there some years ago, also that the Department architect might be asked for his opinion on the matter as there are so many phases to be considered.\n\nIn regard to the building of a wooden arcade connecting the main school building and the classroom block, material for this has been ordered and is being delivered here and handed over to the Principal immediately after inspection. Every effort will be made to have this completed before the end of the fiscal year.\nTo complete the work of demolishing the sawmill buildings it will be necessary to employ ten Indians for a further six days at relief rates. For this work there is no white foreman needed, as a reliable Indian can take charge of it. This would consist mostly of tearing down the platform and moving piles which still stand and clearing up the land generally.\n\nThe quickest method of raising the three chimneys at the Residential School would be to use the metal jack method as recommended by Mr. Anfield. However only one estimate can be received for this locally, and I think the figure quoted, $300.00, is somewhat excessive. To use brick, three ply, with all the necessary safeguards, would cost more than the balance of the appropriation which has been granted for this, namely $312.00 from the original appropriation for this phase of the work, i.e., $425.00. Payment has been made to the foreman-carpenter at the rate of $6.00 per day for fifteen days and his transportation from Vancouver and return has been paid; this amounted to $113.00.\n\nKindly inform me if authority can be given to complete the demolition of the Sawmill for which a further sum of $120.00 would be required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.G.

Raising of chimneys at school now under contract for three hundred dollars. Balance of one hundred and sixty dollars from advance of two hundred and fifty dollars not now required for chimney work. Could this be used for relief work as above.\"\n\nAs already reported the work of demolishing the old Sawmill buildings and having the site cleaned up did not progress so well as anyone making an estimate before the work was commenced might have been led to believe, and it was found that the sum of five hundred dollars quoted by Mr. Commissioner Perry was not sufficient to cover the whole expense of this. In addition to causes already reported, some delay was occasioned by time taken to sort out fairly good lumber which might possibly be useful for school purposes from that which was useless. However I have requested the school authorities to remove all the lumber that they wish to make use of as speedily as possible and in the event of the Department furnishing the authority for the further expenditure of $120.00 it would thus be possible to thoroughly clean up the ground as desired. It should be mentioned that there is a certain amount of old machinery now quite useless still remaining on the ground which would also have to be removed.\n\nAs already reported and under authority granted by your telegram dated the 3rd instant the two chimneys of the Alert Bay School are being raised by the use of galvanized iron. The advance of $250.00 which you forwarded was originally intended to cover immediate payments in the event of these chimneys being raised by the use of brick, and also to cover the expenses...\nof the foreman-carpenter, Mr. C.S. Dodson. Mr. Dodson was paid ninety dollars for his services and his transportation to and from Alert Bay amounting to $23.00 in all was covered by voucher. I thus have a balance of $160.00 on hand, and in accordance with the request contained in my telegram, I wish to know whether this further $120.00 which I have asked for should be taken from this amount or whether you desire the vouchers for supplies given in lieu of wages to be forwarded in the usual way and payment made direct from Ottawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.G.

Anfield, has expressed his satisfaction with the work.\n\nIn accordance with instructions, most of the good material has been disposed of to the Residential School and the balance distributed to aged Indians for fuel purposes. Some of this wood was to have been given to the Anglican Rectory but the Rector, Rev. C.K.K. Prosser, has declined to accept it.\n\nSeveral pieces of old machinery which should have been removed under a former project still remain on the site, but these have been taken charge of by Mr. Anfield who is disposing of it by the best possible means. A pile of bricks also remain on the site. These have already been disposed of by the Anglican Synod to a local resident named Mr. A.M. Wastell, who has not yet removed them. The Department has therefore no responsibility in connection with these bricks.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.G.

Some sort of steam drying cabinet is badly required at this school. There is far too much hand ironing. The belts of the various machines are now guarded.\n\nBakery:\n\nThe flues of the oven are worn out. These should be replaced and I would recommend that brick fire box and flues be placed here. The cost, I am informed, would be about $150.00. The school ought to be able to do this repair work out of per capita grants. Bread is made daily except on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nKitchen:\n\nThere is a three oven No. 5 Albion Range here. The top is not in perfect condition. There ought to be another two oven Range placed in this kitchen, as the present accommodation is not sufficient for cooking for 200 children and the staff.\n\nStaff Dining Room:\n\nThere is a cement floor 20 feet by 15 feet. Inlaid linoleum should be placed on this floor for sanitary if for no other purposes.\n\nElectric Light:\n\nNew batteries which would cost from $400.00 to $450.00 are required. It is possible that new positive plates would be satisfactory for some years.\n\nPumping Plant:\n\nThe present 5 H.P. Peters Engine is far too small for the school. An 8 H.P. Peters Engine is required and the present engine would be kept for instructional purposes.\n\nBuildings:\n\nThe old veranda should be removed from the building known previously as the Girls' Home.\n\nAn Arcade should be provided between the school and the classrooms in the Girls' Home so that children will be protected going to and from the schoolrooms. This is estimated to cost about $250.00 and could be built by the boys under their Manual Training Instructor.\nOttawa, March 9th, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn the 28th February you forwarded to the Department Voucher No. 314 for $300.00 in favour of the General Repair Shop, Alert Bay, for articles supplied under contract for work to be done at the Indian Residential School.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. G. Newnham, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing copy of a letter dated March 17 which I have received from Mr. Anfield, Principal of the Alert Bay Residential School.\n\nI do not recommend that this work be done at the present time, in view of the fact that there is a movement on foot locally to have a Government wharf erected for general community use at Alert Bay, which the Residential School authorities would be free to make use of in common with others. I have in mind the fact that these wharves are in constant need of repair and entail great expense and under conditions which prevail here need to be almost re-constructed every two years.\n\nThe Sawmill Wharf referred to is now of no further use but present conditions do not warrant any expense being incurred in demolishing it. The small wharf in front of the school is safe to be used for a little while longer until it is known whether the Government is putting in a wharf or not. If this is done, this small wharf in front of the school will be more or less of a luxury unless there are sufficient funds to provide for its upkeep.\n\nI would also recommend that the Agreement between the Synod of Columbia and the Department be cancelled and a new one drawn up if necessary, as owing to change in conditions here several of the clauses would now be considered obsolete.\n\nIn any case I suggest that this whole matter be held over until the next fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.G. Newnham\nA/Indian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nST. MICHAEL'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nMarch 17, 1933.\n\nE.G. Newnham, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nUnder a lease with the Synod of Columbia, the Department has taken over the control and upkeep of the structure known as the \"Sawmill Wharf\" for the use of the school. Considerable work was done by a pile-driver on the main wharf shed over a year ago, but the school has been unable to use this wharf for over six months on account of the dangerous condition of the wharf approach, which to make safe at all, would require considerable repairs, consisting of complete repiling and redecking, also considerable number of piles driven under the shore end of the shed. This total cost would be prohibitive under present financial conditions.\n\nOn the other hand we consider that the school must have facilities available for its coal and other heavy freight. All the routine freight could be brought in on the local steamers to the Cannery and transported by truck through the new road through the reserve. Our coal, slabs, hay and other freight could be expeditiously handled by scow to the small wharf immediately in front of the school. This structure was built five years ago by the contractor for the main building. It was taken over by the Department for the sum of five hundred dollars, but no repairs have been done since. It now needs repiling and extending at least two bents. A local pile-driver concern has given us a tender for extending this wharf two bents or twenty-eight feet, putting in 20 piles and all necessary timbers and planking and leaving the structure in a first-class condition for $250.00 inclusive.\n\nThis is a very reasonable figure indeed and we would ask that you place the matter before the Department for consideration and advice. To do anything at all with the \"Sawmill Wharf\" would cost over a thousand dollars.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"F. Earl Anfield\"\nPrincipal.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nMarch 16, 1933.\n\nYour file 156-0-5 D\nOur file 23-4\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of March 9 re the above, I would state that a copy of the tender submitted by the General Repair Shop, Alert Bay, for articles supplied under contract for work to be done at the Indian Residential School was attached to my letter addressed to The Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, dated January 21st.\n\nThe contract submitted by this firm was accepted as per Departmental telegram dated February 3rd, the entire work to be completed for the sum of three hundred dollars. Under these circumstances receipts were not obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.G. Newnham\nA/Indian Agent\n\nN.C. Allen, Esq.,\nRepresentative of the Treasury,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter dated March 1st re the above, I would state that I received no instructions to make a deduction of ten percent from the wages of C.S. Dobson, foreman-carpenter engaged in connection with the demolition of saw-mill buildings.\n\nNo standing instructions in regard to this are on file in this office and the last information I received in regard to the ten percent reduction was prior to coming to this Agency and to the effect that this regulation did not apply to persons in the service of the Dominion Government drawing $600 per annum or less.\n\nIn conclusion I would state that the original arrangement made was for this man to be paid at the rates prevailing in the B.C. Public Works Department for similar kind of work, viz. $8.00 per day, but I considered this too high and so reduced it to $6.00. There was thus an actual reduction of twenty-five percent.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(E.G.

There is no doubt that the work is necessary and it requires no expert opinion to arrive at the conclusion that the brick work is porous and of inferior quality. However before doing anything further in the matter I would be glad to receive your instructions.\n\nIn regard to item two of Mr. Anfield's letter I of course am guided by your letter dated February 17, 1933, file 15/6/28244 and in this matter also I await further instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"E.G.

This pump has been placed in good working order, and, upon test, satisfactory pressure was obtained.\n\nIt is recommended, however, that the pipe line and intake be extended about 40 feet into deeper water, at an estimated cost of $265, and that this work be carried out in June or July, next, when low tides prevail.

Warren approved by Mr. C.E. Webb of the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau, Vancouver, upon the inspection of the Alert Bay Residential School water pump. If you do not hear from the Department within a reasonable time in regard to this matter, it may be as well for you to write the Department asking its pleasure in regard to the proposed expenditure of $265.00 in connection therewith. I may say that I included an item in the 1933-34 Estimates for miscellaneous and unforeseen expenditures and in all probability the Department may secure an appropriation from Parliament under that head. On the other hand the Department may prefer to provide the amount from the school vote and in these matters will give you the necessary directions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"C.C. Perry\"\n\nEncl.\nP/AC\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nE.G. Newnham, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb:\n\nI visited Alert Bay School on the 4th to 7th of January for the purpose of examining the fire pumping plant of the school. The principal of the school, Mr. F.E. Anfield, had reported under date of December 16th that on frequent trials the pump would not deliver water in sufficient quantity or at a great enough pressure to cover the school building. He further reported that the difficulty was probably due to stoppage of the intake screen which had frequently become corroded.\n\nUpon examination I found that the cause of the difficulty reported by Mr. Anfield was due to clogging of the pump impeller, several pieces of wood and some small stones having become lodged in the suction side. No damage was caused to the pump, however, and it functioned perfectly when cleared. It is probable that this foreign material found its way into the suction pipe when first laid and took some time to work up to the pump. On test two streams of water at 85 lbs. pressure were obtained which were capable of covering the roof of the building with a moderate wind blowing and without making use of the reserve power of the engine.\n\nThe suction screen was found to be fairly free having recently been cleaned by the school engineer. It appears that the screen, which is of cast iron and has an aggregate opening area in excess of 200 square inches, grows tubercles over the openings and requires frequent cleaning in order to be kept open. The intake may only be reached during very low tides and in winter time it is exceedingly difficult to reach at all due to the prevailing wind. It would be desirable to have the cast iron screen changed for one of cast bronze which would not grow tubercles and which could readily be cleaned with a wire brush on a pole if found necessary.\n\nFrom observations I have come to the conclusion that the intake is now in shallower water than when first laid. This appears to be due in part to the shifting of the pipe line about 8 to 10 feet and to the movement of sand. While ordinarily the working of the pump is not affected, during very low tides it is possible that the pump might not operate due to insufficient water over the intake. To overcome the difficulty the pipeline should be extended for about 40 feet.\n\nThe cost of the proposed alterations has been estimated at $265.00 and could be most cheaply carried out in June or July when extremely low tides prevail. The suggested changes are recommended to maintain the fire preventive service at its greatest efficiency.\n\n| Estimate | Description | Cost |\n|----------|-------------|------|\n| 40 feet 8\" blk. wrot iron pipe | $306.21 | $122.40 |\n| 4 - 8\" flanges on pipe @ $3.80 | 15.20 |\n| 24 - \u00be x 3\u00bd bolts | 2.40 |\n| 3 - lead gaskets | 3.00 |\n| Bronze screen 70 lbs. @ 40\u00a2 flanged for 10\" x 16\" steel flange | 28.00 |\n| Freight and cartage | 12.00 |\n| Labour & alterations treating pipe etc. | 50.00 |\n| Supervision & contingencies | 32.00 |\n\nApproved: \"C.E.

I was therefore under the impression that when Mr. W.C. Warren, District Engineer of that Branch arrived here recently, that it was in connection with this work as well as the waterproofing. Mr. Warren, however, informed me that he had no authority to proceed with the repair of the pipe line, but stated that it could be attended to at this time. It is necessary that the work be done at extreme low tide, otherwise it will have to be deferred until next year; extreme low tide here during the month of August will be on Saturday, August 12th and Sunday August 27th.

It should be stated on each copy of the voucher that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 420.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nOttawa, August 1, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, enclosing copy of correspondence relating to necessary repairs to the pipe-line intake connected with the Alert Bay Indian Residential School and recommending that this work be carried out in connection with the completion of the water-proofing of the outer walls of the main building.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that a telegram was today received from Mr. C. C. Perry, Assistant Indian Commissioner, in which he stated that all above work, comprising water-proofing and repairing pipe-line intake, could be done for the amount provided for this school, viz.: $2,000 - which amount has been authorized by E. R. No. 420, a copy being sent to Mr. Perry.\n\nMr. Perry is being informed by wire today that he may proceed with the work of the repairs to the pipe-line intake, provided this work and the water-proofing will not be in excess of the above mentioned amount. No doubt, Mr. Perry will take the necessary action and will inform you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. G. Newnham, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay,\nB. C.\nMay I refer to the report by Mr. W.C. Warren dated January 5th, 1931, on the Alert Bay School repairs, etc., in which the wall seepage was referred to on page 4 and suggestions offered on page 5 as to the best method of treating this condition. In this connection I am sending you herewith copy of letter dated May 10th, instant, No.156-0-5, received from the Department authorizing the carrying out of this work which was estimated by you under the Minwax treatment at a cost of $1890.00. You will notice that the sum of $2000.00 provided by the Department is not wholly for this work but is the total sum provided in this year's Estimates for all maintenance and repairs required for the Alert Bay School. The Department does not state whether or not the repair of the fire pump pipe line at a cost of $265.00 is included in the item for $2000.00 but taking the Department's letter literally it looks as though no extra provision has been made for the repair of the fire pump pipe line. It therefore becomes apparent that if it is possible to keep the cost of the waterproofing below the price as mentioned above, every effort should be made to do so. The \"E.R. No.420\" mentioned in the last paragraph of the Department's letter refers to the number of the Encumbrance Requisition Certificate dated May 6th, No.420, obtained by the Department from the Treasury as authority for carrying out the work. It is desired that you kindly quote this E.R. No.420 on all vouchers submitted in connection therewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure\n\nP/AC\n\nC. E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nWinch Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter dated August 1st, instant, No. 156-0-5, relating to the appropriation of $2,000.00 under Encumbrance Requisition No. 420 for waterproofing and other work at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, Kwawkewlth Agency, B.C., the contents of which have been duly noted.\n\nAs the Department may not have complete record of my contact with the Dominion Water Tower & Hydrometric Bureau in this connection, I am sending herewith to be placed on your file, copy of my letter to Mr. Webb, District Chief Engineer, dated May 16th, last, by which it will be seen that the matter was given prompt attention from this office. Mr. Webb, however, experienced a little delay in consequence of having to purchase the special waterproofing material from Eastern Canada. It is expected that all the work will be completed in accordance with understandings contained in previous correspondence on the subject.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas. G. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure:-\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nMr. F.E. Anfield, Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, has furnished me with a copy of a letter which he has addressed to the Secretary, Indian Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C., Winnipeg, embodying a list of requirements which it is considered the Indian Department should be asked to provide for this school during the fiscal year 1934-35. It is possible that these items will be forwarded direct to the Department by Dr. Westgate, but the whole will need careful investigation by myself before I would feel justified in making any report or recommendation, with the exception of Item 6, which covers \"Repair to School Wharf\".\n\nThis wharf is situated right in front of the building, and is not the Sawmill wharf which is a different structure located some distance away from the school. I have examined this school wharf, and find that it is in dangerous condition and if it is to be continued in use, must be repiled at once. I have today had a discussion with Mr. Anfield regarding this matter, and he assures me that the estimate of $250.00 which he asks for will cover expenses of repiling and general renovation to keep this wharf in a state of good repair for the next five years. He also claims that the provision of this wharf is essential, not as a steamer wharf - no steamer could get in there - but as a scow wharf on which to unload fuel, which approximates 210 tons of coal and 200 cords of slabs per year. In its present condition, this wharf could hardly hold one ton of coal.\n\nI also took up with Mr. Anfield the question of the Sawmill wharf which at present the Department is under an Agreement to keep in repair for a number of years. This wharf is of no use whatever either to the Church authorities or to the Department. It could not be repaired for any sum less than one thousand dollars, probably more, and even if it was repaired, it would be more or less of a white elephant. Mr. Anfield was in perfect agreement with me in regard to this, and assured me that if the Department would undertake to repair the school wharf in front of the building for the sum of $250.00, he would, in his capacity as Agent for the Anglican Synod, recommend that the agreement between the Anglican Synod and the Department in connection with the Sawmill wharf be cancelled and declared null and void, so that the Department would be released from all further expenditure in this connection.\n\nIt is possible that there might be a balance on hand from the appropriation of two thousand dollars which was provided for recent repair work at the Residential School covering the pipe line intake and the waterproofing of the outer walls, from which the sum of $250.00 could be provided. Mr. Anfield is very anxious that repairs to this school wharf should be proceeded with as early as possible, and has already made tentative arrangements locally for this to be done as soon as the necessary authority is received.\nIn view of the facts which I have outlined, I would recommend that authority be granted for this item to be dealt with as soon as possible. Mr. Anfield, of course, in his capacity as Agent to the Anglican Synod, is not in a position to anticipate what the decision of the Synod would be in regard to the proposal to cancel the agreement in regard to the Sawmill wharf, but he has assured me that he would forward his very strong recommendations along these lines trusting that as he is the man on the spot, his recommendations would be acted upon.\n\nThe other items referred to in the letter quoted above will be attended to by me very thoroughly with a view to my being in a position to render an accurate report to the Department on these matters as soon as my report is called for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.G. Newnham\nA/Indian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, August 24, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 23/30648 of the 12th instant, with regard to the work that should be carried out at Indian residential schools as between the Dominion Public Works Department and the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the work we require to be carried out at Indian residential schools by the Dominion Public Works Department is only the inspection of boilers. The Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau, when requested to do so, oversee the work in connection with the water system and, in special cases, electrical equipment. All other repairs and requirements at our Indian schools are matters to be dealt with through the local Indian agents and your office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nChas. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have today addressed a letter to the Department under separate cover in regard to the inspection of the boiler and plants at the Lac Le Jeu Indian Residential School by Mr. Arnall, Engineer, attached to the office of the Resident Architect of the Dominion Public Works Department, Victoria, and it has occurred to me to bring to the Department's attention the fact that up to the present time the Engineers of the Dominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau, Vancouver, have advised the Department in regard to electrical equipment and at the present time one of the Engineers of the Bureau is engaged at Alert Bay in supervising the repair of the fire fighting intake pipe line at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School and I think it is advisable that the duties of the Public Works Engineer as relating to electrical equipment, as well as the boilers and machinery in our Residential Schools, should be clearly defined in order that there may be no conflict between the services rendered by the Engineers of the respective Branches, this suggestion having in view the general efficiency and smooth working of our inspection arrangements.\n\nI may also add that the local District Resident Architect recently mentioned in a conversation that he felt that all the Residential School buildings as well as the boilers should be subject to inspection and report by the Public Works Department, but I informed him that I could not say that the Department would find this a satisfactory procedure particularly in view of the fact that its agreement with the Church authorities with respect to buildings and their maintenance is contingent upon the period of allowance which the principals of the schools are permitted to expend for the management of the institution, the maintenance and education of the pupils and the general upkeep of the plant as outlined in a letter dated March 6, 1922, No. 150-1-6, addressed by Dr. Duncan C. Scott to the late Indian Commissioner. I may say that this was simply mentioned by Mr. Dawson, Resident Architect, in conversation but his views have not been committed to writing and, therefore, there would appear to be no immediate need of giving serious consideration to the suggestion unless it should meet with the favor of the Department. It is mentioned simply by way of emphasizing the present need for defining quite clearly the duties which the Department will expect of the Engineers of the two Branches of the Government above mentioned, and I shall be glad to be advised at the Department's convenience of its pleasure in this connection.\n\nI would request that the Department kindly refer this matter...\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nmatter to Dr. McGill as it is understood that Mr. Arnall recently discussed the matter of Indian Schools to some length with him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas. G. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, September 20, 1933.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 23-2 of the 11th instant, with reference to the wharf in front of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that you can have this wharf repaired at a cost not to exceed $250.00 and that you expect that there will be a balance of approximately this amount on hand from the appropriation of $2,000 which was provided for repair work at the Alert Bay School.\n\nOn the understanding that, approximately, $250 will be unexpended, the Department approves of your making the necessary arrangements for the repairs to the wharf to this extent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Indian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Perry:\n\nThank you for your letter of September 20th, with enclosed excerpts from a report of acting Indian Agent at Alert Bay regarding the local wharf situation there.\n\nI have consulted my Committee in charge of this matter and, after careful study of the existing agreement between the Anglican Synod and the Indian Department, it has seemed to us that there is a very considerable equity for our Synod (Indian) account at Alert Bay in the present agreement, as it definitely provides an annual rental to be paid to this account by the Indian Department after a certain number of years' use of the old wharf. I draw attention to this element first of all, because we feel that it should not be lost sight of.\n\nOn the other hand, it was understood the school would make the main use of the old wharf, and if the school authorities really prefer the smaller wharf near the school we should not stand in the way of such an arrangement.\n\nIt would seem only fair, however, that if the change is to be made the Indian Department should be prepared to make some definite, new undertaking as between the Synod and itself regarding the school wharf.\n\nIf you will be prepared, for instance, to recommend that upon release from the former contract the Indian Department would contract to keep the school wharf in condition for a stated number of years, at its own charge, we should be prepared to endorse such a proposal.\n\nI trust the fairness of these suggestions will appeal both to you and the Department and that the matter can be worked out satisfactorily to all concerned.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nI remain,\nYours faithfully,\n\"Charles Columbi\"\n\nP.S. When taking up the matter further would it be possible to ask the acting Agent at Alert Bay to get a group of Indians to clear away the old wharf if the new contract is agreed upon; to leave it as it is would be dangerous.\nMy dear Bishop Schofield:\n\nMay I bring to your Lordship's attention the enclosed excerpts from a report dated September 11th, instant, received at the Department from Mr. E.G. Newnham, Acting Indian Agent at Alert Bay, in regard to the local wharf situation. His observations will be self-explanatory.\n\nPerhaps your Lordship will be aware that a public thoroughfare has recently been created at Alert Bay by the Provincial Government which gives access to the school and to the wharf to which the public has access for freight and other purposes. In a recent conversation with the recently retired Agent, Mr. W.M. Halliday, he informed me that he considered the provincial thoroughfare would do away with the necessity of our agreement with respect to the upkeep of the old sawmill wharf; and while I do not purpose rushing into making any recommendations to the Department without careful consideration I feel that it is most desirable that the agreement concerning the sawmill wharf should be reexamined by yourself and any other Synod representatives together with Mr. Newnham's present proposal, which appears to have the endorsement of Mr. Anfield, your Synod's local representative at Alert Bay, with a view to seeing if the latter proposal would be agreeable in view of the present depressed conditions which call for the exercise of every reasonable economy in the public interests.\n\nIf Your Lordship can endorse the position taken by Mr. Newnham and Mr. Anfield, I shall be glad to do all in my power to secure a grant for the maintenance of the wharf in place of the school as suggested, not only this year but in future years as long as the same may be in proportion to the requirements of the School as at present.\n\nI shall take no action in this matter until I hear from you.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nMost sincerely yours,\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nRt. Rev. Chas. Schofield, D.D.,\nLord Bishop of British Columbia,\n912 Vancouver Street,\nVictoria, B.C.\nRepair to School Wharf\n\nThis wharf is situated right in front of the building, and is not the Sawmill wharf which is a different structure located some distance away from the school. I have examined this school wharf, and find that it is in dangerous condition and if it is to be continued in use, must be repiled at once. I have today had a discussion with Mr. Anfield regarding this matter, and he assures me that the estimate of $250.00 which he asks for will cover expenses of repiling and general renovation to keep this wharf in a state of good repair for the next five years. He also claims that the provision of this wharf is essential, not as a steamer wharf - no steamer could get in there - but as a snow wharf on which to unload fuel, which approximates 210 tons of coal and 200 cords of slabs per year. In its present condition, this wharf could hardly hold one ton of coal.\n\nI also took up with Mr. Anfield the question of the Sawmill wharf which at present the Department is under an Agreement to keep in repair for a number of years. This wharf is of no use whatever either to the Church authorities or to the Department. It could not be repaired for any sum less than one thousand dollars, probably more, and even if it was repaired, it would be more or less of a white elephant. Mr. Anfield was in perfect agreement with me in regard to this, and assured me that if the Department would undertake to repair the school wharf in front of the building for the sum of $250.00, he would, in his capacity as Agent for the Anglican Synod, recommend that the agreement between the Anglican Synod and the Department in connection with the Sawmill wharf be cancelled and declared null and void, so that the Department would be released from all further expenditure in this connection.\n\nMr. Anfield is very anxious that repairs to this school wharf should be proceeded with as early as possible, and has already made tentative arrangements locally for this to come as soon as the necessary authority is received.\n\nIn view of the facts which I have outlined, I recommend that authority be granted for this item to proceed with as soon as possible. Mr. Anfield, in his capacity as Agent to the Anglican Synod, does not anticipate what the decision of the Synod will be on the proposal to cancel the agreement in connection with the Sawmill wharf, but he has assured me that he would make strong recommendations along these lines. As Mr. Anfield is the man on the spot, his recommendation should be followed.\nSir,\n\nIn compliance with instructions contained in your letter dated September 26th re the above, I have to report that I interviewed Mr. F.E. Anfield, both in his capacity as Agent to the Anglican Synod and as Principal of the Residential School in regard to the two wharves under discussion, and he definitely stated as follows:\n\n(1) That there was an urgent need for the wharf in front of the school to be repaired. Departmental letter No. 156-0-5 dated September 20 has already given authority for this to be done at a maximum figure of $250.00. I have therefore given Mr. Anfield authority to have this work proceeded with immediately under local arrangements stressing the fact that under no circumstances must the sum of $250.00 be exceeded.\n\n(2) In consideration of the foregoing, he had recommended to the Anglican Synod at Victoria that the Agreement dated June 1st, 1931, whereby a piece of land forming a portion of Section 4, Cormorant Island, Rupert District, was leased by the Bynod to the Department of Indian Affairs at a nominal rental, be cancelled.\n\nIn connection with No.1, I would state that the school wharf can be considered to be on the premises of the Residential School, therefore the Anglican Synod office at Victoria actually has nothing to do with it. What new undertaking which may be considered necessary - if any - would be dealt with by the Anglican Indian Residential School Commission at Winnipeg.\n\nI attach a rough plan of the land referred to in No.2 by which it will be seen that the Department is saddled with unnecessary responsibility so long as the aforesaid Lease is in effect. On the left side of the public highway proceeding north is the site of the old sawmill now demolished. The sawmill wharf - now under discussion - is shown in red. On the right of the public highway are a number of buildings occupied by white persons who pay rent to the Synod. This site adjoins the Industrial School Reserve, but is not part of it, and I do not see any useful purpose either to the Church or the Department, by the aforesaid lease remaining in effect, especially in view of changing conditions.\n\nIn regard to paragraph 4 of the letter dated September 23rd addressed to you by the Bishop of Columbia, I would state that there is no need for any new undertaking between the Synod and the Department in regard to the school wharf, as this is already covered by the Agreement with the Anglican Indian Residential School Commission.\nIn the event of this aforesaid lease being cancelled it would seem that the Department would be under a final obligation to demolish the sawmill wharf which is now in a dilapidated condition - unless the Synod wished otherwise - after which there would be no further occasion for the expenditure of public funds by the Department in connection with this site which is actually private property and of no benefit to the Indians.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Anglican Church has for the past nine years maintained a self-supporting Parish at Alert Bay as distinct from an Indian Mission, and another denomination is now engaged in mission work here, being firmly established, the religious persuasions of Indians of course not being subject to official interference, it would seem that the only official contact which the Department need maintain with the Anglican Church at Alert Bay, is in connection with St. Michael's Indian Residential School, which is administered by the Anglican Indian Residential School Commission at Winnipeg.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.G.

Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir,-\n\nIn reply to your letter dated September 20 re the above, I have to report that the work of having the Residential School wharf at Alert Bay repaired will be undertaken immediately at a cost not to exceed $250.00.\n\nMr. F.E.

Public Works, Canada,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nre: Inspection of Boilers and Machinery,\nIndian Residential School, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nOn August 2nd, 1933, I inspected the mechanical equipment of this school, which consists of,\n\nTwo 54\" x 90\" x 77\" Inglis Supreme Boilers, containing 82 - 2 3/4\" tubes, Nos. 44261 B.C. and 44262 B.C., rated at 45.1 H.P. each, built in 1929, making them now four years old. Longitudinal joint welded.\n\nOne Gurney boiler, 5 section, 53\" x 72\" x 57\", No. 44557 B.C., rated at 31 H.P., built in 1912, making it now 21 years old.\n\nOne Vertical Tubular boiler 26\" Diameter, 48\" high, containing 36 - 2\" x 26\" tubes, No. 44325 B.C., rated at 4 H.P. Longitudinal joint double rivetted lap, built in 1929, making it now 4 years old.\n\nOne 12 H.P. Lister Gasoline Engine direct connected to a 7.5 K.W. Generator.\n\nOne 6 1/2 H.P. Lister Gasoline Engine direct connected to a 3.5 K.W. Generator.\n\nOne 75 H.P. Continental Gasoline Engine direct connected to a Rotary Pump.\n\nOne 5 H.P. Petteer Semi Diesel, driving by belt a Ponoma deep well pump.\n\nBoiler No. 44261 B.C.\n\nI gave this boiler a careful hammer test and found all stays, plates and seams in good condition.\n\nI then gave it a Hydrostatic Test of 50 Lb. per square inch and found it perfectly tight.\n\nI then made an internal inspection and found it in fair condition. There had been some electrolysis action on the front plates which had caused a slight wearing away, and at some time pitting had occurred, but this appears to have stopped but will need watching so that it does not occur again.\nBoiler No. 44261 B.C. Continued.\n\nI would suggest that zinc plates 4\" x 8\" x 1\" be suspended in the water space of this boiler and the present treatment of soda and lime be continued, using a solution of 1/2 lb. sal soda to 2 gallons clear lime water, using about 1 quart of this solution to each boiler per month, and blowing down one inch of water per week.\n\nThe test gauges, water gauges, blowdown cocks and pipes are in good condition. The safety valve works freely and blows off at 15 lb. pressure. The steam gauge is correct.\n\nBoiler No. 44262 B.C.\n\nThis boiler is in a similar condition to 44261 B.C. The same treatment must be observed.\n\nThe water gauge is to be repacked.\n\nThe fusible plugs in both boilers are to be renewed.\n\nI have issued a certificate for both boilers allowing a steam pressure of 15 lb. and condition good.\n\nBoiler No. 44325 B.C.\n\nI gave this boiler a careful inspection and found that it was in poor condition. This boiler has the appearance of having been badly used. It is much too small for the work required and steam has been raised too quickly causing a breakdown of the tubes.\n\nInternally the plates and furnace crown are in fair condition. There is evidence of considerable pitting having taken place but in many cases it has stopped.\n\nI would recommend that the same feed water treatment be continued but in addition when not in use that it be emptied and left dry and air be allowed to circulate through it.\n\nI could not complete the Hydrostatic Test on account of several of the tubes leaking on the top tube sheet. These will need re-expanding. After the next season this boiler must be retubed. I would recommend that a larger boiler be installed at that time, as even if this boiler is retubed, on account of the forcing required to do the required work it would only last a short time, as it will take a boiler of approximately 15 H.P. to be economical.\n\nThe water gauge must be overhauled, cleaned and made to work freely.\n\nThe test and blow off cocks are in good condition.\n\nThe safety valve works freely by hand. The steam gauge is 1 lb. light. The fusible plug must be renewed.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 125 lb. and condition poor.\nBoiler No. 44557 B.C.\n\nI gave this boiler a careful inspection and found it in good condition. Traces of salt were showing which was caused by the feed water being temporarily connected to the same main which is used for the salt water fire protection system. This is now being changed and a separate main for each service installed.\n\nThe internal condition of this boiler is also good. I gave it a Hydrostatic test of 30 Lb. and found it perfectly tight.\n\nThe water gauge is to be changed on the water column so that it is visible from the front of the boiler, as where it is now placed it is impossible to see it unless you go around to the boiler side.\n\nThe test cocks should be placed at the side of the water column and the steam gauge placed on the top of the column where it can get dry steam.\n\nThe Main stop valve and blowdown cock are in good condition. The steam gauge is correct. The fusible plug is to be renewed.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 5 Lb. and condition good.\n\nLaundry.\n\nConsists of a double washing machine, one 26\" Hydro Extractor, one steam drying machine. They all appear to be in good condition. A pipe guard should be placed across the sides to prevent the back of these machines where the belts and belt pulleys are, being used as a passage.\n\nLighting Plant.\n\nThe 12 H.P. and 6 1/2 H.P. Lister Engines and Generators have been overhauled and are in good condition.\n\nTire Service.\n\nThe Pump and engine is also overhauled and is in good condition.\n\nDomestic Water Service.\n\nThis is also in good condition.\n\nApproximate Cost Materials and Work Recommended.\n\n- 4 Fusible Plugs $5.00\n- 4 Zinc Plates, 4\" x 8\" x 1\" 7.50\n- Retube Boiler, Tubes $60.00, Labour $40.00, Total $100.00\n- New 15 H.P.

Perhaps you will be good enough to discuss the contents of this letter with Mr. Anfield and advise me at your earliest convenience as to what you would consider to be a reasonable arrangement to enter into as a substitution for our existing lease of the Synod property at Alert Bay. When I hear from you I will take the matter up further with His Lordship Bishop Schofield with a view to his approval and thereafter will advise the Department with the objective of terminating our existing lease in favor of a plan that will be mutually satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP/KD.\n\nEnclosure:-\n\nChas. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nE.G. Newnham, Esq.,\nA/ Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nOttawa, October 19, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of the report which you forwarded on the inspection of the boilers and machinery at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, by Mr. Arnall, Engineer of the Public Works Department.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will request Mr. Newnham, Acting Indian Agent, to see that the suggestions and recommendations made by the Engineer, regarding the boilers, are carried out by the school authorities. I may add that the Department will have no funds this year to retube Boiler No. 44325 or to supply a new vertical tubular boiler. The minor equipment, as recommended by the Inspector, should be supplied by the school authorities, from their per capita allowance or other receipts.\n\nRegarding the laundry, it is noted the Inspector recommended that a pipe-guard be placed across the sides, in order to prevent the back of these machines, where the belts and belt pulleys are, being used as a passage. The school authorities should install a proper guard-rail, as recommended by the Inspector.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nSir:\n\nMr. E. G. Newnham, Acting Indian Agent at Alert Bay, Kwawkewlth Agency, has sent me copy of his letter dated September 28th, ultimo, in which he acknowledges receipt of Departmental letter No.156-0-5, dated September 20th, regarding the wharf situation at Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, I have deemed it advisable to furnish the Department with copies of correspondence which I have had with Mr. Newnham and His Lordship Bishop Schofield in regard to the suggestion offered that our lease with the Anglican Synod should be terminated. These are enclosed, as follows:-\n\n(1) Copy of letter to Bishop Schofield, dated Sept.20th, 1933.\n(2) Copy of letter from Bishop Schofield to myself dated Sept.23rd,\n(3) Copy of letter from myself to Mr. Acting Agent Newnham,\n    dated September 26th, 1933.\n\nIt would appear that Mr. Newnham when writing to the Department on September 28th, had not yet received my letter to him of the 26th September.\n\nI shall await Mr. Newnham's reply before taking further action in the matter; and will advise the Department in due course of the result of these communications. In the meantime I would be glad to receive the Department's concurrence in the action I am taking in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nP/AC\nOttawa, October 19, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15/6/31338 of the third instant, enclosing copies of communications between yourself and His Lordship the Bishop of Columbia and also with Mr. E. G. Newnham, Acting Indian Agent, regarding the wharves at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to the wharf situated in front of the school building, I have to say that Mr. Newnham has been authorized to repair same, at a cost not to exceed $250, provided there are sufficient funds left over from the appropriation of $2,000; which was allowed for repair work at the school.\n\nRegarding the sawmill wharf, which the Department leased from the Anglican Synod of the Diocese of British Columbia as from June 1, 1931, at a nominal rental, I have to say it is noted that this wharf is no use, either to the church authorities or the Department and considerable expenditure would be necessary for repairs. It is noted, further, that Mr. Newnham and yourself recommend that the agreement between the Anglican Synod and the Department, in connection with this wharf, be cancelled. As you are of opinion that this wharf is of no use in connection with the school, the Department will approve of the cancelling of the lease of same, provided the church authorities will agree. The Department does not appear to have a copy of the lease, as, by official letter dated July 17, 1931, same was returned to the late Commissioner Ditchburn, after execution by the Deputy Superintendent General. After taking the matter up with the church authorities, please advise if they will consent to the cancelling of the lease of the sawmill wharf. In view of the cancellation, the Department would give favourable consideration to the keeping in repair of the school wharf, in so far as funds permit from time to time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nOttawa, November 2, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of the voucher, to the amount of $250, which you forwarded, in favour of Telegraph Cove Mills, Limited, covering the cost of repairs to the school wharf at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nBefore payment can be made, it will be necessary to have more complete information. You should obtain from the above named firm an account, giving details as to the amount charged by them for supplying the lumber and piling, the price per pound for the nails and the amount for the pile driver. Did the amount of $125 for pile driver comprise a rental for its use or did it cover the labour? Full particulars should be given regarding this item. Please state the time employed and, if labour was included, the time engaged and the rates paid. The voucher which you submitted is returned herewith, in order that you can have the account amended, as requested.\n\nPlease give this matter your prompt attention and return the voucher with full particulars, when payment will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEncl.\n\nE. G. Newnham, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nDecember 2, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter dated November 24 re the above, I have to inform you that in compliance with your instructions, the General Repair Shop, Alert Bay, were communicated with on May 20th last and a request made by me that before the Department could make payment of the balance of fifteen dollars due on freight charges that it would be necessary for them to submit receipts covering each item of the expenditure to this office. Up to the present date this firm has failed to comply with this request.\n\nI am again communicating with the General Repair Shop under today's date emphasizing the necessity of these receipts being produced or a letter of explanation stating the reason why they cannot be obtained to be forwarded to this office before the desired payment can be made by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.G. Newnham\nA/Indian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith the originals of duplicate correspondence received from Mr. E.G. Newnham, Acting Indian Agent at Kwawkewlth Agency, Alert Bay, which will be self-explanatory, and must be dealt with at the Department as no provision other than from per capita grant allowance was made by the Acting Agent in connection with his schools' estimates for the fiscal year 1934-35, as prepared in August last.\n\nApparently, it is customary for the Missionary Commission to deal directly with the Department in matters affecting the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, which may account for their estimates being sent by the Principal to the Commission instead of through the office of the Indian Agent. The 1933-34 estimates included similar items which were not allowed by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Parry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOFFICE OF\nINDIAN AGENT\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nNovember 21, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose herewith copies of letters I have received from Mr. F.E. Anfield, Principal of the Alert Bay Residential School. There is no doubt that improvements to the power plant provided for domestic pumping at this school are necessary, and at normal times I would not hesitate to recommend it, but conditions being as they are, I consider that these continual applications that are being made by Mr. Anfield to the Department in connection with certain improvements to the Residential School can to a large extent, be deferred until times are better.\n\nIn the second paragraph of Mr. Anfield's letter you will note a mention of \"a list of requirements submitted by our Commission to the Department for inclusion in next year's estimates\". In this connection I would state that Mr. Anfield forwarded me a copy of these requirements which he had forwarded direct to the Anglican Residential School Commission at Winnipeg, it being implied that the Commission would submit these direct to the Department at Ottawa. Therefore the only action taken by me in connection with this list of requirements was to keep it on file.\n\nAt the same time I would draw special attention to the fact that it might be good policy to acquire the 12 H.P. Petters semi-diesel engine which the B.C. Packers Ltd. have to dispose of for the sum of $250.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n(E.G. Newnham)\nA/Indian Agent\n\nC.C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nVictoria, B.C.\nNovember 7, 1933.\n\nE.G. Newnham, Esq.,\nA/Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Newnham:\n\nI am instructed by our Executive Secretary in Winnipeg to take up with you the question of increasing the size of the power plant provided for the domestic pumping at this school. I cannot do better than inclose herewith a copy of my letter to him in this regard and it will give you full particulars of the proposition which will enable us to get a very much more satisfactory plant at a minimum cost.\n\nYou will find the need of this engine outlined in the list of requirements submitted by our Commission to the Department for inclusion in next year's estimates. It will be appreciated both by our Commission and myself if you will report on the advisability or otherwise of this proposal to your Department at your early convenience.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n\"F. Earl Anfield\"\nPrincipal.\n\nFEA/C\nOctober 23, 1933.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe need of a larger engine for our domestic water supply has been placed before you in previous correspondence and an estimate of at least $800.00 for an engine included in the requirements for this school for the fiscal year 1934-5. It is doubtful, however, if the present plant will continue to give the required service until that time and the following proposition is placed before you for consideration.\n\nThe B.C. Packers Ltd. operating the local cannery took out this year, a 12 H.P. Petters semi-deisol engine and replaced it with one of 25 H.P. capacity.\n\nThe presumed value of the 12 H.P. engine removed was $200 and they are willing to make a straight trade for our engine of 5 H.P. capacity for which they have a specific use next year. The big engine has been carefully surveyed and will cost $250 in repairs for which sum the engine will be as good as new. It requires a new cylinder block, piston and other minor parts following installation. The engine should be good for at least ten years service. Whilst this plant is slightly larger than that needed for our pumping equipment, it would have a double use in that any time we could add to it an emergency dynamo which, in the event of an accident to our lighting plant, would provide the institution with D.C. power during any period of protracted repairs. It is fully realized that conditions are difficult and that money available for anything, even of an emergency nature, is very limited. I have, however, asked the local manager to hold this engine for us until the first of January next year and I am convinced, should it be possible to raise the sum of $250.00, that the investment made would be a good one. It might also be possible, should the Commission see its way clear to financing this work under next years budget, that the Department could be induced to refund the amount expended when it is shown that a far larger sum had been saved by the acting taken.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n\"F. Earl Anfield\"\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, November 24, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer you to your letter of May 20th last, also to correspondence previous to that date with regard to receipts covering freight charges of $15.00. This item was included in the account submitted by you for work done at the Alert Bay Residential School by the General Repair Shop.\n\nAs you have been previously informed, payment of the amount of $15 cannot be made unless the receipts requested are forwarded to the Department.\n\nWe are in receipt of another request from the General Repair Shop asking payment of this account. Please point out to them why payment cannot be made, and endeavour to arrange and forward to the Department receipts for the balance of their account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The contract was placed, by Acting Agent Newnham, with the General Repair Shop, Alert Bay, B.C., for the sum of $300.\n\nWhen the work was completed, the above firm rendered an itemized account, covering the material and labour. This account included an item to the amount of $15 for freight charges and incidentals, for which there were no supporting receipts; and, when the account was paid, this amount was deducted. The General Repair Shop were requested, through the Acting Indian Agent, to forward receipts covering the freight charges, etc., and they replied that they did not see why they should furnish vouchers for the above balance of their account, as it was a straight contract job. However, the Treasury Board required receipts before making payment, and the above named Company have now forwarded a statement in detail covering the amount of $15 - the balance due them.\n\nThe receipts for each of the items have not been received. Mr. Allen informs me that, as the Department no doubt received full value for the work, payment could be made upon your approval of the voucher. In order to close this long outstanding account, I would recommend that you approve the payment.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department has already incurred considerable expenditure in waterproofing the main building, repairing the intake pipe-line for fire protection purposes, overhauling the pump and providing new shafting and bearings, to the amount of $1,820.96. Besides, an account for $250 has been paid, covering repairs to the school wharf.\n\nI am returning herewith the accounts for labour and material in repairing the boat.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nWinnipeg, Man. December 27th, 1933.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn September 23rd last, Mr. Principal Anfield of our Alert Bay School, reporting damage to the school boat \"St. Michael\", wrote, in part, as follows:\n\n\"I have to report damage to the school boat \"St. Michael\" following a storm of almost cyclonic proportions this week. It had been blowing southeast for three days and then without warning the wind swung round and one of the very rare but dreaded \"Mamakish Winds\" came over and in five minutes our boat, along with five others anchored out, had dragged anchorings and were literally picked up and thrown on the beach. After a terrific fight in which our senior boys and some Indians from the village worked up to their necks in the water, all these boats were secured and lashed down to the beach until the storm blew out. The \"St. Michael\" had its upper works badly stove in but at the time of writing, complete repairs have been effected and two holes in the hull plugged and caulked. I was compelled to wire for 100 ft. chain and put a heavy \"deadman\" down, so that now the boat is safe, no matter what blows. We will not have to depend on the anchor, which will hardly hold any boat in such a storm as we had this week. Every telephone pole along the school frontage was snapped and on the ground, and considerable other damage done to other parts of Alert Bay.\"\n\nThe \"complete repairs\" mentioned in his letter were subsequently found to be ineffective, and in another letter from the Principal, dated December 10th., enclosing an itemized statement of the cost of the repairs, he writes further as follows:\n\"It will be noticed that the total is considerably in excess of the first estimate, but when the work started it was found the damage sustained was such that it was necessary to remove the entire superstructure to get at the cause. The main stern had been broken in the storm and all the seams seriously sprung, so much so that the boat more than half filled with water every 24 hours. All the cabin and housing had been twisted out of line and required rebuilding and it was necessary to take out and replace all the caulking. A first class job has been done and the boat is now good for many years of work.\"\n\nAs the total cost of the repairs amounts to \u00a365.75, and constitutes an expenditure which could not possibly be foreseen, it appears to our Commission that the same should be met partly by your Department, and partly by them, and I am writing for the specific purpose of asking if your Department will meet at least \u00a350. of the total amount, on the understanding that our Commission will provide the balance, namely, \u00a315.75.\n\nItemized statements of the total cost, in triplicate, are enclosed herewith, and our Commission will be obliged if you can furnish them with your reply at an early date, as their books for the year will close promptly on the 31st inst.\n\nWishing you the compliments of the season.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, January 4, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 15/6/32296 of the 13th ultimo, enclosing copy of a communication addressed by you to Mr. Webb, District Chief Engineer, Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau, Vancouver, and also copy of a communication from him dated November 2nd, last, regarding the work carried out at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School in connection with the water-proofing of the main building and repairs to the fire pump system.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department has received, from the Director of the above named Bureau, the report of Mr. Webb, together with that of Mr. Warren, Hydraulic Engineer, under whose oversight the work was carried out. It is noted, from these reports, that all work has been satisfactorily completed and that the cost was as follows:\n\nMaterial, labour, supervision, etc., in connection with water-proofing of building - $1,481.80\nExtension to suction line of fire pump - $286.18\nOverhauling pump and providing new shafting and bearings - $52.98\n\nAn accountable cheque to the amount of $1,890 was sent Mr. Webb in June, last, and the Department is requesting the Director of the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau to have Mr. Webb forward proper vouchers, in triplicate, covering all expenditure, and also to return any unexpended portion of the advance that was sent him.\n\nI may add that an account to the amount of $250 was received from the former Acting Indian Agent, Mr. Newham, covering the cost of repairs to the school wharf, and a cheque in payment forwarded to Telegraph Cove Mills, Limited, Alert Bay, B.C., who supplied the material and performed the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It is noted that the above work has been satisfactorily completed, and I wish to express the thanks of this Department for the services of the above officers of your Bureau.\n\nWith reference to the accounts covering the cost of the above work, I have to say that an accountable cheque, to the amount of $1,890, was forwarded you under cover of official letter of June 9th, last, in favour of Mr. Webb. I would request that you have him forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of material, labour, supervision, etc. It is noted from the memorandum of Mr. Warren, that the cost of the material, labour, supervision, etc., in connection with the water-proofing of the school building amounted to $1,481.80, that the cost of the extension to the suction line of the fire pump was $286.16, and that the overhauling of the pump and the supplying of new parts was $52.98.\n\nWhen forwarding the accounts, Mr. Webb should return the unexpended balance of the advance which he has on hand.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nA. F. MacKenzie Esq.\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nDecember 21, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to my letter of the 4th inst., wherein I enclosed a account for special works on behalf of the Department of Indian Affairs which included the accounting of an advance of $1892.72, E.R.420, for improvements at Alert Bay Indian Residential School, I am pleased to enclose here-with memorandum in duplicate, dated December 19, by Mr. Warren, which describes the work which was carried out at the school, the cost of which amounted to $1820.96. The balance of $71.76 is still in hand and may be used to cover the cost of necessary repairs to the Alert Bay School wharf if desired, but to date I have had no instructions in this matter.\n\nIt is to be noted from Mr. Warren's memorandum in dealing with the waterproofing at the Indian School, that the brickwork on the east end of the building above the residence was found to be in a very bad condition as was also the brickwork on part of the residence, the joints being incompletely filled with mortar and the coping stones having unfilled or loose joints, making the work of waterproofing very difficult in this section.\n\nMay I request a copy of this letter and accompanying memorandum be submitted to the Department of Indian Affairs for their reference.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.B. Webb\nDistrict Chief Engineer\n\nJ.T. Johnston, Esq.C.E.,\nDirector,\nDom.Water Power & Hydrom.Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOTTAWA.\nVancouver, B.C.,\nDecember 19, 1953.\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb:\n\nThe following work was carried out at Alert Bay School during the months of July and August last, at a total outlay of $1820.96.\n\nWaterproofing School.\n\nAll faces of the school building and residence facing south and east were given two coats of waterproofing material. In all approximately 14,000 square-feet of surface was treated. The unit cost of the work was approximately 10\u00a2 per square foot, the total cost of the work was $1481.80, expended as follows.\n\n| Material etc. | $887.83 |\n|---------------|---------|\n| Labour        | 502.92  |\n| Supervision etc. | 92.09   |\n\n$ 1481.80\n\nThe process of waterproofing consisted of the application of \"Minwax\" waterproofing materials carried out in the following order.\n\nFirst, The application of one coat, to the point of saturation, on all exposed faces, south and east.\n\nSecond, The caulking of all windows, doorways, coping stone and roof flashings and the pointing of brickwork where necessary.\n\nThird, A second application of waterproofing on brickwork only, after completion of caulking.\n\nPrior to first application of waterproofing the surface was thoroughly cleaned by wire brush and all loose material removed. Where necessary acid was used for removal of efflorescence.\n\nConditions were ideal for the first application but some difficulty was experienced in making the second application on the east face owing to cool mornings and to the fact that this face of the building was in shadow during the afternoon.\n\nThe brickwork on the east end of the building above the residence was in very bad condition as was also brickwork on a part of the residence, the joints being incompletely filled with mortar. The coping stone also proved to have unfilled or loose joints.\n\nFire Pump System\n\nAn extension was effected to the suction line of the fire pump. The cost of this work was\n$286.18. In addition the pump was overhauled and a new shaft and bearings provided at a total cost of $52.98.\n\nThe work carried out consisted of the extension of the pump suction line a distance of 48 feet and provision of a bronze intake screen. The full length of the suction line was re-calked and the pumping station generally overhauled and placed in condition to operate effectively.\n\nW.C. Warren\nAsst. Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nAPPROVED:\n\nDistrict Chief Engineer\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE\nP. O. BOX 66\nVICTORIA, B.C. December 13, 1933.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter dated December 8th, No.156-0-5, in regard to expenditures at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. In reply thereto I beg to say I have furnished Mr. C.E. Webb, District Chief Engineer, Dominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau, at Vancouver with whom arrangements were made through the Department for the water-proofing and pipeline work earlier in the year, with an excerpt from the second paragraph of your letter.\n\nI would inform the Department that on November 2nd, ultimo, in reply to an inquiry I was advised by Mr. Webb that his records indicated there was at that time a balance of $69.04 remaining from the appropriation for the above-mentioned work. A copy of Mr. Webb's letter is sent herewith by which it will be inferred that he expected to receive a report from Mr. Warren (engineer), who did the work, that no further expenditures were involved. I may add that Mr. Warren is the only engineer available to this Department for all its Indian Reserve irrigation and other water works in the Reserves of British Columbia and demands upon his time have been so incessant as to make earlier returns to the Department a possibility.\n\nA copy of my letter of today's date addressed to Mr. Webb is also sent herewith and will be self explanatory.\n\nI would further advise that this office has been in touch with Mr. Newnham on these matters since the authority was first given to the Bureau to carry out the work and for this reason it is considered that he should have waited for definite information as to the balance available from the $2000.00 before going ahead with the wharf construction in front of the school at Alert Bay in the manner of instructions received by him from the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6428, file 875-5, part 4)\nDecember 8, 1933.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn our recent interview concerning the wish of the Department to terminate the lease dated June 1st, 1931, made between the Anglican Synod of the Diocese of British Columbia and His Majesty the King as represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, in regard to the maintenance of a wharf at Alert Bay, B.C., I promised to consider carefully the suggestions offered by you as being desirable of accomplishment as a condition of the Synod's agreeing to the cancellation, viz:-\n\n1. That the Indian Department should take whatever step may be possible to establish by negotiation with the Provincial Authorities of British Columbia, a title to the Synod with respect to the lands comprised in and referred to in the lease;\n\n2. That the Indian Department should be requested to pay to the Anglican Synod (lessors) the sum of One Thousand dollars ($1,000.00) in cash;\n\n3. That the Indian Department should enter into a definite agreement with the proper Anglican organization having to do with the School wharf site administration at Alert Bay on which it is desired the Department should undertake to maintain a suitable float such as has been recommended by the Acting Indian Agent and Principal Anfield.\n\nI now desire to say that I have carefully perused the agreement above referred to dated June 1st, 1931, in the light of the three proposals which you have verbally made to me in behalf of the Anglican Synod of the Diocese of British Columbia. I have also examined our files in this connection.\n\nYour letter of November 4th, 1933, and the letter of His Lordship Bishop Schofield, dated September 23rd, 1933, have been given especial consideration in this connection, and these letters will be referred to hereinafter. I shall deal with the matter under the respective headings \"1\", \"2\" and \"3\" above shown,\n\n(1) It is presumed that the late Commissioner who assisted in drawing up the agreement dated June 1st, 1931, believed that the Anglican Synod of the Diocese of British Columbia had title to the property embraced in the lease, as there is nothing on file to the contrary. It is inferred, however, in your letter of November 4th, ultimo, that there is necessity that steps should be taken to procure from the Provincial authorities for the Synod\n\nGrease & Grease,\nAttorneys and Solicitors,\n404-411 Central Building,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 1C, Volume 6428, file 875-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\na recognition of its rights to the site. Any recognition which may have been given by the Indian Department, by virtue of signing the lease, would appear to have been given with the supposition that the Synod had a legal right to lease the site to the Department, this right being asserted by the Synod on page 8, line 17, of the agreement. Apparently, therefore, the Department and its officers have been under a misapprehension, and it appears obvious that an error has been made in recommending the execution of the lease under these circumstances. I cannot see how I can advise the Department to present to the Provincial authorities a claim to recognition of a title to the Synod simply by virtue of our lease, the validity of which seems thus open to question.\n\n2. His Lordship Bishop Schofield, in his letter of September 23rd last, addressed to me, suggests that a group of Indians should be engaged to clear away the old wharf if the new contract (in regard to the wharf fronting the school known as the Carson wharf) is to be agreed upon, as it would be dangerous.\n\nWith due respect to His Lordship's views I should state that the wharf was dangerous before this Department signed the lease. We expended, in addition to the sum of $400 paid for the Carson wharf, the undermentioned sums of money, approximately:\n\n- Repair to Synod wharf - $1250.00\n- Clearing site and removing debris - $600.00\n\nmaking a total of about $2450.00. This was done to ensure the safety and utility of the wharf and site under the agreement. It is felt that this is sufficient compensation for any advantage which has resulted from the use of the wharf and site for school purposes since the date of the agreement, under which circumstances and under existing economic conditions, I could not ask the Department to pay a further sum of one thousand dollars. Both site and wharf are in better and safer condition as a result of the expenditures which the Department has made.\n\n3. The Department has already authorized, by arrangement with Principal Anfield, the repair of the Carson wharf fronting the Alert Bay Indian Residential School; and has stated that subject to the cancellation of the sawmill wharf and site agreement, it would give favorable consideration to the keeping in repair of the school wharf, in so far as funds permit from time to time.\n\nIt will be obvious to you, in view of the difficulties at present being experienced that any agreement to be entered into, if at all, with respect to the maintenance of the school wharf, would have to be based on an indisputable clarity of title as well as upon the consideration of the usefulness of the recently constructed Provincial highway through the reserve from the school to the Steamship wharves in meeting the reasonable requirements of the school, which now give rise to the proposal to cancel our existing lease to the \"Mill site wharf.\"\n\nUnless there is some good reason why I should not take such...\nsuch action and this reason can be given to me at a conveniently early date, I intend to make recommendation to the Department that the Synod be advised to resume possession of the property held under the existing agreement by virtue of the clause at the bottom of page four (4) and at the top of page five (5) thereof. I trust that it may be possible for you and His Lordship Bishop Schofield to agree with me in this, as the Department is already providing handsomely for educational and other work at Alert Bay and can, I feel sure, be relied upon to give sympathetic consideration to any reasonable demand concerning it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

F. MacKENZIE\n\nChg. Dept. I. A.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Principal of our St. Michael's School at Alert Bay, B.C., has again directed the attention of our Commission to the need of a stronger engine to operate the pump which supplies the school buildings with water. He states that this engine which is a 5 h.p. Petters Diesel is seriously overloaded, and cannot last much longer. He has requested authority to have it removed from the pump house at the school well, and installed in the laundry to operate the laundry machinery. Our Commission cannot agree to this arrangement until provision has been made for the installation of a more powerful engine to operate the water pump. In the list of requirements submitted by our Commission to be provided by your Department at this school this year, a new engine to operate the pump was included, and you will find the same under section B, page 4a of that list. The kind recommended was an 8 h.p. Petters Semi-diesel. As this matter has been reported on before, and as Mr. Warren, Engineer of the Water Power Branch recommends the installation of a larger engine to operate the water pump, our Commission sincerely trust that this equipment may be supplied immediately before the smaller engine breaks down, and the school is left without any water supply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, February 6, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15/6/32239 dated December 8th, last, with regard to the lease, from the Anglican Synod of the Diocese of British Columbia, of a wharf at Alert Bay, B.C., and enclosing copy of communications between your office, His Lordship Bishop Schofield and the Diocesan Chancellor, also enclosing copy of the lease dated June first, 1931.\n\nUpon review of the correspondence in connection with this matter, it is noted, as stated in official letter of October 19th, last, the wharf in question is not of further use for departmental or school purposes and that it also is in need of considerable repair. At the time the new school building was erected at Alert Bay, it was understood that the school would make the main use of this wharf, but, since that time, it has been found that the smaller wharf near the school would be sufficient to serve their purposes.\n\nIt is understood that Bishop Schofield would consent to cancellation of the lease of the \"Sawmill Wharf\" on the understanding that the Department would agree to keep the small wharf which is near the school in good condition. As stated in official letter to you of October 19th, last, the Department would be prepared to give favourable consideration to keeping in repair the small wharf near the school in so far as funds permit from time to time.\n\nThe Department is unable to consider the request of the Solicitor for the Diocese, made in an interview you had with him, that the sum of $1,000 be paid the Anglican Synod to terminate the lease of the sawmill wharf. I would point out that this wharf was leased at\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVICTORIA, B. C.\nthe time the new school building was erected, and the Department was advised at that time that this wharf would be required for the future use of the school. It now appears, as stated by the Principal, the former Acting Indian Agent and yourself, that this wharf is no longer necessary for school purposes.\n\nAs the Church Authorities have a joint interest with the Department in the carrying on of the work of the school, it is considered, in view of the Department agreeing to keep the wharf near the school in repair, that they should agree to the cancellation of the lease of the old sawmill wharf, without compensation. I may say that in the event of the Church being unwilling to cancel the lease of the wharf referred to, the Department could not consider making any further expenditure on the wharf near the school, as funds will not permit contributing to the maintenance of two wharves. Should the Church Authorities, upon further consideration, not consent to cancellation of this lease without compensation, no further action need be taken in the matter. I would request that you again take this matter up with the Church Authorities and advise the Department.\n\nThe Department would have no grounds to approach the Provincial Government on the Synod's behalf, regarding the title to the site of the wharf covered by lease.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to refer to Departmental letter No.156-0-5, dated October 19th, last, in regard to the lease of this Department with the Anglican Synod of the Diocese of British Columbia, dated June 1st, 1931, of a wharf site at Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nI now beg to transmit herewith copies of the undermentioned letters which will show what progress has been made with regard to the proposed cancellation of the lease, viz:-\n\n1. Letter from Commissioner's office to His Lordship Bishop Schofield dated November 1st, 1933.\n\n2. Letter from Bishop Schofield to C.C. Perry dated September 23rd, replying to letter of September 20th of which the Department has a copy of file.\n\n3. Letter from Diocesan Chancellor (Lindley Crease, Esq.) represented by Crease and Crease, barristers, and solicitors, dated 4th November, 1933.\n\n4. Letter dated December 8th, 1933, from C.C. Perry to Crease and Crease.\n\nThe last mentioned letter was written following a personal interview with Mr. Lindley Crease on December 2nd, instant, by appointment following consideration of his firm's letter of November 4th, ultimo. It will be noted that Mr. Crease asked for the sum of $1000 on the date of our interview which had not been mentioned by him in his letter of November 4th, ultimo.\n\nI believe that His Lordship Bishop Schofield would more readily acquiesce in the cancellation of the lease than would the Chancellor, who is his legal advisor and who is inclined to drive a hard bargain with the Department. For this reason I am inclined to take advantage of our right to question the title upon which the agreement is based, which title was claimed by the Synod in its agreement but is now being sought after by the Synod through the medium of the Department and its lease.\n\nThe lease was sent in duplicate by the Department under cover of its letter No.156-0-9 dated July 17th, 1931, to the Commissioner. One was handed to the Synod and the other retained on file here. It is presumed that the third copy was retained by the Department. In any event I am sending a copy herewith and would call attention especially to the 17th line on page 3 of the agreement where in the title of the site is claimed by the Synod, also to the letter of Messrs. Crease and Crease dated 4th November, ultimo, in which he asks that the Department assist the Synod to\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n\"procure...\"\n\"procure from the Provincial Government, a recognition of its rights.\"\n\nI cannot see any grounds upon which we could now approach the Provincial Government in the Synod's behalf as we have no further use for the wharf or site owing to the construction of the Provincial highway and the contemplated use of the school wharf, the latter having been purchased a few years ago from Mr. Carson, the contractor who constructed buildings for the Department under contract at Alert Bay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nNovember 1, 1938.\n\nMy dear Bishop Schofield:\n\nAs I have not heard from your Lordship since I addressed a letter to you on October 7th in regard to the Alert Bay wharf situation I have wondered if the letter has been received safely. In case this letter has not been delivered I am taking the liberty of sending a copy of the same for your perusal and I would much appreciate receiving Your Lordship's views on the representations made by the Acting Indian Agent, Mr. Newham referred to therein. Copies of the correspondence were forwarded to the Department and I have been advised from the Department that as it is the opinion that the sawmill wharf is of no use in connection with the School, the Department will approve of the cancelling of the lease on the same provided the Church Authorities will agree. In view of such cancellation, the Department would give favorable consideration to the keeping in repair of the school wharf, insofar as funds permit from time to time.\n\nThe Department adds that Mr. Newham has been authorized to repair the school wharf at a cost not to exceed $250.00, provided there are sufficient funds left over from the appropriation of $2,000.00 which was allowed for repair work at the schools.\n\nMost sincerely yours,\n\nP/KD\n\nEnclosure:-\n\nChas. G. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nRt. Rev. Chas. Schofield, D.D.,\nLord Bishop of British Columbia,\n912 Vancouver Street,\nVictoria, B. C.\nTHE ANGLICAN SYNOD OF THE DIOCESE OF BRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nBishop's Room,\nMemorial Hall, 912 Vancouver St.,\nVICTORIA, B.C.\n\nSeptember 23, 1933.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Perry:\n\nThank you for your letter of September 20th, with enclosed excerpts from a report of acting Indian Agent at Alert Bay regarding the local wharf situation there.\n\nI have consulted my Committee in charge of this matter and, after careful study of the existing agreement between the Anglican Synod and the Indian Department, it has seemed to us that there is a very considerable equity for our Synod Indian account at Alert Bay in the present agreement, as it definitely calls for an annual rental to be paid to this account by the Indian Department after a certain number of years' use of the old wharf. I draw attention to this element first of all, because we feel that it should not be lost sight of.\n\nOn the other hand, it was understood the School would make the main use of the old wharf, and if the School authorities really prefer the smaller wharf near the School we should not stand in the way of such an arrangement.\n\nIt would seem only fair, however, that if the change is to be made the Indian Department should be prepared to make some definite, new undertaking as between the Synod and itself regarding the School wharf.\n\nIf you will be prepared, for instance to recommend that upon release from the former Contract the Indian Department would contract to keep the School wharf in condition for a stated number of years, at its own charge, we should be prepared to endorse such a proposal.\n\nI trust the fairness of these suggestions will appeal both to you and the Department and that the matter can be worked out satisfactorily to all concerned.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nI remain,\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"Charles: Columbia:\"\n\nP.S. When taking up the matter further would it be possible to ask the acting Agent at Alert Bay to get a group of Indians to clear away the old wharf if the new Contract is agreed upon; to leave it as it is would be dangerous.\n4th November 1933.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAnglican Synod Diocese of British Columbia - Alert Bay Sawmill Wharf,\nYour File 15-6-31690-\n\nHis Lordship, Bishop Schofield, has conferred with us on your correspondence with him concerning:\n\n(1) The establishment of the wharf fronting on the Indian Industrial School at Alert Bay;\n\n(2) The wharf comprised in the lease of 1st June, 1931, from the Anglican Synod of the Diocese of British Columbia to His Majesty, of the parcel of land forming part of Section 4, Cormorant Island, Rupert District, and the water-frontage thereof, shown on the Plan marked red attached to the lease.\n\nThis lease is for a term of five years, from 1st August, 1930, at a nominal rental of $1.00 per annum, and for a further term of fifteen years at $200.00 per annum, payable in advance, the Crown binding itself to construct and re-build a good and substantial wharf on that site of the nature described in the lease, and undertaking to remove at the cost of the Crown, the old mill buildings.\n\nAs intimated by the Bishop in his communication to you, the Church authorities would not stand in the way of meeting the wishes of your Department, provided that a fair arrangement is made for the cancelling of this lease, and provided that fair arrangements are made for the future upkeep of the wharf opposite the School, which we understand it is now desired shall be maintained in substitution for the present demised wharf, which is commonly known as \"the mill site wharf.\"\n\nThere is another consideration to which we would invite your attention. The mill site wharf has been in existence for a great number of years, and the title of the Anglican Synod to the site has been recognized. It has been the policy of the Church authorities to maintain and protect its title to this site by, amongst other things, seeing that the existence of the wharf is preserved. If the wharf is now to be demolished, we think that your Department may be able to assist the Church authorities, namely, the Anglican Synod, to procure from the Provincial Government, a recognition of its rights to this site, which are of value to the Church in connection with its work amongst the Indians at Alert Bay.\n\nThe writer will be pleased to confer with you on these questions at your convenience. We are now writing to specify them so that you may have an opportunity of considering them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"Crease & Crease\"\n| ARTICLES | FIRMS ASKED TO QUOTE | REMARKS |\n|----------|----------------------|---------|\n|          |                      |         |\n|          |                      |         |\n|          |                      |         |\n|          |                      |         |\n|          |                      |         |\n\n**UNDERLINE TENDER ACCEPTED AND SHOW TOTAL VALUE OF ORDER GIVEN EACH FIRM**\n\nDO NOT USE THIS SPACE\n\nI recommend that lowest tenders, as underlined, which have been accepted, be approved\u2014tenders marked with circle not satisfactory for reasons given in remarks column.\n\nSigned:\n\nDept. of:\n\nCity or town:\n\nProvince:\n\nDATE:\n\nIndian Affairs.

This letter will be self-explanatory. No provision was made for such a plant in the estimates for the current year but if the Department considers the equipment could be supplied if an item were included in the estimates for the next fiscal year or if the Department can furnish the equipment out of the current year's available funds perhaps the Department will be good enough to advise either myself or the Indian Agent of its pleasure in the matter. Of course the Department may consider that the school should provide the equipment from its per capita earnings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJune 16, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nRecently it has been brought to my attention the necessity of caring for perishable food at the Residential School here in Alert Bay, and to check up on this I have made several trips to the school in order that I could get first-hand knowledge of the whole situation.\n\nI find the School is not provided with any means of taking care of this, and considerable difficulty is being experienced especially during the summer months. The school now have quite a large dairy, and as practically all their meat, butter, eggs, etc., are purchased in Vancouver and the boat service irregular, it is necessary that they order in large quantities to carry them over. It does appear that some form of refrigeration is necessary not only from a financial point of view but from a health viewpoint as well.\n\nThe necessity of economizing is fully realized at the present time, and with this in view we have endeavoured to find a means of obtaining satisfactory equipment to serve the purpose at the lowest possible cost. If the Department would consider the purchase of this equipment at the present time, the school are prepared to install the Walk-In-Cooler themselves and by doing this the whole equipment complete, fully installed, could be purchased for the sum of $690.00. This seems to me a very reasonable figure, and I would request that the Department grant us authority to have this refrigerating plant installed during the summer holidays. The School in order to assist the Department have agreed to do all the labour in connection with the installation, in the hopes that the Department will give favourable consideration to their request. This would mean a saving of approximately $265.00.\n\nI might add this plant could be operated from the present electrical system with no difficulty whatever. I have gone to the trouble of having an expert get all the measurements and thoroughly go into it, and no difficulty will be experienced in installing this plant. In the ordinary course the Department would ask for tenders, but in this case a special price has been offered by Marshall-Wells when the school is prepared to do the work themselves.\n\nI would appreciate very much if the Department would give this matter their serious consideration and if possible grant authority for this work to be undertaken. I assure you it is only after my fullest investigation of conditions at the school that I have decided to place the matter before you, and recommend that the installation of this equipment be carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S.

I have examined it very carefully and it could not be patched satisfactory to make a job of it. It is now exactly twenty-five years since the roof was shingled, so it has done pretty well.\n\nI have been trying to locate good shingles in this locality in order that we could get the work done as reasonable as possible, and have been able to find 10 M No.1 XXX and 8 M. XXXXX. There is an eligible gentleman living here whom I could get to do the work for $1.40 per M. He is a very good carpenter and very reliable, and I am sure we would have the work well done. The total cost would be approximately $78.20, and I am herewith enclosing a requisition asking that the Department grant authority to have this work done during the summer holidays when the school is not in session.\n\nWould you be good enough to give this matter your attention in order that we can choose fine weather during the holidays as we do not wish the rain to injure the interior of the building if possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nMST/T\n\nC.C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir:-\n\nRe: Departmental letter dated April 5th, 1933.\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith a letter of request received from the Indian Agent, Kwawkewlth Agency, B.C., that an encumbrance requisition be obtained for expenditure of the sum of $78.20 for the purpose indicated therein, the amount to be charged to the under-mentioned Vote:\n\nGeneral Vote: Indian Education.\n\nThe said request is approved for favourable consideration by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nSir:\n\nYour letter of May 17 has been received and I wish to advise there are two double beds being used in one of the boys' dormitories at the Alert Bay Residential School. These are being used on account of having no others available. I discussed this matter with Mr. Anfield, the Principal and he informed me they were short a few beds and were trying to repair a few old ones themselves. The capacity of the School, I understand, is two hundred children and there are a few more than this number in residence at present. If the Department felt they could supply four or five more beds I feel this would satisfy their requirements.\n\nIn regard to the fire gongs, there is no gong on the girls' side except one in the hall. The Principal feels there should be at least two fire gongs installed, one in the dormitory and the other in the rear of the kitchen. I have gone into this matter thoroughly with him and I am of the same opinion. As school will be out shortly, this matter can be left for a short time, but I would appreciate if the Department would advise me if I may have two gongs installed instead of one, as stated in your letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. S. Tedd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE\nP. O. BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., June 5, 1934.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter dated May 29th ultimo, No. 19-159 C, in regard to correspondence between the Department and the Vivian Gas Engine Works, Vancouver, concerning the purchase by the Department of a Petters Semi-Diesel Engine.\n\nIn reply thereto I beg to advise that the engine referred to was purchased on the authority of Departmental telegram dated March 12th, last, reading as follows:\n\n\"Please purchase eight horse power Petters \"Semi Diesel Engine and ship same to Alert \"Bay Residential School. Prices should be \"obtained from firms on approved list. \"Forward account as soon as possible.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\".\n\nPossibly the Department's file No. 156-0-5 may contain a copy of the wire referred to. Several firms whose names are on the Department's approved list were asked to quote on the engine, the above mentioned firm being one of these.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMay 29th, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of letter of 21st instant, with reference to the Vivian Gas Engine Works, Vancouver.\n\nI note you refer to Petters Semi-Diesel engine for lighting purposes. We do not appear to have any record in this Department of any purchase of this nature. We will, however, communicate with our Victoria Office to ascertain whether they have been obtaining prices for such an engine.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd) A.S. Williams\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nC.H. Dicke Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 17, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nRegarding the double beds in the dormitory, you might let me know how many of these are being used. You should advise, also, if you have consulted the Principal and ascertained his reasons for using double beds.\n\nWith reference to your remarks about the fire gongs, do you mean that there is no gong on the floor on which the girls' dormitory is located? If there is a gong on the floor, the Department considers this would be sufficient. It is not necessary to have the gong in the dormitory. If there is no gong on this floor, you may arrange for the installation of a suitable gong, at a reasonable cost.\n\nI presume that you will forward a separate letter regarding the amount of lumber required for the manual training department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay,\nB. C.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nMay 2, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nAs stated in my Monthly Report for April, I wish to make certain observations in reference to the St. Michael's Residential School during the time in which I accompanied Capt. G.H. Barry, Inspector of Schools, on his inspection.\n\nThe fire drill which was carried out was very good indeed. I timed the children leaving the building after the fire alarm was given and they were all out in less than two minutes, and the roll calls made and reported in four minutes. I might add the children were in bed when the fire alarm was given; they dressed sufficiently to withstand the cold and came out in a very orderly manner. I noticed only one thing which should be changed. The fire escapes are not sufficient as the four dormitories all lead into one general fire escape and some confusion was noticed at this point. The hydrants were operated, and I found them in first-class working order. There appeared to be sufficient pressure to force the water high enough to reach any portion of the building. The fire-fighting squad of the older boys of the school appeared to be well drilled and knew their work.\n\nIn making an inspection of the building itself I noticed one spot where the walls leaked, but I understand this is being repaired.\n\nI also noticed in No. 2 dormitory there were some double beds, which I do not believe the Department approve of. It was brought to my notice there are no fire gongs on the top floor of the girls' dormitory nor in the laundry in the rear of the building. This I feel is not in line with Departmental regulations, and I would recommend that a fire gong be placed in each of these sections of the building.\n\nIt was pointed out that a new stove was necessary for the Dispensary. This I believe will be dealt with in Capt. Barry's report, and I concur in this.\n\nIn the old school, now used as a classroom block, I noticed the light was very poor in one room, and while I feel this should eventually be attended to, it is not an immediate necessity and I would not recommend that anything be done with this at present. I checked over the amount of lumber on hand for the annual training of the boys, and the amount which was agreed upon by Capt. Barry and Mr. Anfield I would suggest would be satisfactory for this year's requirements. The matter of fruit trees was taken up and as they have a portion of their orchard as yet not planted, a requisition is being forwarded to complete their orchard, and I would recommend that the Department have these trees sent to them in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.S. Todd\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, April 24, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your 197/6/34357 of the 16th instant, with reference to the belt required for the new engine recently supplied at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nIf the Indian Agent and yourself are satisfied that a new belt is necessary, you may arrange for the purchase of a one ply Oak Tan 6\" belt, 24 ft. long, at an estimated cost of $26.50, f. o. b. Vancouver.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nChas. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nSir:\n\nThe Department recently authorized the purchase of a Petters Engine for the Alert Bay Indian Residential School at which time Principal Anfield asked to be furnished with a one ply Oak Tan 5\" belt, 24' long at an estimated cost of $26.50 f.o.b. Vancouver. He was advised that as no authority had been granted from the Department to purchase the belting he would have to make requisition through the Indian Agent separately for this material.\n\nA requisition has now been received from the Indian Agent and is sent herewith duly approved for such action as the Department may deem advisable. Although I have approved the requisition the Department will decide, of course, whether the Principal should purchase the belting from per capita grant or if the Department should provide it from the School Vote.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas.

(RG 10, Volume 6428, file 875-5, part 4)\nOttawa, Sept. 22, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the report of the Engineer, Department of Public Works, Victoria, on his inspection, in July, last, of the boilers and machinery at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. He reports as follows:\n\nBoiler No. 44325 - \"I gave this boiler a careful internal and external inspection and found that its condition was very poor. It has been pitting for some time, and, although the pitting has stopped, the damage to the plates has been done, and, after the coming season, it must be taken out and another installed.\" The longitudinal seam was found to be slightly leaking.\n\nBoiler No. 44557 - Found in first-class condition. The firebars are in need of repairs.\n\nBoiler No. 44261 - In good condition. There was quite a lot of sediment in the wet legs, which must be all cleaned out, and care should be taken to keep these clean and free from sediment. The steam gauge is slightly light. The fusible plug must be renewed.\n\nBoiler No. 44262 - The condition of this boiler was fairly good. The Engineer recommends that the same feed water treatment must be continued and that there must be more water blown off to prevent the collection of sediment.\n\nThe attention of the Engineer was drawn to the hot water storage tank. This tank is 12 ft. long and 3 ft. 6 in. in diameter and is suspended close to the roof of the boiler room in such a manner that it is very difficult to get at it. It was leaking at the longitudinal joint on the top. The water pressure being quite low, a screwed plug can be inserted if the leak gets worse. Both the inlet and outlet pipes are badly corroded and must be renewed. While this is being done, the tank can be advantageously lowered, at least 6 ft., so that the attendant can get around it to make repairs, if necessary. This is a small matter and can be done by the staff.\n\nI would request that you draw to the attention of the Principal the recommendations of the Engineer regarding the boilers and hot water storage tank. He should arrange to have the suggestions carried out. The Department understands that the certificates of inspection of the various boilers have been forwarded to the Principal. He should see that these certificates are posted in a prominent place in the boiler-room.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nK. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nALERT BAY, B. C.\nC. F. Dawson, Esq.,\nDistrict Resident Architect,\nDepartment Public Works,\nVictoria, B. C.\n\nAugust 29th, 1934.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Inspection of Boilers and Machinery,\nIndian Residential School, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nBOILER No. 44325.\n\nI beg to report that on July 25th I gave this boiler a careful internal and external inspection and found that its condition was very poor. It has been pitting for some time and although the pitting has stopped the damage to the plates has been done and now after the coming season must be taken out and another installed. In my last report I stated that it had been badly used and was much too small.\n\nI gave it a Hydrostatic test of 190 lbs. and found the Longitudinal seam slightly leaking, which from the internal conditions proves that it is past its usefulness and should be replaced. When this is done a boiler having submerged tubes should be considered as the vertical type boiler is not suited for the class of work it has to perform.\n\nThe safety valves are in good condition and are set to blow off at 125 lbs.\n\nI have issued a certificate for this season allowing a steam pressure of 125 lbs. and condition poor.\n\nBOILER No. 44557.\n\nOn the same date I gave this boiler a careful inspection and found it in first class condition. I then gave it a Hydrostatic test of 15 lbs. and found it perfectly tight. All the recommendations in my last report have been carried out. I set the safety valves to blow off at 5 lbs. water pressure. The firebars are in need of repairs. The steam gauge is correct.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 5 lbs. and condition good.\n\nBOILER No. 44261.\n\nOn the same date I gave this boiler a careful internal and external inspection and found that all stays, crowns, plates and welded seams were in good condition. I then gave it a Hydrostatic test of 30 lbs. and found it quite tight.\nThere was quite a lot of sediment in the wet legs which must be all bled out and every care taken to keep these clean and free from sediment. The steam gauge is slightly light. I set the safety valves to blow off at 15 lbs. water pressure. The fusible plug must be renewed.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 15 lbs. and condition good.\n\n**BOILER No. 44262.**\n\nOn the same date I inspected this boiler in a similar manner and found its condition similar to No. 44261, and have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 15 lbs. and condition good.\n\nThe same feed water treatment must be continued but there must be more water blown off to prevent the collection of sediment.\n\nWhile I was there my attention was drawn to the Hot Water Storage Tank. This tank is 12 feet long and 3'6\" in diameter and is suspended close to the roof of the boilerroom in such a manner that it is very difficult to get at it. It is leaking at the longitudinal joint on the top. The water pressure being quite low a screwed plug can be inserted if the leak gets worse. Both the inlet and outlet pipes are badly corroded and must be renewed. While this is being done the tank can be advantageously lowered at least 6 feet where the attendant can get around it to make repairs if necessary. This is a small matter and can be done by the Staff.\n\n**AUXILIARY MACHINERY.**\n\nThe auxiliary machinery is in a very good condition and well kept. All the bearings are quite tight no play being visible.\n\nAll the recommendation guards in regard to my last report have been carried out and the Laundry Machinery is now properly protected.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT.

Rain is also pouring through the front wall into the infirmary and many of the window frames in the dormitories are letting water through in considerable quantities.\n\nThe situation is well in hand and we are not fearful of any emergency though the main ditches are running at full capacity. Every precaution is being taken to keep all drains clear and all roof traps have been inspected personally today.\n\nMy object in writing is to suggest that the Department be notified of this condition as these inroads of water in the building cannot but have a very bad effect on the structure; creating a situation that in time is going to cost considerable money to correct; and for which the school management through the Commission can in no way be held responsible.\n\nThe Local Indian Agent is away at the time of writing or I would have asked him to come and see the situation for himself.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) F. Earl Anfield.\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6428, file 875-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE\nP.O.

It is considered that the school authorities, themselves, should be responsible for the expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst.

However, there is an item of $1,300 provided for the supplying of laundry equipment. If the Principal considers the installing of cold storage equipment more urgent than laundry machinery, the Department might favourably consider the matter. You should take this matter up with the Principal and advise the Department, and further consideration will then be given. It is noted that the cost of the equipment, fully installed, would be approximately $690. If the Principal decides that he would prefer the cold storage equipment, you should give particulars as to the nature of same, the best source of supply, shipping directions, etc.\n\nYou might state, also, what power would be used in the operation of the cold storage plant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay,\nB. C.\nOttawa, May 28, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, regarding the request of the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, to be supplied with a potato peeler and enclosing correspondence which he received, quoting on this equipment.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department does not usually supply equipment of this nature to residential schools. We have no funds available to cover the cost and therefore regret that we will be unable to authorize the purchase. I may add, it is noted, from the cut of the peeler, that it is electrically operated. It is not known what power the Principal would use in the operation of the machine if supplied. In any event, if the Principal purchases this equipment, from per capita allowance or other receipts of the school, it must not be attached to, or operated by, the electric light system. I am returning, herewith, the correspondence regarding the supplying of a potato peeler.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEncl.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay,\nB. C.\nSir,\n\nI am just in receipt of a communication from Mr. F.E. Anfield, Principal of St. Michael's Residential School in which he requests the Department to purchase a potato peeler for use at the School.\n\nMr. Anfield points out they use in the neighborhood of one hundred pounds of potatoes a day and that there is considerable waste through the fact of the younger children peeling the potatoes.\n\nI am enclosing you correspondence which Mr. Anfield has received in connection with same, and after the Department has given this matter their consideration would you kindly advise me your wishes and at the same time return the correspondence to be handed back to Mr. Anfield.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nMay 16, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nUnder date of June 16, 1934, I took up with the Department through our Assistant Commissioner Mr. C.C. Perry, the possibility of the Department installing a refrigerator plant at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School as I felt this was something which should be favourably considered in the interests of health and economy at the School.\n\nUnder date of July 27th Mr. Perry forwarded me copy of a letter received from the Department dated July 19, No. 156-0-5 stating as follows: \"I regret that, owing to lack of funds, it is not possible to authorize the expenditure that would be necessary. However the request has been noted and will receive further consideration when we are preparing our Estimates for the fiscal year 1935-36.\"\n\nWhile in Ottawa in December last, this matter was taken up with Mr. Sutherland and he was favourably disposed towards the installation of a refrigerator plant at the School. As it is now nearing the holiday period when the children will be absent from the school and the proper time to have the installation made, I would appreciate if the Department would kindly advise me if authority for this expenditure can be granted. As stated in my letter of June 16, the whole equipment, fully installed, could be purchased for the sum of $690.00, and I would kindly ask the Department to approve of this amount as this equipment is urgently needed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nI am sorry to have to report we are again having trouble with our drainage system at the residential school here. Last evening I was called to the school by the principal, Mr. Anfield, to look over the situation, and I found the field or flat at the rear of the school which has two cement drains leading from it to the sea were not large enough to take away the flood waters which had backed up on the farm. Mr. Anfield also showed me how the school building itself was badly leaking. It appears the water is getting in through the brick wall penetrating through to the plaster; this was noticeable in the upper dormitories as well as in the basement of the school.\n\nAs it was of such a serious nature, I wired Mr. C.C. Perry, Assistant Commissioner at Victoria and suggested that an engineer be sent to Alert Bay to deal with the situation and make a report to the Department. I am under the opinion unless something is done to stop this leakage the Department will have a tremendous bill on their hands as the plaster no doubt will come off the wall and possibly the foundations of the school be undermined. Today the weather has cleared somewhat and the situation may be eased up a little; however we are constantly watching it and if necessary will have to dig another ditch alongside one of the present drains.\n\nM. S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 13, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, regarding the leakage of the main school building during recent heavy rains.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that Mr. C. C. Perry, Assistant Indian Commissioner, Victoria, B. C., advises the Department that he has arranged with the District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Bureau at Vancouver to send their engineer to Alert Bay to investigate and report.\n\nI may add that in June, 1933, the Department incurred an expenditure to the amount of $1,890.00, in waterproofing the main building; and, as it was considered at that time that this would overcome the trouble, no further provision has been made for the purpose. It will now be difficult to provide funds if the Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Bureau reports that any large expense is necessary at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I have gone over it very carefully and am satisfied that it is the type of plant required. We shall operate it from a semi-diesel engine at present in the school; the Petters taken out of the domestic pumphouse. In addition to the tender of $825.00 as offered by Marshall-Wells Ltd., Vancouver, B. C., there will be required a further sum of $75.00 for the door; and for lumber and cement for the small building to be erected to house the compressor and engine. The school will do the labour.\n\nIf this tender is acceptable to you, will you ask the Department to utilize part of the funds made available for laundry machinery for this purpose, as we consider refrigeration to be an urgent necessity at this School. It is hoped that the Department will sanction immediate purchase of the equipment recommended here-with, so that installation may proceed without delay.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nEnos/\nFBA/RC\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL COMMISSION\n\nMr. F.

Anfield, Principal.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Kelvinator Refrigeration System -- Revised Quotation.\n\nConfirming our conversations with you, we have pleasure in offering revised quotation covering the supply and installation of our Kelvinator (made in Canada) refrigeration system set up and connected on your premises as follows:\n\nIn insulated storage room provided by you to dimensions 5'W x 9'L x 8'High interior measurement.\n\nWe would install,\n\n1 - Kelvinator Model 11239 large size crossfin cooling coil.\n\n1 - Special Brine Slush type, horizontal tank coil with radial fins, (capacity 20 gallons magnesium sulphate brine solution).\n\nA - 1 - Kelvinator Model LM7 Ice Cube Maker, capacity 7 three lbs. trays.\n\n3 - Automatic thermostatic expansion valves.\n\n1 - Standard cork insulated L baffle with drip pan and drain connections.\n\nAll properly connected according to Kelvinator of Canada Standard engineering practise etc.\n\n1 - Kelvinator, Model W.R.3150, twin cylinder, water cooled, methyl chloride compressor.\n\nThis machine will be fitted with special drive pulley, and suit-\nable belt supplied for belting to your Petters Oil Engine. Operating speed 400 R.P.M.\n\nIncluding all necessary copper tubing, fittings, hand valves and methyl chloride refrigerants.\n\nCondensing unit is equipped with:\n\n- 4 Service shut off valves.\n- 1 Automatic pressure actuated water valve.\n- 1 Vertical condenser and liquid receiver.\n- 1 Refrigerant strainer and oil separator.\n- 1 Refrigerant level try cock.\n- 1 High pressure relief valve.\n- 1 High pressure gauge.\n- 1 Compound gauge.\n- 14 lbs. Methyl Chloride refrigerant.\n\nAll the above installed and in satisfactory operating order.\n\nOne year's full service guarantee. Price ............ $825.00\n\nThe compressor has ample capacity to serve future extensions to storage facilities as anticipated.\n\nThe advantage of our combination fin coil and holdover system in your case is apparent, as it will give you the necessary reserve capacity to maintain even temperature at 37 degrees to 40 degrees for at least 5 hours in daytime periods and 8 hours at night when door is kept closed.\n\nFiguring our suction gas temperature at plus 10 degrees, we use a special brine formula which commences freezing at plus 20 degrees, forming slush. This slush has a capacity of 11,590 B.T.U. per 100 lbs. brine or a total of 23,180 B.T.U. in tank specified above, which is ample to absorb the full leakage into the box for 8 hours.\n\nReferring back to our previous quotation of June 15th, 1934, you will note that this provided for a 1/3 H.P. Condensing unit and equipment to serve a storage box 7' x 5' x 7'H outside, which would net 6' x 4' x 6' interior space. As we were then contemplating the use of your automatic electric power which would amount to continuous power service, we did not consider it necessary to recommend, special holdover features, and quoted on crossfin coils only.\n\nWe recommend that brine tank coils are necessary at this time in order that your engine operating time may be limited to 16 hours per 24.\n\nThe actual storage capacity of the room now contemplated will be 2000 to 3000 lbs. general foodstuffs.\n\nThe Condensing unit as specified has sufficient capacity to cool a total storage load 10 to 12 tons. It will only be necessary at any future date to provide additional room and connect the necessary coiling etc. to provide cooling accommodation up to this amount.\n\nWe can make complete installation in one month.\nAwaiting your instructions, We remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMARSHALL-WELLS B.

C.\n\nRefrigeration Sales Division.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed please find voucher No. 142 covering two invoices from Marshall-Wells B.C., Ltd. for shipments of paint to St. Michael's Indian Residential School, Alert Bay.\n\nMr. Anfield advises me during Mr. Phelan's recent visit he authorized the expenditure of $150.00 to assist him in making the annual repairs to the School. Mr. Phelan requested that the invoices be forwarded to the Department and have them referred to him as no authority was given other than his verbal instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nSir,\n\nRecently the Dominion Government Boiler Inspector, Mr. T.J. Arnall, made his annual inspection at St. Michael's Residential School, Alert Bay, and again informed me boiler No. 44325 which he had reported unfavourably on last year, must be replaced. In his last report Mr. Arnall stated as follows:\n\nBoiler No. 44325: \"I gave this boiler a careful internal and external inspection, and found that its condition was very poor. It has been pitting for some time and although the pitting has stopped, the damage to the plates has been done. After the coming season it must be taken out and another installed. The longitudinal seam was found to be slightly leaking.\"\n\nIn the Department's letter of May 28th, No. 156-0-5, they stated an item of $1300.00 had been provided for the supplying of laundry equipment for the Alert Bay Residential School this year. In my letter to the Department dated June 15th it was recommended that a refrigerator plant be installed, but it is now realized that the necessary expenditure for a new boiler this amount of $1300.00 will not cover both items.\n\nThe matter was thoroughly discussed with Mr. Anfield, and he decided, in view of the lateness of the season, he would manage without the refrigerator plant, and asked me to write the Department requesting that the money originally intended for this purchase be used for the purchase of a boiler and laundry equipment, which is urgently required. I am enclosing an illustration of the type of Steam Ironer requested by Mr. Anfield, and I would therefore now recommend that the refrigerator plant be left in abeyance and that the $1300.00 approved for expenditure at the school this year be used to purchase the new boiler and Steam Ironer.\n\nThe boiler recommended by Mr. Arnall is as follows:\n\nVertical Boiler, size 36\" x 90\", 142 square feet heating surface, 14.2 H.P., 125 pounds working pressure, at an approximate cost of $600.00.\n\nThe Steam Ironer required, shown in the enclosed illustration, would cost approximately $800.00. If $1300.00 is all that is available, I would suggest that the Department purchase the boiler and apply the balance on the Ironer and let the Commission make up the remainder.\n\nI regret that so much correspondence has taken place in connection with the amount of money approved, but we are trying to get the most urgent requirements and that is our reason for requesting the installation of a larger boiler for the laundry. Would the Department kindly advise us as quickly as convenient as the school will be reopening shortly and with so many primary grades this year the laundry equipment is considered urgent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n(M.S.

S. Todd, Indian Agent, Alert Bay, B.C., has forwarded a request from the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School (Electoral District of Vancouver North), for the supplying of cold storage equipment for the use of the school. They have no facilities for keeping milk and food supplies, as it is not possible to obtain natural ice at Alert Bay.\n\nThe Estimates for Indian Education for the current fiscal year contain an item, to the amount of $1,300, for the supplying of laundry equipment. The school authorities now advise that the supplying of cold storage equipment is more urgent than the laundry machinery and also that the church authorities, themselves, will purchase part of the laundry equipment. The Agent has forwarded a quotation from Marshall-Wells B.C. Limited, Vancouver, B.C., for the supplying and installing of a Kelvinator refrigerating system, at a total cost of $825. An additional sum of $75 will be required for the erection of a small building to install the plant, making a total cost of $900. Mr. Agent Todd has strongly recommended the supplying of the cold storage equipment as being more urgent than laundry machinery.\n\nI beg to recommend, for your approval, that the funds required to install the cold storage equipment be authorized. I shall be pleased to receive your direction if it will be satisfactory to place the order with Marshall-Wells B.C. Limited, or what other firm you request should be asked to quote.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to advise the Department that Mr. Webb of the Dominion Water Power Branch, at Vancouver, has today discussed with me several matters affecting our work in British Columbia, an item of which is the necessary waterproofing of part of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, upon which a report has already been made to the Department through the Director of the Water Branch from Mr. Webb's office.\n\nIt is understood also that Mr. Phelan recently visited Alert Bay and would probably have discussed with the Indian Agent and School Principal the condition of the building.\n\nMr. Webb and I consider that it should be recommended to the Department that, if funds are available, the waterproofing proposed to be done should be carried out during the present dry weather rather than waiting until the fall rains begin when the continued leaky condition will probably recur unless the work is done. I would request the Department's attention be given to this matter with as little delay as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nP:HN\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONTARIO.\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\nDOMINION WATER POWER AND HYDROMETRIC BUREAU\nOTTAWA ONT.\nMay 28, 1935.\n\nSir,- Re: Alert Bay Indian Residential School\n\nLast February Mr. Perry requested Mr. Webb to have an inspection made of the walls of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School to ascertain the extent of injury caused by seepage through them during the early winter months. Mr. Warren made an inspection shortly after and there is attached hereto a copy of his report dated March 22nd, with a covering letter from Mr. Webb dated May 22nd; also copy of Mr. Webb's letter to the Canadian Minwax Company, Limited, of Montreal, who were responsible for water-proofing the exposed walls of the school in 1933.\n\nFrom this report it would appear that the water-proofing process has not been successful and Mr. Webb is endeavouring to obtain some satisfaction from the Canadian Minwax Company to live up to the representations made before the work was undertaken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMay 22, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nRe: Alert Bay Indian Residential School\n\nOn February 26th last you were advised of an inspection by Mr. W.C Warren of damage to the walls of the above school caused by seepage through them during the early winter months.\n\nIt appeared from Mr. Warren's inspection that the waterproofing which was done to the building in the summer of 1933 had not been a success and the Vancouver agent of the Minwax Company, from whom waterproof material had been purchased, was communicated with under date of February 20th. In this letter he outlined how the waterproofing of the building had been carried out under the Minwax Company's instructions and specifications and under the most favourable weather conditions, and in view of the fact that the desired results had not been obtained we suggested that the company should assume responsibility to making the walls in question thoroughly waterproof. We have had some correspondence with the Canadian Minwax Company Ltd., 1176 Benoit St., Montreal, Quebec and up to the present no definite settlement of the question has been reached.\n\nA copy of our most recent letter of May 10th to the Canadian Minwax Company is enclosed, from which you will note we have put the matter up to them as to whether they are going to undertake the satisfactory waterproofing of the building or not. It seems to me the responsibility is theirs.\n\nI am enclosing copy of Mr. Warren's memorandum of March 22nd, reporting the result of his inspection. I think the Department of Indian Affairs would be well advised to immediately have a row of Lombardy poplars planted along the south and west sides of the building to act as a windbreak against the driving rain which occurs each winter, and at the same time a row of fir should be planted which, when grown, will make a much more permanent wind break.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston, Esq.C.E.,\nDirector,\nDom.Water Power & Hydrom.Bureau,\nOTTAWA.\n\nC.E. Webb\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nC.C. for Dept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, enclosed\n\nMr. Perry\nVancouver, B.C.,\nMarch 22nd, 1935.\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb\n\nRe: Alert Bay School\n\nI made an inspection of the above school building on the 9th of February and found that the inside walls of the school and residence on the sides facing south and east showed unmistakable signs of dampness penetrating through the walls.\n\nI was informed by the principal of the school that the amount of moisture had been very great since the exceptional storm of the week of January 20th to 26th and that the school people had been employed more or less constantly during the latter part of that week and the following week in drying out the floors and walls of the building. There was, however, at the time of my visit, sufficient evidence of moisture penetration on the walls to satisfy me that the seepage had occurred to a considerable extent.\n\nExamination of the outside walls of the building did not disclose any breaking down of mortar or any weakness in the wall and the waterproofing material which had been applied two years previously did not appear to have been washed out by rains. The inside walls of the building are commencing to show signs of breaking down. The metal lath on the exposed walls apparently is rusting away as the plaster is very weak in places.\n\nIt would appear that the Minwax waterproofing material applied in 1933 has not been effective. As to the reason why this material has been non-effective I am not prepared to express an opinion. I would suggest, however, that it would be desirable during the coming summer to make some further tests on the building with the same material and with other types of waterproofing before adopting any other expedient.\n\nIt would be desirable in my opinion, to plant a hedge of trees along the south and west sides of the building in order to provide a wind-break and to minimize the effect of the driving rains on the exposed faces of the building. The Lombardy poplar would be suitable for this purpose as it grows very fast and to a desirable height. Its life, however, short and it should only be employed until such time as a more lasting tree, such as the fir, can be grown to the necessary height.\n\nW.J. Warren\nAsst. Hydraulic Engineer\nMay 10, 1935.\n\nSirs:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your unsigned letter of the 3rd instant regarding defective waterproofing.\n\nI note your remarks regarding possible structural defects. I would point out that for possible defective joints we were advised to use pointing and calking material manufactured by your company, which we did to the extent mentioned in my letter of the 20th February to Mr. Loney. It would now appear from your letter that the material supplied was not that which should have been used in this instance.\n\nIn view of the fact that you do not appear to be satisfied with the conclusions arrived at after investigations by this Bureau, it would appear to me that the only satisfactory method of ascertaining the information you desire would be an inspection of the building by the Minwax Company. In order to further this and provide every assistance possible I am prepared to recommend to the Department of Indian Affairs that a responsible member of your firm be allowed to carry out the test suggested in your letter of the 3rd instant.\n\nAs it is necessary that the problem of this building be effectively solved by mid-summer I shall be pleased to be informed of early action in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.E. Webb\nDistrict Chief Engineer\n\nCanadian Minwax Co., Ltd.,\n1175 Benoit St.,\nMONTREAL, QUE.\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nJune 15, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter No. 156-0-5 dated May 28th regarding the installation of a cold storage plant in St. Michael's Residential School, Alert Bay, I beg to advise I have taken this matter up with the Principal who arranged to have an expert of the firm of Marshall-Wells B.C. Ltd., Vancouver, B.C. come to Alert Bay and take measurements, etc., and after thoroughly discussing the proposed amended plan with the Principal and myself he has submitted the enclosed Tender in the full price of $825.00 with one year's full service guarantee. In addition, $75.00 would be necessary to provide lumber and material to erect a small building to house the compressor and engine. The school have agreed to supply all the labour in connection with this.\n\nIt might be as well to state the original tender submitted to the Department was from Marshall-Wells B.C. Ltd. in which they agreed to install the equipment for the amount of $690.00 but this was intended to operate from the lighting plant. When it was discovered the Department regulations would not permit this, it was necessary to ask for an amended tender and make certain alterations for the new equipment. This has now been worked out and as stated before, it can be installed for the sum of $825.00 with an additional sum of $75.00 required for the erection of a small building, making a total cost of $900.00.\n\nAs we are anxious to get the Department's decision as quickly as possible in order that we may proceed with the installation we are trying to give you all the particulars. When we found it necessary to make the change and work out a new plan we decided we would use a storeroom in the school adjacent to the boiler room and by doing this we could have considerably more storage capacity for general food stuffs.\n\nIt is noted in your letter an item of $1300.00 was included in our Estimates for the supplying of laundry equipment. Mr. Anfield now advises the Commission are going to purchase part of the laundry equipment which we had previously asked for, and therefore I feel in view of this and the urgent need of the cold storage equipment, the Department should supply this refrigeration plant, and I strongly recommend that the Department approve of the enclosed Kelvinator Refrigeration System submitted in the enclosed Tender. If the Department will approve, I would recommend that they request either this office or our Assistant Commissioner at Victoria to arrange for the purchase of same and have the plant shipped direct to St. Michael's School, Alert Bay. Would you kindly advise us at your earliest convenience as we are anxious to proceed with the installation during the summer months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter No. 156-0-5 regarding the installation of a new boiler at St. Michael's Indian Residential School, Alert Bay. I beg to advise Dr. T.B.R. Westgate of the Indian Residential School Commission visited me yesterday accompanied by Mr. Anfield, the Principal, and we thoroughly discussed what was best to do in our difficulty.\n\nWe all agreed the boiler and steam ironer were much more important and necessary at the present time than the refrigeration plant. The boiler and ironer are more or less hooked up together and one cannot function properly without the other. At present the boiler is too small and is being used far beyond its capacity, and it being in poor condition we are afraid of an accident. This year there are a great number of primary grades and it is not possible for the older girls to do all the work necessary. After considering our position, Dr. Westgate decided to wire the Department as follows:\n\n\"After consultation Indian Agent Todd and Principal Anfield strongly recommend immediate installation steam ironer and high pressure boiler Alert Bay School as suggested in Mr. Todd's letter to you August 20th last. Season now so far advanced refrigeration plant mentioned in your letter August 29th to Mr. Todd may be held over until next year. School management will install machinery and our Society will meet all cost beyond fifteen Hundred Dollars. As School now open with capacity enrollment, kindly wire instructions Indian Agent Todd.\"\n\n\"T.B.R. Westgate\"\n\nI feel we have taken the only course open, and therefore would recommend to the Department they arrange for the installation of a suitable boiler as well as a steam ironer to take care of the work. This is urgent, and I would kindly ask the Department's immediate consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S.

S. Todd, Indian Agent, Alert Bay, B.C., has forwarded a request from the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School (Electoral District of Vancouver North), for the supplying of cold storage equipment for the use of the school. They have no facilities for keeping milk and food supplies, as it is not possible to obtain natural ice at Alert Bay.\n\nThe Estimates for Indian Education for the current fiscal year contain an item, to the amount of $1,200, for the supplying of laundry equipment. The school authorities now advise that the supplying of cold storage equipment is more urgent than the laundry machinery and also that the church authorities themselves, will purchase part of the laundry equipment. The Agent has forwarded a quotation from Marshall-Wells B.C. Limited, Vancouver, B.C., for the supplying and installing of a Kelvinator refrigerating system, at a total cost of $825. An additional sum of $75 will be required for the erection of a small building to install the plant, making a total cost of $900. Mr. Agent Todd has strongly recommended the supplying of the cold storage equipment as being more urgent than laundry machinery.\n\nI beg to recommend, for your approval, that the funds required to install the cold storage equipment be authorized. I shall be pleased to receive your direction if it will be satisfactory to place the order with Marshall-Wells B.C. Limited, or what other firm you request should be asked to quote.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nPublic Building\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDATED ... August 9th, 1935.\n\nMr. C.F.

Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your telegram of the 6th instant, with reference to the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nIn preparing the Estimates for the current fiscal year, the Department found it possible to provide only $1,300 for new equipment at this school. In your letter of November 2, 1934, you listed the requirements at each of the schools conducted under the auspices of the M.S.C.C., and in the case of the Alert Bay School the refrigerating plant was placed third on the list. As item \"A\" could not be considered and as item \"B\" is provided from B. C. Special, the request for the refrigerating plant ranked at the head of the list.\n\nCorrespondence during the last few months, both from the Principal and the Agent, pointed out the necessity of having a refrigerating plant at the Alert Bay School. Consequently, the matter was placed before the Honourable the Minister, and the Department is awaiting his directions with reference to his wishes in connection with the source of supply.\n\nRecently the Agent wrote again and stated that the Principal had now changed his mind and wanted the steam ironer instead of the refrigerating plant. This request was given consideration, and Mr. Todd was written on the 29th ultimo and advised that the Department considered that in view of the stress laid on the necessity for supplying a refrigerating plant, no change should be made. He was further informed that, if a new boiler is required, the Department would be prepared to favourably consider supplying this, although the cost of the refrigerating plant and steam boiler would exceed the amount provided in the current year's Estimates as mentioned in the first part of this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R.

In this connection it is noted from the Dominion Government Boiler Inspector's report, that he found the boiler in very poor condition and that, after the coming season, it must be taken out and another installed.\n\nI have to request that you will report, as soon as possible, if it is absolutely necessary that a new boiler be installed this fall or if the present boiler will be satisfactory for the coming winter's use. Unless it is urgent that a new boiler be supplied at the present time, we would not be prepared to authorize the expenditure.\n\nThe matter of supplying cold storage equipment, as mentioned in your letter of June 15th, last, at a total cost of $900.00, is now before the Minister, for his consideration. It is thought that this equipment should be supplied, rather than a new boiler. Should the present boiler be satisfactory for the coming winter's use, the Department would endeavour to include, in the Estimates for the next fiscal year, the amount required in the purchase of a new boiler\u2014which is stated by you to be $600.\n\nIf a new boiler is required, we would, no doubt, be able to provide the funds for the purpose\u2014$600\u2014and also supply the cold storage equipment, at a cost of $900. While this will exceed the amount provided for this school, yet an effort would be made to obtain the funds for both the above named purposes. The Department is not sure, from your letter, whether the cost mentioned, viz.: $600, includes the expense of freight and installation, and I should be pleased to be advised regarding the approximate cost of the supplying installing and any freight charges.\n\nWith reference to the supplying of a steam ironer, the Department considers there is no urgent necessity for this equipment, and it will have to stand over for the present.\n\nAs soon as the Minister advises regarding the supplying of the cold storage equipment, you will be informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nAugust 20, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nRecently the Dominion Government Boiler Inspector, Mr. T.J. Arnall, made his annual inspection at St. Michael's Residential School, Alert Bay, and again informed me boiler No. 44325 which he had reported unfavourably on last year, must be replaced. In his last report Mr. Arnall stated as follows:\n\nBoiler No. 44325: \"I gave this boiler a careful internal and external inspection, and found that its condition was very poor. It has been pitting for some time and although the pitting has stopped, the damage to the plates has been done. After the coming season it must be taken out and another installed. The longitudinal seam was found to be slightly leaking.\"\n\nIn the Department's letter of May 28th, No. 156-0-5, they stated an item of $1300.00 had been provided for the supplying of laundry equipment for the Alert Bay Residential School this year. In my letter to the Department dated June 15th it was recommended that a refrigerator plant be installed, but it is now realized with the necessary expenditure for a new boiler this amount of $1300.00 will not cover both items.\n\nThe matter was thoroughly discussed with Mr. Anfield, and he decided, in view of the lateness of the season, he would manage without the refrigerator plant, and asked me to write the Department requesting that the money originally intended for this purchase be used for the purchase of a boiler and laundry equipment, which is urgently required. I am enclosing an illustration of the type of Steam Ironer requested by Mr. Anfield, and I would therefore now recommend that the refrigerator plant be left in abeyance and that the $1300.00 approved for expenditure at the school this year be used to purchase the new boiler and Steam Ironer.\n\nThe boiler recommended by Mr. Arnall is as follows:\n1 Vertical Boiler, size 38\" x 90\", 142 square feet heating surface, 14.2 H.P., 125 pounds working pressure, at an approximate cost of $600.00.\n\nThe Steam Ironer required, shown in the enclosed illustration, would cost approximately $800.00. If $1300.00 is all that is available, I would suggest that the Department purchase the boiler and apply the balance on the Ironer and let the Commission make up the remainder.\n\nI regret that so much correspondence has taken place in connection with the amount of money approved, but we are trying to get the most urgent requirements and that is our reason for requesting the installation of a larger boiler for the laundry. Would the Department kindly advise us as quickly as convenient as the school will be reopening shortly and with so many primary grades this year the laundry equipment is considered urgent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n(M.S. Ford)\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, Sept. 23, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 20th ultimo, regarding the vertical boiler required for the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, I beg to say that quotations may be obtained from the following:\n\nVancouver Engineering Works, Limited,\n519 West Sixth Street, Vancouver.\n\nVancouver Machinery Depot, Limited,\n1155 West Sixth Street, Vancouver.\n\nYou should at once communicate with the firms mentioned, requesting them to quote a price on the boiler which is required. In your letter to each firm, you should give full particulars regarding the boiler that is needed.\n\nThe business should be placed with the firm quoting the lowest price. If, however, the lowest quotation exceeds $600, you should again communicate with the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. C. Parker,\nActing Secretary.\n\nM. S.

In this connection it is noted, from your letter dated August 20th, last, that the boiler required, as recommended by the Dominion Government Boiler Inspector, would cost approximately $600.\n\nThe Honourable the Minister has been requested to grant the necessary authority for the expenditure and to advise the names of the firms who shall be asked to quote on the supplying of the boiler. When we have his instructions, you will be advised.\n\nI may add that the supplying of the cold storage equipment, for which you were asked to obtain quotations in official letter of the 13th instant, from the firms mentioned therein, and also the supplying of the boiler will involve a total expenditure of approximately $1,500.

Harrison, Vice President, relative to the Alert Bay Indian School waterproofing job.\n\nI am greatly surprised to learn that the Minwax Company have so far done nothing to rectify the conditions which have existed at the school since their product was put on to waterproof the building and which job has not proven satisfactory in any way. It had been my opinion that the Minwax Company would have been only too pleased to investigate conditions at the Alert Bay School where seepage is taking place through the brick walls where their product was used as a waterproofing.\n\nAt your suggestion I will be very pleased to have you call at your earliest convenience to discuss the situation with me as something must be done to rectify conditions at the Indian School. As you know the road weather is now past for this season. It is altogether probable the school will have trouble again this year through leakage when the rain commences.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHerbert J.

You have not forwarded the quotations for the installing of the cold storage equipment, and the Department would be pleased to hear if you have placed the order for the supplying of the vertical boiler. If the above equipment has been supplied, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. S.

O. Anfield,\nGeorgia Hotel,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nResidential School,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nOctober 17th, 1935\n\nMr. F. O. Anfield,\nGeorgia Hotel,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe take pleasure in quoting you on Frigidaire Equipment for your Residential School at Alert Bay, B. C.\n\nFirst, it is our understanding that this equipment is to be operated from a 5 H.P. Pedders Oil Engine, 400 R.P.M. with a 21\" flywheel and a 6\" pulley.\n\nIt is also our understanding that you have an engineer at the School on duty night and day and that we will be able to depend on him to check the operation and that he will cut in the power plant when refrigeration is required in order to maintain a maximum temperature of 42 degrees, as it will be impossible for us to give you an automatic operation with this type of installation. We will, however, guarantee that it will not be necessary for you to operate the plant longer than 16 hours out of each 24.\n\nWe will construct a Walk-In Fixture, the outside dimensions being 6' x 10' x 8' high, properly insulated with 5\" of corkboard and having one full length door fitted with the latest type instant hardware. This cooler will be built of sitka spruce throughout, finished in a good workmanship manner, all freight will be paid and a man will be sent to Alert Bay to make the installation.\n\nIn this cooler we will install one Frigidaire Diamond Fin FLOODED Coil with a Frigidaire S Type control valve that will automatically maintain a given back pressure. By using this type of coil we will be able to pump sufficient liquid refrigerant into the coil to give us at least a three hour holdover. We hope, however, that you will be able to get a four hour holdover. We do not carry this coil or valve in stock so that it will be necessary for us to bring it through from the Factory and it will take us at least two weeks to get it from the time you place your order. Also, by using a Diamond Fin Coil, because of its increased surface, we will be able to maintain a circulation during the off cycle period. To this Coil we will connect, by means of cold drawn copper tubing, a Frigidaire Heavy Duty, Twin Cylinder, Reciprocating Type, Water Cooled Compressor. This Compressor will have sufficient capacity to evacuate the Coil entirely very rapidly. It will be our intention to draw the box down to 36 degrees in the on cycle and the off cycle will be determined by the temperature of the box rising to 42 degrees. This will give you, we believe, a very trouble proof operation with a safe\nOctober 17, 1935\n\nMr. F.O. Anfield,\n\ntemperature to keep your food.\n\nThe whole will be installed by our Engineers in Alert Bay and unconditionally guaranteed for a period of one year. This guarantee is given you not only by McLennan, McFeely & Prior Limited, distributors of Frigidaire for the Province of British Columbia, but is backed by the Frigidaire Corporation, a subsidiary of General Motors. This complete installation of the Cooler and the Equipment will cost you $895.00\n\nHoping to receive your instructions, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMcLennan, McFeely & Prior,\n\nFrigidaire Manager.\n\nJEMcGormack/AM\nLower Costs - Constant Market\n\nA Gallon a Minute or a Gallon an Hour\n\nKelvinator Cooling Units are designed and constructed for rapid heat transfer with consequent low operating costs.

The Department will note McLennan, McFeely & Prior Ltd., Vancouver, B.C. who are distributors of the \"Frigidaire\" automatic refrigeration for this province, have quoted on behalf of Crawley & Barker, and submitted a tender for complete installation for the full price of $895.00. This equipment is to be operated from the 5 H.P. Petters Oil engine which the school now have, and will be operated independent from the school's electric plant, which complies with Department regulations.\n\nMarshall-Wells B.C. Ltd., of Vancouver, submitted two quotations on behalf of the Payne Hardware Company, the first including complete installation for the full sum of $1010.00, this to be operated from the school's 5 H.P. Petters engine, which also complies with the Department's regulations in that respect. In Marshall-Wells' second quotation the Department will please note this was figured to be operated from the school's electric light plant and its full price installed would be $900.00, but as this would be against the Department's regulations this quotation cannot be considered.\n\nThe Department will note there is a difference in price between the two quotations of $115.00 for the same hook-up, Marshall-Wells being that much more than McLennan, McFeely & Prior. Not being an expert in this particular line, I am unable to give the Department any definite recommendation. I have, however, consulted several people whose trade specialties are similar, and it would appear the Kelvinator, made in Canada and supplied by Marshall-Wells B.C. Ltd., would work very satisfactory and give good service for the particular location where the installation in the school is to be made. Other than this I am unable to give the Department any further information.\n\nI am herewith enclosing the quotation received from McLennan, McFeely & Prior and the two quotations from Marshall-Wells B.C. Ltd. which will be self-explanatory. Would the Department kindly advise me as to their wishes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S.

It is noted that you have placed the order for supplying this equipment with the Vancouver Iron Works, Limited, Vancouver, at a cost of $598.50, and that the boiler has now been received and is being installed. When this work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should forward an itemized account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nWith reference to the disposal of the old boiler referred to in your letter of the 26th ultimo, the Department is not aware, at the present time, of any other school to which this equipment could be sent. I may say, however, that from the reports received from the engineer of the Dominion Department of Public Works, who inspected this boiler in August last, it was in very poor condition and that it was absolutely necessary to have a new boiler installed. From your letter, it is noted that this old boiler is in very good shape. It is considered, if it was not in satisfactory condition for use at the Alert Bay School, it would hardly be satisfactory, without large expense, to have it placed in some other school. However, in the meantime, if this old boiler is considered to be fit for further use, the Principal should arrange to store it until required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. S.

It is to be understood that this equipment will be operated from the school's 5 h.p. Petters engine. You should see that the work is satisfactorily completed and that the equipment is placed in good running order. After the refrigeration system has been installed to the satisfaction of the Principal and yourself, you should obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost. This, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nFor your information, I return herewith copy of the quotation of Marshall-Wells B. C. Limited, in order that you can check up on the equipment they supply and see that they have supplied all parts and installed same satisfactorily.\n\nI might add that we have also received your letter of the 26th ultimo, enclosing the quotation from Paine Hardware, Limited, North Vancouver.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

In the Department's letter of September 23rd instructions were given to purchase this boiler providing the quotations received did not exceed $600.00.\n\nYou will please note the Vancouver Engineering Works Ltd. submitted a tender of $749.75.\n\nYou will also please note the Vancouver Iron Works Ltd. submitted two quotations, the first one in the amount of $660.00, and the second $598.50.\n\nAfter the first quotations had been received from each firm I took the matter up with them further stating we did not have sufficient funds provided, whereupon the Vancouver Iron Works submitted the second quotation in the amount of $598.50, which was formally accepted in my letter of October 29, copy of which I am enclosing.\n\nFor the Department's information, the Vancouver Iron Works installed the original boilers and machinery now in use at the Residential School, and in view of this I think they felt they could reduce their original quotation. I might add I am pleased this firm was the lowest tenderer and supplied this material as we will only have one firm to deal with in future should any difficulty arise over any of the machinery installed at the school.\n\nThe boiler is now installed and is giving complete satisfaction. The invoice in the amount of $598.50 was forwarded on Voucher No. 323 on December 4th, 1935.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S.

It was not large enough to serve the purpose at the Alert Bay School, and therefore was being overloaded continually which made it dangerous, and it was for this reason that a request was made for a larger boiler.\n\nThis boiler could be used elsewhere, and Mr. Arnall the engineer stated to me he would keep it in mind and try to use it at another school when one of that size was required. We will arrange to store the boiler at the School here until such time as the Department advises us it can be used elsewhere.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S.

Architect,\nDepartment of Public Works,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Vertical Boiler No. 44325 B.C.,\nat Indian Residential School,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nHaving reference to the above, upon looking over my previous reports on this boiler I find that the following various conditions have been reported on.\n\nIn 1933 I reported that this boiler had the appearance of having been badly used and Hydrostatic inspection could not be completed on account of tubes leaking on the top end and recommended that they be rerolled, and this was done.\n\nIn 1934, during the Hydrostatic test the longitudinal seam started to leak and taking into consideration the internal condition of the plates I reported that it was getting past its usefulness, and again reported that a new and larger boiler be installed.\n\nIn my 1935 report the longitudinal seam was again leaking during test. I then reported that it must be renewed as soon as possible, as I would be obliged to cut the steam pressure considerably below usefulness, which was done in 1936, reducing the steam pressure from 120 lbs. to 100 lbs. If it had not been for the extreme care and attention to instructions given to it by Mr. Ward, the Engineer, it would not have lasted as long as it has.\n\nIn answer to the request of Mr. Todd, the Indian Agent, about selling it for commercial purposes, this would mean that it would come under the Provincial Inspection Act and as lap longitudinal seams are not now allowed I expect that they would not pass the boiler except for low pressure. I think that $60.00 would be a fair price for it. The suggestion that it be used in another school is in my opinion the only way to dispose of it.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n\"T. J.

Vertical Tubular Boiler, No. 44325. This boiler was removed from the school last fall and another of a larger size installed. Mr. M.S. Todd, Indian Agent, Alert Bay, states that an offer of $60.00 cash has been received from Mr. J. Sharp, who is at present installing a marine ways at that point. The Agent referred the matter to C.F.

Mr. Anfield has received an offer of $60.00 cash for it, but before submitting this offer to the Department I took the matter up with the Public Works Department through the Commissioner's office, and from the engineer's report I would recommend that the Department agree to accept $60.00 cash for same, as we do not have any further use for the boiler here and if it is left lying around no matter how well it is taken care of it will quickly deteriorate and depreciate in value.\n\nWould the Department kindly advise me in view of the enclosed correspondence, whether it is their desire to accept this offer of $60.00, in which case the money would be forwarded to the Department in favour of the Receiver General.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Loney,\n3240 West 24th Avenue,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Loney: Re: Alert Bay Indian School\n\nI have your letter of June 17 and I'm really delighted to see that Mr. Webb takes a more considerate attitude.\n\nI honestly do feel in connection with Brick and Cement Coating that under the conditions as they will exist on the job, it would be dangerous to use it. Those walls are full of moisture, you've got slow drying conditions and a lot of rain apparently, even in the sun, and there would be great danger of peeling and then there would be lots and plenty of trouble.\n\nI think the thing to do is to say that we will supply, without cost, F.O.B. the steamer here in New York, or F.O.B. cars for freight, the Clear Waterproofing necessary to do the balcony. Probably ten gallons should be sufficient, fifteen gallons we could be able to furnish if it was desirable. Then if they desire to go thru with the balance of the job we will be glad to talk with them about supplying material for the balance although I'd be inclined to hope that when it came to the balance they would have discovered that really weren't so much to blame and that they could afford to pay at least a cost price on the material. However, I wouldn't quibble about that point.\n\nNow as to specifications I do not see how I can write more explicit specifications than I have already done. To attempt to do so might be misleading for it is very difficult to line out the work from this distance.\n\nThe thing that must be accomplished is that they must have sound and solid and full joints. If I was on the job I'd test every joint with a hammer - every one that seemed at all loose I would cut out and cut it out \u00bc\" deep and I would point it up with a high lime cement mortar. I think probably I would use a mortar with one part cement, two parts lime and seven parts sand and I'd do a mighty careful pointing job. If I wanted to be sure of myself I think on that job I'd cut out and re-point every single joint. It's difficult to recommend that from here because it might be spending more than is necessary. Wherever that isn't done I would certainly take the greatest possible care and rub every joint or crack in a sound joint full of Caulking Compound, rubbing it on and rubbing it off the surface so that it'll well filled and then I'd give the whole surface another coat of Clear waterproofing. One coat should be sufficient.\n\nI wish I was going to be out in your section for I think that if this was done, you and Mr. Webb and myself would be able to celebrate and make merry not only at the Golden Jubilee but because this job was finally licked.\n\nBest regards,\n\nVery truly yours,\nMINWAX COMPANY, INC.\nAllrich S. Harrison\nVice-President\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that Mr. C. E. Webb, District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau at Vancouver, has furnished me with copy of his letter dated July 8th, 1936, addressed to Mr. J. T. Johnston, Director of the Bureau at Ottawa, in which he recommends the expenditure of $100.00 in order to carry out a further experiment of waterproofing a part of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School as suggested by the Minwax Company, Inc., whose product was previously used but proved unsatisfactory owing to alleged constructural deficiencies in the building.\n\nIn view of Mr. Webb's recommendations, I feel I should endorse the same as there seems at least a degree of hope that the faulty condition of the leaking building can be improved by the proposed experiment which, if successful, would prove a good investment.\n\nThe alternative appears to be constructural changes in the building which would no doubt involve a major outlay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

Anfield, Principal of St. Michael's School at Alert Bay forwards tenders for a steam ironer to be installed as laundry equipment in the school which we are submitting for the Department's attention.\n\nIt is noted Mr. Anfield suggests the 100\" flat ironer as the most practical and suitable ironer for the school work. Being a lay man I am not in a position to offer any advice in this connection, and would ask the Department to be guided more or less by Mr. Anfield's Recommendation.\n\nThe Department will recall a request was made by the school last year for this ironer to be installed at that time but at that time we were advised it could not be undertaken just then but suggested it might be approved this year. This is something which I know is very much needed, and I would recommend to the Department they undertake to install this machinery, and would ask that they advise me of their wishes in this respect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S.

The need of a steam ironer is known to you, and of the two bids I would most strongly recommend the 100\" flat ironer, to the price of which should be added freight charges from Vancouver to Alert Bay, which might amount to $50.00 in all. For your information, I have seen the flat ironer in question, and it is exactly what we need here.\n\nWill you kindly place this matter, with your comments, before the Department for consideration.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nVancouver, B.

This machine would be thoroughly overhauled and put in good running shape and we have no doubt it would be quite suitable to take care of the amount of flatwork you have to handle in your Institution. Ironing capacity of this machine is rated at 14' 7\" based on 100# steam pressure at the Flatwork Ironer.\n\nFor your information a new machine of this type would cost $2765. f.o.b. Toronto.

ORR,-\n\nRegarding the letter hereunder, from Agent Todd, reporting on the condition of the exterior walls, and roof and the repairs required to the interior of the building at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, I would say that the following amounts have been provided in our Appropriation for the current fiscal year for this school:-\n\nWaterproofing walls, main building - $2,500.\nInterior and exterior decorating - 250.\nMiscellaneous repairs - 250.\n\nAs you are aware, the Minwax Company were paid $1,800 to waterproof the outside walls. It would appear, from the Agent's letter, that this work was very poorly carried out.\n\nI would request that you arrange for the carrying out of the repairs mentioned by the Agent as being required, but it will not be possible to provide any amount in excess of the sums mentioned above - a total of $3,000. for carrying out any work at this school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6428, file 875-5, part 5)\nSir,\n\nOn May 27th I received a telegram from Mr. C.E. Webb, District Chief Engineer, Vancouver, stating Mr. H.J. Loney, representative of the Minwax Company of Canada would arrive in Alert Bay the following day to make an inspection of the work done in 1933 in which the above firm's material was used in waterproofing the walls of St. Michael's Indian Residential School in an effort to stop water leakage penetrating the brick walls of the school.\n\nUpon Mr. Loney's arrival at Alert Bay, I accompanied him to the school and spent five hours going over the work that had been done by their representative as well as examining every portion of the building where it was thought possibly a leakage was taking place. After a very thorough inspection, certain conclusions were arrived at by myself and I feel in the interests of the Department I should make a personal report giving only my own personal views. I think I should also state that for a great many years I handled building material and had considerable experience in the construction of buildings, and therefore my views are being expressed through the knowledge which I have along these lines.\n\nExterior of Building - I thoroughly examined the quality of material used in the construction of this school. I refer now to the brick used in the veneer work. The bricks supplied for this school were just common clay red brick, and in my opinion should never have been used for an outside wall in a wet climate. I am under the opinion hard-pressed, No.1 brick should have been used in this building in this climate.\n\nThe bricks used were found to have many defects, including airpockets, checks, and blisters running generally peaking through a great portion of the bricks used in the building. Where a blister appeared it has either peeled off or so thin that the moisture gets into the brick and keeps the wall damp. Some of these holes and checks would appear to go clean through the brick although it is difficult to determine this. There are many cracks in various joints where with the storm continually beating against the wall, the water could seep through and run down the wall between the brick and the tile in the wall.\n\nI particularly examined the work done by Mr. St.Cyr, representative of the Minwax Company, and I find there are cracks in the wall which were never touched. Upon investigation I also found that when he arrived here several Indians were employed by someone to assist him in doing this work. There are places on the building where this material was put on that the naked eye cannot see any reason why it would be put on. It appears no systematic way of doing the work was established; they simply went over the building and put a little daub on wherever they saw a crack, and it would appear that many cracks were missed. I do not think Indians should have been employed to do this very important work, and in my humble opinion the whole face of the building must be gone over before a satisfactory result can be obtained.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nThe roofs were thoroughly examined, including the main roof, roof of the residence and the roof of the balcony. The three drains of the main roof were found to require repairing; the screens were partially closed with stones and other refuse washed in from the roof. One or two of the screens were completely closed. I have requested the Principal to have these replaced. The asphalt or tar preparation used on these roofs has to some extent deteriorated, leaving much loose gravel on the roof, and it would appear that a new roof will be necessary very shortly.\n\nIn my opinion, this is not the most suitable type of roof to be used in this locality where we get so much rainfall at certain seasons of the year. The roof on the balcony was found not to have a proper drain as there was water still lying on the roof twenty-four hours after the last rainfall.\n\nIt was our considered opinion that the water getting into the walls of the building was caused partially by the roof where it joins up to the walls and through the main walls themselves, through defective material being used in the original construction which later cracked or developed seams.\n\nInterior of Building - Upon examining the interior of the building the walls were found to be damaged through moisture to the extent that plaster is falling off in spots and in other places a great deal of discolouration has taken place which eventually will cause the plaster to come off. Upon examining the metal lath it was found to be badly rusted and in some places rusted entirely away. The water seeping down through the walls enters the building in the basement coming through the wall at the point where the brick wall joins the cement foundation. The portion of the building which is affected is the east and south side of the main building and residence.\n\nI consider the condition of the building is now a major undertaking and that it would be useless to spend a little money trying to patch it up; however, that matter can be determined by the Department's engineers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nJuly 8, 1936.\n\nSir: Re: Alert Bay Indian Residential School\n\nFrom previous correspondence you will understand we have been in communication with the representative of the Minwax Co. regarding the waterproofing job which was done several years ago at the Indian Residential School, the results of which proved unsatisfactory. The question of responsibility for the fact that water still seeps through the building remains unsettled and as a matter of fact it seems to me we will not arrive at any definite decision in the matter.\n\nFrom all reports it appears that the weather conditions at Alert Bay during the winter months are extremely severe and with driving rains which last for several days at a time, any building must be absolutely water-tight if seepage is to be avoided and this does not seem to be the case in the Alert Bay School.\n\nMr. H.J. Loney, Vancouver, representative of the Minwax Co. Inc. made an inspection recently at the expense of his company, of the Alert Bay School. He reported to his principals that the building was not in a satisfactory condition as far as water tightness was concerned. He reported finding cracks between bricks and mortar in many places. He also reported finding in quite a number of instances, bricks with thin holes in them into which moisture had seeped and lodge which might possibly be the cause of considerable seepage. The condition at this school is unfortunate in view of the fact that so much seepage has occurred that now the walls of the building are almost continuously wet, in fact it is doubtful if the interior of the walls dries out during the summer months. This condition makes it very difficult to determine what would satisfactorily waterproof the building. Frankly I am at a loss to know what to recommend.\n\nMr. Loney is very anxious to have his product used in an endeavour to finally seal the building against moisture. In order to definitely determine if this Minwax product will satisfactorily waterproof the building it has been suggested that a surface of approximately 600 square feet be\n\nJ.T. Johnston, Esq., C.E.,\nDirector,\nDom. Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOTTAWA.\ntreated as a test. The area selected is one which has given considerable trouble and is located just over the main entrance to the school on the southern exposure from the roof down to the first floor. The Minwax Co. are prepared to furnish ten gallons of Minwax free, f.o.b. New York, we to pay the duty and freight charges. In addition to this some 30 lbs. of caulking compound would be required and five gallons of black Minwax coating for treating the back of the parapet over the main entrance. I estimate material would cost $28.00 and labour about $40.00, in all $68.00. If the department concur in the suggestion, which I think is a good one, I would suggest $100. be appropriated to carry out the experiment.\n\nSomething must be done at an early date as possible to waterproof this building and from the information now available I do not think we can hold the Minwax Co. wholly responsible for the fact that their product did not make a satisfactory waterproofing job.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.B.

Anfield Esq., Principal,\nSt. Michael's School,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAnswering your telegram received today, I am attaching circular giving complete details and specifications of our model \"A\" Ironing Machine, and also a copy of our Operating Manual for same. The circular enclosed does not show the dual heat control which is the latest improvement in our machine, enabling the operator to heat the right or left half of shoe at will, or the entire shoe when ironing large pieces. This is a decided help where considerable work such as dresses, shirts, etc., are being ironed on the left or open end of the shoe. It also means an economy in current consumption. There is also the improvement of rubber, instead of steel castors, which does not appear in the enclosed circular.\n\nAs explained in my letter of July 16, price of this machine is $149.50, $20.00 deposit, and $7.00 per month, or $128.50 cash, the latter covering 90 days or a little longer time if necessary. I also mentioned that should you instal the 110 AC current within 6 months from date of purchase, we would exchange the DC motor for an AC motor without charge.\n\nThe above price is FOB Alert Bay and would cover the installation by us before shipment of the correct motor for your current. The heating element will work quite satisfactorily on AC or DC current.\n\nSince I called on you on July 10th our Factory has turned out a new Ironer priced at $104.50 at $6.00 per month or $93.50\nThis ironer is in appearance the same as the Model \"A\" but is in reality the wringer post ironer illustrated on page 9 of the enclosed circular mounted in the same cabinet and cover as the Model \"A\". It is operated with a hand lever as shown and this would be supplied with motor and heating element for any current.\n\nWe thank you for your enquiry and hope we may have the opportunity of being of further assistance to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBeatty Bros. Limited\n\nPer\n\nManager, North Vancouver Branch.\n\nF.W.Thomas/BT\nIn the Beatty Ironer you are assured of a product that will do the work expected of it. You will be well repaid to take the time to learn to operate this ironer. The Beatty is simple to operate. You will soon become expert in ironing the most difficult pieces. Before you use the Ironer, read the following directions carefully.\n\nBeatty Bros. Limited\n\nHead Office Fergus, Canada\nHow to Iron Bed Sheets, Pillow Cases,\n\n1. Sheets that are wider than twice the width of the Beatty roll should be folded in two first, then passed through the ironer twice, and folded to put away.\n\nPillow Cases\n\n2. Pillow Cases are ironed from the closed end to the open end. If embroidered, the pillow case should be turned right side up the first time through. There is no need to release the shoe when thin flat pieces like pillow cases are being ironed. These thin articles lie flat on the roll, and the open throat of the Beatty shoe permits them to feed into the ironer without wrinkling.\n\nTable Cloths\n\n3. Table Cloths are ironed after being laid once with opening at the operator's right end with as much of the article in the ironer as possible. The other part of the table cloth should extend over the open end of the roll. This extended part should be ironed before the second fold lengthwise is made.\n\nEmbroidered Doilies\n\n4. Embroidered Circular Doilies, when put through the first time, are ironed from the centre with the embroidered side up. The second time through, the embroidered side should be turned towards the roll. This presses the embroidery into the pad and makes the design on the doily stand out.\n\nServiettes\n\n5. Feed these into the ironer with the hemmed edge first and with the inside facing the shoe. When the article comes off the roll, take the end that is ironed last and start it through again first giving it a quarter turn. Several serviettes may be folded and ironed together. This saves a great deal of time.\n\nPajama Pants\n\n6. Iron each leg of pajama pants separately from the bottom up. Then fold the legs together and iron from bottom to top.

(RG 10, Volume 6428, file 875-5, part 5)\nHow to Iron Dresses, Bloomers,\n\n1. When ironing children's dresses, slip the skirt over the roll with the waist band of the dress at the open end. Fold the sleeve of the dress and iron all the way round.\n\n2. Iron one sleeve of the dress at a time. Place the sleeve flat on the roll and iron from the cuff to the armpit.\n\n3. Iron the yoke of the dress next. Continue to iron over the shoulder and across the yoke to the other sleeve.\n\n4. The collar is ironed by placing it around the open end of the roll and allowing it to take its own shape.\n\n5. Slip the dress over the open end of the roll. Place the pressing lever in the \"Press\" position. Set the pleat and turn the roll forward. Apply the pressure and allow the shoe to press for a few seconds, then release the pressure lever.\n\n6. When ironing under-bloomers which have the elastic band at the waist and on the legs, iron the top portion of the bloomers first from one side to the other as shown in illustration No. 6.\n\n7. Iron across the legs of bloomers, letting the top portion extend over the open end of the roll. Be careful to stretch the elastic so that the gathers will be ironed out in both legs and waist.\nSmocks, Collars, Press Ties, Trousers\n\n1. Smock Being Ironed\n\nSmocks or Hoover Aprons\n1. Smocks or Hoover Aprons are ironed in a similar way to a man's shirt as illustrated and described on pages 4 and 5.\n\nDetachable Collars\n2. Soft, detachable collars are ironed by placing a number of them on the roll while the pressure is being applied. Then fold them in the centre and iron the right side up. This gives them a natural shape. If collars are to be starched use cold starch and only a small quantity.\n\nWhen small articles like collars are being ironed, their position on the shoe should be varied so as to keep the heat in the shoe evenly distributed across its whole length.\n\nPressing Ties\n3. Ties are pressed by placing a damp cloth over the shoe and pressing them. Then iron them with the inside facing shoe.\n\nPressing Trousers\n4. Press each trouser leg separately on both sides. To do this, turn the Shoe Release Lever so that the shoe is thrown right back from the roll. Place a dampened cloth over the shoe so as to completely cover it. Then turn the Pressing Lever to the \"Press\" position. Put the shoe release into place and the Beatty will automatically apply the necessary pressure. Allow to steam, and press for a few seconds, and then release in the same manner.\n\nWhen both legs have been pressed separately, fold them together, and place in ironer as shown in illustration No. 4.\n\nSteaming Velvet\n5. To Steam Velvet, turn the hot shoe, so that it faces upward in a horizontal position. Place a wet towel on the shoe and draw the velvet back and forth over the steaming towel.\n\n7. Press a switch on the Beatty and the Ironer does all the hard work\n\nPage Seven\nDirections for Set-up, Operation and Care of the Beatty Ironer\n\nInstalling the Ironer\nIf the Ironer is delivered to you crated, remove the crate carefully so as not to scratch the ironer. Also remove the paper covering the roll. Attach castor brackets with screws and lock washers to be found in a small box under the castors under the ironer. The heat of the ironer may be adjusted to suit the individual by raising or lowering the castor brackets. Thumb screws are provided to keep the castors from turning too freely. Insert the castors and plug into a convenient wall plug.\n\nHeat Control\nThe heat switch which controls the heat of the shoe is on the name plate at the right. When the heat is on, the pilot light just above the switch will show red. The switch for starting the motor is also on this plate.\n\nFinger Touch Control\nThe finger touch lever controls the shoe and roll. Press gently, then release and the shoe will come up to the roll and the roll will turn. Press again and the shoe leaves the roll and the roll stops. If you hold it down the shoe will come up to the roll and move back again, continuing this forward and backward movement till the finger is removed.\n\nKnee Control\nThe knee control lever is on the left beneath the base. Pressing the lever gently with the knee and releasing it has exactly the same effect as the finger control. It is more convenient as it leaves both hands free to feed in and smooth out articles being ironed.\n\nPressing Control\nThe pressing control lever is on top at the right. When turned to \"PRESS\" the shoe is brought up to the roll without the roll turning. In this position it can be used for pressing trousers, pleats, embroidery, etc.\n\nFor raised work, initials, etc., it is not necessary to release the shoe to press\u2014simply turn the lever to the \"PRESS\" position, hold for the time required to press, then turn back to \"IRON\" position and roll will turn. Turn this lever to \"IRON\" for ordinary ironing.\n\nEmergency Control\nThe emergency control lever is at the right and behind the shoe. If, for any reason, the roll stops turning when ironing, push the emergency lever back away from the roll. This will move the shoe away from the roll and prevent scorching.\n\nTo continue ironing, pull the lever back to its original position.\n\nTry operating all controls before starting to iron the first time.\n\nHeating the Shoe\nTo protect it previous to installing, the element is given a coating of gum. This is burned off when heat is applied, causing a slight odor which will gradually disappear. The shoe requires about 7 minutes to heat sufficiently for ironing. Test the shoe as you would a hand iron, by touching it with a moist finger. If it sizzles it is hot enough to iron.\n\nIf the shoe is not heating fast enough or not retaining its heat for continuous ironing, have your electrician check your voltage.\n\nTo prevent any part of the shoe from overheating when ironing small pieces, use first one end of the roll and then the other.\n\nFor silks and rayons, the shoe should be cooled.\n\nWhen ironing is finished, before turning off the motor, make sure the shoe is clear of the roll by releasing the emergency lever. This will prevent scorching the roll cover.\n\nCover and End Tray\nThe cover may either be hinged back or lifted right off. For some operations, such as steaming velvet, it is better to lift the cover off. Before closing the cover, place the emergency lever in the \"OFF\" position and then turn it over behind the shoe.\n\nTo use the clothes tray raise it and push in. To lower the tray pull it out and drop it.\n\nOiling\nSome machines are shipped without oil. A red tag tied to the \"PRESS IRON\" control lever will tell what to do in this case.\n\nThere are three oil holes requiring two or three drops of oil once a month. One is a cup at the back of the mechanism case; the other two are at either end of the motor.\n\nGeneral Suggestions\nStart first on simple, flat pieces and, as you become more proficient, do the more difficult pieces such as men's shirts, etc.\n\nAvoid, as far as possible, allowing buttons and hooks to come into contact with the shoe. Turn them towards the roll or cover them with a piece of cloth.\n\nIf you have never used an ironer before, follow the methods illustrated in the preceding pages. As you become expert you may find another way that you prefer. Don't become discouraged with your first attempts. The more you use the ironer, the more proficient you will become.\nSit Down to Iron\nWith the\nBeatty Bros. Limited\nAutomatic Ironer\nSit Down to Iron\n\nWith the Beatty, you are comfortably seated. All you have to do is place the clothes over the well-padded roll and watch them come out beautifully and perfectly ironed. Both your hands are free to handle the garment that is being ironed. The Beatty ironer is operated by a knee or finger-touch control. With a Beatty you have no weight to lift\u2014no pressure to exert\u2014no discomfort from heat\u2014no tired arms, sore feet, or aching back. The Beatty does all the hard work.\n\nBanish Washday's Last Burden\n\nSolve washday's last problem with a Beatty automatic ironer. The Beatty will iron your clothes in less than a third the time it usually takes to do them by hand, and will give them a professional finish that will delight you. It will save you many weary hours of lifting, pulling and pushing a hot heavy hand iron, and give you extra time for leisure.\n\nPays for itself\n\nThe Beatty pays for itself by saving valuable time. You can iron your clothes exactly as you wish, and be sure that they will pass the discriminating inspection of your most critical friends. If you have been accustomed to sending your clothes out to be ironed, you will find that the Beatty will pay for itself in a few months by saving the cost of this outside help.\n\nModel A\nBEATTY AUTOMATIC IRONER\nFig. No. 615\nCast-Well Paste\nNet Weight 160 lbs.\nHydro Approval No. 3384\nIron With Ease and Comfort\n\nThe very first time you sit down to iron with the Beatty, you will be amazed at the speed at which flat work\u2014towels, sheets, pillow cases, table cloths, etc., can be done. These articles constitute 85 per cent. of the ironing.\n\nIrons Everything Perfectly\n\nOur booklet of instructions, supplied with every ironer, tells you how to handle the more difficult pieces. A little time spent in learning how to iron hems, facings, collars, turn-ups, frills, lingerie, etc., will pay you well, for it will be no time before you can iron the most intricate pieces with perfect ease and comfort.\n\nControls are Conveniently Placed\n\nNo ironer is so easy to operate as the Beatty. It is completely automatic, has finger touch and knee control, saves you from all effort, and does the work better than it could possibly be done in any other way. Finger touch control, power and heat switches, and the pressing lever, are all grouped conveniently at the right. No need to stoop or reach. The handy knee control is easy to operate.\n\nBoth Hands are Left Free\n\nBy using the knee control to operate the shoe and the roll, both hands are left free to guide the clothes. This feature speeds up the work and saves considerable time. You can stop the roll and release the shoe instantly by a touch of the knee control if you wish to smooth out a garment.\n\nHandy Control\n\nThe illustration on the right shows the Duo-Batch Control and the Red Signal Light which tells the operator that the heat is on. One switch is for power, the other for heat. The conveniently placed lever control\u2014the handy still pressing lever and shoe release are also shown on these pages.\n\nConvenient and Handy to Use\n\nThe Beatty ironer is designed to give the user maximum convenience and comfort. It is just the right height, has no obstructions under the stand, and allows you to sit with ease in a natural position. The Beatty is compact. It will fit easily into a narrow doorway easily. The hot shoe can be thrown clear by the hand release, when you are through ironing, or when the power goes off.\n\nFor easy ironing use a Beatty. No complicated routine to learn, no difficult mechanism to master. Everything is plain and simple, fully automatic and quiet.\n\nIron\u2014Press\u2014Steam\n\nWith the Beatty you can iron or press. Just turn the lever on top of the ironer mechanism, and the ironer becomes a presser. By turning back the shoe to the limit, it can be used to steam velvet. When ironing, a strong spring keeps the shoe at constant pressure, whether a handkerchief or a thick article is being ironed.\n\nIrons the Clothes Perfectly Dry\n\nThe Beatty shoe heats quickly, even clothing thick or folded articles. Release the shoe so that it is away from the roll, then place the material to be ironed on the roll. Then rotate the roll until the material comes under the shoe. Now touch the knee control and proceed to iron.\n\nThe Beatty Shoe Heats Quickly\n\nThe Beatty ironer shoe heats in seven minutes, and requires no special wiring. Just plug into any convenience-outlet. With the Beatty it is not necessary to dampen the clothes as much as with a hand iron, and a much weaker starch solution is used for best results.\n\nFull Open-End Roll on the Beatty\n\nThe Beatty corner has a full open-end roll. This feature gives added speed and convenience, for it is on this open end that all ironing apart from flat work, is done\u2014suits, coats, dresses, aprons, curtains, etc., are placed on the open end. The knee control, shown here, allows you to use both hands to guide the clothes.\n\nThe Beatty Used as a Presser\n\nAt the left we see a Beatty being used for pressing. The pressing lever is thrown on so that the roll is stationary while the pressing is being done. The clothes are placed on the roll, heated moderately with a damp cloth, then the shoe is brought down and kept in place until the crease is made. A pair of trousers takes but a few minutes to press with the Beatty.\nDoes Faster and Better Work\n\nHas Better Application of Heat and Pressure\n\nEvery ironer, no less busy and efficient, must apply plenty of heat and pressure to give the clothes a crisp, smooth finish. Ironers who do this get greater pressure and greater results. That is why the Beatty ironer faster and gives the clothes a firm, glossy finish that keeps them cleaner for a longer time.\n\nThe Beatty Shoe is of Special Design\n\nThe real value of an ironer is in its shoe. For it is the shoe that imparts the uniform pressure and uniform heat that are so necessary to give the clothes a smooth finish. Women prefer the Beatty ironer because its shoe applies heat and pressure more evenly than any other shoe. It has great heat volume, and will iron large bed sheets and table cloths without noticeably cooling off. The Beatty shoe is specially designed to give the shoe body much heavier pressure than the main body of the shoe. This extra pressure applied to the cloth at the last instant gives that extra polish that is so desirable.\n\nIrons Everything Beautifully\n\nDressmaking enthusiasts are delighted with the fine work the Beatty produces. Baby's clothes are ironed beautifully. They come from the ironer crisp in texture and dainty in appearance. Silk lingerie looks as though it had been done by a professional. Even delicate curtains, which are usually so difficult to iron by hand are a simple matter once you have become adept at ironing. Even the most difficult of household articles, hitherto well nigh impossible to iron, can be pressed and ironed by the Beatty without the least effort.\n\nSpecial Safety Feature\n\nWhen the Beatty does the ironing there is no danger or scorching the clothes, for the special design of the Beatty includes a safety feature, which eliminates this possibility. The pad rolls continuously around the shoe before the shoe comes in contact with the garment to be ironed. The roll continues to rotate until after the shoe leaves again. Thus, when the shoe is in contact with the article to be ironed and the shoe, the roll is in motion, and consequently the clothes cannot be scorched.\n\nHeavy Pressure Gives a Fine Finish\n\nTo the right is pictured an end-on view of the Beatty roll and shoe. It shows how, when a garment is being ironed, the maximum pressure is exerted at the lower lip of the shoe to give an extra smooth finish. This exclusive Beatty feature gives damask linen a beauty and sheen that is unequalled by any other ironer.\n\nIron Men's Shirts Perfectly\n\nThe Beatty ironer with full open-end roll, does a perfect job on men's shirts. Cuffs, sleeves, shoulders and fronts, can be ironed to perfection, and in less than a third the time required to do the work by hand. When you have a Beatty, hubby can wear a freshly ironed shirt every morning.\n\nGreatest Ironer Value Ever Known\n\nThe Beatty Ironer is Built for Speed\n\nThe Beatty ironer acts quickly. It has lightning response. At the touch of the operator's finger, the shoe releases instantly from the roll, so the clothes may be adjusted. The chromium plated shoe heats in seven minutes and requires only two-thirds the time and space needed for its extra size and weight. The area of the Beatty shoe is half that of equivalent shoes. This is nearly ten times the size of an ordinary hand iron.\n\nGives the Clothes a Professional Finish\n\nBy the perfect application of uniform pressure, and even heat, the Beatty ironer gives the clothes a natural finish that is the equal of that given by the experts. The heavy shoe of the Beatty drives the material being ironed, toward the center of the roll, where it is subjected to the final heavy pressure that perfectly completes the operation. A powerful spring keeps the shoe against the roll, and prevents the shoe from slipping thus ensuring perfect ironing for both thick and thin articles.\n\nHandy Detachable Clothes Rack\n\nThe Beatty is equipped with handy detachable clothes rack, which is permanently mounted within easy reach on right front of ironer. Saves the operator the bother of carrying clothes back and forth while ironing is going on. The rack is supplied with bracket with which it can be fastened on the wall and used between ironing days. A handy shelf is also supplied to fasten on the left end of ironer. See page 36.\n\nThe Beatty is Economical to Operate\n\nWhen you use a Beatty you always iron from the flat position. You never have to \"tip\" the ironer. As you have become adept in using it, the more intricate articles can be ironed. With the Beatty, power consumption is a small item. The Beatty is so efficient that the same amount makes the Beatty method the most economical way in the world to iron. The Beatty roll irons clothes in a third the usual time, and with but a fraction of the effort, and at the same time obtain work that is much more beautiful.\n\nThe Beatty Roll is Well Made\n\nThe full, open-end roll of the new Beatty ironer is 26 working inches long, revolves at 61 revolutions per minute. With this roll, it will iron clothes 48 in. wide and 11 feet long in one minute. The roll itself is well padded, so as to form a smooth, firm and resilient surface to which the clothes are not injured by the Beatty. The roll itself is not heated. All drying is done by the shoe.\n\nAmple Space Between Roll and Base\n\nThe wide space between the roll and the stand allows plenty of room for clothes to fold when they come off the roll. This prevents them from bunching up. The wide base of the Beatty curves around the roll and delivers the clothes to the front of the stand, where it is convenient to receive them.\n\nAmple Space Between Roll and Shoe\n\nThe picture to the left shows the shoe thrown back from the roll, with clothes released. There is ample space for adjusting thick, cumbersome articles on the roll before starting to iron. Once the ironing has been done, the shoe is brought back into position, and the ironing can begin.\nThe Beatty Has Great Mechanical Perfection\n\nOne of the outstanding features of the Beatty ironer is its mechanical perfection. It is simple and compact in construction, yet combines strength and durability.\n\nThe main shaft on the worm gear is taken by high-grade ball bearings. An idler gear which clutches the worm gear is supported by all parts of the mechanism assembly by a system of roller bearings. The entire mechanism is \"roller flooded\" to eliminate vibration, and is attached completely to the cast-iron stand.\n\nBuilt to Give Years of Service\n\nThe continuous and satisfactory operation of an ironer depends on the selection of power that will last for years. The Beatty has a splined shaft that will last for years. It has been tested under heavy loads and will do work, and will give unsurpassed performance over a long period of time. The use of rust-proof steel to withstand the effect of steam and water will assure you many years of roll. This combination gives a lifetime self-oiling roll.\n\nFrame Made from Heavy Pressed Steel\n\nThe Beatty stand is pressed from a solid piece of steel and the legs, which support the top panel, are secured directly to the stand; the whole supporting frame forms a strong and rigid base carrying the mechanism which supports the ironing mechanisms and roll. There are no screws between the stand and the top panel where they are out of the way. Ample room is provided for the roll and the wringer in a readily position. Free-running, wide faced casters make the stand easy to move when necessary.\n\nGives Perfect Satisfaction\n\nThe high standard of mechanical excellence to which the Beatty has been built, makes the frame so strong that you can do beautiful work quickly and easily, and will save you both time and effort. The Beatty will stand up under hard usage and give satisfactory service for a lifetime.\n\nBeatty Wringer Post Ironer\u2014Fig. 678\n\nMay be used with any Beatty Electric Washer of the Agitator Type. By using a Wringer Post Ironer you can have a complete washing and ironing outfit all in one. The ironer operates from the wringer shaft. Simply lift the wringer off, attach the ironer and operate the electric motor. The heat of the ironer is sufficient to turn the roll. The ironer has its own heating element, heat switch, light switch and pressure lever.\n\nSpecifications\u2014Length of roll 25\u00bd\". Roll is well padded. Shoe is chrome-plated. Heating element is 1150 watts. Shoe exerts 100 lbs. pressure. Irons 9 ft. per minute.\n\nBecause of its greater heat and pressure and larger ironing surface, this Wringer Post Ironer is easier and better work than the hand method. Best of all, it eliminates the hard drudgery of pushing, pulling and lifting a hot, heavy hand iron.\nHow to Iron Bed Sheets, Pillow Cases, Pajamas, Aprons, Curtains, Bloomers\n\nSheets\n1. Sheets that are wider than twice the width of the Beauty roll should be folded in two first, then passed through the ironer twice, and folded to put away.\n\nPillow Cases\n2. Pillow Cases are ironed from the closed end to the open end. If embroidered, the pillow case should be turned right side up the first time through. There is no need to release the shoe when thin flat pieces like pillow cases are being ironed. These thin articles lie flat on the roll, and the open throat of the Beauty shoe permits them to feed into the shoe without wrinkling.\n\nTable Cloths\n3. Table Cloths should be folded once when operating at the operator's right and with as much of the article in the shoe as possible. The other part of the table cloth should extend over the open end of the roll. This extended part should be ironed before the second fold lengthwise is made.\n\nEmbroidered Doilies\n4. Embroidered Circular Doilies, when put through the first time, are ironed from the center with the embroidery facing down and turn through; the embroidered side should be turned towards the roll. This presses the embroidery into the pad and makes the design on the doily stand out.\n\nServiettes\n5. Feed these into the ironer with the napkin edge flat and with the inside facing the shoe. When the article comes off the roll, take the end that is ironed last and start it through again first giving it a quarter turn. Several serviettes may be folded and ironed together. This saves a great deal of time.\n\nPajama Pants\n6. Iron each leg of pajama pants separately from the bottom up. Then fold the legs together and iron from bottom to top. Pajama coats are ironed the same way as men's shirts. See pages 4 and 5.\n\n7. You can bid goodbye to that tiresome, tedious method of ironing with a hand iron once you have the Beauty to do all the hard work.\n\nTowels\n1. Bath Towels, Tea Towels and Hand Towels are ironed after being folded once. They can be put through two at a time as shown in Illustration No. 1.\n\nApron Strings\n2. Apron Strings are the first part of the apron to iron on the Beauty, as shown in Illustration No. 2. Apron strings are ironed together up to the point where they are attached to the apron.\n\nAprons\n3. After the apron strings are ironed, place the apron over the roll and iron from bottom to top, allowing a part of the apron to extend over the open end of the roll. Fold the bottom of the garment on the arm to keep apron off the floor. Then iron the extended part from the bottom up.\n\nCurtain Ruffles\n4. Iron the ruffles by drawing the ruffled edge around the open end of the roll. This shapes the ruffle without creasing.\n\nCurtains\n5. When ironing body of curtains, allow the ruffled edge to extend out over the end of the ironer roll as shown in Illustration No. 3. Iron the ruffle first, then the body.\n\nBloomers With Elastic Band Waist\n6. Slip the garment over the roll and iron the top portion all the way around. Remove the bloomers and place each band separately on the roll and iron all the way around.\n\n7. No. 7 illustration shows the simple controls on the Beauty Ironer, each one being conveniently placed to save time, labour and footsteps, and to enable you to sit down and iron in comfort.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is supplied with a bracket for wall mounting or may be used to make a towel rack in kitchen or bathroom as shown below.\nDress\n\n1. When ironing children's dresses, slip the skirt over the roll with the waist band of the dress at the open end. Fold the sleeve of the dress and iron all the way round.\n\nSleeves\n\n2. Iron one sleeve of the dress at a time. Place the sleeve flat on the roll and iron from the cuff to the arm pit.\n\nYoke\n\n3. Iron the yoke of the dress next. Continue to iron over the shoulder and across the yoke to the other sleeve.\n\nCollar\n\n4. The collar is ironed by placing it around the open end of the roll and allowing it to take its own shape.\n\nPlacing Pleats\n\n5. Slip the dress over the open end of the roll. Place the pressing lever in the \"Press\" position. Set the pleat and turn the roll forward. Apply the pressure and allow the shoe to press for a few seconds, then release the pressure lever.\n\nChildren's Bloomers\n\n6. When ironing under-bloomers which have the elastic band at the waist and on the legs, iron the top portion of the bloomers first from one side to the other as shown in illustration No. 6.\n\nBloomer Legs\n\n7. Iron across the legs of bloomers, letting the top portion extend over the open end of the roll. Be careful to stretch the elastic so that the gathers will be ironed out in both legs and waist.\n\nSmocks or Hoover Aprons\n\n1. Smocks or Hoover Aprons are ironed in a similar way to a man's shirt as illustrated and described on pages 4 and 5.\n\nDetachable Collars\n\n2. Soft, detachable collars are ironed by placing a number of them on the roll while the pressure is being applied. Then fold them in the centre and iron the right side up. This gives them a natural shape. If collars are to be starched use cold starch and only a small amount.\n\nWhen small articles like collars are being ironed, their position on the shoe should be varied so as to keep the heat in the shoe evenly distributed across its whole length.\n\nPressing Ties\n\n3. Ties are pressed by placing a damp cloth over the shoe and pressing them. Then iron them with the inside facing shoe.\n\nPressing Trousers\n\n4. Press each trouser leg separately on both sides. To do this, turn the Shoe Release Lever so that the shoe is thrown right back on the roll. Place a dampened cloth over the shoe so as to cover it completely. Then turn the Pressing Lever to the \"Press\" position. Put the shoe release into place and the Beauty will automatically apply the necessary pressure. Allow to steam, and press for a few seconds, and then release the pressure lever.\n\nWhen both legs have been pressed separately, fold them together and place in ironer as shown in Illustration No. 4.\n\nSteaming Velvet\n\n5. To Steam Velvet, turn the hot shoe, so that it faces upward in a horizontal position. Place a wet towel on the shoe and draw the velvet back and forth over the steaming towel.\n\n6.

Further, it will be necessary to know what power will operate this machine and whether it will be by alternating or direct current.

The Acting Indian Agent will be requested to interview the Principal and supply the Department with the information required.\n\nI may add that the Department is also requesting similar information regarding an ironer for the Chapleau Indian Residential School, as it has been decided to give favourable consideration to this request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

Writing on the 18th ultimo, he states, in part, as follows:\n\n\"It is quite imperative that something be done to ease the present situation....... we simply cannot go on another year with a repetition of hand ironing. It seems strange to me that schools not half the size of this are equipped with steam ironers, and here everything is done by hand.\"\n\nIn another part of his letter he mentions that at the Sardis School, one of the Beatty Model \"A\" ironers is being used with good success, and he has forwarded to our Commission the enclosed letter from Beatty Brothers Ltd., of North Vancouver, B.C.\n\nAs a similar need for an ironer of the type mentioned in the enclosed letter exists at our Old Sun School and also at our Chapleau School, I have been instructed by our Commission to earnestly request your Department to provide the relief which the installation of this type of equipment at each of these Schools would afford. It is my understanding that when the Deputy Superintendent General called here on the 30th ultimo, he referred to the need which he himself had observed in this connexion during his recent visit to our Chapleau School, and that he left instructions for the Principal to lay this matter before you. Our Commission will be deeply obliged if you will give this question the prompt and sympathetic consideration which it undoubtedly deserves.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/KH\nTHE BEATTY WASHER STORE\n\n91 Lonsdale Ave.,\nNorth Vancouver, B.C.\n\nJuly 16th, 1936.\n\nF.

The heating element of the machine will work quite satisfactorily on AC or DC current.\n\nThe Price of the Ironer is $149.50 at $10.00 deposit and $7.00 per month or $136.50 Cash, the latter covering ninety days, or a little longer if necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBeatty Bros.

Webb, District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau at Vancouver, the firm which supplied the material undertook to supply further material and directions with a view to a more satisfactory result. Under these circumstances, it is recommended that if the Department is to supply the cost of the proposed work, Mr. Webb should be again consulted, it being noted that Agent Todd states that the \"Public Works Department\" is considering the situation at the School. I was not aware of this arrangement if made, and I have written to Mr. Todd to ask him if he did not intend to refer in his letter to the Hydrometric Bureau.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C.

This left a balance of $2920 for emergency expenditures which might be necessary throughout the year.\n\nIn Mr. Anfield's correspondence are requests for various items amounting to considerable sums of money, and for the Department's information I will deal with the items which in my opinion are necessary, and leave the other items for further comment should the Department decide to provide for them. I will number the items according to their number in Mr. Anfield's letter.\n\n(1) Repairs to the building generally, particularly the brick walls. As this is now receiving the consideration of the Public Works Department, I feel this should be left until their report and recommendations has been received.\n\n(3) New bull for the farm: The Principal is suggesting that the present bull, which has been in service for five years, should be exchanged for another one, and I would recommend that a trade might be arranged whereby the Department would only be called on to pay the transportation charges.\n\n(6) Hot water tank for boiler room: Mr. Anfield informs me the Boiler Inspector, Mr. T.J. Arnall on his recent inspection advised him the present tank should be replaced next year, and in view of this I would recommend that a new boiler be installed.\n\n(7) New hoods and stove pipe for main boiler: The Boiler Inspector and Mr. Anfield recommend that these be replaced, and in view of their condition I would recommend that these be purchased.\n(8) Cooling tanks for lighting engines: Also in view of Mr. Anfield's report in connection with the condition of these three cooking tanks for the lighting engine, I would recommend that they be replaced.\n\n(10) Heating furnace for Classroom Block: It is noted the Boiler Inspector states the heating furnace in the Classroom Block is in very poor shape and must be replaced within the next two years, and I would recommend that this work be undertaken.\n\nIt will be noted several of these items are recommended by the Boiler Inspector, and I am writing him for a further report on these particular points and will forward his recommendations to the Department at a later date, but in the meantime I would ask that these items listed above be included in the Estimates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.

This left a balance of $2920 for emergency expenditures which might be necessary throughout the year.\n\nIn Mr. Anfield's correspondence are requests for various items amounting to considerable sums of money, and for the Department's information I will deal with the items which in my opinion are necessary, and leave the other items for further comment should the Department decide to provide for them. I will number the items according to their number in Mr. Anfield's letter.\n\n(1) Repairs to the building generally, particularly the brick walls: As this is now receiving the consideration of the Public Works Department, I feel this should be left until their report and recommendations has been received.\n\n(3) New bull for the farm: The Principal is suggesting that the present bull, which has been in service for five years, should be exchanged for another one, and I would recommend that a trade might be arranged whereby the Department would only be called on to pay the transportation charges.\n\n(6) Hot water tank for boiler room: Mr. Anfield informs me the Boiler Inspector, Mr.T.J. Arnall on his recent inspection advised him the present tank should be replaced next year, and in view of this I would recommend that a new boiler be installed.\n\n(7) New hoods and stove pipe for main boiler: The Boiler Inspector and Mr. Anfield recommend that these be replaced, and in view of their condition I would recommend that these be purchased.\nCooling tanks for lighting engines: Also in view of Mr. Amfield's report in connection with the condition of these three cooking tanks for the lighting engine, I would recommend that they be replaced.\n\n(10) Heating furnace for Classroom Block: It is noted the Boiler Inspector states the heating furnace in the Classroom Block is in very poor shape and must be replaced within the next two years; and I would recommend that this work be undertaken.\n\nIt will be noted several of these items are recommended by the Boiler Inspector, and I am writing him for a further report on these particular points and will forward his recommendations to the Department at a later date, but in the meantime I would ask that these items listed above be included in the Estimates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n(M.S.

The boiler mentioned is still at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.

It is believed that the combination of both systems would offer too many risks as to the needs of the school, and too many complications and difficulties should any breakages or defects occur during the operation of the system.\n\nIt is therefore considered that a water supply system, if absolutely required for the village, would be more satisfactory to both parties if entirely separate from the school system.\n\nA copy of this letter is being sent to our Assistant Indian Commissioner, Mr. C.

We figure that this could be supplied by us at less cost.\n\nOur reason for writing this letter to you is that, in the first place we need the business, and in the second place we are satisfied that the Department can save money by purchasing its energy supply from us instead of operating the two plants.\n\nIf you will give us the necessary authority so that our representative can inspect the premises to ascertain the load now carried, with particulars of any increased service which may be required in the near future, we shall be very pleased to quote you figures on which we feel sure a contract could be based that would be satisfactory in that it would effect a saving for your Department.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs  \nFebruary 9th, 1937\n\nWe do not wish to even appear to be interfering in the business of the School, and do not think we are doing so, as we feel sure that the Department would be willing to let the School share in the saving which would be effected by the change.\n\nWill you kindly let us have a reply at your convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPACIFIC POWER & WATER COMPANY LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nWTH: JS\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nFebruary 2, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nWith reference to the report hereunder from Inspector Pragnell regarding the moisture penetrating the outside walls of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School during heavy rains, I may say that the same condition existed at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School in Nova Scotia.\n\nYou will remember that I made a careful investigation last year to find a remedy and I found that the Canadian National Railways had experienced the same difficulty with their buildings in similar locations.\n\nThe Shubenacadie Indian Residential School has been waterproofed by the Western Waterproofing Co., and the results appear so far to have been satisfactory.

There were 203 children in the school at the time of my visit. I am sorry to say, however, that the whole school had been down with mumps. Five children had had septic pneumonia, but the administration should receive full credit for the fact that they had pulled them all through safely. I found everything in very satisfactory order, clean and tidy, and all fire apparatus in good order, children looking well despite the mumps, and the food good and sufficient. They had plenty of milk. There are 11 cows milking. A lot more clearing of land has been done and is in progress, barns, outhouses, and the land and gardens all in good order, and sanitary. I was very pleased with my inspection, and both the Agent, Mr. Todd and the Principal, Mr. Anfield, are cooperating well together.\n\nThe matter of the leaking north side wall of the main building was discussed. I personally believe, and am speaking from personal experience in my old home close to the sea, that tarring is the only solution. It is ugly, but effective and cheap, and perhaps, nowadays there may be some method of colouring the tar, or painting it afterwards.\n\nGeo. S. Fragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, January 21, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant, the Department regrets that, at the present time, there are no funds available to purchase the plow requested by the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Oliver Big Base Plows excel in the quality of their plowing\u2014in their ability to bury deep trash, weed seeds, insect eggs in the ease and range of their adjustment through the Oliver Ball-Bearing Screw Control\u2014a patented feature\u2014in the correctness of their line of draft through the Oliver Dial hitch\u2014in their light draft when plowing at full depth.\n\nThe basis of Big Base Plowing is different. It lifts the earth and truly revolves it through a complete circle, burying all trash deeply, crumbling and pulverizing the soil so that it is in the best possible shape for the growing of a new crop.\n\nThe Oliver Big Base will bury completely the heaviest cover crops of sweet clover, cornstalks, or combine stubble. It is all in the big bases\u2014their design\u2014the width and the shape of the moldboard.\n\nThe Furrow Slice Starting on Its Upward Path, Is Lifted, Not Pushed, Up the Moldboard\n\nThe Furrow Slice, As It Moves Farther Up the Moldboard, Folds in the Surface Trash\nMounting the Big Bases\n\nAt every point in their construction, the Oliver Big Base Plows are just as modern as the Big Base itself. The frame and beams are heavy flat-bar stock, heat-treated for added strength. At every point, the frame is rigidly braced so that the Big Bases are always kept in correct alignment. The axles are forged from steel and heat-treated for strength. The Oliver Big Base Plows are built to do wonderful work when they leave the Oliver plant and to keep on doing it for many, many years.\n\nThe Oliver Ball-Bearing Depth Adjustment Screw\n\nYou find it only on Oliver Plows, because it was invented by Oliver and is patented.\n\nThese Oliver Tractor Plows have the exclusive Oliver Ball-Bearing Depth Adjustment Screw Control. With it, the plowing depth can be adjusted, while the plow is in motion, with less effort than it takes to turn a grindstone.\n\nDepth is instantly adjustable to meet changing conditions of soil or slope. You can plow a furrow from one end to the other, in any field, to absolutely uniform depth, whether the tractor is going up or down, or running around a side hill.\n\nA quick-acting power lift raises the Big Bases for you at the end of the furrow.\n\nTheir Clearance\n\nAnother feature of the Big Base and Rake Plows is the rake and clearance built into them. The beams, naturally being placed far apart, automatically give these plows greater rake\u2014but there is also built into them greater clearance below the frame. There is almost no place for trash to catch, and this, coupled with the fact that the Oliver Big Base Plows are the greatest plows ever built for turning trash under, means that almost never will it be necessary to stop the plowing because of trash accumulation.\n\nFinal Folding-in of the Trash. The Soil Is Up and Pulverizing\n\nAfter the Big Base Plow Has Passed. The Trash Is Completely Buried Under a Full Depth Layer of Well-Pulverized Soil\n\nThe Top View of the 218, Showing the Clearance and Rake, the Heavy Axles Bridging Clear Across the Frame, and the Correct Line of Draft Through the Oliver Dial Hitch\nLight of Draft and in Correct Line of Draft with Any Tractor\n\nThe Oliver Big Base Plows, because of the lifting and turning action of the bases and the minimum weight of the high strength, flat-bar frame, are naturally light of draft. But perhaps even more important in light draft is the Oliver hitch.\n\nThe hitch goes right back to the center of the frame. A flat bar of heavy stock joins the side members of the frame, and to this, the hitch is attached. The tractor is pulling right back to the first base, about at the wheel line.\n\nThe hitch is also hinged so that the plow will follow the contour of the ground and plow to even depth.\n\nChilled or Steel\u2014The Oliver Big Base Plows are made in the 218-AXX and the Row Crop 218-AXX 2-base plows and the 318\u2014a 3-base plow\u2014both have a wide variety of share and moldboard equipment in steel or chilled shares.\n\nYou'll Want to See the Big Base strength of beams and frames, the greater Oliver clearance and the rake, the better Oliver line of hitch and base mounting that gives light draft, the Oliver Ball-Bearing Depth Adjustment Screw and the Big Bases will interest you for they give better plowing, more economical fuel consumption, longer life, lower plowing costs, and a lower cost of producing crops.\n\nA Rear View of the 318, Showing the Flat-Bar Steel Beams and Frame\u2014Heat-Treated for Strength, that Keep the Big Bases in Correct Alignment\nOttawa, February 17, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed is a copy of a letter received from the Pacific Power & Water Company Limited, also a copy of our reply.\n\nAs a matter of fact, any arrangements made with the company should be made by the school authorities, as they are responsible for the cost of the electrical energy used in Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nHowever, you might let me have a report regarding the condition of the electric plant in the school and, at the same time, you should let me know if the Pacific Power & Water Company is developing sufficient electrical energy at the present time to supply the needs of the Alert Bay School. In the event of electricity being secured from this company, would it be necessary to re-wire the school? Could the company guarantee that electrical energy would be available at all times? Any further information that you can secure should also be furnished.\n\nYou will note the last paragraph of our letter to the company and, in any interview that you may have with their representative, you should point out to him that present inquiries are simply to obtain information and the Department does not commit itself in any manner whatsoever.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

It should be understood that, insofar as the school is concerned, the school authorities would be responsible for the cost of the electrical energy they would use.\n\nThe Department is unable to commit itself in any manner regarding the request of the company until we are definitely advised regarding the expenditure that would be necessary in any extra wiring required for both the school and the Agent's office and the cost involved in supplying the electrical energy.

(RC 1C, Volume 6428, file 875-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, May 21, 1937.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Mr. Neill:\n\nI have to refer to correspondence regarding the supplying of electricity to the school and agency buildings at Alert Bay. I am now in receipt of reports from various officials in regard to the matter. From reports received, in neither case would it appear to be in the interests of administration to substitute the Pacific Power and Water Company's power for that supplied by the plant now installed.\n\nWith regard to the agency, the architect, commenting on the report received from the Indian Agent, observes that if, as is expected, the present delco plant operates for another six years the monthly cost would be considerably less than with the Pacific Power Company's power. If it should only be possible to operate the present plant for another two years without replacement the monthly cost would still be less than installing the Company's power. It is, therefore, considered advisable to operate the delco plant until further capital expenditure is required when the question of installing the Company's power might be further considered.\n\nSo far as the school is concerned, according to figures submitted by the Principal, the cost of operating the present school plant is very much lower than that suggested by the Power Company for supplying electrical current. The Superintendent of Welfare & Training reports that in view of the information contained in letters from the Indian Agent and the Principal of the school, he does not consider it advisable to accept the Company's offer to supply electrical energy. I concur with Mr. Hoey in the opinion expressed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. W. Neill, Esq., M. P.,\nAlberni, B.

P., addressed to Mr. Jackson regarding the supplying of electricity to the school and agency buildings at Alert Bay, I have to say that I am now in receipt of reports from various officials in regard to the matter. From reports received, in neither case would it appear to be in the interests of administration to substitute the Pacific Power and Water Company's power for that supplied by the plant now installed.\n\nWith regard to the agency, the architect, commenting on the report received from the Indian agent, observes that if, as is expected, the present delco plant operates for another six years the monthly cost would be considerably less than with the Pacific Power Company's power.

McGUIII,\n\nWith reference to the offer of the Pacific Water Power and Electric Company, to supply electrical energy for the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, I wish to direct your attention to the letter written by Mr. Anfield, Principal of the Alert Bay School and forwarded to the Department by Agent Todd.\n\nIn view of the information contained in the two letters mentioned above, I do not consider it advisable to accept the Company's offer to supply electrical energy to the Alert Bay School.\nSir,\n\nUnder date of February 17th last, letter No.156-0-5, the Department wrote me enclosing copy of a letter received from the Pacific Power & Water Company Ltd., 675 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, together with their reply to the above company. As requested in the Department's letter, I have obtained the required information and respectfully submit same for the Department's information.\n\nIn regard to the Residential School, I enclose herewith copy of Mr. Anfield's report in connection with the electric plant now used at the Residential School, which will be self-explanatory.\n\nThe Department will please note in the comparison of costs, that at the present time in using the school plant the average cost per month does not exceed $54.25, whereas the local power company suggest that their cost of supplying electrical energy would be somewhat less than $130.00 which they estimate as the cost of operating the school under its own plant.\n\nIt is also noted in Mr. Anfield's figures he has made no allowance for depreciation and has provided for only actual operating costs. It is also noted he estimates the life of our present plant at ten years and that it has been in service at the present time for eight years. These are points which I feel should be taken into consideration in arriving at a decision in respect to the equipment and the possibility of making a change.\n\nIn regard to the Agency delco light plant, I enclose herewith an estimate of what it would cost to re-wire the Agency building in order to make it safe for using power other than the delco plant. I am inclined to feel the estimated cost as submitted by the Pacific Power & Water Company is too high, and that if I were given authority to arrange to have the work done myself and also be able to buy the materials wholesale, this cost could be reduced considerably, and would be pleased to undertake the work if the Department approved of dealing with it in that way.\n\nI enclose also a letter received from the Company as to the cost of lighting the Agency, submitting the rates which sets out the approximate average monthly consumption and cost. My own opinion in this respect would be that our light bill would not be much higher than it is at the present time when we take into consideration that the delco plant is at the point where considerable money must be spent on it if we are to continue using it. It will require a new set of batteries and a complete overhaul, which I would not recommend when we have city lights now available. I feel the Department should encourage local endeavour wherever possible, all things being equal.\nI would therefore recommend, as far as the Agency is concerned, that the Department arrange to take the Pacific Power & Water Company lights, and authorize me to arrange for the rewiring of the Agency buildings, which I feel can be done cheaper than the price quoted in their estimate.\n\nIn connection with the Residential School, I would recommend that no change be made there at present, as it appears the equipment is in good shape and should require no replacements for a further period of two years, unless the Pacific Power & Water Company can compensate the school by supplying electrical energy at a cost not to exceed the school's cost of their own plant at the present time. I would also recommend that if this cannot be arranged, the matter be left as it is until it is found necessary for further capital expenditure in connection with the plant, at which time the matter can be gone into again.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nThe Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of March 5th in connection with the lighting plant in the School, I have to advise as follows:\n\n**Plant Engine No. 1** - 6\u00bd H.P. Lister. Condition fair. Piston is sloppy, but it should be remembered that this engine has its original cylinder, pistons and bearings.\n\n**Plant Engine No. 2** - \u00bc H.P. Lister. Condition good. New cylinders and valves were installed on this engine two years ago. Original bearings and pistons in both cylinders.\n\n**Switchboard** - First class condition. All relays and cut-outs 100%, and both engines operate on automatic control through this board.\n\n**Batteries** - Coyle type, installed five years ago this coming Christmas. Present condition only fair. In our opinion they are the wrong type for an automatic plant, which places a tremendous drain on the batteries on starting. These batteries are splendid storage batteries, but are not heavy enough for starting work. This is their sole use here, as we only carry 300 watts on them before the relays kick in and the engines start.\n\n**Wiring** - All O. K., and would not require replacement for an A. C. circuit.\nThe Indian Agent.\n\nGeneral Efficiency of Plant - This plant is 100% efficient at the present time and has never once failed us in the eight years of its installation. Credit must undoubtedly go to efficient care by our very competent engineer, Mr. W. Ward. It should be said, however, that with the increased buildings attached to the School, that the plant is getting very close to maximum capacity and any further heavy drain would overload it.\n\nPotential Life of Plant - With the steady use of this plant here, I would imagine that ten years would be its normal life, following which time the plant should be rebuilt if satisfactory service is to be ensured.\n\nHowever, with the advent of the modern automatic Diesel plants, it would appear to be poor economy to continue with gasoline engines, with their costly fuel and obvious danger from fire and explosion. When the time comes for replacement, I would strongly recommend a 60 H.P. automatic Diesel direct coupled to a 25 K.W. flat compound wound generator, in conjunction with a 300 Amp. Hr. heavy duty battery for night work.\n\nCost - For the calendar year, 1936, the cost of operation of this plant amounted to $419.49 or an average monthly cost of $35.00 which is very reasonable. It has remained at this figure for some years, rising from an average of $30.00 in 1932 when extra buildings were added to the plant. Cost of all parts and replacements in the eight years of installation would not exceed $270, or $30.00 a year at the outside. The engineer would not spend more than an hour a day average on the plant throughout the year, giving a maintenance cost of less than $200.00 a year in wages, or $16.76 a month. Fuel, repairs and time thus do not exceed an average of $54.25 a month, whereas the local power plant figure our light bill would average $100.00 a month, according to the local manager.\n\nTrusting that this will convey the desired information,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFEA/L. Principal.\nPROPOSED WIRING OF ALERT BAY INDIAN AGENCY\n\nGENERAL: This estimate has been drawn in conformance with the request of Mr. M.S. Todd that all wiring in the Agency Building be protected metallically either with galvanized conduit or A.B.C. flexible armoured cable, type A.C. (hereafter designated as \"B.X.\"). Due to the world wide rise in the price of iron and copper there has been a marked rise in the cost of wiring materials recently; there is no indication that top prices have yet been reached.\n\nDESCRIPTION: Since a total of forty-three outlets is necessary in this building, it is necessary to divide the wiring into five circuits, branching out from the service entrance near the office door. These circuits are as follows:\n\nCircuit 1: Kitchen plug (otherwise called \"convenience outlet\")\nLaundry plug.\nType of Wiring: conduit.\n\nCircuit 2: Laundry\nLaundry lavatory, with wall switch\nPantry\nKitchen unit, with wall switch\nDining room,\nLiving room,\nType of Wiring: first three in conduit, on ceiling. balance in B.X., concealed.\n\nCircuit 3: Outer Office; two light and plug\nInner Office; one light, one plug, one switch.\nDining Room: one plug.\nLiving Room: two plugs.\nPorch, one light, one wall switch.\nType of wiring: Conduit under floor and up wall to porch light. Short stretches B.X. from conduit through walls to lights, plugs, and switches.\n\nCircuit 4: Three southern bedrooms; two plugs each.\nTwo northern bedrooms: one dro-light each.\nBathroom: one lighting unit, one wall switch.\nStairwall: one light, two wall switches.\nType of wiring: Conduit through attic, with short stretches B.X. through walls to plugs and switches.\nCircuit 5: Outbuilding; five lights, two switches.\nType of wiring: Knob & Tube.\n\nService Entrance: Fused Safety Switch, 6 circuit service panel, meterlet, and conduit to ground on domestic water supply system.\n\nUnits: Keyed sockets, toggle or push-button wall switches, double plugs supplied throughout, except in kitchen and bathroom, where suitable lighting units will be provided, total cost of both units not exceeding $7.50.\n\nSUMMARY showing location of outlets:\n\n| Circuit | Lights | Switches | Plugs | Total |\n|---------|--------|----------|-------|-------|\n| 1       | 2      | 6        | 4     | 2     |\n|         | 3      | 4        | 2     | 5     |\n|         | 4      | 4        | 3     | 6     |\n|         | 5      | 5        | 2     | 7     |\n| Totals  | 19     | 11       | 13    | 43    |\n\nCOST: as described above\n\nMaterial $187.50\nLabor 144.75\n$332.25\n\nRemoving old wiring 12.00\n$344.25\n\nNote: If the Department prefers to supply its own material, the labor cost would be slightly higher; certain costs that are here divided between the two items would in that case have to be carried entirely in the second item.\n\nFor the above sum, three hundred and forty-four dollars and twenty-five cents, we the undersigned, hereby undertake to re-wire the Indian Agency at Alert Bay, as described, in conformance with the Canadian Electrical Wiring Code.\n\n(Sgd) \"J. Potts\"\n\"M.A. Giraldi\"\nPACIFIC POWER & WATER COMPANY LTD.\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nMr. M.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nSubject: Cost of Lighting\nIndian Agency\n\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nApril 19th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs with the Provincial Police Station here, and other establishments having office and residence in the same building, the Indian Agency would come under our combination \"Commercial-Domestic Rate\", using one meter. With the area you have at present in your offices, and the present number of rooms in the domestic part of the building, your monthly minimum charge, if you purchased electrical energy from this company, would be $5.55. The cost of energy would be as follows:\n\n1st 26 K.W.H. per month @ 30\u00a2 per K.W.H.\nAll energy in excess of 26 K.W.H. per month @ 4\u00a2 \" \"\n\n(Note: K.W.H. - kilo-watt hours)\n\nEach month your bill would be worked out on the basis of the amount of energy used during that month. That amount would be owing, unless it were less than the minimum, in which case the minimum would be owing. The minimum and the energy charge are not added.\n\nAverage consumption at the Custom's House has been around 40 K.W.H. per month for the last six winter months. Suppose that at the Indian Agency it should be 50 K.W.H. per month, your bill would be as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n26 \\text{ K.W.H.} & @ 30\u00a2 = \\$7.80 \\\\\n24 \\text{ \" } & @ 4\u00a2 = .96 \\\\\n& \\text{Total} = \\$8.76\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nMeter rent of 2\u00bd\u00a2 per month (one meter) should be added to this, or any bill. It has been omitted here simply to make the problem clearer.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) \"J.Potts\"\nMr. M.S. Todd,\nIndian Agency,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn line with our conversation of this morning, this letter is an attempt to answer your second question: \"what assurance have you that this plant will be operating two or three years from now?\"\n\nWhile it is impossible for us to guarantee that the plant will be operating at that time, I can definitely state that it is the present intention and belief of the shareholders and directors that it will be, not only two years from now, but for the duration of time.\n\nThe cost of the plant to date in capital equipment has been around $18,000.00. If it became necessary to shut down because it had been shown that the operation was no longer commercially practicable, the value of the installed equipment would immediately become little more than the value of scrap metal - say $8,000.00. By shutting down the shareholders would lose over 50% of their original investment - a strong motive to keep operating.\n\nHow soon the plant becomes firmly established depends upon the feeling of the community for it, and upon little else. It is felt that this public feeling is becoming more and more favorable; that people are realizing that the plant is an asset to the community, and an enterprise worthy of their support.\n\nIt is our hope that you feel the same way about it, and that by your support you will help us to become an integral part of this community.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) \"J. Potts\"\nOttawa, April 27, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, you may arrange for the purchase, from a firm on the approved list, of a tractor plow for the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. It is noted that the cost of this will not exceed $165.00.\n\nThe Principal should, also, understand that, in supplying this plow, its cost will be deducted from the amount provided in this year's appropriation for repairs and equipment at the Alert Bay Residential School.

All these items were placed before you and our Commission for inclusion in the estimates for the current fiscal year:\n\n(a) **20 only Institutional Beds** $220.00\n\nSimmons, Ltd., Vancouver, B.C. #171 - 3' wide with #5040 Spring at $11.00 each\n\n(b) **20 only Hospital Mattresses** $210.00\n\nat $10.50 each.\n\nAs previously explained, many of the beds in the present school date back as far as 1912 and the condition of some of them requires the support of boxes to keep them from falling to the ground. For years we have had to use several double deck beds and the Inspector has repeatedly requested us to discontinue their use.\n\nIn view of the possible construction of a preventorium this summer, and the consequent necessity of moving the required beds therefor from the School, I am quoting on a bed suitable for such an institution, and we could put the new beds and mattresses there and discard the old ones in the School. The quotations are quite recent, and are f.o.b. Vancouver, B. C.\n\n(c) **Cooling tanks and gasoline tanks** $75.00\n\nThe original tank on our lighting engines is in a dangerous state, corrosion having eaten it down over 1 ft. from the top.

It should also be remembered that since driving these piles, the intake was moved out some 40', and any consequent pull must be made at an angle which requires good piling.\n\nIt will be appreciated if you will lay this matter before the Department with a view to the possible replacement of this piling over the present intake.\n\nFor your information, the School paid for the piling now unsafe for further use. This job cost $40.00 complete, though with logs at present prices, a contract would likely go higher.

G. WARREN\n\nVancouver, B. C.\nJuly 21, 1937.\nVancouver, B.C.,\nJuly 21, 1937.\n\nALERT BAY SCHOOL\n\nSir:\n\nSCHOOL WALLS\n\nAn inspection was made on May 2nd of work carried out by Mr. MacLean last August. So far as I have been able to determine from inspection and reports of the school staff, the work done approximately 400 square feet, has been successful in overcoming the leak in the area covered, that is, above the sunroom in the centre of the school. Other parts of the school, residence and laundry still leak very badly. Part of one of the interior walls at the southeast corner of the school was still damp at the time of my visit, from rain that had leaked through about one week previously. No additional leaks since my last visit in 1935 are apparent in the walls.\n\nFURTHER WATERPROOFING\n\nI would suggest that a larger area of the school wall be treated, as was done last year, as a further test of the effectiveness of this waterproofing material. It would, however, be desirable to have the caulking compound tinted to approximately the color of the brick so that a liberal use of the caulking material will not disfigure the building completely. The section most in need of additional treatment is the east wall of the school, residence and laundry. Most particularly that part immediately above the residence on the school wall, about 800\n\nC.E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water and Power Bureau,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6428, file 875-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nsquare feet in area. The estimated cost of treating the 800 square feet above referred to, would be $250.00.\n\nAPPLICATION\n\nThe application of the waterproofing material should not be done when the walls are wet or damp or the temperature is below about 70\u00b0 F. at the point where work is being carried out. I noticed that some of the waterproofing done by Mr. MacLean appeared to have been carried on when the temperature was low as the material in places congealed on the surface and in consequence will probably scale off. This occurred on parts of the building previously waterproofed.\n\nThe amount of the waterproofing liquid to be applied to secure a satisfactory job would appear to be more than was recommended by the supplying company. Comparing the work done previously with what Mr. MacLean did, I would say that the material first applied had either leached out or had been absorbed further into the brick, as the brick in the portion done by Mr. MacLean has a glazed appearance, similar to that when the building was first waterproofed, whereas the brick in the portion first waterproofed has much the appearance of the brick in the untreated walls.\n\nDRAINS\n\nRegarding Mr. MacLean's statement that the seepage is through the concrete walls and that drains would overcome this, I would like to point out that there are large tile drains all around the building placed as he suggests. I would also like\nto point out that there are now several cracks in the basement walls through which leakage does not appear to enter but water still leaks through along the first brick course above the basement wall nearby.\n\nI would recommend that additional work on the walls similar to that done by Mr. MacLean be carried out this coming summer, if the weather is suitable.\n\nSCHOOL ROOF\n\nI examined the school roof and find that repairs are urgently needed. Quite a lot of soil has accumulated on portions of the roof and growth has commenced. In such places the roof sheeting seems to be in process of decay. The bituminous coating on the roof surface generally is very thin and in places none remains. It would be desirable to renew the roofing sheet in many places around the roof edge next the parapet wall and particularly under the flashing. In some places the edge of the roofing sheet butts the parapet wall but does not lap it under the flashing, also in places examined, where a lap does occur, the paper is very fragile.\n\nThe flashing (copper) is not of the type shown on coping detail on sheet 5 of school plans (Lytton) but as shown on attached sketch. The intended protection is not provided by the existing flashing as is evident by the condition of the roof where examination was possible. A complete examination was not possible at the time without being prepared to effect immediate repairs owing to the probability of causing damage to the waterproof membrane.\nI would like to point out, however, that I only found one leak which I could definitely attribute to the condition of the roof along the parapet wall. However, I would suggest that when repairs are to be made to the roof that sufficient funds should be provided to effectively seal the roof at its junction with the parapet wall completely around the building, although it may not be found necessary to carry out the work to that extent when a thorough examination is possible. There is 1350 lineal feet of parapet or other wall protected or intended to be protected by flashing.\n\nI would suggest further that the roof be scraped, brushed and washed, and a new coat of asphalt applied over the whole roof area and gravel re-distributed.\n\nThe cost of the above work is estimated as follows:\n\n| Description                          | Cost   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|\n| Repairs and renewals to flashing     | $340.00|\n| Re-surfacing roof                    | $480.00|\n| Inspection                           | $75.00 |\n| **Total**                            | **$895.00** |\n\nAppended are specifications for repair work on roof and details of cost.\n\nI would recommend that roof repairs outlined above, be carried out at an early date. While it is possible that no serious trouble would develop immediately, conditions are such that it would not be desirable to allow the roof to remain in its present condition over the next winter. It would not, however, be desirable to commence work after the end of September owing to weather conditions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.C. Warren\nAssistant Hydraulic Engineer\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 1C, Volume 6428, file 875-5, part 5)\nSPECIFICATIONS FOR REPAIRS AND RENEWALS TO FLASHING (ABOUT 1350 LINEAL FEET)\n\nFlashing is to be repaired before renewal of asphalt roof coating.\n\nScrape, brush and wash all along that part of roof adjacent to parapet or other wall where flashing is to be repaired. Raise counter-flashing and remove slip flashing. Apply four sheets 15-lb. asphalt saturated roofing felt to roof surface. Sheets to be one-half roll width. The first sheet to be applied to the roof surface with roofing cement and turned up the vertical face of the wall as high as the counter-flashing will permit, and fastened in place with nails driven through flat tin caps placed not closer than six inches to the edge of the roof deck. Each additional sheet to be applied to the one below with coating of roofing cement and to be turned up the vertical face to within one inch of the top of the preceding sheet and fastened with nails driven through flat tin caps placed not closer than six inches to the edge of the roof. In no case shall the top of the last sheet be below the lower edge of the counter-flashing, end lap to be not less than six inches, and to be fastened with roofing cement.\n\nWhen completed the whole to be given a mopping of roofing asphalt applied hot and the gravel replaced.\n\nThe counterflashing to be turned down in a vertical position and the slip-flashing replaced. All cracks and broken joints in metal flashing to be soldered and where necessary flashing replaced. The counter-flashing raglet to be re-calked with Minwax calking compound where necessary.\nWhere the counter-flashing raglet is more than 12 inches from the roof deck full width felt sheets are to be used.\n\nAfter the roof deck has been cleaned and the counter-flashing raised and before further work is carried out, an inspection will be made to determine the extent of felt flashing to be installed, after which necessary materials will be ordered.\nSPECIFICATIONS FOR RENEWAL OF ASPHALT ROOF SURFACE AND ADDITION OF GRAVEL (11,900 SQUARE FEET)\n\nScrape, brush and wash all that part of roof not already done under foregoing specifications. The surface to be entirely free from dust, sand and moss before application of asphalt. Mop surface with 30 lbs. per square (100 square feet) roofing asphalt applied hot. Spread gravel over entire surface of roof, 450 lbs. gravel per square, only about half this quantity on roof at present.\n\nAsphalt shall be a high grade roofing product having a melting point of approximately 170\u00b0. Gravel is to be such as will pass a 3/4\" square mesh screen, free from sand, and to be washed before spreading on roof. Where the surface of the roofing felt is broken repairs are to be made in an approved manner before mopping on asphalt coat, not less than two sheets and nor more than four sheets of 15-lb. asphalt saturated felt to be used and to be applied with roofing cement and fastened with nails driven through flat tin caps.\nESTIMATE OF COST\nREPAIRS TO ALERT BAY SCHOOL ROOF\n\nRepairs and Renewal of Flashing, 1350 lin.ft.\n\n22 rolls 15-lb. asphalt saturated felt,\n400 square ft. per roll $66.00\n700 lbs. roofing cement, Barrett's Ever-\nlastic or equal 63.00\n(1 Roll of felt for 60 lin.ft. of\nflashing. 0.35 lbs. cement per lin.\nft. of flashing)\nTin caps and nails 5.00\nLabour 150.00\nSupervision and Contingencies 56.30\n$340.30\n\nRepairs and Renewals to Roof Sheet, 11,900 sq.ft.\n\n3600# roofing asphalt @ $36.00 ton $64.80\n2 rolls roofing felt 6.00\nLabour 288.00\nFares 3 men Vancouver to Alert Bay (return) 69.00\nFreight 9.00\n$436.80\nSupervision and Contingencies 43.70\n$480.50\nInspection both jobs 75.00\n$555.80\nDetail of Coping Etc.\nScale 1\"=1'\nFrom Sheet 5 Plans Lytton school.\n\nCoping\n\nCounterflashing\nRoof Deck\n\nSmall L shaped Copper flashing loose under counterflashing and atop of roof deck.

Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn complying with your instructions to waterproof 400 square feet of wall at the Indian School at Alert Bay, immediately above the sun room, also behind the parapet wall on the south side of school building, I may say I rubbed the bad joints with Minwax Compound No. 1 and gave the bricks two very heavy coats of clear waterproofing which I soaked in, using over 4 gallons.\n\nBehind Parapet Wall\n\nI wire-brushed the brick thoroughly and put one coat of damp-proofing and followed this with one coat of trowelling compound about 1/8-inch thick. On my inspection I found a stub of a flag pole which had a crack one-half inch wide. This I sawed off level with the copper flashing and covered it with a heavy coat of trowelling compound and sealed it.\n\nRoof\n\nThe roof is in poor shape, especially behind the south and east walls for about three feet. There is quite a lot of moss growing there and the paper, not being well covered with asphalt, is in bad condition.\n\nThe joints of the copping of the south wall I covered with the saturated cotton as far as it would go and finished the rest with sacking strips and trowel coated over them well. Behind the copping stone I covered with one coat of damp-proofing.\n\nI also found what I should say is a bad leak on the copping of the sunroom roof, the flashing being pulled away from the main building fully 3/4 of an inch, which I caulked.\n\nSo you will see I have carried out your instructions and more, to have a good test.\n\nSouth and East Walls\n\nThe brick, I must say, is very porous and unevenly laid, and worst of all, the mortar was mixed with very coarse sand and little cement which makes the joints of the brick very porous and undoubtedly allows the moisture to penetrate. The work done on these walls has been of some benefit, although I consider the clear waterproofing used has not a heavy enough base and would therefore recommend waterproof paint of not less than three coats, on these two walls in particular, coupled with careful inspection of all\npitholes and open joints in brick, which should be pointed before painting, and that this be done as early as possible next year weather permitting. In so doing I consider you will save the metal laths and plaster on the interior of these two walls.\n\nThe brick throughout the whole building is very unevenly laid and forms small ledges that hold the water and when the wind is blowing will eventually seep through the walls.\n\nDrains\n\nI fully believe the seepage in the basement is entirely caused for the want of a tile drain placed one foot away from the foundation wall and not less than 4\" below floor level. When laying same there should be at least one foot of beach pebbles or crushed rock placed above to allow perfect drainage.\n\nI also would suggest while digging is being done, to have a damp-proofing coat put on the outside of the cement wall to grade height. This will be further protection against any seepage through concrete wall.\n\nYour instructions regarding my accommodation - although Mr. Todd no doubt did his best, there was no room at the school which necessitated my going to the hotel.\n\nMaterial at Alert Bay\n\n4 gals.

Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys & Engineering Branch.\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of September 11th with reference to the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nYou may arrange for the repairs required to the roof at a cost not exceeding $695.00. I presume you can arrange to proceed with this work at once.\n\nI understand from Mr. Mills' report that it may not be possible to treat the walls until next summer. However, you may inform your engineers that whenever weather conditions are favourable, a further 600 sq. ft. of the wall of the Alert Bay School may be treated at a cost not exceeding $250.00.\n\nFunds for the above purposes are available in the appropriation for Indian Education, and accounts certified by your engineers will be paid to the amounts mentioned above.\n\nDirector.\nSeptember 11, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill.\n\nRe - Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nI am forwarding herewith copy of a memorandum received from our Chief Engineer in regard to work done in the Fall of 1936 for the purpose of preventing seepage through the walls of the above school and containing recommendations for further work on the walls and roof of the school. A report is also attached on \"Proposals for further waterproofing of walls and repairs to school roof\" prepared by Mr. W.C. Warren as a result of investigations carried on under instructions of Mr. C.E. Webb of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau. There is also attached a letter addressed to Mr. Webb by Mr. J.C. McLean who applied the waterproofing last September, which describes in detail the general conditions found in the school.\n\nMr. Warren's recommendations are, briefly,\n\n(1) That in view of the fact that the 400 square feet treated last summer successfully kept out the water during last winter, a further 800 square feet of wall be treated, at an estimated cost of $250.\n\n(2) That as the roof is urgently in need of repairs, renewals of the flashing and a renewal of asphalt roof surface, with addition of gravel, should be made, at an estimated cost of $895.\nWill you please advise if you approve of this work being undertaken and if the necessary funds will be available.\n\n[Signature]\nDirector\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle.\n\nRe - Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nAccording to advice received from Mr. Webb, District Chief Engineer, Dominion Water and Power Bureau, British Columbia, it appears that there has been trouble experienced during wet weather at the above school caused by seepage through the walls of the building. Following an inspection an attempt was made last year to correct the seepage with the application of water-proofing material on the apparently affected sections of the building. The result of such treatment did not prove satisfactory and after much correspondence with the manufacturer of the product (Minwax Company Incorporated, 11 West 42nd St., New York) it was decided to re-treat a small section of the more seriously affected wall with the Minwax Company's preparations in an effort to determine if their product was capable of giving a satisfactory water-proofing job. This work was done last September by an experienced man obtained in Vancouver and a copy of his report is attached.\n\nLast spring Mr. Webb had Mr. Warren of his office make an inspection to ascertain the results of the experiment of last September and report on further work that he would recommend to improve the remainder of the walls. A copy of Mr. Warren's report is attached. From this report it appears that the 400 square feet which were treated last summer have successfully kept out the water during the last winter and Mr. Warren further indicates that no additional leaks have developed since his visit in 1935. It would appear however that the whole building is in a poor state of repair due partly to wall leakage. Although a question which does not need to be considered at the present time, it is not apparent just how the quality of brick and mortar as indicated in Mr. Warren's report was used in the original construction of the building.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector, Surveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nAs there still seems to be some doubt as to the results that might be obtained from using Minwax products on an extensive scale, Mr. Warren recommends that as a further experiment an additional 800 square feet of wall be treated at an estimated cost of $250.00.\n\nOn Mr. Warren's investigation of this building, it was found that the roof was urgently in need of repairs and he recommends that such work be undertaken. The cost of same is estimated at $995.00. Attached to Mr. Warren's report are specifications for repairs and renewals to the flashing as well as specifications for renewal of asphalt roof surface and addition of gravel.\n\nIn view of the condition of this building as described in Mr. Warren's report, it is apparent that something should be done to preserve this building insofar as the quality of its original construction will permit. Mr. Warren's suggestions are therefore concurred in and it is recommended that repair work be undertaken in accordance with his report provided that the money is available and the Indian Affairs Branch is agreeable to have such work undertaken. It will be noted that it is desirable to have the repair work in question done during warm weather and subject to your approval it is suggested that if this work is to be undertaken Mr. Webb might be instructed that the work is approved, but that it is only to be undertaken when weather conditions are suitable.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(sgd.)

If this is Mr. Webb's plan, then it is not necessary to ask for the thousand dollars which I included in my Estimates but rather for funds sufficient to take care of the labour only. I would appreciate if you would check our estimates and see that sufficient funds are provided for this work.\n\nI might add a few days ago we had one of the most severe storms of the year, and Mr. Anfield phoned me stating the walls of the building were leaking very badly. I immediately went to the school, and in company with Mr. Anfield examined the building, and found the water had penetrated the walls on two sides of the building.\n\nI strongly recommend to the Department the condition of the school is serious and that sufficient funds be provided to make a good and lasting job. Unless this is done in my opinion the metal lath and plaster of the building as well as the foundations will be ruined and ultimately cost the Department a lot of money to repair.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, November 24, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to previous correspondence regarding the disposal of an old boiler at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, you may dispose of this at any time, provided you consider the offer you receive is reasonable.\n\nIn the event of your selling the boiler, you should immediately notify the Department and, at the same time, remit the amount obtained for it.\n\nIf you do not receive an offer within the next two months, you should so advise me.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I would draw to your attention the recommendation of Mr. Arnall that a different type of heater be installed.\n\nRegarding the batteries, many of the positive plates need replacement. This could best be done by a contracting firm sending up some spare batteries for our use and allowing us to ship, say half a dozen, to town for renewal of plates and electrolyte.\n\nI should inform you that our engineer has insufficient time to undertake this work at the School, under the provisions of the Minimum Hours of Work Act.\n\nI should also notify you that the metal stack pipe of the boiler in the classroom block is eaten right through and needs immediate replacement.

Superfex has adjustable shutters that direct heat toward the floor, where you need it. A Superfex heater will do a better job of heating a given space than any old-fashioned stove of comparable size. It will give you more comfort, and do it with greater convenience. You will have no grates to shake, no ashes to dust up the house with, no handling of dirty or awkward fuel. Superfex is the modern and really comfortable way to heat your home, and its modern style and two-tone brown porcelain enamel finish afford an attractive addition to the furnishing of the finest home.\n\nMODEL 1035 Superfex Heat-Director...\nTwo-tone brown porcelain enamel finish.\nHeating capacity 4,800 cu. ft. in north, 6,400 cu. ft. south. 5-gallon detachable reservoir.\n\nMODEL 1036 is the same except with constant level valve for connection to outside supply.\nSUPERFEX is a modern heating stove, made to burn No. 1 or No. 2 light domestic fuel oil (cheaper than kerosene) quietly and cleanly. There are several sizes and styles, made to suit varying requirements for heat in the modern home, office, school, church, shop, garage, service station or small store.\n\nSome are of the Heat Director type, in which heat rays are deflected toward the floor at various angles, depending upon your need, by means of adjustable shutters on three sides. In average operation, with the shutters about three-quarters open, a wide area of floor around the heater is warmed. You can feel the comforting blast of radiant heat, and the warmed floor helps to heat the lower part of the room. Because of the large area of radiating surfaces, heating is accomplished without strong cold drafts on the floor.\n\nWhere the radiant type of heating is desired, the Superfex Oil Burning Heat Radiators offer the most satisfactory answer. They throw out a blast of comforting heat that puts any old-fashioned stove to shame, and bring you many advantages that none of the old stoves could afford... cleanliness, convenience... steady heat... constant control.\n\nSuperfex Heaters are clean, quiet and efficient in operation. They are easy to light and positively controlled. If outside temperatures remain about the same, you can be assured of even temperature inside without fuss or bother. Any tendency toward change can promptly be met with a change in the volume of heat from your Superfex. Ask your dealer to demonstrate Superfex modern heat.\n\nMODEL 1031 Superfex, smallest Heat-Director, is beautifully finished in two-tone brown porcelain enamel.

If you refer to your memorandum of March 21 and my reply of March 26 you will note that it was decided at that time that it was not advisable to take any further action regarding the extension to the sewage disposal system. Under these circumstances the amount already transferred to you for this purpose is still available and you may use $1145.00 of this for the work at Alert Bay.\nDeducting the $1145.00 from the $1400.00 already transferred to you leaves a balance of $255.00 and if it is later decided to take any action at Fort Frances along the lines suggested by Doctor J. T. Phair (reference my memorandum May 3) any additional amount of money necessary can then be transferred.\n\nDirector.\n10th May, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to the above school and to your memorandum of the 12th ultimo, the understanding is that $800.00 is provided for this work in this year's appropriation and that as the original estimate of the cost of repairs was $1,145.00 a further sum of some $350.00 would be required. As requested in your memorandum Mr. Webb was asked to consider the possibility of reducing this estimate. A report has now been received from Mr. Webb and he considers that the original estimate is not too high for the repairs which will be necessary. As shown in the attached copy of a memorandum from the Chief Engineer it is Mr. Webb's opinion that if the full amount of money cannot be provided the work should be deferred until next year.\n\nHowever, our understanding is that you are anxious to have this school put in good condition and I should be glad if you would advise that the additional funds necessary will be transferred to this Branch.\n\nDirector.\nAGENT'S MONTHLY REPORT ON KWAWEELTH AGENCY, APRIL 1936.\n\nRecently the matter of repairs to the walls of the residential school and redecorating of the Principal's residence was referred to the department, and I would again ask that this work be started at as early a date as possible.\n\nM.

(RG 1C, Volume 6428, file 875-5, part 6)\nMarch 21st, 1938.\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd,\n\nI have to notify you officially of my intended marriage this coming summer, and to request the earnest consideration of the Department towards putting the Principal's residence at this school into better condition than it is now.\n\nAs you are aware, the residence has by its position on the south-east corner of the building, received the brunt of the severe leakage which has taken place on the whole weather face of the building, as a result of which the residence walls and ceilings are in such condition that the house will need a complete renovation from top to bottom.\n\nA prima facie condition of any such renovation must be the waterproofing of the outside walls and I understand it is the Department's intention to carry this work through to a satisfactory conclusion as soon as the weather is suitable.\n\nWhen the School was built, the Department furnished one room in the residence and supplied a cook range for the kitchen. The balance of the furniture required was supplied by the Indian Residential School Commission or by myself. For some years I lived in the residence, my meals and wants supplied by a housekeeper, but the place was so cold and damp that eventually I gave up the place and moved into the main building. Within the past two years, an increased staff made it necessary to move four workers back into the residence for sleeping purposes only, and though it has been far from comfortable for them, the first waterproofing job helped a little and we have been able, by pushing the heat in the evening and shutting off all the downstairs radiators, to get the upstairs rooms fairly warm for sleeping purposes. However, if the house is to be used as a home for permanent use, something must be done to augment the present heating supply. The kitchen stove which was supplied by the Department has been used for years for the teaching of small domestic science units, and later was\nThe Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nMoved for use in our isolation building. It will not stand further moving, and is not in fit condition for re-installation in the residence.\n\nIt is, therefore, necessary to ask the consideration of the Department towards the following suggested needs:\n\n1. The renovation of the house, walls and ceilings with a new washable Kalsomine product named \"Vello\", and the sanding and re-varnishing of the floors; also the supply and installation of French doors for living and dining room, to prevent the draughts which come in under the front door:\n\nCost:\n(a) 6636 sq.ft. walls and ceilings, 2 coats \"Vello\", requires 50 lbs. \"Vello\" at 10\u00a2 lb, plus 55\u00a2 freight $5.80\n(b) 1905 sq.ft. floors, 2 coats varnish, requires 2 gals. Valspar at $4.25 gallon $5.50\n(c) Two French doors for living and dining room, material only, (see attached bids) $30.55\n(d) Labour on above, including 3 days fixing throats of fireplaces, both of which have smoked since installation: 10 days painting, 6 days on floors, 1 day on French doors, 3 days on fireplaces - 20 days at $5.00 $100.00\n\n$144.85\nCarried forward $144.85\n\n2. \"Kleen-Kook\" Range with Silent Glow Oil burner, installed (see bid attached) $153.50\n\n30 gallon hot water tank, with stand and piping, $25.11 plus $2.50 freight $27.61\n\nOther bids are attached for consideration and comparison.\n\n3. Auxiliary heater\n#1035 Superfex Heat Director, installed $115.50 (see bid attached)\n\nOther bids are attached hereto for the consideration of the Department, but I really consider that the Heater mentioned herein will, with the kitchen range, keep the house warm and comfortable to live in.\n\n4. Installation of power plugs from city power lines for use of electric appliances, according to the Canada wiring code specifications, bid submitted and attached, $50.00\n\n$491.46\n\nThese items total $491.46, which may seem a lot of money to spend on this house, but it should be remembered that nothing whatever has been done on it since it was built. For years the water ran down the sitting room and upstairs bedroom walls, and I think you are in a position to verify this and also the need of proper heating.\n\nFor your information, the extra heat and French doors were found necessary at Lytton where a replica of this school is situated. Generally speaking there is need of heat here for longer than at Lytton.\nThe Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nMay I be permitted to say in closing that this is the first time I have asked the Department for consideration for anything personal, and I hope that the requests made here-with will receive favourable support.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPEA/L. Principal.\nSt. Michael's School  \nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Anfield:\n\nWe are very pleased to quote on your specification for Kitchen Range. The description of your inquiry calls for our Burbank #136, ivory pyralin stripped for oil and equipped with two burners fully installed which is covered in the following:\n\nOne only #136 Burbank Range, stripped for oil, One only Aetna Standard Burner, installed f.o.b. Alert Bay, $118.37.\n\nI note that you had not called for this range to be equipped with hot water coils. If you are desirous of having coils add $4.25. Trusting that this will fulfill your requirements, we are,\n\nYours truly\n\nMarshall-Wells B.C. Limited\n\nManager, Stove Department\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP. O. Box #8,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have read with considerable care the file of correspondence with regard to suggested improvements in the Principal's residence at St. Michael's Indian Residential School, Alert Bay.\n\nI use a room in the residence when carrying out inspections around Alert Bay and have been there from 7 to 10 days yearly. This has given me an opportunity of seeing just what repairs and additions are urgently required.\n\nIn general, I am in agreement with the views put forward by Mr. F. E. Anfield and the recommendations of Mr. Indian Agent Todd, though I do not know where a sum of almost $500.00 is to be found to carry out the requested work.\n\nI could not possibly recommend the installation of a hot-air furnace, and I regret that I am unable to even recommend that an oil burner be installed for heating purposes in the Principal's residence at a cost of $115.50. There is no reason, as far as I can see, why the heating of the Principal's residence should prove any more difficult than the School in general. I have found that when the engineer attends to his work the heating of the School and residence is quite satisfactory. It is quite possible that some attention should be paid to the regulation of the radiators through the School to ensure that when the residence is properly heated other parts of the School are at about the same temperature and not overheated as at present. It is true that when the main part of the School is only heated to a moderate degree, the Principal's residence, being furtherest from the boilers, does not receive sufficient heat.\nThe French doors suggested for the dining room and the living room are in my opinion necessary; such doors have been provided in the Principal's residence at St. George's School, Lytton. The door leading from the Principal's study to the verandah does not fit properly and certainly requires weather stripping. I would, in fact, recommend that all outside windows and doors of the residence be provided with metal weather stripping. This, I think, would do more to maintain a steady temperature than the provision of a costly oil burner. When I occupy a room at this School I find that the wind blows right through closed windows and doors, and, of course, lowers the temperature of the rooms considerably.\n\nThe walls and ceilings certainly require some sort of washable kalsomine, as they are in a dreadful state owing to the penetration of rain from south-easterly gales. I am further in agreement with Mr. Anfield when he states that the waterproofing of the outside walls should be attended to before any kalsomining is carried out inside the building, but I understand that it is the Department's intention to carry out this waterproofing as soon as the weather is suitable.\n\nThe kitchen range originally supplied for use in the Principal's residence has been made use of in the domestic science class, and is now completely worn out. The installation of power plugs for use of electric appliances in connection with the recently installed Alert Bay mains, is also recommended.\n\nIn conclusion I may say that, if my own recommendations are accepted, the cost of the improvements at St. Michael's Indian Residential School would be reduced from the estimated total of $491.46 to $375.96, which would be increased a little by the cost of the metal weather stripping (which I consider the boys of the Manual Training Class could install at no extra cost). I would, therefore, request that no more than $400.00 be authorized for the improvements of this School, although I am not able to make any suggestion with regard to where this money is to be found, as it would not appear that such improvements have been allowed for in this year's estimates.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools for B.C.\nOffice of Indian Agent.\n\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nMarch 29, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter No.23/2627 dated March 22nd last, I beg to advise I have given the matter of heating the residence at the Indian Residential School due consideration, and in view of the fact that the residence at the present time does get a small amount of heat from the present heating system located in the main building, it is felt if the Department installed an oil burner in the hall or the residence it would amply heat these rooms and at the same time save the Department a considerable outlay in the cost of a furnace.\n\nThis suggestion has been taken up with Principal Anfield of the School, and he is of the same opinion as myself and therefore I would recommend that in place of installing a hot air furnace, at a cost of $300.00, with an additional cost of $150.00 for condensate pumps making a total of $450.00, an oil burner be installed at a cost of $115.50 as per estimate and illustration enclosed.\n\nYou will also please find enclosed a letter and quotations received from Mr. Anfield for additional work and material required to put the residence in proper condition so that he may make his home there when married. I have perused very carefully Mr. Anfield's letter addressed to me under date of March 21st, and agree with him that the work requested is necessary. The walls and ceilings and floors should be done over as well as installing the two French doors for the living and dining room.\n\nIn respect to the range, you will please note Mr. Anfield is requesting a new \"Kleen-Kook\" oil burner range as well as a hot water tank. I might state in this connection when the school was built the Department did supply a cooking range for the residence, but as Mr. Anfield has used it all these years in the interests of the school for domestic science classes as well as in the isolation building, I feel it should be replaced at this time and would recommend that a new one be supplied.\n\nIn respect to Item 4, \"Installation of Power Plugs\" I would state the school is now connected with the city power lines and electrical energy used for the ironer and frigidaire. Our present plant will not permit any further load, and therefore Mr. Anfield is asking that power plugs be installed so that he can personally use the city power, and I would recommend that this work be done for him.\n\nYou will please note the total items requested amounts to $491.46. By using Item No.3, Auxiliary Heater in place of the hot air furnace, the Department will save considerable money and would cut down the total cost to some extent.\nMr. Anfield has given the Department many years of faithful service in the interests of the Indian people, and I feel in recognition of this service the Department should at this time show him every consideration by having the residence put into good shape when it is going to be permanently occupied as a residence, and I would therefore recommend that the requests as submitted be approved at an early date so that the work can be got under way and completed by July 1st at the latest in order that he can take up residence there early in August, at which time he expects to be married.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\"M.

(RC 10, Volume 6428, file 875-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nDATE: June 24, 1938\nSir,\n\nI have today received a Certificate from the Principal, St. Michael's Residential School, Alert Bay, to the effect that all Fire Extinguishers at this school are in place, in good working condition, and have on July 25th and 26th been refilled and charged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nKwawkewlth Agency,\n\nReport for the Month of August.\n\nDuring the month work has been completed on the walls and roof of the Residential School at Alert Bay. An entirely new roof has been put on, which appears to be an excellent job. The walls on the east side of the building proper as well as two walls of the residence have received a coat of Minwax, but it is regretted there was not sufficient funds to complete all the walls on the east side of the school and the residence, as the work now looks to be more or less patchy.\n\nN. S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nIn connection with the Estimates, I would kindly ask the Department to refer to my letter of August 30th in respect to the problem of heating the old Girl's Home, now used as a classroom block at the Residential School. After inspecting the heating equipment with Mr. Arnall, Boiler Inspector, we were both of the opinion that to continue with open fires in this building was not safe, and that some better heating system must be provided if this building is to be used as a classroom block.\n\nM. S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 1, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nPlease transfer to the Surveys & Engineering Branch the sum of $200.00. This amount is required in connection with repairs and improvements that are being made at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School under the direction of the engineer attached to the Surveys & Engineering Branch.\n\nActing Director.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa,\nSeptember 1, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nPlease transfer to the Surveys & Engineering Branch the sum of $200.00. This amount is required in connection with repairs and improvements that are being made at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School under the direction of the engineer attached to the Surveys & Engineering Branch.\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 1, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Alert Bay Indian Residential School\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of August 25 I am requesting our Treasury Branch to transfer to the Surveys & Engineering Branch an amount of $200.00 in connection with the work for the above-mentioned school.\n\nActing Director.\n25th August, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nWe were advised by your memorandum of the 13th May last that $1,145 of the $1,400 item for the proposed extension to the sewage disposal system of the Fort Frances Indian Residential School might be used for the above work. We are now advised by Mr. Webb that a further $200 will be required to pay for material purchased for this school.\n\nI understand that the balance of the $1,400 has been used in connection with the Cecelia Jeffrey School and will be glad if you will advise if the extra $200 required for the Alert Bay School can be provided.\n\nDirector.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa,\nAugust 13, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reviewing your report for the month of July I note a reference to the work that is being done at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nIn September last an official from the Surveys & Engineering Branch visited Alert Bay and reported in part as follows:\n\n\"As there still seems to be some doubt as to the results that might be obtained from using Minwax products on an extensive scale, Mr. Warren recommends that as a further experiment an additional 800 square feet of wall be treated at an estimated cost of $250.00.\n\n\"On Mr. Warren's investigation of this building, it was found that the roof was urgently in need of repairs and he recommends that such work be undertaken. The cost of same is estimated at $895.00. Attached to Mr. Warren's report are specifications for repairs and renewals to the flashing as well as specifications for renewal of asphalt roof surface and addition of gravel.\"\n\nYou will note from the above the reason why all the walls in the building are not being treated this year, also our reason for repairing the roof.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDuring the month another test has been made on the walls of the Residential school in which the east wall and two walls of the residence were treated with the Minwax preparation. This office was under the impression it was the Department's intention to have all the walls properly done this year and knew nothing about the building of a new roof on the school. The money which I asked for in my Estimates last year was to have the walls done, and I would kindly ask in the future when the Engineering Branch wish to have any work done on the school that they advise me so that this can be placed in my Estimates rather than take money which is asked for, for one purpose and use it for another. Possibly it would be well to have the Department advise this office the Engineer's recommendations as to the work required to be done next year so that I can have the items placed in my estimates for 1939.\n\nM. S. Todd,\nIndian Agent.\nAGENT'S REPORT ON KWAWEWLTH AGENCY FOR JUNE 1938.\n\nAt the beginning of the month repairs were made to the lift at the intake of the water system at the Residential School and vouchers covering this have been forwarded to Ottawa through the Indian Commissioner's office in Vancouver.\n\nM.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent, Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Lighting System, Alert Bay School.\n\nIn view of the fact that the batteries of the lighting system at this School have been in use since 1932, and are now reported to be \"in their last stage of usefulness\" and must soon be replaced, and in view of the further fact that the present lighting plant is gasoline driven, with the consequent \"ever present risk of back-firing and explosion from engines which as their age increases, become more and more prone to such attacks\" and in view of the still further fact that this lighting system will be unable to provide the N.B. Preventorium which will be opened in connection with this School at the beginning of January next with the light required, Mr. Principal Anfield has recommended to our Commission that arrangements be made with the Pacific Power and Water Co., Ltd. of 806 Royal Trust Building, Vancouver, B.C. for this school to be supplied with light and power from the plant of this Company they have recently established in Alert Bay.\n\nFrom correspondence before me, I learned that the batteries of the plant now in use will not last the winter, and that the cost of replacing these might be saved if satisfactory arrangements could be made with the Pacific Power and Water Co. to furnish the light and power required at the School and Preventorium. I also learned that by the same arrangement the cost of replacing the gasoline engines with those of the Diesel type might likewise be saved.\n\nIt appears that Mr. Principal Anfield has talked the matter over very fully with Mr. Indian Agent Todd, and recommended that some of the \"mechanical plant now in use be traded in for other electric equipment to be used should a\ncontract be made with the Pacific Power & Water Co., when\nthe proceeds from the parts disposed of would help to meet\nthe cost of the new equipment.\n\nThis suggestion was referred to your Commissioner\nfor B.C. and he advised that he was unable to agree to accept\nthe same.\n\nIn view of the circumstances set forth above I beg\nto suggest that further consideration be given to this\nimportant matter and that authority be given to Mr. Indian\nAgent Todd and Mr. Principal Amfield to make the best arrange-\nment possible for providing the School and Preventorium with\nlight and power, and to dispose of some of the equipment now\nin use should it be found possible to enter into a satisfactory\nagreement with the Pacific Power & Water Co.\n\nIn keeping with the promise I made to you during\nour interview on the 21st ultimo, I am recording for your\ninformation a copy of the telegram I read to you at that time\nand which I received while in Ottawa from Mr. Principal Amfield.\nIt reads as follows:\n\n\"Suggest reaching agreement with Department re\noperating cost Preventorium (stop) Recommend\nfixed additional per capita grant thirty cents\na day for basic number fifteen patients plus\ncost light and power (stop) School lighting\nplant unable handle Preventorium.\"\n\nAs a new set of batteries would cost approximately\n$600, or nearly half that amount if the cells are retained and\nnew positive and negative plates installed, and as the cost of\nreplacing the gasoline engines now in use for those of the\nDiesel type would amount to a very considerable sum, it seems\nto me that from the standpoint of economy the change recommended\nby the Principal deserves careful and sympathetic consideration,\nand I trust that you may view the matter in the same light.\nAs the Preventorium is expected to be ready for occupation by\nJanuary first next, a prompt decision in the matter will be\nappreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW/WH\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa,\nDecember 3, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your voucher No. 227 in favour of the Dominion Oil Burner Distributors.\n\nWhen the request for the supplying of oil burners for the class room at the Alert Bay School was received we had already expended the amount provided for this school in the current year's appropriation. We understood at the time that only 2 oil burners would be necessary and as the cost of these was reasonable and they were strongly recommended the amount necessary was taken from a small unallotted portion of our appropriation. At that time we were not aware that 5 of these heaters would be necessary as in that event we would have been unable to consider the matter.\n\nUnder the circumstances we can only pay for the 2 which were ordered by our Purchasing Branch and a cheque for $138.90 is being forwarded to Dominion Oil Burner Distributors. The cost of the others will have to be provided from school funds.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\n\nR. A.

(RG 10, Volume 6428, file 875-5, part 6)\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose copy of a letter received from Mr. Indian Agent Todd, Kwawkewlth Agency, in the matter of heating of the classroom block of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. I also enclose a letter from Mr. Anfield, Principal of the said school, on the matter, and tenders from Summerfield's Limited, Vancouver Iron Works and Patterson Boiler Works in connection with replacement of boilers in that building; finally, there is a copy of a letter signed by T.J. Arnall, Engineer of the Public Works Department, in which the present boiler in that building is condemned, with his remarks upon the matter. This latter letter, of course, is the one that started the correspondence.\n\nYou will see that the Indian Agent and the Principal are now using three oil burners as a temporary measure to heat this building. These burners were, and are, intended for the Preventorium which is to be erected. Both the Indian Agent and the Principal are so satisfied with the good results given by these burners that they suggest that instead of a new boiler being installed at much greater cost, that oil burners be used instead.\n\nI wish to draw your attention to the fact that it would necessitate five burners in all, i.e., an additional two to the three now being used.\n\nOn the last page of Mr. Anfield's letter, you will see particulars as to prices of these burners and attention drawn to the fact that a saving of $800 to $900 would be made by using oil burners instead of a new boiler, and further that these oil burners seem to give even greater satisfaction than a boiler and steam plant would or has. Mr. Anfield makes the recommendation on the same page, and I concur in this, which amounts to the fact of the three burners now being used be accepted for the heating\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nof this building, three to replace them for the Preventorium to be purchased at a later date, and further, that two more oil burners be purchased and sent up for the same purpose.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG. S. Pragnell.\nFor D. H. MacKay.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl\nGSP/AC\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nSeptember 12, 1938.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe enclosed copy of correspondence received from Principal Anfield of the Alert Bay Residential School will be self-explanatory in respect to the new heating system for the classroom block which is found necessary owing to the boiler which is now some twenty-six years old being condemned by Mr. T.J. Arnall, Boiler Inspector.\n\nTo date I have not been officially advised by the Department that they have received from Mr. Arnall official notice that the present boiler is condemned, I only have Principal Anfield's word in which he informed me the Commissioner's office had received an official report. Mr. Arnall did, however, at the time of his inspection, inform me that the boiler would have to be replaced.\n\nUpon receipt of the three oil burners which were purchased recently in Vancouver for the Preventorium to be loaned to the school temporarily until some arrangement could be made, I went to the school and carefully examined the efficiency of these burners in the matter of heating this building.\n\nAfter taking everything into consideration, it was felt if two small 8\" pot burners could be added to the three now operating, the building could be heated more cheaply and with greater efficiency and less outlay than could be done by replacing the old steam heating plant. To start with, it will cost at least $1200.00 to replace the present boiler and as all the fittings and heating system is twenty-six years old, I am of the opinion this would not stand up any length of time and the Department would be faced with replacement, which would in all probability run into $2000.00 or $2500.00 altogether.\n\nFiguring this outlay against possibly $325.00 or $350.00 for installing five oil burners, which will no doubt give the school a better heating system, I would recommend to the Department that two more oil burners be purchased immediately and have the building heated in this manner rather than go to the great expense of the installation of a steam heating system.\n\nWould you please advise me at your earliest convenience if you approve of the oil burners for heating rather than replacing the present system, and if so, that authority be given for the purchase of two additional 8\" burners.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

MICHAEL'S SCHOOL\nAlert Bay, B. C.\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\n\nSeptember 10th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAttached please find bids on the installation of a new steam furnace for the classroom block at this school.\n\nThese are submitted at the request of Mr. Commissioner Mackay in Vancouver with whom I consulted on receipt of a wire to the effect that the present steam plant in this building had been condemned for further use by Mr. J. T. Arnall, Dominion Public Works Boiler Inspector.\n\nAs the school was then full to capacity with all class rooms running in this building, the Commissioner approved the suggestion that three oil burning heaters be purchased for the projected T. E. Preventorium, and used in the school block during the time that consideration of a new boiler was in hand.\n\nThese burners were purchased from the Dominion Oil Burner Distributors, Vancouver, on competitive bids secured by the writer, and were installed and operating at the school on Friday of this week.\n\nIt is understood by the Commissioner that these burners are lent for the purpose of heating the school block for the time being, and they will be stored on completion of their use, and later put into the Preventorium to be used as the heating units of that building.\n\nIn the one day's use made of these heaters it was found that they have proved splendid heating units, and in consultation with the school engineer it was decided to place before you the possibility of making them, with the addition of two other burners, the permanent heating unit of this school block. From the visit made by you to the school this morning, it was possible for you\nThe Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\n\nto form your own conclusions, and make your own recommendations to the Department.\n\nFrom the school point of view, we would like to place the following before you:\n\n(a) Value of a new steam plant in this block.\n\nIt should be borne in mind that the steam pipe and radiation system of the boiler now condemned were installed in 1912. The engineer informs me that not only has the boiler given out completely but that the steam pipe has split in several places, and that the radiation is in poor shape. It is his opinion, and in it the writer concurs, that the installation of a modern steam boiler with consequent increased pressure of an efficient installation might further weaken the present pipe and radiation. It is highly probable that following any installation of a new steam furnace, it may be necessary without warning to face the Department with the necessity of new plumbing and radiation.\n\nThe projected cost of this new boiler installed would be at least $1200.00, and we hesitate to recommend any such expenditure, having in mind the possibility of further requirements for pipe and radiation.\n\n(b) Consideration should be given to the physical condition of the building proper before the steam installation is undertaken. The building, as mentioned before is 26 years old. No great improvements or repairs have been undertaken in the past fifteen years, and the wisdom of expensive heating installation must perforce be questionable.\n\n(c) Value of Oil-burning heaters.\n\nThese burners are perfectly safe, passed by the underwriters and will handle adequately the heating of the classrooms. Vents have in all cases been found in existing chimneys, thus making the fire risk negligible. Manual control of these heaters by individual teachers makes it possible for each room to be kept at proper temperatures regardless of existing wind and weather conditions.\nThe Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\n\nIt is my opinion that if the large 13\" burner were moved from the large class room to the downstairs hallway, and a 10\" burner placed in that room, with the purchase of two additional 5\" burners, (one for the Home Economics room and the other for the downstairs classroom) it would adequately take care of the heating of this building until such time as it was necessary to dismantle the plant.\n\nThe present three burners have cost in the neighbourhood of $220.00, and the two additional 5\" burners will cost approximately $100 f.o.b Alert Bay, and a saving of $800.00 to $900.00 is immediately obvious.\n\nIt is therefore recommended:\n\n1. That the Department approve the use of oil burning heaters as the heating units to be employed in the school block, and that no purchase of steam equipment be made.\n\n2. That the Department arrange for the immediate purchase of two only 5\" Quaker Burnoil Heaters to be forwarded to the school immediately by the Dominion Oil Burner Distributors, Vancouver.\n\n3. That the Department accept the vouchers for the three burners already purchased by refunding to Mr. Indian Agent Todd the amount expended thereon, these monies to be returned to the Preventorium account held in trust by him.\n\nWill you please give your consideration to this report and advise Commissioner Mackay at the earliest possible opportunity of your recommendations thereon, so that this classroom block may have a satisfactory heating system before the winter weather sets in.\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nSUMMERFIELD'S LIMITED.\n\n1429 Granville Street,\nVancouver, B.

Public Works, Canada,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir: Re: Boiler No.44557 B.C., Gurney Square\nSectional No. 945, Serial 106-425,\nIndian Residential School, Alert Bay.\n\nAs near as I can find out this boiler was installed in\n1912 and has been in continuous service since. It is used\nto provide heat for the old school building.\n\nIn my 1936 report I pointed out that the metal had crystallized\nand was unreliable and that the life of the boiler could not\nexceed two years. In my 1937 report I stated that it should\nnot be used more than that first season. Upon examining it\nthis year I found that one section had cracked and during test\nit was leaking quite freely. I must compliment the operating\nengineer for carrying out my instructions to him, which have\nprolonged the life of this boiler. But it has now reached\na state where something must be done before heat is supplied\nto the building. Either a new boiler must be supplied or\nmore extensive repairs to the present one carried out.\n\nIf a new boiler is considered I would suggest a two pass\nSteel Tubular one similar to those in the main boiler room,\nbut of the capacity of the one taken out. A square Cast\nIron Sectional boiler will cost approximately $1070.00\nF.O.B. Vancouver, and a Steel Two Pass will cost approximately\n$1600.00 F.O.B. Vancouver.\n\nThe building is distant about 450 feet from the main boiler\nroom and is of wooden construction and more or less of a fire\nhazard. If it is decided to purchase a new boiler, I would\nsuggest that a boiler of the same size and design be purchased\nas those now installed, and install it in the main boiler\nroom and connect to the main steam header of the school heating\nsystem and a branch line led in the most direct manner to the\nsteam mains of the old school. This will mean that the steam\nbranch and returns will have to be led underground, but, as\nthe ground is easily dug, it will not add much to the cost,\nwhich, including boiler, should not exceed $2700.00. If this\nis considered, it will remove the fire hazard and also provide\nan additional supply of steam for the main school.\n\nAnother method is to take out the broken section and replace\nit with a new one and build a firebrick foundation for the\nboiler in place of the present cast iron base. This could be\ndone for approximately $600.00 and would give a satisfactory\ntemporary job, but in any case, consideration must be given\nto the weakness of the other sections of the boiler, which may\nlast for some time or may crack at any time, as before reported,\nthe metal has crystallized.\nSummary of Cost:\n\nNew Cast Iron Boiler F.O.B. Vancouver ........$1070.00\nNew Tubular Boiler, F.O.B.

C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe views of the Department are requested regarding the following matter:\n\nThe Pacific Power & Water Company, Limited, which company supplies electric energy for Alert Bay is endeavouring to obtain a contract with the School for the supply of light and power to the main and adjacent buildings. They have made a rate offer which is being considered.\n\nTo turn the lighting of the school and the power required for pumping, etc., will require the following equipment:\n\n1) A complete switchover assembly for the present lighting plant main boxes.\n\n2) An electric starting clock for the pump house.\n\n3) A 5 HP induction motor to replace present pumping engine.\n\n4) V-belt assembly and breaker switches for pump house.\n\n5) The wiring and installation of the above items.\n\nIn order to install these without cash cost they offer to take in lieu thereof the present pumping engine, a 7 HP Petters, valued at $216.00 in present condition by the B. C. Equipment Co., Ltd., and also the smaller of the two lighting plants, i.e. the 6 HP Lister gas engine and generator at present in use at the School. This engine and generator have been in constant use for 9 years and I imagine the value of same would not exceed $150.00 as is.\n\nThe Pacific Power & Water Company, Limited, estimate the cost of equipment required to use their services as $325.00, but they point out that it might be a year or more before they could obtain a sale for the plant taken over.\nThe Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay.\n\nWill you request advice from the Department as to whether, should the Commission consent to enter into contract for light and power, permission will be granted to release the equipment enumerated above as (a) and (b) in exchange for the equipment noted as items 1 to 5 in paragraph 2 above.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFEA/Inc.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nDecember 20, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant you may forward for payment the account covering the cost of the 3 additional oil burners which are in use in the class room block of the Alert Bay Indian residential school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of December 3rd, file 156-0-5, addressed to Mr. Indian Agent Todd regarding oil burners purchased for the classroom block of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. The situation with respect to heating this block was set out in a letter from this office to the Secretary dated September 28th, in which the installation of five oil burners was recommended instead of replacing the old boiler, which was condemned by the Boiler Inspector, and the replacement of which was estimated to cost at least $1200. The three burners that were then in use at the school were purchased for the new Preventorium and were only placed in the school as a temporary measure, as cold weather had set in and the boiler could not be used to heat the school, and until either new heaters or a new boiler could be supplied.\n\nAlthough the letter written on September 28th by Colonel Pragnell, on my behalf, was clear enough as to what was required to heat the classroom, the Department should have been advised, in reply to Departmental radiogram of October 8th, that authority for five oil burners and not two was required, as those in use in the classroom belonged to the new Preventorium and were only on loan to the school.\n\nIn view of the recommendations contained on page 3 of Mr. Anfield's letter, a copy of which accompanied my letter of September 28th to the Department, it would be hardly fair to expect the school to pay for these oil burners, and I trust that when the correspondence on file there in connection with the matter has been reviewed, that this expenditure can be authorized as a charge against appropriation.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

It is a further fact that the Pacific Power and Water Company has only recently commenced to give service in the district and it is by no means certain that they are at present in a position to supply power regularly and in adequate amounts. Taking everything into consideration the Department feels that it would be inadvisable to make any change at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

This boiler looks as if it will give very satisfactory service.\n\nFor purposes of our departmental inventory, we are valuing this boiler at $325.00.\n\nThanking you for your help in securing this much needed piece of equipment,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPEAL.\n\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe File 156-0-5.\n\nI have received your letter of December 8th, together with copy of Dr. Westgate's letter regarding the lighting system at St. Michael's Indian Residential School, at Alert Bay.\n\nOn October 29th Mr. Indian Agent Todd wrote to this office in connection with the matter and forwarded at that time a letter he had received from Mr. Anfield, Principal of the school, in which certain suggestions for a change in the lighting system were set out but no definite recommendation made. This matter was dealt with during my absence from the office by Lieut. Colonel Pragnell, a copy of whose reply to Mr. Todd is attached hereto along with the letters referred to from Mr. Anfield and Mr. Todd, for your information. This subject was further discussed with the Agent a few days ago, and he stated he had no objection to the change being made, providing all costs involved in the switch over were met out of school funds and also that sufficient of the present equipment be retained to provide light and power, should the company fail to meet its obligations.\n\nThe Pacific Power & Water Company Ltd. are prepared to install the necessary equipment required to supply light and power to the main school and adjacent buildings and accept in payment therefor the 7 H.P. Petters engine, installed a little over a year ago by the Department at a cost of over $500.00 and now valued under the proposed change at $216.00, and also the 6 H.P. Lister gas engine and generator, which is the smaller of the two lighting plants in use at present, at a valuation of $150.00. The school would retain the larger of the two lighting plants for use as an auxiliary unit in an emergency, should occasion arise. To be of use in this connection I should imagine that new batteries would still be required and if we are called upon to supply these I cannot see where the argument that the switch over should be made in order to avoid this expense to the Department, can be maintained.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nUnder ...\nUnder the proposals, there would be a sacrifice of our machinery at the prices quoted, particularly on the Petters engine, but I doubt if this constitutes a sufficient reason to object to the change being made. There would be no equipment surplus to requirements.\n\nThe new equipment required to effect the change is set out in Mr. Anfield's letter of October 19th attached hereto, and need not be repeated here. No information with respect to the rates the company proposes to charge for the electricity has been supplied to this office, and it is presumed that whatever these costs may be, the school is prepared to meet them from their own funds. Under these circumstances, there should be no objection to the changes being made provided also the Department is not called upon to meet the cash costs involved in switching from the present system to the Pacific Power & Water Company Ltd. I should like to suggest that in the event of the proposal being approved, that the Department obtain certain assurances from the school Commission that the machinery being removed as a result of the change or its equivalent will be replaced by the Commission should it be found necessary to return to the provision of light and power to the school by the system now in operation.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Commissioner's Office,\nVancouver, B.C., November 4, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Todd:\n\nI am in receipt of yours of the 29th ultimo with reference to a proposed change from supplying their own electric light to connecting up with the Pacific Power and Water Company, of the St. Michael's Residential School. I note your remarks in the matter and that you feel you cannot recommend this, and I am inclined to agree with you. I notice, too, that the Principal himself actually makes no recommendation. He is merely informing us that this Company has made an offer.\n\nI agree with you that it would be sacrificing our machinery at the price suggested and, further, we are not at all yet sure as to whether there would be any saving in expense to either the school or the Department. I notice that Mr. Anfield gives no figures to that effect.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG. S. Pragnell\nFor D. M. Mackay.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nOctober 29, 1938.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe enclosed correspondence has been received from Principal Anfield of St. Michael's Indian Residential School Alert Bay, and will be self-explanatory.\n\nIt is noted the Principal is considering recommending to the Commission they use electric light and power from the Pacific Power & Water Company Ltd., Alert Bay, and discontinue the use of their own electric light plant in the school provided by the Department. Mr. Anfield sets forth a list of equipment required to make the switchover, and at the same time suggests the Department turn in the 7 H.P. Petters engine now used for pumping at the school well, and also the 6 H.P. Lister gas engine and generator which is a smaller unit of the present electric light plant, to the above Company, which would mean the switchover could be done without any cost to the school.\n\nIn looking up the engineer's recent report, I find he reports the electric light plant in good order with the exception that the batteries are poor. In looking back further I find last year the engineer stated the batteries should be overhauled by the resident engineer in charge, and this was reported to the Principal of the school at that time. I do not believe any effort was made by the school to have these batteries overhauled as recommended by Mr. Arnall, and this no doubt is the reason why the batteries have deteriorated so quickly.\n\nI cannot recommend to the Department that we assume any obligation or cost in the matter of a switchover from the present lighting system in order that the school may use electrical energy from the Pacific Power & Water Company for the following reasons.\n\nThe 7 H.P. Petters engine which Mr. Anfield values at $216.00, was purchased new last year and cost over $500.00. This engine is in excellent shape and should be worth more than the value quoted by Mr. Anfield. I also feel that it should be kept intact as an auxiliary plant in case of emergency.\n\nI am also opposed to our present electric light system being dismantled even though this small unit is getting old, as I am not satisfied that the present Company can guarantee to supply the school with continuous electrical energy. It is only a new Company starting up, and should anything happen to them it might mean the Department would be called upon to install a new electric light system at the school were we to permit the present plant to be dismantled.\nI feel if the School wishes to switch over and take \"city power\" they should do this at their own expense and that the present equipment should be kept intact at least for the present, until such times as we are satisfied the Company can give continuous service.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSir,\n\nYour letter No.156-0-5 dated January 17th last in respect to the old tubular boiler now in storage at the Alert Bay Residential School has been received, and in reply I beg to advise you this boiler was some two years ago replaced by a larger one and has been in storage at the School ever since.\n\nAt that time the Salvage Officer requested me to try and obtain a sale for the boiler, but I was unable to do so. Later I wrote to the Department on May 17th last suggesting it be transferred to the Kwakwewlth Agency and left in my care to be used for any useful purpose I might decide; I had in mind at that time possibly I could utilize it in some Indian village for a bath house. However it was later found impossible to use it for that purpose.\n\nOn December 20th last Mr. Sharpe of Alert Bay, who owns a boat building establishment, told me he might be able to use it in his plant and offered me Twenty Dollars for it. After giving his offer due consideration I felt it was best to do something with it rather than leave it at the school to possibly rust out, and wired the Salvage Officer at Ottawa stating we had received this offer of Twenty Dollars and asked for authority to authorize the sale.\n\nOn the same date I received a telegram stating he would accept Twenty Dollars for it, and to advise the name of the purchaser.\n\nI notified Mr. Sharpe that the Salvage Officer would accept his offer but to date he has not taken delivery of the boiler nor has he made any payment for it. Shortly after receipt of my letter Mr. Sharpe was injured and has been in the hospital ever since, and I presume that is why he has not been able to take delivery up to now.\n\nPossibly I should have reported the matter to our Department in view of their letter of June 20th advising the old boiler could be used at some Indian village, but I was under the impression when I referred the matter back to the Salvage Officer he would immediately notify our Department at Ottawa and if they had any objection I would be so advised. When I received his telegram authorizing the sale and to accept the Twenty Dollars, I felt that everything was clear in Ottawa so far as past correspondence was concerned.\n\nIn view of your letter I shall not make delivery of the boiler until such time as I receive definite word from you. Would you kindly advise me your wishes by return mail so that I will know what to do when Mr. Sharpe comes to see me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. S. Todd\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n21st January, 1939.\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe would be most grateful for anything you could do to assist us in obtaining two used filing cabinets in which to keep past correspondence and \"dead\" files.\n\nYou will understand that since this school has opened there has been a large volume of correspondence, and at the present time this is being kept in a cupboard which has now become very much congested, and there is no available space for the keeping of further records. We have two filing cabinets for our current files, and these too are very full. We do not require new cabinets, old wooden used cabinets would do very well, and we thought that perhaps there might be some of these to spare from one of the Department's offices through re-organization. We would be willing to pay any freight charges on the cabinets, if the Department would see fit to issue two of these cabinets to us.\n\nIf you can help us in any way in this matter it will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL.

Your file 156-0-5.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 6th instant, and the offer of Mr. Sharpe of $20.00 for the old boiler, the Salvage Officer points out that as this was previously advertised for sale by tender and no bids were received, it would seem advisable to authorize the Agent to sell this equipment at the best price obtainable. If, therefore, Mr. Sharpe tenders the sum of $20.00 the Agent is authorized to release the boiler to him and collect the purchase price, which should be promptly forwarded here, in order that a Salvage Minute may be issued confirming the sale. If the Agent is able to realize a larger amount from some other party, he is at liberty to do so, in order to dispose of the boiler at the earliest possible date.\n\nWould you kindly advise him regarding the above.\n\nW.M.

I understand from Commissioner MacKay that this will not involve the expenditure of more than $100.00. Payment to this extent will be made on receipt from you of a certified account.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nMay 9, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant with reference to examining the intake at the Alert Bay Indian residential school.\n\nThe Surveys & Engineering Branch is being requested to have one of their engineers visit Alert Bay during June.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of April 13th in reply to correspondence dealing with the fire fighting intake at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. The suggestion that an examination of the intake might be made by a local man was referred to Mr. Todd, who has reported that there is no one at Alert Bay qualified to undertake the work.\n\nIn discussing this matter with Mr. Warren of the local division of the Water and Power Bureau, he suggested that it would be best to have the work carried out in June when there would be a minus tide. At this time there would not be more than two feet of water over the intake and consequently it would be much easier, and probably less costly, to raise and examine the pipes.\n\nIn the current year's estimates provision has been made to improve the present water supply system at the Indian village of Alert Bay, and it seems to me that when our engineers are engaged on this work that it would be a good time to examine the intake of the fire fighting system of the school, provided of course the improvements to the village supply system are undertaken before the commencement of the school term in September.\n\nIn addition to the work at Alert Bay our engineers will in all probability be going up the coast in connection with work at Port Simpson, Kitkatla and Greenville, and could stop off at Alert Bay and examine the water intake at the school at that time. The question of probable costs was discussed with Mr. Warren.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nwho suggested that $100.00 be appropriated for the purpose. This amount, of course, may not be required, but it would be as well to make provision to that extent.\n\nI should appreciate receipt of your instructions in this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa,\nApril 13, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant enclosing correspondence dealing with the fire fighting pump intake at the Alert Bay Indian residential school.\n\nFrom the information contained in the letters that you forwarded I am inclined to feel that possibly no heavy expenditure will be necessary to remedy conditions. For this reason I hesitate to arrange to have an officer of the engineering service go to the school because such action would involve considerable expense for travelling. Would it not be possible to secure some local man to examine the intake and make a recommendation regarding what is required?\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. W. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding herewith, for attention, correspondence dealing with the fire fighting pump intake at St. Michael's Indian Residential School, Alert Bay. The correspondence is self-explanatory, and need not be reviewed by me.\n\nThe situation is one that should be attended to without great delay, and I would recommend that the engineering Branch be authorized to make the necessary examination and carry out such repairs as may be found necessary to put the system in proper working order.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOffice of the Indian Agent\n\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nMarch 20, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find copy of correspondence received from Principal Anfield of St. Michael's Residential School, Alert Bay, in connection with fire prevention facilities, which will be self-explanatory.\n\nI gather from Mr. Anfield's letter there is something defective in the intake valve. It is noted the Engineer states in his report he has taken the pump apart three times to remove stones which have been carried up the pipe and become wedged in the impeller. He also states if the end of the pipe line is raised, the stones, if any, will roll down to the joint, and then back to the valve when it is lowered, also the swivel join, if badly corroded might leak if disturbed.\n\nNot being an engineer I am not in a position to make any definite recommendation as to how this should be repaired, but it is evident something must be done in the interests of fire protection.\n\nMr. Anfield states the Commission is of the opinion that this would come under the heading of major repairs, and would thereby constitute a charge on the Department. Personally, I am not in a position to make a recommendation either one way or the other in that respect, but the correspondence is being passed on to you and I would kindly ask that you refer the matter to our Engineering Department with a view to having it repaired at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"M. S. Todd\"\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\nMarch 16th, 1939.\n\nReport on Fire Pump Intake.\n\nIntake at low tide in six feet of water; time taken to prime pump, 12 minutes at half tide.\n\nThere seem to be stones in the intake valve and they prevent the flapper from closing. To clear it, it will have to be taken up by bending at the swivel joint, or by breaking one of the joints in the line and floating it out.\n\nIf it is raised the stones will roll down to the joint, and then back to the valve when it is lowered, also the swivel join, if badly corroded might leak if disturbed.\n\nI have taken the pump apart three times to remove stones which have been carried up the pipe and had wedged in the impeller.\n\nThe new fitting installed for service to the Preventorium cannot be used until the pump is running which means running about 700 feet of hose from the nearest hydrant.\n\n(Sgd) W.

C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to Departmental circular 502-606, file 150-65 of February 10th, 1938, issued by the Director of Indian Affairs in connection with fire prevention facilities at Residential Schools, it is necessary that the condition of the fire fighting pump intake at this school be reported to the Department forthwith, and a request made for remedial action.\n\nFor some time past it has been obvious that the time taken to put this pump into full operation has been gradually increasing, and the time is approaching when a very dangerous situation might result. If, for any reason, our domestic tank should be less than half full, it is very doubtful if this pump could be primed in time to supply water to the hydrants before the domestic tank ran dry.\n\nAttached please find copy of report on this matter submitted to me by the school engineer. There is undoubtedly something holding the intake valve open, and it would seem that the advice of the Department's engineers should be taken before any attempt is made to check this by lifting the intake at the swivel joint. The pump has never failed to supply water to the hydrants, but the time involved in getting it through is dangerously long, and it will be appreciated if you will look this over at your convenience and advise the Department that in our opinion a situation exists which should be looked into by them without delay.\n\nThe Commission is of the opinion that this would come under the heading of major repairs, and would thereby constitute a charge on the Department.\n\nThanking you for your interest in this matter,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOffice of the Kwawkewlth Indian Agency,\n\nMarch 11th, 1939.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 363,\n\namounting to $15.95 in favour\n\nof H. McQuaig, Esq., Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nfor labour in repairing roof of school block, Alert Bay Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental wire dated November 16th, 1938, to Indian Commissioner D.M. MacKay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nof Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. 516\nThe Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nUnder date of July 21st the Commission has directed that a list of the requirements at the School which it is considered that the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of the Interior, should be expected to supply next year, be placed before you for consideration and incorporation in your estimates for the fiscal year, 1939-40.\n\n1. Two new engines to replace the present lighting plant and batteries.\n\n(a) One 6 H.P. single cylinder Lister, full diesel, 4 cycle solid injection engine, price - $350.00\n\n(b) One 12 H.P. 2 cylinder, Lister, full diesel, 4 cycle, solid injection engine, price - $590.00\n\nFreight, cartage, etc., $30.00\n\n$1,000.00\n\nIn connection with these items it should be remembered that they will replace the present units and will do away entirely with batteries, the present set of which is just about finished. It is doubtful if the present batteries will last the winter without giving serious trouble and it would appear the wiser policy to save the continued purchase of batteries at this school every five years at a cost of $600.00 or $700.00 per installation, and at the same time do away with the fire risk of the present gasoline-driven plant. Bids on these engines are attached hereto with full explanatory notes.\n1a. Failing the installation of diesel engines, it is imperative that new batteries be provided at the opening of the next fiscal year, and bids are attached hereto as follows:\n\nScyle Batteries, Limited, Vancouver, B.C.\nprice f.o.b. Alert Bay, $750.00\n\nMcLennan, McFeely & Prior, Limited,\nVancouver, B.C., price f.o.b.\nAlert Bay, 912.80\n\nIt is hoped, however, that the Department realizes that battery driven plants are now almost a thing of the past, and further expense in this line will be avoided by the installation of diesel engines.\n\n2. An increased per capita grant for 10 pupils at $160.00 per capita, less 5%. $1,710.00\n\nThe need of this has been placed before the Department repeatedly, as we have been carrying this number of extra pupils for many years in an effort to take care of an ever increasing number of cases urgently requiring admission to this school. Dr. R. A. Hoey, Superintendent of Welfare and Training, promised favourable consideration to this item in last year's estimates, and it is considered we have a just claim on the Department for early and favourable consideration of this matter.\n\n3. V-Joint for Dormitories. $52.05\n\nWith the waterproofing of the walls on the east face of the building attention should be given next year to the walls of the dormitories on this side of the school in order to prevent the plaster from falling down. The entire metallic lath behind this plaster has rusted completely, and it is proposed to put strapping on the walls and V-jointing them at a material cost of $52.05, the bid from Telegraph Cove Mills, Limited, Alert Bay. An alternative bid from the H. J. Wells Lumber Company, Limited, $105.00, is also submitted. Unless a complete re-plastering job is to be avoided, this work should be done without fail next summer.\n4. Repiling of School dock. $200.00\n\nBid received from Mr. Goodrows of Beaver Cove, B.C. This wharf will fall down within a year if the work is not undertaken as most of the piles are down to a very small diameter through the action of toridos and under water growth.\n\n5. Waterproofing and painting of the entire east, south and west walls of the school, estimated cost based on the cost of the surface done this summer $2,100.00\n\n6. Re-shingling of the roof and exterior painting of classroom block, materials and labour. $475.00\n\nThis building which is used as a classroom block was formerly the Girls' Home, built in 1912. It is well worth saving, and the amount required would put the exterior in good shape for at least ten years further service.\n\n7. Potato peeler, food grinder and mixer. $575.00\n\n8. Hot water storage tank, Hi-Test hot water heater, Inglis Supreme boiler, for classroom block - These three items installed and operating complete as per tender attached from Summerfield's Limited, Vancouver, at a total cost of $1,529.00\n\nBoth the hot water storage tank and the present hot water heater are leaking and have been recommended for replacement by the Boiler Inspector. The steam boiler at the classroom block was permitted operation by the Boiler Inspector three years ago for only two more years, and I am certain that this year he will put in a strong report condemning it. It is cracked right down the front and is unsafe.\n\nAlternative bids on this equipment from Crane, Ltd, Vancouver, B.C., and Marshall Wells B. C. Limited, Vancouver, B. C. are included, but it should be noted that these bids do not include installation.\n9. Steel canopy for kitchen range in main building at an installed price of $60.00\n   As per bid of Summerfield's Limited, Vancouver, B.C., attached.\n\nIt is considered that the heat in the kitchen is detrimental to the health of the children and staff employed therein, and that a proper canopy which is almost standard practice in every institution and hotel kitchen should be installed without delay.\n\nAs practically no provision was made for the requirements included in last year's estimates, it is earnestly hoped that more favourable consideration will be given to this year's requirements, and the above items are commended to you and the Department for your earnest consideration.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. It is presumed that such items as Manual Training Supplies, salary grant for Instructor, and the m.n per capita grants are automatically included in your estimates and do not need to be specified in this list.\nHOFFARS LIMITED\n1790 Georgia Street West\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nAug. 2, 1938.\n\nAlert Bay Indian Residential School,\nc/o Rev. Anfield, Supt.\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nTo modernize your existing gasoline driven Light Plants we have the following alternatives to offer you:\n\n(1) FIT DIESEL ENGINES TO THE PRESENT GENERATORS\n\n(2) ONE GENERATOR TO BE DRIVEN BY TWO ENGINES\n\n(3) TWO DIESEL DRIVEN UNITS\n\nBy installing Diesel driven equipment it will be more economical than purchasing batteries. The average life of batteries is 4 to 5 years, and as a standard set of 110 Volt batteries cost approximately $600 to $700.00, this means a yearly charge of over $100. per year. Diesel Engines on the other hand, operating on less than one-half pint of diesel fuel per hour, it is more economical to have a small unit running to supply required current. We are pleased to quote you as follows:\n\n(1) We could supply you with suitable diesel engines, direct connected to your present generators. The writer measured up your bases on his recent visit to Alert Bay so know that the physical dimensions of the recommended Diesels will fit on your present bases. We would propose supplying for the small unit, one 6 H.P. Single Cylinder, Lister, full Diesel, 4 Cycle solid injection engine. Price FOB, Warehouse, Vancouver..........................$390.00\n\nFor the large unit, one 12 H.P. 2 Cylinder, Lister full Diesel, 4 Cycle, solid injection engine. Price FOB, Warehouse, Vancouver..........................$590.00\nAlert Bay Indian Residential School #2.\n\nThese engines would give you the same capacity as your present gasoline driven plants. If these engines were installed, it would only be necessary for you to disconnect the automatic relays on your present switchboards. For your maximum load both engines could be run in parallel, for three-quarter load the large unit could be used alone, and for day, night or light loads the small engine could be used.\n\n(2) ONE GENERATOR AND TWO ENGINES\n\nFor this installation we would supply one 15 K.W. 110 Volt, direct current compound wound generator. This generator would be driven through suitable Multi-V-Belt drives by two engines. One 8 H.P. Single Cylinder, Lister, full diesel 4 Cycle, solid injection engine, and one 16 H.P. 2 Cylinder Lister, full diesel, 4 Cycle, solid injection engine. The engines would be provided with suitable clutches so that they may be engaged or disengaged at will. Price of this equipment FOB, Warehouse, Vancouver..........................$1985.00\n\n(3) TWO UNITS\n\nWe would propose supplying one 4.5 K.W. 110 Volt, direct current, direct connected unit, and one 9 K.W. 110 Volt direct current, direct connected unit. These units would be driven by one 8 H.P. Single Cylinder, Lister, and one 16 H.P. 2 Cylinder, Lister, full diesel, 4 Cycle solid injection engines respectively. Price FOB, Warehouse Vancouver........$2275.00\n\nShould you decide to install either of the last two propositions, we would be pleased to allow you a trade-in value of $400.00 on your two existing plants.\n\nWe enclose such descriptive literature on these engines which we think will be of interest to you. We also enclose a blueprint showing the general arrangement of one generator driven by 2 engines. This particular drawing was prepared for an alternating current installation, but it will give you a general idea of the proposed set-up. Should you require any further particulars we will be glad to submit them to you.\n\nWe are,\n\nYours very truly,\nHOFFARS LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nSales Engineer.\n\nGVGM:N\nMr. F.

Anfield, Principal, and included in our Estimates on Sheet 9a. It was felt best to forward this correspondence so that the Department will be more familiar with Principal Anfield's requests.\n\nSince the Estimates have been made up, Mr. T.J. Arnall of the Public Works Department has inspected the boilers and equipment at the Residential School, and informs me he is condemning certain heating equipment and that it will have to be replaced before the present winter, as it cannot be used further. Last year Mr. Arnall informed me some of this was in bad shape, and knowing this I went to the school and spent the entire time he was making his inspection with him in order to familiarize myself with his findings.\n\nI have not to date received his report, but I believe when it does come it will be necessary for the Department to take some action in providing heat for what is known as the \"Girls' Home\" now used as a classroom block. This building as the Department knows, is very old, and I am of the opinion it is no longer safe to have open fires burning in the building. I am of the opinion if it is to be used further it should be heated by steam and that no fires should be permitted in the building unless it is made safe from the possible fire hazard. I do not feel I can take the responsibility if this building is continued to be used in its present state.\n\nIf the Department or the Commission do not wish to provide proper heating for this building, I would strongly recommend that the structure be closed for school purposes till such time as the present fire hazard is removed, and would also recommend that the Public Works Department be requested to make a special report as to its condition providing this building comes within their jurisdiction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S.

To the men on the Staff.\n\nEffective October 26th, the present duties of the Manual Training Instructor on fire drills, day and night, are cancelled, and are replaced by the following:\n\nOn an alarm being sounded, you will proceed to the beach fire pump and prime the deep sea water pump, following which you will start the engine and operate the pump until you hear the whistle, signal of one blast, following which you will shut down the engine and pump. Should you hear the whistle blow a series of blasts, operate pump at full pressure, closing relief valve.\nSpecial Instructions (Cont).\n\nThe Manual Training Instructor will take instruction in the operation of the pump and engine from Mr. Ward, the engineer, and must make himself thoroughly acquainted with this equipment as its successful operation at all times is paramount for safety of life and property.\n\nThe School Engineer will be entirely responsible for the fueling and maintenance of this equipment. The job of the manual training instructor is to run it.\n\nThe present duties of the Manual Training Instructor will be taken over by the Farm Instructor who will in future count the boys in the playground, and at night clear No. 4 Dormitory.\n\nThe engineer will in future, on any alarm, day or night, proceed to the domestic pump house and put the same into immediate operation.\n\nThe assistant farmer will take his station below the infirmary and raise the fire ladder to clear patients and staff if ordered so to do, or if the immediate need is obvious.\n\nKindly sign the attached copy as proof of having received and understood these instructions.\n\nI acknowledge having received a copy of the above instructions and understand these.\n\n(Signatures)\n\nApril 27th, 1939 - General Notice to the Staff.\n\nThe copy of letter from Winnipeg herewith makes sad reading. Let us, however, take to heart the request made by Dr. Westgate and shoulder our individual responsibility towards fire danger and risk.\n\nPlease do not delude yourselves into believing that this is a fire proof building, it is far from it, and as much care and watchfulness is required here as would be needed in a building of similar size and frame construction.\n\nWill you please make it your personal and individual responsibility to notify me without fail of anything which you consider contributory to fire risk in or about the school.\n\nMay 9th, 1939. - General Notice to the Staff.\n\nThe attention of the staff is called to the necessity of keeping rags, papers etc., away from the radiators. This creates a definite fire risk which must be avoided at all costs.\n\nTeachers in class rooms are asked to check their stoves and see that the indicator does not go above 4 at any time. Boys playing with these stoves may leave them set in a dangerous position, and teachers should always check the indicator before starting school each session, and before leaving the classroom at the close of the day.\n\nMay I repeat the necessity of reporting anything untoward along the lines of fire hazard or risk. If at any time you notice anything wrong, any smell of burning, make it your business to report it at once to the man on duty, the night-watchman, or the undersigned.\nMay 30th, 1939. General Notice to the Staff.\n\nThe Night Watchman will be laid off as from Thursday morning, May 31st. This means that careful rounds must be made by the staff member on each side on duty at 10.30 p.m. each night.\n\nPlease see that all unneeded lights are out, windows closed in basements and that all taps are shut off. Keep your eyes open for possible fire risks and see that they are corrected.\n\nThe farmers will be responsible for late rounds at the barn. Will all staff members please pay special attention to lights after 10.30 p.m. Put them out wherever you see them unrequired.\n\nPrincipal.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJune 14, 1939.\n\nSir,\n\nOn June 13th, 1939, at approximately 3:30 A.M. I was awakened by a resident of Alert Bay stating that Mr. Anfield had sent out a telephone call that the Residential School was on fire. I immediately proceeded to the School, arriving there at approximately 4 o'clock.\n\nI found all the children and supervisors were out of the building, wrapped in blankets, and the rest of the staff were fighting the fire which at that time was under control but still burning in the walls and floors of one dormitory and the boys' sitting room. I remained at the school till approximately 7 A.M., when the fire was extinguished, doing what I could to assist in clearing up the debris in order that the school could resume its normal activities. I then arranged with Mr. Anfield Principal, to hold an investigation into the cause of the fire at 10 o'clock, and returned to the Indian Office and sent the following wires to the Department at Ottawa and the Indian Commissioner's office respectively:\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nReporting fire boys' dormitory and cloakrooms Residential School here early this morning. No personal injury. No interference classrooms. Maximum estimated cost labour and material One Thousand Dollars. Local labour and material available. Request authority for urgent repairs. Holding investigation cause of fire. Report following.\n\nM.S. Todd.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner, Vancouver.\n\nAlert Bay, June 13th.\n\nFire early this morning Residential School. No personal injury. Have advised Ottawa requesting immediate repairs. Maximum estimate One Thousand Dollars.\n\nM.S. Todd.\n\nAt 10 A.M. I returned to the School with Miss Thompson, clerk-stenographer, and questioned different members of the staff privately, and I enclose you herewith copy of their respective statements. I also enclose correspondence from Principal Anfield re Notices and Regulations of the School in regard to fire, which will be self-explanatory.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nIn my opinion the fire was caused by spontaneous combustion of oily rags left in the rubbish box in the sitting room of the junior boys. The statements made by Miss Bailey and Miss Sainsbury will be self-explanatory in this respect.\n\nAs a large portion of the floors in the dormitory and sitting room were burned entirely, it was considered urgent that immediate repairs should be made in order for the school to carry on, and I so advised the Department in my wire. At the time the wire was sent I had not had an opportunity to make a careful estimate of the cost of repairs nor could I tell at that time exactly what would be necessary owing to the condition of the building, and therefore stated in my wire One Thousand Dollars would be the maximum amount required for repairs. Since then, however, I have carefully examined all the damage and find the cost is going to be much less than originally estimated. Although we have not had time to get prices on material, it is felt from Three to Four Hundred Dollars will purchase all the material required, and Mr. Anfield has just now told me if the Department would provide this material at once, the Manual Training class will undertake to make the repairs before school closes.\n\nThe Residential School closes next week, and if the Department would approve of letting us purchase the material locally at once, we will be able to have most of the repairs done by the Manual Training Instructor and his class and this would save the Department considerable money, but if this cannot be arranged then I would recommend that the work be done by contract or day labour and completed as quickly as possible.\n\nThis report and recommendation is being forwarded the Department by \"air mail\" in order that we may have an early reply in case the Department can see their way clear to have the work done by the Manual Training class, in which case I would ask the Department to advise me by wire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\nENQUIRY BY M.S. TODD, INDIAN AGENT, INTO FIRE\nat\nST. MICHAEL'S RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nAlert Bay, B.C.\non\nJune 13th, 1939\n\nStatement by Mr. F.E. Anfield, Principal:\n\nI was awakened at 3:30 A.M. today by the ringing of the fire alarm in my residence. I proceeded to the main school with a flashlight, and went to the office and picked up a megaphone, then proceeded to both sides of the school and observed that children were already filing down the fire escapes. I then went over to the boys' side to ascertain the cause of the alarm, and on opening the door of the Lower School boys' sitting room, discovered one corner of the room in flames, with a great deal of smoke evident. I then unhooked the hydrant hose on the main floor, turned on the water, and directed the nozzle to the base of the fire, left the hose there running, and went out and made sure that the correct count of children had been reported.\n\nI then went back to the source of the fire with the fire-fighting squad of boys and the Assistant Farm Instructor, whom I ordered to hook up the outside hydrants. I went back into the building and directed a stream of water from the inside hydrant on the fire, which was quickly put under control as far as danger to the loss of the building was concerned. By this time the main fire fighting pump was in operation and we put two main lines into the building and fought the fire from the basement toilet on the boys' side. I had also instructed the Head Matron to remove four patients from the Infirmary; had also observed the school Engineer was on the job with the domestic school pump whilst the Manual Training Instructor was in charge of the fire pump which took approximately thirty-five minutes before delivery of water was affected. This was reported to me by both the Engineer and the Manual Training Instructor.\n\nAt approximately 3:50 A.M. I called the local telephone system fire alarm and was answered by Mrs. Studly whom I requested to pass the call along. By 4 A.M. the fire was under control. I then instructed the men to cut open certain parts of the floors and ceilings of the sitting room; the interiors were flooded with water.\n\nThe action of children and staff in vacating the building was carried out most admirably; there was no panic or excitement of any kind in spite of the large volume of smoke in the dormitories on the boys' side. As soon as the fire was completely under control the children were returned to the dormitories, and a strict watch kept on the location of the fire. Hot cocoa was provided for the children working on the fire. All children whilst outside were covered with blankets; the weather was fine, and warm. By 6:30 everything was back to normal and the water all cleaned up, and the school is now functioning as usual.\n\nFrom my observation I conclude that the fire started in a rubbish box in the corner of this sitting room. This room is immediately above the basement of the school and below the junior boys' dormitory.\nNo damage to equipment resulted from this fire, but I would estimate that damage amounting to One Thousand Dollars was done to the structure. The ceiling of the boys' downstairs toilet end of the lower school boys' sitting room will have to be replaced, and quite a lot of new joists, studding and flooring have to be put in, as well as painting. The boys' clothing room and upstairs dormitories will have to be redecorated due to smoke damage and paint blisters.\n\nA night watchman was not on duty, he having been laid off on the 30th of May. It is customary at this school to engage a night watchman from October to the end of April, but in view of the worry caused by the loss of our Carcross School, I requested the Commission to put this man back on duty for the month of May, particularly in view of the special ceremonies in connection with the King's visit to British Columbia, which brought extra people passing through. So far as a Night Watchman is concerned I may say so far as I am aware the Department pays a grant for a night watchman for schools which are considered fire risks. I however took the stand that this school was not a fire-proof building, and years ago requested a night watchman for at least the six months of winter when the furnaces were kept going all night. It is my belief, however, that a night watchman should be on duty in this school for the entire term and I have arranged for him to return to duty tonight.\n\nI would like to file herewith copy of Instructions to all staff members regarding fire drills, etc., and Notices issued recently in connection with danger of fire. That this training has been well done was evident to all this morning. Every child was safely out of the building inside of four and one-half minutes.\n\nIndian Agent Todd:\n\nWhat is your idea of how the fire could start in the rubbish box? Do you think there is a possibility of any of the boys smoking and throwing a cigarette butt in there?\n\nMr. Anfield:\n\nNo, I am certain it was not that, because the big boys have no access to that room. They are not allowed in there, it belongs to the little boys. In any case, this fire which we discovered at 3.30 could hardly have been burning from the time any boy had access to that room as they were all in bed by nine o'clock. If they had thrown a cigarette butt at that time surely it would have been discovered as rounds are made by the man on duty at ten o'clock. My opinion is that oily rags must have been in the box as I believe they oiled the floors yesterday.\n\nIndian Agent Todd:\n\nAre the boys permitted to smoke at all?\n\nMr. Anfield:\n\nNo, and the men on the staff are asked never to smoke on duty and only in their own rooms or in the staff sitting room. All dormitories are locked, and the boys have no access to the lower school boys' sitting room after they go to bed.\n\nI might add too that the electric lighting plant ran well throughout the alarm and at approximately 4.15 I instructed the Engineer to pull the main switch in case the fire should have burned through any connections.\nStatement by Mr. B.G. Chambers, Vice-Principal:\n\nI sleep on the top floor of the building. About 3:30 I was wakened by the boys hammering on No.1 dormitory door. I got up and went down to it, and opened it and found it full of smoke. I then hurried down to the room below it, the lower school boys' sitting room, and on opening the door I could see flames from the floor going to the top of the ceiling. I shut that door, it had been closed, but not locked. When I got up the stairs Miss Turner was on the landing; she had heard the hammering too. I went and opened both dormitory doors No.3 and 4 and put all the lights on in all the dormitories and toilets and then put the fire gang on over on the far wall of No.4 dormitory. Then I unlocked the fire escape doors on No.3 and 4 dormitories and we got the boys out. They went out very quietly from both dormitories, taking a small boy each with them from the lower dormitories. The fire escape door in the lower dormitory was right above the fire.\n\nAfter the boys had left the two top dormitories I made sure that there was no boy in either dormitory or in the toilets. I went round and looked under the beds and all around, then I went down and the ladies asked me to make a second check in No.1 dormitory which I did. Then I followed the boys around to the front of the building and put the fire ladder up to the Infirmary windows and carried three children down the ladder. One boy was able to come down himself. Then I went back to help Mr. Anfield.\n\nMr. Anfield\nDo you think the fire could have started in the toilet below the sitting room?\n\nMr. Chambers\nI do not think so; I think it started right in the corner of the lower school boys' sitting room, close to the fire escape. That is where the flames were going up. The rubbish box is gone entirely, and it is usually in the corner.\n\nIndian Agent Todd\nWhat was the construction of the box?\n\nMr. Chambers\nIt was a tea box, of three-ply.\n\nIndian Agent Todd\nIs there anything else in that room?\n\nMr. Chambers\nThe boys' slicker coat, but they are all there. There is a bench along the wall, the end of it is charred.\n\nMr. Anfield\nDo you think that the fire could have been prevented in any way by having that door locked?\n\nMr. Chambers\nI do not think so, not if it started from what we think it did. Mr. Hill said he was in there about 10:30 so it could not have been from a match or cigarette stub or he would have noticed it.\nMr. Anfield\n\nHave you any suggestions to make in regard to the fire protection system in regard to the removal of children?\n\nMr. Chambers\n\nThe children were perfectly safe getting out and were very quiet and orderly, but I did think if we had a man at the foot of the fire escape it might be a help in a really serious case. One thing I would suggest would be to have some kind of mask a person could put on in case of emergency to check the children. I thought that this morning when I went into that room; if there had been children in it you would have to get them, and if the smoke had been a little bit thicker you could not do anything.\n\nMr. Anfield\n\nHave you fire instructions posted in your room?\n\nYes.\n\nDid you follow them?\n\nYes.\n\nHow long have you been in the School?\n\nNine years and two months.\n\nStatement of Mr. F. Hutchinson, Manual Training Instructor\n\nMy duty in case of fire is to go down and start the sea-water fire pump. At approximately 3:30 this morning I heard the fire bell ringing, and got a few clothes on and ran down and started to prime the fire pump and while I was waiting to prime it I gave the engine a turn over to warm it up, then waited till Mr. Ward came down. About 2 minutes after 4 exactly we had it going. We have to wait until the fresh water gets into it and primes it. If it was efficient it would be primed right off the bat. The tide was very low but I could not see the intake of the pump line. If the pump had been working properly we would not have had any difficulty. I stayed there for three minutes then Mr. Ward told me to come up here and help you out and he looked after it from then.\n\nMr. Anfield\n\nWe are trying to ascertain the cause of the fire. As Manual Training Instructor, did you give out any oil, linseed, or turps yesterday?\n\nMr. Hutchinson\n\nI gave some oil to Miss Bailey to do the floors. A little boy came in and he took the wrong tin; instead of the floor oil he took the linseed oil. Miss Bailey remarked to me after how much further it went, and I explained to her that it was linseed oil instead of the regular floor oil they generally use.\n\nMr. Anfield\n\nI am going to ask you a personal question - what time did you come in last night? Did you notice any smoke or light of any kind as you came in?\n\nMr. Hutchinson\n\nI came in about 12:30, by the back dormitory door. The windows were all closed so I would not have noticed smoke, but I would have seen a glow if there had been one, as it was pitch black. The last time I was in that sitting room was about 6 o'clock last night, I looked in when I came off duty.\nMr. Anfield\nDid you ever see anybody smoke in there?\n\nMr. Hutchinson\nNo.\n\nMr. Anfield\nWhat is the rule?\n\nMr. Hutchinson\nStaff are not permitted to smoke while on duty.\n\nMr. Anfield\nHave you fire instructions in your bedroom?\n\nMr. Hutchinson\nI have; all I did this morning was what I was supposed to do.\n\nMr. Anfield\nThose instructions are in writing?\n\nYes.\n\nMr. Anfield\nHave you any suggestions to make that would improve the system of fire protection?\n\nMr. Hutchinson\nThe only thing is to have a buzzer in the dormitory so that the children could signal the supervisors in a case like this. Also to have one man free to go to the seat of the trouble, to have no other duty.\n\nMr. Anfield\nI consider that my first duty and the first duty of every staff member is to see that the school is clear of children; that they are all safe first, then we can concentrate on the fire, but the children come first.\n\nIndian Agent Todd\nDid you see that box that was in the room yesterday?\n\nMr. Hutchinson\nI just noticed it, I did not see it closely or what was in it.\n\nMr. Anfield\nWhat are those boxes used for generally?\n\nMr. Hutchinson\nJust to keep the room tidy, to thrown dirt and orange papers into. The floors are swept and the dirt and garbage are thrown into it and it is taken away in the morning. They are usually emptied at 6 o'clock at night of the day's rubbish, and it is only the night sweepings that are left over night.\n\nMr. Anfield\nFrom your observation where did the fire originate?\n\nMr. Hutchinson\nIn the corner where that box was kept in the boys' sitting room, immediately under the boys' dormitory, right next to the fire escape door.\n\nMr. Anfield\nHow long did it take you from the time you woke up till you got to the engine?\n\nMr. Hutchinson\nAbout two minutes; I had everything ready, but it took about half an hour to get that pump primed and going. If we hadn't had the fresh water tank full we would not have had a chance. Mr. Ward started the domestic pump first; I can't start my engine until it is fully primed.\nStatement of Miss L. Bailey, Boys' Supervisor\n\nI imagine it was about 3:30, I didn't look at my watch, we heard the boys knock and Miss Finley and I both got up. We heard the door of No.2 dormitory open and Mr. Chambers went in. When we went out of our room Miss Finley went to No.1 and I went to No.2 and found the boys ready to go out with blankets over their shoulders. Miss Finley had opened the fire escape door in No.1 dormitory and Mr. Chambers had opened the one in No.3 and 4; I waited till his boys came down and one big boy took one little boy and we proceeded; we had started when Mr. Chambers had the fire bell ringing. There was no disturbance or any excitement. I counted each boy as they passed and the number was right. They were counted four or five times altogether then we reported to Mr. Anfield.\n\nYesterday morning I oiled the boys' sitting room floor and the two hallways. We did not put much on, we only had about three inches in the nail, just enough to stop the dust. I helped the boys do it. We got the oil from Mr. Hutchinson. I asked for floor oil but I didn't know till the afternoon that the boys had made a mistake and got the wrong kind. I think it was linseed oil they got. We didn't have very much but it went a long way. After we finished our floors I asked Miss Sainsbury if she would like the boys to help her do her classroom floor and at 4 o'clock we went to her room, she was there too, and we took the cloths we had used and wiped them over her floor. We used every bit of oil up, in fact the cloths were almost dry when we finished, but they were very dusty. When we got through Miss Sainsbury remarked to me about being careful of the rags, so I said to the boys \"Put them in the garbage can\" and I said \"Be sure and put them outside\", and Miss Sainsbury said \"Yes, put them outside\". We stressed the point. The boys went and put the rags away, and they came back and said \"We have finished, Miss Bailey\". I said \"Did you do what I said\", and they said \"Yes\". By this time prayer bell had gone.\n\nAfter supper we tidied up our sitting room, swept the floor and picked up anything around. We had emptied the garbage can in the afternoon so we put the dirt in the garbage can. The boys did the sweeping up. I didn't look into the can, I didn't know they had put the rags in there. We usually empty the garbage can at night, but there wasn't any dirt. I got my boys this morning and asked them if they put the rags in the inside garbage box or in the outside can, and they told me in the box.\n\nMr. Anfield\n\nThank you Miss Bailey for your very frank statement. What we wanted to know was how the fire started and if there was any possibility of incendiary action. It would appear it was spontaneous combustion with all the dust on the rags down in the bottom of the box.\nMr. W. Hill, Assistant Farm Instructor.\n\nMr. Anfield You were on duty last evening?\n\nMr. Hill Yes.\n\nQ. Did you make rounds?\nA. Yes, at 10.30.\n\nQ. Did you visit the lower boys' sitting room?\nA. Yes, it was the first place I went to. I closed the windows.\n\nQ. Did you notice this garbage box?\nA. No, not particularly; I went in with my flashlight.\n\nQ. Was there any sign of fire?\nA. No. I noticed the smell of the newly oiled floor.\n\nQ. You have read these Notices put up recently about fire?\nA. Yes, I have.\n\nQ. Did you lock the door of the room?\nA. No, I closed it but did not lock it.\n\nIndian Agent When you make your rounds do you ever look into any of these waste paper boxes inside the building?\n\nA. No. Last night was my first night that I made the rounds. I am new at the school and Mr. Coulard has been making the rounds but our duties have been changed.\n\nQ. You did not see any boys around the school last night after 9 o'clock?\n\nA. No, they were all in bed. I was upstairs with the boys till 10 o'clock, then I came down and Mr. Chambers was there. He said he would be up there. I made rounds at 10.30. I went to the kitchen and the boys' basement downstairs, everything was alright.\n\nMiss Sainsbury, Teacher\n\nMr. Anfield We would like you to answer a few questions, about the oil that was used yesterday.\n\nMiss Sainsbury Miss Bailey came to me and said she was going to have the floors oiled, and asked if I would like to have my classroom done. I said it was very dusty and some oil might improve it. At 4 o'clock she came and said could we do it then because she didn't want to keep it she would send it back to the Manual Training Shop if there was any left and I didn't want it. So she came in with two boys, there was very little oil left in the bottom of the pail. We got the rags she had used and they did the floor. There was only enough to do the front part of my classroom. When we finished, I said to her \"Be careful about the rags, where are they going to put them?\" She said, \"outside\".\nI said, \"You know I am very frightened about rags; I never have them in my classroom because I am afraid they might explode or something\". She said, \"We will put them outside in the garbage can\".\n\nIn the evening I went back to my classroom after I came off duty and I thought I smelled an odor; it did not seem like fumes, it was just a strong smell of oil. I went into the boys' sitting room and said to Miss Finley \"I think I will open these windows but they have to be closed at ten o'clock and I do not think I will be in my classroom. There seems to be a strong odor around here\". I asked her who was on duty and she said \"Mr. Hill\". I saw Mr. Hill and if he would see that the windows were closed and he said he would.\n\nDuring the time I was in my classroom Mr. Anfield came to the door and I noticed when he opened the door there was a strong odor and I wondered if it was in my classroom or outside. I went to the register and smelled it and it wasn't there and then I spoke to Mr. Anfield. I was not really worried about fire but it was on my mind because of this odor, but I remembered about the floors. I went to bed about 10.30 and was up when the bell rang, I did not smell anything, I am on the girls' side and the control door was closed.\n\nMr. W. Hill, Assistant Farm Instructor\n\nIndian Agent\nWhen you went into the room last night to close the windows did you smell a strong odor in there?\n\nMr. Hill\nYes, I noticed it but I thought it to be the newly oiled floors. It was not very strong, I presume the windows being open had killed it. I went straight to the windows and closed them.\n\nIndian Agent\nMr. Anfield, is it customary to oil the floors in the school?\n\nMr. Anfield\nYes, the floors on the boys' side and the auditorium where there is hard wear are oiled about four or five times a year.\n\nMr. W. Ward, Engineer\n\nMr. Anfield\nYou used the other water supply first, the domestic supply?\n\nMr. Ward\nYes, I went straight up to that pump and then down to the other pump house.\n\nIndian Agent\nDid you have any difficulty getting the water in the pump?\n\nMr. Ward\nYes, \"Hutch\" was down there from about 3.30; it was just after 4 when we got it pumping.\n\nQ.\nWhat is the cause of the delay?\n\nA.\nIt is the priming; it is caused through the faulty intake.\nIndian Agent\nHow long has this situation existed?\n\nMr. Ward For the last eighteen months it has gradually been getting worse.\n\nIndian Agent\nWas the domestic pump running all the time?\n\nMr. Ward Yes; as soon as I was notified I went up and it started in a couple of minutes. I make it a point that that tank is full every night; it was full last night at 10 o'clock. The capacity is 15,000 gallons.\n\nIndian Agent\nDid the equipment work alright when you got it working?\n\nMr. Ward Yes, except that it is hard to prime and towards the end it lost its prime and would not pump enough.\n\nIndian Agent\nIf this intake is repaired, will it be alright?\n\nMr. Ward Yes. If it is repaired it can have full pressure in 45 seconds. The way it is now you just have to wait, and the way it is now there is no fire protection for the Preventorium except our own domestic pump.\nOttawa\nJuly 24, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

C.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn connection with the enclosed letter from the Principal of our St. Michael's School at Alert Bay, B.C., I would strongly recommend that his request for authority to engage the carpenters mentioned to undertake the repairs to that part of the Main School building damaged by fire be granted. As a large saving was effected on the transportation of the graduate pupils, there should not, as far as I am aware, be any serious difficulty in applying the amount thus saved to the repairs in question.\n\nAs it is important that the repairs should be completed before the school reopens in the autumn, I would further recommend that authority to engage the carpenters mentioned be telegraphed at once to Mr. Indian Agent Todd.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW/WH\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nEnclosure\nMr. F. EARL ANFIELD  \nPrincipal  \n\nST. MICHAEL'S SCHOOL  \nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\n11th July, 1939.\n\nThe Secretary,  \nIndian Residential School Commission,  \nM.S.C.C.,  \n38-43 The Bible House,  \n184 Alexander Avenue, East,  \nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFurther to correspondence regarding the damage done in the recent fire at this school, attached please find copy of letter from the Indian Agent, Alert Bay, of even date. You will note that the School is expected to supply the labour and in this connection it is necessary to make the following statement:\n\nOn the date after the fire, i.e., on June 14th, I interviewed Mr. Indian Agent Todd and informed him that the School Manual Training Instructor, and a class of twelve boys, were prepared and willing to do this work provided that authority was issued to purchase materials immediately. I notified Mr. Todd officially that the school would be closing inside of ten days, and that if action was not taken at once, we would be unable to carry this out. I understand from Mr. Todd that on June 17th authority was wired from Ottawa to make the necessary purchases. The material is just starting to arrive now, almost one month from the date of the fire.\n\nThe Manual Training Instructor is away on his Summer School course, following which he will take two weeks vacation. We have no boys in school capable of undertaking this work without skilled supervision. The few boys we have in school are kept more than occupied on the farm and other essential work at the school. All the boys really capable of doing this work are on vacation and most of them are graduates in any case.\nThe Secretary,\nI. R. S. C., M.S. C. C.\n\nUnder the circumstances, it would hardly seem reasonable to expect the school to supply labour for this task, and after consultation with the Indian Agent, I would ask that you lay this matter before Ottawa forthwith with the request that authority be telegraphed to engage two men to proceed with this work immediately.\n\nMy estimate for labour was two men, 15 days each at $5.00 a day, total $150.00. Every effort will be made to have the job completed within or less than the estimated time. It is imperative that the work be placed in hand at once as there are gaping holes in the floors and charred walls in the basement and sitting rooms affected, not to mentioned the water-spoiled walls.\n\nI am sure that Ottawa does not realise that there has been such a delay somewhere and that the only material so far received is the sheet metal ceiling which arrived last week.\n\nThe Department authorized a grant of $145.00 to pay the fares of graduating pupils, and it may help to point out to them that following a strenuous effort, it was possible to get the parents to meet all of this amount but $30.00, leaving $115.00 unspent, which the Department might be able to apply on this work of repair.\n\nThere are two good carpenters available, Mr. Fred Sharpe and Mr. H. McCuaig, both of whom have worked before at this school for the Department. A good helper is also available, a Mr. R. Thompson, who also has worked here before, so any, or all, would be acceptable to the local member, I'm sure.\n\nIf, for any reason, the Department is unable to unwilling to sanction this labour cost, I am compelled to ask immediate authority to engage same and charge to the Commission.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Christianson.\n\nI am enclosing the following accounts in connection with Alert Bay and Sliammon Indian village:\n\nAlert Bay.\n\nGordon & Belyea..................$18.64\n\" \" ..................... 29.43\nGeneral Repair Shop.............. 2.00\nPaylist for labour............... 56.50\nLetson & Burpee, Ltd............. 19.04\nMcLennan, McFeely & Prior....... 20.87\n\nx x x\n\nIt is understood that payment of these accounts will be made by your branch.\n\nT.

Pay-sheets will also be made up showing the hours worked, rate, and amount due, and will be signed by the recipients, and a return made to the Department.

Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDr. McGill,\nIndian Affairs,\n\nPlease see your memorandum of May 13th last, your file 156-0-5, relative to the disposal of the old tubular boiler at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. I should be glad if you would advise me if any further word has been received from Indian Agent Todd in connection with the collection of the purchase price, so that this transaction may be closed.\n\nW.M. Bailey,\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nExtract from Inspector Barry's report on the Alert Bay Indian residential school dated June 27, 1939.\n\nFollowing the late fire at Alert Bay school I have a number of recommendations to make. These will involve the expenditure of a substantial sum of money, and I would ask that such suggestions be taken into consideration in the drawing of the plans for the proposed new residential school in the West Coast Agency.\n\n(a) Two new escapes are required on the ends of the main building. One iron escape of simple design is required from the infirmary in the front of the main building.\n\nThe present escapes follow the general line of the stairs on each side of the school, and it is up the stair well that flames and smoke may be most likely to cut off the escape of the children. Escapes of course should not follow the same general direction down the outside of the school as the stairs do inside. In the present case the whole stair well on the boys' side was full of smoke, and through the fact that the boys and girls from the front dormitories and the supervisors had to pass across the stairs well to gain other dormitories and fire escapes they encountered dangers to which they should not have been exposed.\n\nDoors should be cut between the dormitories on the upper or second floor to allow the children in front dormitories access to the escapes through the rear dormitories on the same floors.\n\nCubicles for supervisors should be constructed in each dormitory. These should be located near the doors to fire escapes. The latter should be kept unlocked and the way to them should be through the supervisors cubicle itself as in many of our schools. No doors in the school should be locked but they should all be protected by electrical alarms as suggested in former reports on different schools.\n\n(Sgd.) Gerald H. Barry.\nOttawa,\nJuly 31, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer you to your letter of May 27 and Mr. Hoey's reply of June 3 in connection with the purchase of two engines for use at the Alert Bay Indian residential school.\n\nWe have been in communication with the Purchasing Branch in connection with securing these engines for some weeks and Mr. Bailey now requests that you secure tenders from approved sources of supply and submit the same for our consideration.\n\nI might add that when the request was first forwarded to us through Indian Agent Todd's office it was stated that the following were required:\n\n1 - 6 H.P. single cylinder Lister, full diesel, 4 cycle solid injection engine\n\n1 - 12 H.P. 2 cylinder, Lister, full diesel, 4 cycle, solid injection engine.\n\nThe Principal had secured a price of $1000.00 from Hoffars Limited, 1790 Georgia Street West, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.

At the present time he is moving his boat building establishment from one location to another and as he cannot use it until he gets settled in his new quarters, I am inclined to think this is the cause of the delay in not paying for it, as he has no place to which to move it at the present time.\n\nI would suggest that you leave the matter in abeyance for a short time longer and if he does not pay for it as soon as he takes up his new location, I will write you giving a definite recommendation at that time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.

At the present time he is moving his boat building establishment from one location to another and as he cannot use it until he gets settled in his new quarters, I am inclined to think this is the cause of the delay in not paying for it, as he has no place to which to move it at the present time\".\n\nNo further information has been received from Mr. Todd, with respect to this boiler.

As soon as these tenders are received they will be submitted to the Department for consideration, which should be within the course of the next few days.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

The absence of inlet and exhaust valves in the cylinder head, which is of strong symmetrical design, leads to freedom from breakdown due to loss of compression or cracked cylinder heads. The water spaces are readily accessible for cleaning.\n\n2. Bearings are of ample size having considerable margin over load requirements.

The absence of inlet and exhaust valves in the cylinder head, which is of strong symmetrical design, leads to freedom from breakdown due to loss of compression or cracked cylinder heads. The water spaces are readily accessible for cleaning.\n\n2. Bearings are of ample size having considerable margin over load requirements. The material used is of the highest quality specially selected for the required duty.\n\n3. Lubricating oil is supplied by a Calibrator lubricator, under pressure, to the cylinders as well as to the large and small end bearings. There is no fuel dilution of the lubricating oil.\n\nThe fuel consumption is, we believe, lower than that of any other engines of the same power and can be taken at working load not to exceed 0.40 to 0.45 pints per b.h.p. hour.\n\nThe Engines are rated well within their maximum power and conform to B.S.I. conditions in this respect.\n\nWe recommend them with assurance, based upon long experience, to all requiring power for any purpose.\nSMALL DIESEL ENGINES\n\n5 to 20 B.H.P.\n\nFor working on Gas Oil, Shale Oil, Diesolene and similar light Fuel Oils.\n\nSTATIONARY ENGINES.\n\n| Description | Type | Horse Power | Speeds R.P.M. | Maximum Cyclic Variation | Cwt. | Approximate Weights | Gross Kg. | Net.

The chief leader, thirty-five horsepower Vivian diesel will supply the power and the tribesmen are doubling the capacity of the previous plant.\n\nThis is a climax to a series of achievements going back three generations. They have transformed primitive Indian encampments into what has every appearance of a white settlement. Many years ago, Cape Mudge village on Quadra Island, home of the Cape Mudge natives, was just a selection of wooden, windowless shacks unmarked by any sign of civilization. Today, the village is a thriving community, particularly that of the present Chief Billy Assu, its amenities include electric light, a modern water system and a community hall.\n\nChief Billy Assu, now sixty-five years old, has seen most of his life's work done from behind a big modern house built of cedar with a high protective wall. Now he has a modern home with electric light, bath and radio. When he was ten years old, he went to school, but his father was working for one of the farmers. While he was watching a ship unload, a barrel fell over him. He picked up some of the white stuff that fell out and crammed it in his mouth. That was his first taste of sugar.\n\nWhen he was twenty-five he became a chief and then he married my late famous missionary, Thomas Crosby, and became a Christian. Next year the first white missionary came to Cape Mudge. His name was Mr. Wilson and he was Mr. Crosby, and he remained in the district forty years. Under the guidance of Mr. Wilson and the influence of his wife, the Cape Mudge Indians rapidly progressed into the prosperous community they are today.\n\nBilly is one of the picturesque characters of the old-time Indians. His wise and able leadership of his tribe was honoured in 1937 when he was presented with one of three Coronation medals given to British Columbia natives. The decoration was given to him by M. S. Todd, Indian agent at Alert Bay. The silver medal bears an inscription which reads: \"By command of His Majesty King George VI, Chief Billy Assu is decorated with this Coronation medal in recognition of services rendered to the Indian people.\"\n\nChief Billy has three sons and one Dan, is a leader in the United Church at Cape Mudge.\n\nWhen you drive along the Island Highway in the evening and the lights at Campbell River turn on, you see the lights twinkling from the houses on Quadra Island across the swift waters of Discovery Passage, a memorial to the progress of the last three generations and another example of what these natives hope to continue to do in the future.\n\n\"GIVE ME A VIVIAN\"\n\n\u2014Says Capt. J. Shannon\n\n\"Give me a sturdy boat and a Vivian,\" says Captain Jack Shannon, owner of the Shannon J., and leave the rest to me.\" He is so well satisfied with the performance of his 3 cylinder, 60 horsepower Vivian diesel that next year he is building\u2014the Shannon M\u2014will be fitted with a 4 cylinder, 80 horsepower model.\n\nJack's father was the pioneer otter trawler on Quadra Island. He knew four sons and a grandson carry on the tradition he started in 1912. Traditionally, trawling for ground fish was done on big boats with a cumbersome pole which often proved dangerous in a pitching boat. Even now, as fishermen know, the \"otter board\" call for speed is vital in handling. The boat must maintain a steady pull of 1\u00bd to 2 knots so that the net rests on the bottom; go too fast and the boards may come off the bottom; too slow and the boards may get stuck deep in the mud. So Jack turns to Vivians for an engine that gives him steadily, even power for long periods of towing.\n\nOne great feature of Jack's new engine is its Wide Drive. This is a special Vivian feature. The Wide Drive is built in at the back of the engine, making the engine more compact and allowing more space below. But Jack, like every other Vivian user, is enthusiastic about his engine as a whole. He has had his 60 horsepower engine for four years, and it is still running away from him. All the time he has never had a moment's delay. Previously, he had two Vivian gas engines, the first of which he bought in 1915. Jack particularly emphasizes the saving made by Vivian Diesels: whereas his operating costs with the gas engines averaged $50 weekly, the Diesel has reduced that figure to $11.\n\n(Continued Over Page)\nGIVE ME A VIVIAN!\n\n(Continued from Over Page)\n\nJack has had his share of pioneering and adventure. He was one of the original pioneers who founded the grey cod fillet curing industry in 1938. Grey cod are caught periodically in large quantities and are fished for by the fish. Prior to 1938 there had been no market for them. Jack turned grey cod to profitable use when he began to cure them for curing.\n\nDaring has claimed him too. Once his vessel was negotiate Seymour Narrows and the man on watch neglected to call Jack and anchor above the Narrows until the tide came. After bucking its way through the Narrows, the tide rip forced the boat over towards Ripple Rock Whirlpool. For several minutes it hung on the edge of the whirlpool, depending entirely on the strength of its engine to fight the current. If the Vivian Diesel had stopped, there could have been no Jack Shannon here today. But the Vivian never faltered and, after the tide eased, took the boat and its occupants safely to port.\n\nLittle wonder that hardy skippers like Captain Jack Shannon have respect for Vivians!\n\nFISHERMAN INSTALLS VIVIAN HIMSELF!\n\nJohn D. Pahl's \"Sherman.\" Powered with a 2 cylinder, 40 h.p. Vivian Diesel.\n\nProof of the simplicity and dependability of the Vivian engine is provided by John D. Pahl, Hartley Bay, owner and operator of the senior Sherman. In most cases it is preferable that installation of expensive diesel equipment be completed by men who specialize in the work. However, the simplicity of the Vivian diesel is such that a very neat installing job can be done by the owner. Eighteen months ago, John Pahl bought a new Vivian Diesel and installed it himself. Today, he writes:\n\n\"During the eighteen months I have had the engine, it has gone 5,500 miles, and never once have we had any trouble. You can see why I am proud of it. During the fishing season, both the boat and the engine are used for fishing. That is why I chose Vivian. My little engine knows how to take care of itself. All we have to do is start up the morning and it runs all day long. Often 15 or 18 hours without a break. When we stop the engine at night there is no need to adjust it for the next day. There is nothing to tune or valves to set. My Vivian looks after itself!\"\n\nJohn Pahl, B.C. fisherman, has good reason to be proud of his Vivian engine. The record speaks for itself. Vivian, however, is only one of the thousands of Vivian users who will tell you why \"THE TREND IS TO VIVIAN ALL OVER THE WORLD.\"\n\nGray & Jack's Fast Stepping \"Sumas\"\n\nOne of the fastest tow-boats in Port of Vancouver service is the 40-foot Sumas, owned by George Jack, a 40-foot ship powered by a 6 cylinder, 120 horsepower Vivian Diesel.\n\nThe Sumas is used extensively to tow and conduct a general towing business. We had heard, some time before, several reports about these boys being able to pull a big string of logs or scows on time, but we had to pin Hugh against the wheel-house of the Sumas before we could get him down his modesty and get him to tell the truth.\n\nTowing 175,000 feet of lumber to Victoria (from Port Ceres) through heavy seas, winds and choppy water didn't seem much of a feat to Gray & Jack, but we got our report from Hugh that they did it. They made an average speed of 3\u00bd miles per hour. Now that isn't much for a big towboat, but the Sumas is not a big boat, only 40 feet long, and when you get 175,000 feet of lumber on the end of the line building up a wind you've got to be careful to make that time.\n\nTo see the Sumas licking it up False Creek you'd think she was going twice as fast. Hugh claims that this illusion is gained by the way she sits in the water, that her draft has been lowered and when she hits it up she pushes the sea away from all sides.\n\nGray & Jack have been doing some experimenting with their Vivian Diesel and they think they've got it just about right for good towing.\n\nGreat boosters for the Vivian engine, Gray & Jack think there's nothing like them. The Sumas was formerly powered by a 60 horsepower Vivian gas engine. It was the remarkable performance put up by this motor that resulted in their buying the big Vivian Diesel.\n\nFor further information, mail this Coupon to\n\nVIVIAN ENGINE WORKS LTD., 1090 West 6th Avenue, Vancouver, B.

The 140-foot, double end ferry will connect the main Okanagan highway, operating between Westbank and Kelowna, B.C., and is to be ready for the 1939 tourist season.\n\nB. C. Fisheries Patrol\n\nBecause of the excellent records of the Vivian in the Vanida, Hemilla Rock II, and Clapra, all in the service of the Dominion Fisheries Department, orders have recently been placed for two Vivian Diesels; an 8 cylinder, 180 horsepower and an 8 cylinder, 180 horsepower, to be installed in the two new patrol vessels. These vessels, 80' 6\" long, the other 87' feet have been planned to withstand the most severe storm conditions on British Columbia's rugged coast. The engines chosen to meet these strict Government specifications was Vivian.\n\nPrince Rupert\n\nThe Prince Rupert Fishermen's Co-operative Association required a new engine for their 90-foot fish packer Aquitie. After an investigation of several makes, the decision at the annual meeting of the board was in favor of an 80 horsepower Vivian Diesel, replacing the present gasoline engine.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nFederal Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nATTN: MR.

It has long passed its experimental stage, and is now used as a power unit in every industry, on all kinds of land and sea transport and in every country in the world.\n\nThe present day mechanical injection oil engine (now known as a Diesel engine) has evolved from the original British patents of Herbert Akroyd Stuart, of 1892, under which the world's first commercially successful oil engine was manufactured at our Grantham Works in 1892. Thousands of engines of this early type were produced at Grantham, and many are still in service.\n\nThe excellent service which these early engines have given has set a high standard, and the proof that this standard has been maintained is provided by the fact that Ruston & Hornsby Ltd. are today the largest manufacturers of oil engines in the British Commonwealth.\nThe Works in which Ruston Oil Engines are produced are up-to-date in every respect. They include a modern foundry, forge, machine, erection and test shop, a well-equipped model works, a laboratory where all materials are tested and a special shop for the manufacture of fuel pumps and atomisers.\n\nA new self-contained section of the works has been erected for the production of the small vertical oil engines described in this publication. This new section includes machine shop, erection, test, painting and despatch all under one roof.\n\nEntirely new equipment has been installed, and the most up-to-date production methods have been instituted in order to provide the greatest possible accuracy of workmanship without the high prices which the high quality of the product would otherwise necessitate.\n\nThe Ruston Foundry has recently been equipped with a mechanised section in which all small castings are produced. The addition of this new section makes the foundry one of the most up-to-date in the country; there is indeed, no foundry in existence that is better able to produce castings of the type needed for small oil engines.\nTable of Sizes\n\n| Mark | R.H.P. | B.H.P. | Type | Cylinder | Piston | Approximate | Approximate | Width of | Base of | Diameter |\n|------|-------|-------|------|----------|--------|-------------|-------------|---------|---------|----------|\n|      |       |       |      |          |        |             |             |         |         |          |\n\nNote\u2014The weights given include engine, exhaust silencer, fuel tank, spanners and standard spares and do not include water or exhaust pipes or foundation bolts.\n\n*The powers of all Ruston oil engines are in accordance with the B.S.I. 12-hour ratings and will maintain this power for 12 hours at a temperature of 75\u00b0 F.*\n\nIn addition, Ruston oil engines will carry the maximum power given in column 3 for periods not exceeding 1 hour.\n\nAllowance in power margin\u20143% reduction for every 1000 ft. altitude over 330 ft. above sea level.\n\n**BEDPLATE AND HOUSING.** Cast iron. Cast in one piece.\n\n**CYLINDER HEAD.** Cast iron. Separate water jacketed casing carries the operating lever and controls combustion chamber valves to promote turbulence, to give complete combustion of fuel and air.\n\n**VALVES.** Heat resisting steel. Overhead type, actuated by push rods. Inlet valve chain driven by enclosed shaft. Exhaust valve chain driven by patented device.\n\n**CYLINDER LINERS.** Close grained centrifugally cast iron.

The gears run in oil.\n\n**FUEL PUMP AND FILTER.** Plunger release type. Easily cleaned but accessible.\n\n**FUEL FILTER.** Fitted to suction and delivery sides of the fuel pump. The filter has an easily removable element.\n\n**GOVERNOR.** Centrifugal, variable quantity type.\n\n**LUBRICATION.** Oil bath type gear type pump. Pump fitted with adjustable relief valve.\n\n**COOLING.** Water cooling by tank or radiator as required.\n\n**TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT.** Set of tools and equipment.\n\n**EXHAUST AND AIR SILENCERS.** Efficient exhaust silencer and a combined air filter and silencer unit.\n\n**DIRECTION OF ROTATION.** Clockwise, looking at the camshaft gear drive end.\n\nSome Features\n\nThe ease with which Ruston engines can be started is due to the design of the combustion chamber and injection system. The engine is turned by hand with the compression released, and after about three turns the fuel pump is brought into action and full compression applied. The engine fires instantly. This applies equally to engines working in tropical climates and to those in cold damp atmospheres.\n\nThe simple, straightforward design of the combustion chamber is responsible for a highly efficient combustion which is reflected in economical working. For the same reason the engine is very clean internally and will run for long periods without decarbonising. A wide range of distillate fuels may be used. In general the specific gravity should not be greater than 0.88 and the viscosity not greater than 50 seconds at 100\u00b0 F. (Redwood No. 1).\nIt is only the work of a few seconds to remove the easily detachable covers to gain access to all working parts, which are protected from dirt and drainage while the engine is running, but which are readily accessible for inspection, cleaning or adjustment.\n\nThis feature together with the adequate filtering of inlet air and fuel, renders these engines suitable for working in dusty or other impure atmospheres.\n\nNote also the robust simplicity of the design.\n\nThe general design of the bedplate and housing, which are formed by a single casting, can be seen in the illustration on this page. The cylinder heads are separate castings carrying the valves, rocking levers and overhead valves.\n\nThe valves are made of special heat resisting steel, and the stems are fitted with hardened renewable steel caps. A useful feature of the cylinder head design is that the atomisers can be removed without draining the water jackets.\n\nRenewable cylinder liners of the wet type are used. They are of centrifugally cast iron and are nitrogen hardened.\n\nSo thoroughly is the hardening done that if one of these liners is broken up, the hardened edges of the fragments are of sufficient hardness to cut glass.\n\nNote the expansion joint formed by two rubber rings round the liner near the bottom.\n\nCast iron pistons are fitted and are provided with three pressure rings and one scraper ring.\n\nThe gudgeon pin is of the floating type which is able to carry with safety greater pressures than a fixed pin could take. Lubrication, moreover, is more certain with a floating pin, which therefore has longer wearing qualities.\n\nThe design and performance of these engines gives free working piston rings and prevents the sticking of rings common in many high speed engines.\nIMPORTANT FEATURES\n\nVALVE STEMS\nfitted with renewable hardened steel caps\n\nATOMISER\nremovable without draining water jacket\n\nSPECIAL EXHAUST VALVE GUIDE\nprevents valve from sticking\n\nCOMBUSTION CHAMBER\nis designed to promote turbulence and to give complete combustion of fuel and instant starting from cold\n\nFLOATING GUDGEON PIN\n\nSPECIAL HARDENED RENEWABLE CYLINDER LINERS\nensuring long life and minimum wear\nRubber ring expansion joint at bottom\n\nVALVE ROCKING LEVERS\nlubricated without removing covers\n\nTOTALLY ENCLOSED VALVE GEAR\n\nCAMSHAFT AND CAMS\nforged solid hardened and ground, operating on hardened steel valve tappets\n\nFORGED STEEL CRANKSHAFT\nwithdrawn from end of housing\n\nGEAR TYPE LUBRICATING OIL PUMP\ngives positive lubrication\nThe fuel is injected by a fuel pump of the plunger-release type.

The fuel pump plungers are actuated direct from the camshaft.\n\nThe atomisers are of simple design and need no attention beyond an occasional cleaning.\n\nThe crankshaft is a solid steel forging, forged in our own works and machined to fine limits. The material is tested in our own laboratory.\n\nThe crankshaft is accurately balanced and is drilled to take the lubricating oil under pressure to the large end bearings.\n\nThe camshaft is of steel and is machined from the solid. The valve cams are hardened and ground. The overhead valves are actuated by rigid push rods and rocker arms mounted on the cylinder head. Valve adjustments are easily made after the removal of the valve cover.\n\nThe fuel oil is filtered twice before it is injected into the cylinder. A filter mounted on the side of the engine strains the oil before it reaches the fuel pump, and a further small filter is placed in the fuel line between the pump and the atomisers.\nThe lubrication is by forced feed from a gear type pump placed below the level of the oil in the sump, and delivering oil through oilways cut in the crankshaft to the main and big end bearings. The cylinder liners are lubricated by splash, whilst the valve gear is lubricated by cups screwed in the valve cover. This method of valve lubrication is extremely simple and avoids the complications of a complete pressure system. The cups can be screwed down whilst the engine is running.\n\n**APPROXIMATE DIMENSIONS**\n\n| Size | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | K | L | M | N | P | Q | R | T | U |\n|------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| IVTO | 2'10\" | 1'4\" | 1'6\" | 1'4\" | 2'10\" | 1'4\" | 1'6\" | 1'4\" | 2'10\" | 1'4\" | 1'6\" | 1'4\" | 2'10\" | 1'4\" | 1'6\" | 1'4\" | 2'10\" | 1'4\" |\n| VTO | 3'7\" | 1'4\" | 1'6\" | 1'4\" | 3'7\" | 1'4\" | 1'6\" | 1'4\" | 3'7\" | 1'4\" | 1'6\" | 1'4\" | 3'7\" | 1'4\" | 1'6\" | 1'4\" | 3'7\" | 1'4\" |\n| VTO | 3'7\" | 1'4\" | 1'6\" | 1'4\" | 3'7\" | 1'4\" | 1'6\" | 1'4\" | 3'7\" | 1'4\" | 1'6\" | 1'4\" | 3'7\" | 1'4\" | 1'6\" | 1'4\" | 3'7\" | 1'4\" |\n| VTO | 3'7\" | 1'4\" | 1'6\" | 1'4\" | 3'7\" | 1'4\" | 1'6\" | 1'4\" | 3'7\" | 1'4\" | 1'6\" | 1'4\" | 3'7\" | 1'4\" | 1'6\" | 1'4\" | 3'7\" | 1'4\" |\n| VTO | 3'7\" | 1'4\" | 1'6\" | 1'4\" | 3'7\" | 1'4\" | 1'6\" | 1'4\" | 3'7\" | 1'4\" | 1'6\" | 1'4\" | 3'7\" | 1'4\" | 1'6\" | 1'4\" | 3'7\" | 1'4\" |\n\nMakers of Successful Oil Engines since 1892\n\nPage Fourteen\n\nSome Installations\n\nRadiator - Coated 5\u00bd B.H.P.

They are 4-stroke compression ignition engines running on the lighter grades of Diesel oils such as those commonly used in \"Diesel-engined\" road vehicles.\n\nThe fuel is today easily obtainable almost everywhere, and since it is non-volatile it is free from spontaneous fire risk, and is not subject to considerable loss through evaporation when stored in comparatively large quantities.\n\nSteady vibrationless running is a feature of these small engines. The exhaust can be effectively silenced, and when the engine is enclosed in a well-built outhouse very little sound can be heard outside. These engines are simple to run and maintain. They start by hand from cold and can be looked after by a chauffeur, gardener, tractor driver, or any intelligent man or youth. Simplicity has been obtained by skilful design and not in any case at the expense of performance. The sectional drawing on the centre page of this leaflet reveals the whole design of the engine and illustrates the robust construction of all parts. Uses for which they are ideal include; the lighting of country houses; providing power for small workshops, dairies, farm buildings, etc.; driving concrete mixers, elevators and conveyors, and other equipment requiring a built-in power unit, and a multitude of other purposes for which a limited supply of power is needed.\nThe ease with which engines in this series can be started is one of their outstanding features. The engine is turned by hand with the compression fully released. When sufficient speed has been attained (usually after 3 turns) full compression is put on and the fuel pump is brought into action. The engine fires instantly.\n\nFactors which contribute to the lasting qualities of these engines are\u2014\n\n1. Smooth running due to sound design.\n2. Freedom from delicate parts.\n3. First-class materials and workmanship.\n4. Rigid inspection during manufacture, including our own laboratory test on materials used.\n\nThe illustration shown above illustrates the simple nature of the engine and its robust construction. Note for example, the straightforward design of the cylinder head also the simplicity of the governor and speeder gear by which the speed of the engine can be varied while running.\n\nThe design of the combustion chamber ensures economical combustion of the fuel. This in turn means low fuel consumption, a clean engine and a clean exhaust. Thus fuel costs and maintenance costs will both be low. The cost for fuel and lubricating oil works out at approximately \u00a31 to \u00a34 per B.H.P. hour.\n\nRUSTON & HORNSBY LIMITED\nLINCOLN ENGLAND\nBRITAIN'S LARGEST MANUFACTURER OF OIL ENGINES\n### TABLE OF SIZES\n\n| Mark | B.H.P. | No. of Cyls. | Revs. | Diameter of Flywheel | Pulley Dia. | Width of Knuckle for Pulley | Dia. and No. of Foundation Bolts | Bore of Water Jet Outlet Pipe | Bore of Exhaust Pipe | Bore of Oil Pipe | Rubber Hose | Number and Size of Water Tanks | Dia. | Height |\n|------|--------|--------------|-------|---------------------|------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|---------------|-----------|--------------------------|-----|--------|\n| IVTO | 5      | 1            | 1000  | 2'-1\" 6\"            | 8\" x 7\"    | 7                           | 357                            | 91                            | 484              | 1\"             | 11\"         | 11\"         | 1                       | 1' 9\" | 5' 0\"  |\n| ZVTO | 10     | 2            | 1000  | 2'-1\" 6\"            | 8\" x 7\"    | 81                          | 446                            | 111                           | 573              | 12\"            | 16\"          | 16\"          | 1                       | 2' 6\" | 5' 0\"  |\n| VSO  | 71     | 1            | 1000  | 2'-1\" 7\"            | 10\" x 9\"   | 10                          | 510                            | 128                           | 650              | 15.9\"          | 19\"           | 51\"          | 44\"          | 1                       | 2' 0\" | 5' 6\"  |\n| 2VSO | 15     | 2            | 1000  | 2'-1\" 7\"            | 10\" x 9\"   | 12                          | 612                            | 142                           | 752              | 15.9\"          | 19\"           | 51\"          | 44\"          | 1                       | 2' 9\" | 6' 0\"  |\n| IVSO | 22\u00bd   | 3            | 1000  | 1' 10\"              | 14\" x 9\"   | 121                         | 624                            | 15                            | 765              | 15.9\"          | 19\"           | 51\"          | 44\"          | 1                       | 3' 3\" | 6' 0\"  |\n| 4VSO | 30     | 4            | 1000  | 1' 10\"              | 14\" x 11\"  | 141                         | 726                            | 17                            | 867              | 15.9\"          | 19\"           | 51\"          | 44\"          | 1                       | 3'10\" | 6' 0\"  |\n\n### APPROXIMATE DIMENSIONS\n\nThe A.

When a special Exhaust pipe layout is to be used please consult us and give us as much information as possible.\nDESCRIPTION OF ENGINE\n\nTHE ENGINE is provided with a specially designed Combustion Head incorporating the \"Lister Patent Combustion Chamber,\" which ensures a positive start from cold by hand without need of Cartridge, Heating Lamp or Electric Ignition. A variable compression ratio initially ensures easy starting and subsequent running at low maximum pressures.\n\nTHE CYLINDER BORE is treated with the LISTARD process of chrome hardening (Van der Horst Patents) which has been proved to give the greatest wear resisting surface yet known, whether the wear may be due to heat, chemical action or abrasion from the piston rings; thus giving a greatly lengthened life throughout which the engine retains its ease of starting, fuel and lubricating oil consumption, and develops rated power.\n\nTHE PISTON AND RINGS are of high grade material, and finished to an accuracy equal to that employed in the finest motor car engine. Long life and full compression are thus assured.\n\nTHE CRANKCASE is totally enclosed and dust proof, making the engine especially suitable for work in dusty and gritty surroundings.\n\nTHE CRANKSHAFT is made from high grade steel, accurately machined and finished by grinding to an accuracy of half of one thousandth of an inch. It is extended beyond the Flywheel on both sides allowing the pulley or coupling to be fitted on either side or if necessary a pulley on each side.\n\nTHE CAM, CAMSHAFT AND ROCKERS are of high grade steel, accurately machined. The working surfaces are hardened and finished by grinding.\n\nTHE CONNECTING ROD is a Steel forging with renewable bearing at both ends. The small end Bush is of Phosphor Bronze and the large end bearing is of Steel Shells lined with white metal.\n\nTHE BEARINGS for Crankshaft are of ample size to provide maximum durability.\n\nTHE VALVES are of the finest alloy heat-resisting steel, and the valve seatings are efficiently water cooled to ensure long life.\n\nFUEL PUMP & FUEL INJECTOR. C.A.V. Bosch Fuel Pump and suitable Fuel injector are fitted.\n\nGOVERNOR is of the centrifugal type and operates on the fuel injection pump, varying the quantity of fuel injected in accordance with the load.\n\nLUBRICATION is automatic. Main bearings are fed by positive plunger pump. Splash and Oil bath lubrication is used for other parts.\n\nGENERAL EQUIPMENT. Tank or radiator to suit requirements, Exhaust Silencer, Air Silencer, Fuel Tank and piping, Starting Handle, Set of Tools, and Fuel Funnel with Strainer where necessary. Tank Cooled Engines ordered without Water Cooling Tanks are supplied with water connections unless contrary instructions are given. Where Radiator cooling is supplied an allowance of 1 h.p. should be made for fan.\n\n| TYPE OF ENGINE | Nett Wgt. | Gross Wgt. | Volume | Code |\n|----------------|-----------|------------|--------|------|\n|                | lbs.      | kgs.       | lbs.   | cu. ft. | cu. m. | Word |\n| 4 h.p.

A variable compression ratio initially ensures easy starting and subsequent running at low maximum pressures.\n\nTHE CYLINDER BORE is treated with the LISTERAL process of chrome hardening (Van der Horst Patents) which has been proved to give the greatest wear resisting surface yet known, whether the wear may be due to heat, chemical action or abrasion from the piston rings; thus giving a greatly lengthened life throughout which the engine retains its ease of starting, fuel and lubricating oil consumption, and develops rated power.\n\nTHE PISTON AND RINGS are of high grade material, and finished to an accuracy equal to that employed in the finest motor car engine. Long life and full compression are thus assured.\n\nTHE CRANKCASE is totally enclosed and dust proof, making the engine especially suitable for work in dusty and gritty surroundings.\n\nTHE CRANKSHAFT is made from high grade steel, accurately machined and finished by grinding to an accuracy of half of one thousandth of an inch. It is extended beyond the Flywheel on both sides allowing the pulley or coupling to be fitted on either side or if necessary a pulley on each side.\n\nTHE CAM, CAMSHAFT AND ROCKERS are of high grade steel, accurately machined. The working surfaces are hardened and finished by grinding.\n\nTHE CONNECTING ROD is a Steel forging with renewable bearing at both ends. The small end Bush is of Phosphor Bronze and the large end bearing is of Steel Shells lined with white metal.\n\nTHE BEARINGS for Crankshaft are of ample size to provide maximum durability.\n\nTHE VALVES are of the finest alloy heat-resisting steel, and the valve seatings are efficiently water cooled to ensure long life.\n\nFUEL PUMP & FUEL INJECTOR. C.A.V. Bosch Fuel Pump and suitable Fuel injector are fitted.\n\nGOVERNOR is of the centrifugal type and operates on the fuel injection pump varying the quantity of fuel injected in accordance with the load.\n\nLUBRICATION is automatic. Main bearings are fed by positive plunger pump. Splash and Oil mist from Big End lubricates all other parts.\n\nGENERAL EQUIPMENT. Tank or radiator to suit requirements, Exhaust Silencer, Air Silencer, Fuel Tank and piping, Starting handle, Set of Tools, Tin of Lubricating Oil and Fuel Funnel with Strainer where necessary. Tank Cooled Engines ordered without Water Cooling Tanks are supplied with water connections unless contrary instructions are given. Where Radiator cooling is supplied an allowance of 1 h.p. should be made for fan.\n\nAPPROXIMATE SHIPPING SPECIFICATION\n\n| TYPE OF ENGINE | Net Wgt. | Gross Wgt. | Volume | Code |\n|----------------|----------|------------|--------|------|\n|                | lbs.     | kgs.       | cu. ft.| cu. m.| Word |\n| 8 h.p.

In the first part of your letter you state that you are not prepared to approve the installation of a 6 H.P. engine and a 12 H.P. engine as requested by the Principal but you recommend, in the latter part of your letter, the purchase of a 6\u00bd H.P. engine and a 13\u00bd H.P. engine as per quotation of A. R. Williams Limited.\n\nDo you consider that these units would be sufficiently powerful to do the work required?\n\nIn suggesting in the second paragraph of your letter the retention of the present engine and the supplying of batteries have you taken into account the fact that our experience shows that batteries only last approximately 3 years at a residential school? The expenditure involved is much heavier than we anticipated and consequently we would like very definite assurance from you before further considering the purchase of the 6\u00bd and 13\u00bd H.P. engines.\n\nIf you refer to official letter of July 31 you will note that it was not stated that Hoffars Limited were on the approved list. We simply advised you that the Principal had secured a quotation from this firm as we thought such information might be a guide to you in obtaining other quotations.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to refer to your letter of July 31 in the matter of the supply of two Diesel engines to replace the 6\u00bd H.P. and 14 H.P. gasoline engines now at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. Mr. Indian Agent Todd in a letter to this office dated August 11th stated that Mr. Anfield recommended that the existing gasoline units be replaced by 6 and 12 H.P. Lister full Diesel engines. The information I have would lead me to conclude that it would be a mistake to replace the existing gasoline engines with the Diesels of the H.P. suggested by Mr. Anfield.\n\nIn the present set-up there is an automatic feature built in the engines and connected to the batteries which starts the engines in operation when the batteries need recharging which lessens the constant attention of an attendant that would otherwise be necessary. The present proposal is, of course, to do away with the use of batteries and install two Diesels directly connected to the present generators. As the engines proposed are of less H.P. than the existing gasoline engines it is extremely doubtful if they could do the work required of them without heavier maintenance costs than we have been called upon to meet with the existing set-up. Unless we are prepared to put in more powerful units than proposed by Mr. Anfield, my opinion is that we would be well advised to retain the engines now in use and supply the batteries required.\n\nTenders received are attached, and summarized as hereunder:-\n\nHoffars Ltd. (Not on approved list) -\n\n| Item                          | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|\n| One 6 H.P. Lister Diesel      | $380.00|\n| One 12 H.P.

Williams Machinery Co. in my opinion are sufficiently powerful to meet our requirements and would no doubt give satisfaction. The expenditure involved is probably higher than the Department has provided for. It will be observed that the units quoted on by this company are Vee Belt Drive and not direct connection, which might be considered a disadvantage. Should the Department favorably consider the replacement of the present engines the units offered by A.R. Williams Ltd. are the only ones in the low cost field available from firms on the approved list.\n\nThe length of time taken to secure information for the Department on which a decision might be made is regretted but as the information received was so conflicting, I considered it advisable to proceed carefully and examine the various angles involved before submitting the matter for your consideration.\n\nI should appreciate being informed of the Department's decision in due course.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

It is noted that these can be secured at a cost of $475.00 f. o. b. Vancouver. Purchase should be made from a firm on the approved list and other requirements of the purchasing regulations should be carried out.\n\nAn encumbrance requisition is being obtained, and as soon as I have the number of this, you will be informed.\n\nIf it is possible to obtain any allowance for the old set of batteries, you will no doubt obtain it and have it applied towards the cost of the new ones.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.;\nP. O. Box 70, Vancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of the 12th instant, and regret that my letter of October 6th dealing with the application of St. Michael's Residential School for two Diesel engines to replace the present gasoline engines of the lighting plant was not sufficiently definite.\n\nThe information I intended to convey was that of the engines quoted in the low price field those offered by A.R. Williams Ltd. would be more likely to do the work required of them than the lower powered engines quoted on by Hoffars Ltd. Frankly, I am not satisfied that the Department would be well advised to replace the existing gasoline engines, which are in good condition, by the low powered Diesels suggested. Information obtained subsequent to my letter of the 6th convinces me that unless the Department is prepared to put in more powerful Diesels than those referred to herein, the best and most economical course to take would be to replace the old batteries by a new set of greater capacity and continue to operate the existing gasoline engines.\n\nThe capacity of the existing set of batteries when installed was 90 ampere hours but it is considered that it would be much better to provide 160 ampere hour set in replacement. My information is that such a set should last at least six years, and with proper care eight years or more. The estimated cost of a 160 ampere set of batteries suitable for our requirements is approximately $475.00, f.o.b. Vancouver.\n\nI would recommend the replacement of the old batteries and the continued use of the existing gasoline engines.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M.

As we are not sure of the type to be used, we are quoting you on both rubber lined and linen unlined.\n\nWe are pleased to quote 2\" \"Trojan\" rubber lined Fire Hose $39.00 c. ft. 2\" Linen Fire Hose, $24.00 c.ft.

For your information, the expansion ring type is the one generally used for fire hose, and the most satisfactory.\n\nWe thank you for this enquiry, and will be pleased to have your valued order covering your requirements, which we understand is one only 50 ft. length, and four only 25 ft. lengths, to which lengths the above prices would apply.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMARSHALL-WELLS B.

W. McGill and Mr. R. A. Hoey, it is necessary to inform the Department that for the safety of the building the 2\" fire hose on each floor of the school should be increased in length.\n\nDuring the fire in June last it was this inside hydrant which saved the school, but fortunately the fire was on the inner wall rather than the far one. These hose only reach as far as the doors of the large sitting rooms or class rooms on each side of the building. These hose are 50' in length and should be increased by at least 25' on all floors except the main floor, which should have an additional 50' as the present hose does not reach the residence at all.\n\nIt would also seem necessary to advise that in our opinion fire escapes should be installed at each end of this building, rather than, or in addition to, the present escapes at the back of the building. It is realized, of course, that this would entail a large capital expenditure, but I am convinced that sooner or later these should be installed.\n\nYour consideration and report on this matter will be appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nLetter No. 15/6/2920.\n\nOffice of the Indian Commissioner for Indian Agency\n\nVancouver, B.C., Dec. 11th 1939.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 75-A, allot.#76-12-415, amounting to $527.25, in favour of Vivian Engine Works Ltd., 1090 West Sixth Ave., Vancouver, B.C., for set of batteries in connection with electric light plant, Alert Bay Indian Residential School, Kwawkewlth Agency, B.C.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 156-0-5 dated 25th Oct., 1939.

Last year an application was before the Department for the replacement of these engines and batteries with a dieselized plant, and in view of this application no extensive repairs were carried out on the plant as it then stood. The Department, however, decided to replace the storage batteries and to continue the use of the present gasoline driven lighting plant engines.\n\nA very careful examination of these engines has recently been made by Mr. W. T. Ward, the school engineer, who will be retiring from our service at the close of this month. Mr. Ward was most anxious that these engines be turned over in as good shape as possible to the new engineer, and they have been completely taken down and examined. It was found that considerable replacement of essential parts will have to be made on both these engines. With such replacements there is reason to assume that these lighting plants will continue to give satisfactory and trouble free service for several years.\n\nThe following parts will be required, and the costs as quoted are contained in the attached tender, which is the only one procurable as all Lister plants and parts are restricted to one provincial agency:\n\n| Parts for 6 H.P.

At that time I asked him if he would give me a report on their condition, and I enclose herewith copy of the report of the Engineer in which he refers to plants No. 1 and 2, pointing out the repairs which had been made during recent years as well as the new parts which had been purchased, and stating at the end of each report that the condition of the engines was \"good\".\n\nMr. Anfield has appointed a new Engineer at the School, and while I do not question the necessity of the parts requested, nevertheless I cannot help but recall that on August 29th last he gave us this report, and stated at that time everything was in all condition. Personally I am not in a position to know whether the parts are required, and feel it might be best to have our Boiler Inspector give us a report before recommending the purchases.\n\nIt is noted for Plant No. 2 they are requesting two cylinder heads at a cost of $60.40 each. This is the first intimation I have had that anything was wrong with the engines. Mr. Anfield's letter will be self-explanatory, and I would kindly ask you to deal with the matter as you see fit. Quotations from Hoffars Limited for the parts required are also enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nMajor D.M.

Since then the engines have been running until the present time and there is no doubt that the present Engineer wishes to turn over the plant in good condition by asking for these items which Mr. Arnall recommended.\n\nI have spoken to Mr. Arnall on this matter and he advises that this work is absolutely necessary and is what he reported was required on his last inspection.\n\nNaturally, the engines having run all winter have got worse.\n\nI understand the reason this work was not done immediately after Mr. Arnall's inspection was that it was contemplated putting in Diesel Engines to replace the present gasoline engines.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"G. F. Dawson.\nDist.Res. Architect.\n\nCFD/LM\nIndian Commissioner's Office,\nVancouver, B.C., March 19, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of a letter received from the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School requesting authority to make repairs to the electric light plant engines. In view of the fact that Mr. Arnall included these engines in his last inspection and found them in good shape it would be appreciated if you would kindly have him make some observations on this requisition, as it would appear to me that these repairs should not have become necessary in the short interval since his last inspection. Will you also advise me when Mr. Arnall expects to make his next inspection of this school.\n\nKindly return the enclosed copy of the Principal's letter with your reply.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFor D.M.

C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to Departmental circular 150-65 of February 10th, 1938, dealing with fire prevention at Residential schools, the attention of the Department is directed to the need of an extension to the inside hydrant on the top floor of the building.\n\nIt is necessary to advise the Department that the hydrant stand on this floor is on the girl's side of the building and that to get a hose through to the boys side, it would be necessary to smash down a partition and a sealed door. The cost of cutting through this wall and extending the present hydrant line would be approximately $56.00. If, however, seventy five feet of hose with couplings were supplied so that this could be connected to the hose from the next lower floor, reasonable protection would be available. The cost of the hose and couplings would be approximately $25.00 F.O.B. Alert Bay, and bids are attached for\n\n(a) the additional hydrant complete and\n(b) the hose with couplings.\n\nIn view of the economic stringency the cheaper installation would be satisfactory at this time.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nFEA/L.

Mr. Anfield points out that their present machine has been in service some thirteen years, and is in a very bad state of repair.\n\nFor the Department's information, I am aware that the school typewriter is in poor shape as we use the same ourselves regularly when it is necessary to loan our office typewriter to the school for them to do certain work which requires the long carriage. If the Department could see their way clear to supply the school with a typewriter requested I would appreciate it very much as it would not only help them but this office also as we are without the use of our own machine at times when it is on loan to the Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.

Were it not for the condition of this machine, I would not think of asking for a long carriage machine in view of the need for war economy.\n\nIf, however, the Department will give us a new typewriter we would much appreciate a long carriage typewriter in view of the vast number of forms which have to be handled each month.

Buck, on his inspection of the Indian Residential School at Alert Bay and dealing particularly with the waterproofing of the walls.\n\nThe main points in Mr. Buck's report seem to be that the brick used originally in the School was of very poor quality but that where the wall has been waterproofed, satisfactory results were obtained. Also, that waterproofing would have to be undertaken at intervals not exceeding five years.\n\nI hope this information will be of use to your Branch.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Mills\n\nRe: Indian Residential School,\nAlert Bay, British Columbia.\n\nIn connection with work carried out at the above to render the building waterproof, our records show that in a report dated July 21st, 1937, Engineer Warren of Mr. Webb's staff stated that to determine the protective qualities of a product prepared by the Minex Co., Inc., of New York for the purpose, an area of 400 sq. ft. of the exterior brickwork was treated, with satisfactory results. The material for the work was supplied gratis.\n\nIn consequence, in addition to other roof repairs found necessary, and included in the report referred to above, Mr. Warren recommended that further waterproofing be carried out on the east walls of the school principal's residence, and laundry, covering an additional 800 sq. ft., where leakages were evident. The roof repairs, and waterproofing of walls were estimated to cost approximately $1,145.00. This expenditure was approved by our Director in his memorandum to this Service under date of September 16th, 1937, and in a letter dated September 18th, 1937, Mr. Webb was instructed to proceed with the work.\n\nIn a letter dated October 8th, 1937, Mr. Webb acknowledged our instructions, but advised that owing to the lateness of the season, work could not be started that year.\n\nDuring the 1938-39 fiscal year, funds to the amount of $1,345.00 were provided, with which amount the repairs to the roof were carried out and waterproofing applied.\n\nThe above is all the information that is available on our files regarding the matter in question.\n\nI may say, however, that while en route to Bella Bella in March, I was able to spend an hour with Mr. Anfield the Principal of the Alert Bay School, who hurriedly conducted me through the school, and indicated to me what work had been carried out by Mr. Warren.\n\nThe walls treated were:\n\n1. The whole east wall, above the roof of the Principal's residence.\n2. Part of the east wall of the Principal's residence.\n\nT. S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering and Construction Service,\nOttawa.\nI observed that the brick used in the school originally was a poor type of lightly burned stock brick, commonly used for backup work. It is highly absorbent, and poorly laid. I also observed that the wall area waterproofed was considerably in excess of what I now discover to have been recommended in Mr. Warren's report of July 21st, 1937. However, during a conversation with Mr. Warren in this office recently, he explained that more work than recommended had actually been carried out; but at a cost within the estimate.\n\nI observed while at the school, that where the waterproofing compound had been applied to the exterior, the interior of such walls were dry. In other untreated areas, the plaster was wet and cracked, giving evidence of long-standing trouble.\n\nWhile unfamiliar with the compound used, it would appear to be giving satisfaction, and in my opinion some similar treatment should be applied to all exterior brick surfaces.\n\nIt should be borne in mind, however, that applications of waterproofing compound, to exterior surfaces, subjected to such rainfall conditions as exist at Alert Bay, could not be considered permanent; but would require treatment at intervals not exceeding five years.\n\n[Signature]\nArchitect,\nEngineering and Construction Service.\nST.

It has 5 added improvements which bring it to the peak of baking perfection.\n\nThe New Features\n\nNew furnace with heavier fire brick linings, new recessed furnace front, no cast iron excepting the grates and the rear collar being exposed to the fire---Result, fewer and cheaper repairs.\n\nAdditional insulation between walls---Result, saving in radiated heat, more even baking and low fuel consumption.\n\nNew Insulated Fume and cooling damper. This damper is entirely independent of the main damper, which can either be open or closed when the fume and cooling damper is used---Result, convenient operation and time saved.\n\nNew pyrex enclosed oven lights, built in---Result, convenience and time saved.\n\nPolished aluminum Trimmings---Result, handsome appearance.\nThe New Model Pendrith Portable Oven\n\nA STEEL Oven containing enough BRICK to form a SOLID HEAT. Built Sectionally. Set up and Marked at the Factory. Shipped \"Knocked Down.\" Easily erected by anyone.\n\nPENDRITH MACHINERY CO.

An oven is a consumer of fuel and an oven must be kept in good repair. Therefore, in figuring the cost of an oven, these two points of fuel consumption and repair bills MUST be considered along with the purchase price. Estimating the life of a Pendrith Oven at 20 years (conservatively) the great importance of fuel and repair economy will be fully appreciated. In addition, the improved product turned out by an oven with the EXTRA HEAVY INSULATION and the SCIENTIFIC FLUE ARRANGEMENT of the PENDRITH OVEN will mean a great deal during the lifetime of the oven in additional profits. These items will amount to several times the first cost of the oven and we therefore claim that the Pendrith Oven is BY FAR the cheapest portable oven on the market, to buy.\n\nNOTE.\u2014The first cost, or purchase price, of the Pendrith Oven is very reasonable and the terms within every baker's reach.\nVancouver, B. C.\nApril 15th, 1940.\n\nMr. F. Earl Anfield, Principal,\nSt. Michael's School,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Anfield:\n\nIn answer to yours of the 10th inst., We take pleasure in quoting you on our Bakers ovens which are manufactured by ourselves in Vancouver, and as far as possible of B. C. Products.\n\nThe ovens you mention are apparently of the lighter type, made by Eastern Manufactures for shipping to places where mechanics are not available and manufactured so the buyer can erect the oven themselves. We do not manufacture this type of oven; we consider our oven more durable and economical to operate, as there are no iron flues to burn out. We construct our furnace and flues entirely of brickwork, and continue the flue between the decks which gives a far better distribution of heat thereby, making a more uniform heat.\n\nWe would recommend our 120 loaf size as this is capable of turning out approximately 900 loaves in an 8 hour shift, and is suitable for Pie and cakes etc. Also is an excellent oven for roasting as the solid heat derived from the brickwork makes a superior job of roasting than cooking on a flash heat as in a light stove.\n\nThese ovens can be constructed to burn any kind of fuel, such as oil, wood or coal. Also we could make a small allowance on the oven you now have as a trade-in.\n\nThanking you for this opportunity to quote you on our ovens, and trusting to be of service to you, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\nNICHOLSON AND SONS.\n\nA.

The present range is in bad condition, the ovens are burned through, the flues are gone as are also the top plates. It has been in used since the new school was opened, and whilst it has given good service, it is not really of as heavy a type as is required for this work. Should the Department sanction this item, which was included in the estimates for the present fiscal year, we would like to suggest that the weight in the sectional cover (first) be increased, and the other three graduated. This is necessary through the use of an oil burner which gives off a very intense heat on the fire box section of the range. This heat is necessary in order to get the required temperatures in the ovens. Whilst we would like to have this range equipped with a canopy to take the heat out of the kitchen, we do not feel that we are justified in asking the Department for this additional expense in the light of present day conditions.\n\n(2) A new Bakery oven.\n\nFrom the bids submitted we would strongly recommend No. 3 of the Pendrith Machinery Co., Limited, that is a baking cabinet, three deck type, for wood firing, at a price of $316.00. This is the cheapest of all the bids submitted and would answer our needs adequately.\n\nThis bake oven would be used extensively for the baking of meats, fish, cakes, etc., and would prove a real saving to the big range which is not, with all its size, adequate for the needs of this school. We need an additional bake oven, if at all possible but realizing the urgency of economy, we would say that should the Department find itself unable to supply both these needs, the hot range must come first as the continued life of the present equipment for another year is extremely doubtful.

As we have no record or having received any correspondence during the past summer in connection with this matter it was presumed, until receipt of your estimates for 1941-42, that the condition had been corrected.\n\nWould it be possible to have this work done this fall? Similar work was done in 1938-39 under the direction of Mr. Warren who is an official at Mr. Webb's office. Please interview him and, if it is possible, you may proceed with the work at once on the understanding that the total cost of material and labour must not exceed $2,100.00. If not could you purchase the material required from the current year's appropriation? Mr. Warren will be aware of the material needed. It is understood that the work done under Mr. Warren's direction in the fiscal year 1938-39 has proved satisfactory and, therefore, it seems advisable to use the same material.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.
