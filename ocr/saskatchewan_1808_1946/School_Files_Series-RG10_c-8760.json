Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended JUN 30 1945.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated JUN 30 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at Alberni B.C.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the ALBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended SEP 30 1945\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated OCT 10 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Alberni B.C.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is an accurate statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended SEP 30 1945\n\nDated OCT 10 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Alberni B.C.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

(RG 10, Volume 6432, File 877-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the foregoing is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the columns under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended DEC 31 1945 ALBERNI, B.C.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated DEC 31 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Alberni BC this 1st January 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended DEC 31 1945\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated DEC 31 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Alberni B.C.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended MAR 31 1946 19\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated MAR 31 1946 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended MAR 31 1916 19\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated MAR 31 1916 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at .................................................... this .................................................. 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended JUN 30 1916 Principal\n\nDated JUN 30 1916\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Alberni Oct this July 10 1916\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended SEP 30 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated OCT 15 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ALBERNI B.C.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereon.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended DEC 31 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JAN 11 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Alberni B.C.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, piling it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately hereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Residential School for the Quarter ended DEC 31 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JAN 11 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Alberni B.C.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereon.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils named on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will credit be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return has been made faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERTA INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended MAR 31 1947\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated MAR 31 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended SEP 30 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated OCT 5 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this Oct 8 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended SEP 30 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated OCT 6 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Alberni this Oct 8 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I A 403 Rep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended SEP 30 1947\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated OCT 6 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Alberni Oct 8 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the foregoing is a faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence during quarter shown on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grants. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the above Return be a true and faithful statement of the attendance at the RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C., School for the Quarter ended MAR 31 1948\n\nDated APR 3 1948\n\nPrincipal\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Alberni this April 7 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will any provision be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended DEC. 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated JAN 1, 1948.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Alberni this Jan 15, 1948.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2; and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total Number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended DEC 31, 1947 ALBERNI, B.C.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: JAN 1, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at: Alberni\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence which are entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively, according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended DEC. 31 19\u2014\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JAN 19\u2014\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this Jan 25 19\u2014\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on each Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pacing it No. 2; and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entering the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by filling the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nIndian Residential School Quarterly Return\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nI HEREBY

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended SEP 30 1948 19\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated OCT 12 1948 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Alberni this OCT 14 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL for the Quarter ended SEP 30 1948.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated OCT 12 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at Alberni this OCT 15 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403 R. 3608\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**West Coast Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Alberni Residential School at Alberni B.C.**\n\n**Reserve for Quarter ended Sep 30th 1948**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n|                 |                 |     |     |      |                |                    |                          |                             |            |\n| 293             | Brooks, Donald  | 11  | 1   |      | Pt.Simpson     | 1                  |                          | Oct 47                      | 92         |\n| 294             | Starr, Marvin   | 14  | 1   |      | Kiteumkalun    | 1                  |                          | Oct 47                      | 92         |\n| 295             | Cecil, William  | 16  | 1   |      | Pt.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended SEP 30 1948.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: OCT 12 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended SEP 30, 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated OCT 12, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Alberni\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 R. 3508\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n### West Coast Agency\n\n**REPORT of the Alberni Residential

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence by all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 30th March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended MAR 31 1949\n\nDated APR 4 1949\n\nPrincipal\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at April 5 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 R. 3608\n## Indian Residential School Quarterly Return\n\n### Girls 3.\n\n**West Coast**\n\n**Agency**\n\n**Report of the...

The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter for all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence during quarter, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will allowance be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, ALBERNI, B.C., School for the Quarter ended SEP 30 1949.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated OCT 5 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 7/10/49\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the above statement is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SOUTHERN COLUMBIA INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C., School for the Quarter ended SEP 30 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated OCT 5 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 21/10/49\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in which all pupils are present in the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ........................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included, on one sheet of the Return use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is shown therein by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included, on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered in the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will provision be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended DEC 31 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: JAN 2 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included, on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When coding to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on any Return and determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will grants be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended SEP 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated OCT 5, 1950.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

(RG 10, Volume 6432, File 877-2, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALEMBERT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

CANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the grant per child per year. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended JUN 30 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JUL 4 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Port Alberni this July 6 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly-Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils in residence during quarter period on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter for all pupils whose attendance is uncertain, by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will any credit be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL at ALBERNI, B.C., School for the Quarter ended DEC 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated JAN 5, 1950.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at Port Alberni, B.C.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils during the Return period ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n### WEST COAST Agency\n\n**REPORT of the ALBERNI RESIDENTIAL School at ALBERNI**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 263             | Watts, Daniel    | 11  | 1   |      | Opstohesahlt   | 1                 |                          | Sept. 47                    | 92 / 48     |\n| 267             | White, Mark     | 14  | 1   |      | Bella Bella    | 1                 |                          | Sept. 47                    | 92 / 48     |\n| 268             | Dixon, Alvin    | 12  | 1   |      | Bella Bella    | 1                 |                          | Sept. 47                    | 92 / 49     |\n| 269             | Harris, Andrew  | 11  | 1   |      | Bella Bella    | 1                 |                          | Sept. 47                    | 92 / 46     |\n| 290             | White, Johnny   | 11  | 1   |      | Bella Bella    | 1                 |                          | Sept. 47                    | 92 / 28 Sickness |\n| 292             | Teuchie, William| 13  | 1   |      | Uculelet       | 1                 |                          | Oct. 47                     | 92 / 47     |\n| 293             | Breeds, Donald  | 12  | 1   |      | Pt.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is true and correct statement of the attendance and tuition at the INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALEBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY Certify that the within Return is correct and faithfully represents the attendance and tuition at the INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTES:\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY THAT THE WITHIN RETURN IS A TRUE AND FULL STATEMENT OF THE ATTENDANCE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence which appears on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will credit be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered in the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will any allowance be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended DEC 31 1951.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDate: JAN 10, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at Port Alberni\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| Register Number | Names of Pupils | Age | Boy | Girl | Band or Reserve | Class or Study | Standing in Class |

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALEBERN, B.C., School for the Quarter ended SEP 30 1951.\n\nDated OCT 6 1951\n\nPrincipal\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6432, File 877-2, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C., School for the Quarter ended SEP 30 1951.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated OCT 6 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at Port Alberni, B.C.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY Certify that the within Return is a true and correct Account of the attendance and tuition at the INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ALBERNI, B.C., School for the Quarter ended SEP 30, 1951.\n\nDated OCT 6, 1951.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at Port Alberni, B.C., this 11 Oct., 1951.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ALBERNI, B.C. ended SEP 30 1951 Principal\n\nDated OCT 6 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at PORT ALBERNI, B.C.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended DEC 31 1952.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated JAN 1 1953\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent's Office\n\nDated at Port Alberni, B.C.\n\nthis 5 Jan 1953\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nIndian Residential School Quarterly Return\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Michael's Indian School School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 31, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTERED NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|------------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 0680             | Agnes (Gerry) Rufus | 8   | X   |      |                |                   |                          |                           |            |\n| 0691             | Inga Nelson     | 7   | X   |      |                |                   |                          |                           |            |\n| 0692             | Stella Bannister | 7   | X   |      |                |                   |                          |                           |            |\n| 0693             | Georgia Hanusa  | 8   | X   |      |                |                   |                          |                           |            |\n| 0694             | Joseph Kainimaque | 9  | X   |      |                |                   |                          |                           |            |\n| 0695             | Anna Sinclair    | 13  | X   |      |                |                   |                          |                           |            |\n| 0696             | Irene Clayton    | 12  | X   |      |                |                   |                          |                           |            |\n| 0697             | Gloria Gray     | 12  | X   |      |                |                   |                          |                           |            |\n| 0698             | Mildred Jackson | 15  | X   |      |                |                   |                          |                           |            |\n| 0699             | Edith Martin    | 10  | X   |      |                |                   |                          |                           |            |\n| 0700             | Josephine Wilson | 14  | X   |      |                |                   |                          |                           |            |\n| 0701             | Adele Vickers   | 7   | X   |      |                |                   |                          |                           |            |\n| 0702             | Winnie Hunt     | 8   | X   |      |                |                   |                          |                           |            |\n| 0703             | Lillian Anne    | 9   | X   |      |                |                   |                          |                           |            |\n| 0704             | Lily Wilson     | 11  | X   |      |                |                   |                          |                           |            |\n| 0705             | Edith Lawson    | 7   | X   |      |                |                   |                          |                           |            |\n| 0706             | Gloria Nappie   | 9   | X   |      |                |                   |                          |                           |            |\n| 0707             | Ella Weber      | 15  | X   |      |                |                   |                          |                           |            |\n| 0708             | Mary Hanusa     | 9   | X   |      |                |                   |                          |                           |            |\n| 0709             | Leona Wilson    | 12  | X   |      |                |                   |                          |                           |            |\n| 0710             | Bertha Robinson | 11  | X   |      |                |                   |                          |                           |            |\n| 0711             | Elizabeth Joseph | 8  | X   |      |                |                   |                          |                           |            |\n| 0712             | Aster Jean Dick | 8   | X   |      |                |                   |                          |                           |            |\n| 0713             | Delores May Williams | 12 | X   |      |                |                   |                          |                           |            |\n| 0714             | Mildred E.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Michael's Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 31, 1952.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Portage la Prairie, this January 1, 1953.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STARTED IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE | DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|----------------|----------------|-----|-----|------|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| 0404           | Pearl Weir     | 17  | X   |      | Masset        |                 |                        |                           | 2-5-39      | Dischg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will provision be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, can payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

As any surplus supplies which we had were destroyed in the fire, and the special requisition which we sent in afterwards was based on the needs to the end of the present school year, we shall have little or nothing left.\n\nTrusting this is all in order I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRCS/BW\nEncl.\nAlberni Residential School\nUnited Church of Canada\n\nPrincipal\nREV.

R.C SCOTT, B.A.\n\nAlberni:\nBritish Columbia, December 6th, 1940\n\nMr. F.R. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ashbridge:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith, a requisition for school supplies which I would be glad if you would forward to the Department. I am also enclosing copy of a letter which I have just received from Captain Barry to whom I wrote in connection with this requisition. You will note what Captain Barry says about the requisition being forwarded at this time, and I would be glad if you would point out to the Department that it would seem that some discrepancy had been made between the supplies requisitioned at the close of last year in Coqualeetza and those which we find to be necessary in this new school. I am sending this forward in the hope that the Department will assist us because I have already paid out $20 from school funds for supplies which we could not wait for as they were needed at once. The requisition enclosed is also very necessary and we need it soon, so that I would be pleased if we could have a decision reached as soon as possible.\n\nThanking you for your valued assistance at all times I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRCS/BW\nEnc.\nDecember 2, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 29th of November last with reference to a requisition for class room supplies for the work to be undertaken after Christmas, I may say that I have no idea whether the Department would be prepared to consider such a requisition at the present time.\n\nI have no doubt that the work books you mention are very necessary and I would suggest that, in forwarding the requisition in the usual way through your Indian Agent, you mention that the requisition is forwarded at this unusual time due to the fact that your school has only recently been opened and that there are still a number of class room supplies necessary.\n\nThis letter is being forwarded in duplicate so that one copy may be sent to your Indian Agent.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H.

Waterhouse and Greene of Port Alberni, and the account will be forwarded in triplicate marked distinctly \"Vote 66(99)\". As your letter does not mention the large flag or the picture of the King and Queen for which we asked, I presume you have these still under advisement.\n\nThanking you heartily for this consideration,\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRCS/BW\n\nIndian Affairs.

A certified account in triplicate should be forwarded for payment and when forwarding this you should distinctly mark on it -- \"Pay from Vote 196 (99)\".\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI find that our flags from Coqualeetza are too badly worn to be used on the new school. I would like to have a suitable flag for the main flag pole, a Union Jack, and would greatly appreciate it if the Department would furnish it.\n\nThere is a great deal of resonance in the Assembly Hall and even allowing for improvement upon the installing of benches and when the pupils would be in their places, I am quite sure that something extra will have to be done to insure good hearing upon the part of those in the pews. Consequently if we could have six or eight smaller flags, say 2'x3', or thereabouts, Union Jacks and Red Ensigns, these could be arranged in a way that would be both decorative and of assistance in securing better acoustics.\n\nI might say also that we have no picture of the King and Queen, and if one could be secured for use in our Assembly Hall I would appreciate it as I intend to support heartily, the efforts of educational authorities to secure intelligent and loyal support of our authorities and institutions.\n\nTrusting you may see your way clear to recommending this contribution I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C Scott\nPRINCIPAL\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to forward requisition for school material for Alberni Indian Residential School, together with covering letter from the Reverend Principal, who has requested that these be forwarded as early as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ashbridge:\n\nI regret that when our office requisition was sent in along with the classroom requisition in June last, no No.606-7 Business envelopes were asked for. This was due to the fact that Miss Wilson who had been in charge of the office, was away on sick leave and the stenographer who was taking her place was not familiar with the procedure and the needs, and in the press of work which was mine, it slipped my notice.\n\nI am enclosing a requisition herewith and I would appreciate it very much if even at this late date you could see your way clear to sending it forward to the Department.\n\nThanking you I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRCS/BW\nEncl.\n**Requisition for School Material**\n\n**Indian Residential School**\n\nFor: School: West Coast Agency\n\n**NOTE:**\nTo avoid delay, teachers should give full particulars regarding each article required.\n\nThe name, series, number of grade, and name of author and publisher of all books required should be given as fully as possible.\n\nWhen ordering kindergarten material, the catalogue number of some well known firm should be given for each article required.\n\nOnly one item should be specified on each line of this requisition and no entry should be made under heading \"Number Authorized\".\n\n| ARTICLES                  | NUMBER ON HAND | DATE OF LAST RECEIPT | NUMBER REQUIRED | NUMBER AUTHORIZED | REMARKS |\n|---------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|\n| Govt. of Canada Envelopes | 10 box         |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Pictures King George & Queen Elizabeth | 1 set |                       |                 |                   |         |\n\nN.B.\u2014Explicit information regarding address must be furnished.\n\nName: Rev.

The present one has been in use for many years. I do not know how long, but we have used it now for six years. Under the ever increasing amount of work which has been laid upon our office, not alone through the approaching change in the location of the school, but also because of our endeavour to keep in touch with parents and friends through circular letters, and also largely through the great amount of detail made necessary in connection with our Preventorium, this old machine has been constantly in the hands of the repair man. It is away today, and it certainly will not stand up much longer.\n\nI trust that it may be possible to secure a good machine, and would be grateful if you could see your way clear to recommend its purchase.\n\nThanking you in anticipation I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C Scott\nPRINCIPAL\nSIR:-\n\nI beg to forward you herewith, Requisition for School Material received from Reverend R.C. Scott, Principal of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, together with a Requisition for Stationery for use also at the School, and would recommend that the supplies asked for be sent for use at the School.\n\nThe above should be sent via Canadian National Railway Company's freight, addressed to Reverend R.C. Scott, Coqualeetza Indian Residential School, Sardis, B.C.\n\nThis address holds good for the balance of this School year, but if issue is made after orders for removal to the new School come into force, the supplies should be shipped to Alberni, B.C.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nN.

These maps are not only expensive but are very difficult to obtain at the present time, and are subject to change without notice. Under the circumstances, it is not considered advisable to go to the expense of supplying these maps.\n\nWe are arranging to send you a map of Canada and a map of the World, both of which we have in stock.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nReferring to requisition No. 25322 which calls for a Dictograph Cabinet and folding paper, I am advised by Clarke & Stuart Company with whom the order was placed that they have not been able to obtain Dictograph Cabinets these past few years owing to the fact that the trays were unobtainable. They have, therefore, shipped one Repeater Duplicator complete with 2 Hectograph pads which will service the same purpose and a further supply of these pads can always be obtained.\n\nWe trust this will be satisfactory.\n\nJ.

Canada.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nIn endeavouring to acquaint the young Indians of this School with something of a knowledge of the country in which they live, we find it quite impossible to proceed any further without at least two large size maps of Canada, which would be suitable to put on rollers for classroom instruction.\n\nThe only map now available in the School was acquired in 1930 and although it is slowly coming apart, it is still being used by both the intermediate and senior classes.\n\nHoping you will be able to supply us with these maps in the very near future, I remain,\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\nAllen Raymer Reesor\n**Requisition for School Material**\n\n**Date:** February 24th 1945\n\n**For:** Alberni Residential School West Coast Agency\n\n**NOTE:**\nTo

On\nSeptember 14, the Department provided the sum of $100 to purchase\nthe necessary science equipment for high school work at the\nabove school. It is presumed that the equipment listed is meant\nto be purchased from this amount.\n\nAll the items on the attached list are approved\nwith the exception of the microscope. Would you please discuss\nwith Major Davey the necessity of supplying such an instrument\nto this school at the present time. You can then decide\nconcerning the provision of the instrument requested.\n\nIt is also suggested that a table globe would\nbe just as satisfactory and considerably cheaper than a floor\nstand globe, but here again you can decide with Major Davey\nconcerning this item.\n\nBernard F.

As yours is the first to mention them, I presume that other schools did not write to the Embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\nNormally, we check carefully all the pamphlets and bulletins recommended in the Bulletin. In this case, we assumed that a list given to summer school students at Macdonald Teachers' College would be above reproach. This incident has shown that such lists will also have to be carefully checked. I am passing these bulletins to the proper authorities for further action.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Summer School. Each of the seven teachers has requested a copy of the Courses of Study.\n\nThese courses are published in separate pamphlets, namely, Social Studies, 1 to 6; Art, one to six; Health and Physical Education, one to six. These are published by the B.C. Department of Education. They are not text books and it is expedient that each teacher should have one. I would be glad if you would place them on order to be delivered as soon as possible.\n\nI am glad to be able to report that all my teachers, with the exception of one who superannuates this year, attended summer schools for the full summer term, including the Indian Education classes supervised in Victoria by Mr. Waller of Alberta. They teachers have returned filled with gratifying enthusiasm.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nNo Course of Study is required for Grade Seven.\nDecember 18, 1952.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Alberni Indian Res.

Mr. Caldwell states that the machine is no longer satisfactory for his purposes.\n\nIt is recommended that a new mimeograph machine be supplied and that the old one be supplied to a smaller school.\n\nW.

Andrew T.B. Baird, of the 31st ultimo, suggesting that an Industrial Indian Day School be established in the West Coast Agency of Vancouver Island, the foundation for which he says has been laid by a Mr. John A. Donaldson, who has taken a number of Indian lads into his house for the purpose of teaching them, in which work Mr. Baird states.\n\nTo the Honourable\nC.T. D'Arcy\nSurgeon General of Indian Affairs\nstates that Mr. Donald enjoys the cordial cooperation and support of the local Indian Agent, Mr. A. Pullen; and he asks that the Department will agree to give a grant such as has been given to other similar institutions in British Columbia, for the establishment of an Industrial Board School among the Indians on the West coast of Vancouver Island.\n\nThe undersigned hopes to report that the large majority of the Indians in this Agency are heathens; that no denomination appears to have operated among them\u2014at least not with success\u2014except the Roman Catholics, who claim to have 596...\nout of a population of 2864 Indians. This denomination has also 2 Day Schools, namely at Oolah and Claquato. The number of children of school age on the West Coast appears to be 389.\n\nThe undersigned considers that it would be well before giving a definite answer to Mr. Baird's application that the Visiting Indian Superintendent for British Columbia be required to report upon the proposition.\n\nA.

H. Macdonald, who is a Presbyterian Missionary among the Indians on that coast having taken a number of Indian lads into his charge for the purpose.\ninstructing them and at the same time acquiring through them a knowledge of their language.\n\nI have to request that you will report on the application made by Dr. Baird on behalf of the Presbyterian Church.\nA.W.

I have the honor to inform you the sum of $1500 has been voted by Parliament to assist in erecting a new building for girls at the Albemarle Industrial School B.C. but the Dept does not desire this also be included without plans being submitted for its adoption.\nSchools\n\nKindly let Rev.

Sir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant asking for a grant toward the Indian school established under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church at Alberni, B.C.; and in reply I beg to inform you that the matter will be carefully considered when making up the estimates for the coming year, but as there is such a great strain to meet the demands from the schools already in existence that no definite promise can be made; however desirable the\nwe might consider it\nto help such educational\nefforts among these Indians.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6433, File 877-5, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo Deputy Minister\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, 15th July 1893\n\nWith reference to the letter of the 8th inst. from the Secretary of the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada making application on behalf of that committee for a grant to the Indian School at Alberni. I have the honor to report that Alberni is a Reserve of 130 acres situated immediately south of the Alberni Company's lands on the east bank of the Alberni Canal in the west coast of Vancouver Island. In the month of July 1871 Mr. Rev. Mr. Baird wrote suggesting that an Industrial Indian Day School be established in the West Coast Agency of Vancouver Island. The foundation for which he stated had been laid by Mr. John A. Macdonald who had taken a number of Indian boys into his house at Alberni for the purpose of teaching them in which work he was cordially supported by the Indians.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa,\n\nIndian Agent Mr. Brinton & Mr. Band then asked for a grant such as has been given to other similar institutions in B.C. for the establishment of an Industrial Boarding School among the Indians on the west coast of Vancouver Island. Agent Vowell was requested to report on Mr. Band's application which he did in March 1892. At the same time enclosed a letter from Agent Brinton on the subject. Mr. Vowell recommended that the application be favorably considered and that $150 per each of 10 pupils be granted in the meantime. The Agent's report was also very favorable to the school. The answer was that no sum of $100 for each of 10 pupils was included in the Supplementary Estimates for 1892-93 to aid in making a start. The financial statement, however, presented by the Board was such that a large reduction was necessitated.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, 189\n\nReceived at this time among other was disallowed. The Church authorities were informed of this fact at the same time told that the Department hoped to be able to do something in view of the recent meaning 1873-94 and added that it would like to receive a statement from the Church authorities showing what progress had been made and what assistance it was considered should be given. This statement was not sent, & nothing was accomplished in the estimates for 93-94. The Department contributes $300 per annum towards the salary of the teacher of the day school which Indians attend. The Secretary states that a new school house has been built at a cost of about $300. It remains to be seen whether the greater part of the work. The mission property he says consists of 16 acres and costs originally including road building $2000. The cost of the new school house he\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, 189\n\nHe says is not definitely agreed upon its highest estimate being $3000.00 & the lowest $1000.00. The new building is intended to accommodate from 20 to 25 children.\n\nI may say that Mr. Agent in his last Annual Report gives a very good report of the work done by this Mission and connected therewith taking a deep interest in the work. The question of making a grant should not I think be considered until it has been definitely known what the building is to cost & until Plans thereof have been submitted.\n\nJohn M. [signature]\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nFor full information in regard to the location of the building &c.\nTo Mr. Hayter Head,\n\nThe Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am instructed by the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, to make application to the Government for a grant to the Indian School at Alberni. The condition of the Mission is as follows:\n\n1. The Mission property consists of sixteen acres of land.\n\n2. There is a Girls School in which there are, at present, thirteen (13) children. The accommodation is not such as to make it possible to receive others who are seeking admission. It was hoped that, by this time, the building would have been enlarged or a new one erected, but the sickness and necessary withdrawal of our Missionary, the Rev. J. A. MacDonald, has disappointed us in that. In a short time, however, a successor will be on the ground, and the enlargement will be effected as soon as convenient. It is proposed to accommodate from 20 to 25 in the new building. Miss B. I. Johnston, who is Matron of the School, and seems admirably fitted for the work, reports that both parents and children take a hearty interest in the Home.\n\n3. The Day School has varied in attendance on account of the practice of children going with their parents, on their fishing and sealing expeditions. There were, on the Roll, during the Second Quarter of 1892, 20, average attendance 12 1/2. Third Quarter (1892) average 17 3/5 (number on Roll not reported). Fourth Quarter on Roll 30, average 16 1/2. First Quarter, 1893, on the Roll 14, average 8 3/5. Last statement received, 19th Sept., reports 20 on the Roll, with the remark that the attendance is becoming more regular, but average not given.\n\nA new School House has been built on the Mission property and taken possession of by the School on the 6th of Sept., which will no doubt, contribute to its success.\n\nMiss Maggie Minnes who has charge, is, so far as we can learn, a competent and devoted teacher.\n\n4. There are thus employed in the Mission, a Missionary, a Matron, a Teacher, and a Helper who looks after the property and cultivates the land, in the interests of the Mission, the children themselves being taught, as far as possible, to share in the work.\n\nToronto, Nov. 8, 1893.\n5. The original cost of the land, with old building upon it, was $2000.00. The School House has cost about $300 only, the Indians themselves doing the greater part of the work, along with Mr. McKee who is in the service of the Mission.\n\n6. The cost of the New Girls Home is not definitely agreed upon, the highest estimate being $3000.00, the lowest $1000.00.\n\n7. The total amount expended on the Mission, up to the present time, is about $9000.00 (including the original purchase, but not the new Building).\n\n8. There are 220 Indians at Alberni, beside the Mission, and 1000 in the whole region, and amongst whom our Missionary has been laboring.\n\n9. Our late Missionary, Mr. McDonald who, to an unusual degree, won the affections of the Indians, used to follow them to the coast, and was about to start another school amongst the Ululahs, when compelled to retire.\n\nWe would like to contribute our part in the solution of the Indian problem, as far as funds and workers will enable us.\n\nWe trust the Government will give this application favorable consideration, and find it possible to make such a grant as the facts of the case will justify.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSec'y of F.M.C.\nThe Toronto Globe\nSept 19th '23\n\nPRESBYTERIAN CHURCH NOTES\n\nA new school has been opened at Albert, B.C., by Rev. Mr. Smith, recently. The Indian agent, Mr. Gibb, was present at the opening ceremony. After the ceremony tea was served on the lawn and the children were given presents. The occasion was one of joy and thanksgiving. The church members in calling also sent a box of supplies for the school. The school will have a number of children.

Since however the Foreign Mission Committee who is making application for grant in the matter of the only contemplated providing accommodation for 20 or 25 girls, and the plan shows provision for 29 beds in the dormitories, there can be no necessity for overcrowding, and should be very carefully avoided.\n\nAnd it is important matter about which nothing\nnothing can be learnt from the plan so that of ventilation, and I have supposed that the following plan, which experiences has shown to combine economy and efficiency, be adopted.\n\nBy having boxes, about inches square along the base-board of the walls, open at the ends or perforated at intervals, the vitiated air will enter it, and if this box is connected about its centre with the main chimney which comes up from the furnace & supplies the rooms with the fresh heated air by means of a pipe entering into it, a draught will be created which will keep drawing the vitiated air out of the boxes, and send it up the chimney.\n\nThe boxes might be set in under the skirting board, or inside walls, so that the skirting board would form the outer side of it; or in fact a hollow space left under the skirting board, if holes be left in it, hollow of the entrance of the foul air, would answer the purpose, and this might be done all round.\nround the room, or along one or two sides of it, as may be found necessary.\n\nThe foul air should, when possible, as already said, be conducted through pipes into or to a spot immediately adjacent to a chimney, but conductors have been found to work their way under ceiling into the space under the floor, always providing them the same way for the air to escape from there or through the roof, to the outside of the building.\n\nIt would seem moreover advisable to have a bath-room and water closet on the attic as well as the first floor, but there need be no difficulty in making the slight change required for that.\n\nIt is desirable that there is what is called a \"woman's room\" on the ground floor, but the presence of a man at all in a girl's building is regarded as most objectionable, and some arrangement must be made for him, if a man is required, elsewhere.\n\nSince no provision is made for any other room in the new building it may probably be assumed that this teaching is intended to carry on teaching in\nTo the old one.\n\nAll that apparently remains to recommend or to that the grant will lapse on 30th June 1876, and consequently should be expended before that date, but that the amount of \u00a34,157.72 must on no account be exceeded, and the general approval of the plan is subject to the condition that the Depot will not be called up to expend anything on the proposed building beyond the sum first mentioned.\n\nD.

Guillet Esq.\nInd Agent\nAlberni B.C.\nBritish Columbia,\n\nIndian Office.\n\nVictoria, 12 January 1895\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th ultimo relative to a letter sent to your Department through Mr. Wilson Stitt, Alberni, B.C., in which Mr. Stitt suggests sundry alterations which he thinks should be made in the Indian Reserves at Alberni etc.\n\nIn this connection I beg to submit herewith Mr. Agent Guillod's Report which explains the matter as it stands at present.\n\nMr. Stitt as a new comer may be excused for not understanding the difficulties to be met in carrying out the alterations which he proposes; not to mention the impolicy and injustice which attach thereto.\n\nMr. Guillod has all the information requisite respecting the grant made by the Department for the school at Alberni and if Mr. Stitt have anything to do with the school he can find all the information he requires with Mr. Guillod.\n\nAs regards the Indians being a nuisance, Mr. Guillod has not reported on that point but it is possible that the Town of Alberni may have been laid out somewhat too close to the Indian Reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nIn answer to your letter of the 29th December 1894, I have the honour to reply to your communication from Mr. Wilson Stitt of Alberni. I beg to state that I have seen Mr. Stitt who has recently been sent to Alberni to minister to the settlers of the Presbyterian persuasion and he tells me that, seeing that the Opetchesalt Reserve is on the high road and adjacent to the town of Alberni and that he hears of some drunkenness and prostitution on the Reserve it would be to the interests of the Indians if they were removed from such close contact with the whites, the miners at this place having brought in some undesirable citizens and proposed that they should be removed to the Tseshoot Reserve on the West side of the River one mile further up.\n\nWith regard to this I beg to state that in some respects it is not desirable to have a public road between the fort of an Indian Ranch and the River but this Tribe had the Reserve given to them before Alberni was settled and permission was asked from the Indians to have the Road where it is, that to move them to the west side of the River...\none mile further off would have little effect in affording facilities for procuring liquor. That the Reserve on the West side of the River belonging to another Tribe, the two Tribes would not assimilate and that the improvements on the Reserve are of much value to the Indians and if the land was sold it would not realize enough to pay them for their houses and improvements and I do not consider that the Band would ever agree to the removal.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\nHarry Guillod\nAgent\n\nA.W. Vowell Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVictoria\nMr. Hayter Reed,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nFeb. 7, 1896\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI received today from Mr. Swartout, our Agent at Alberni a communication addressed to him by Mr. Harry Guillod, in which is expressed your general approval of the plans for the proposed Home for Indian children at that place, and suggesting certain changes worthy of consideration. Mr. Swartout has himself sent a reply to Mr. Guillod, of which he has sent me a copy. I shall, however, take the liberty of addressing directly to the Department a fuller statement, and without waiting for a meeting of our Committee, in order to expedite matters.\n\n1. As to the number of children for which provision is made; We had intended, as you say, to provide for only twenty children. Upon further consideration, however, it was deemed advisable to expend so much money for the accommodation of a number not greater than we were providing for in the old building, although with very much crowding. It was also found that the Home has grown in popularity with the Indians, and that many who were formerly unwilling to send their children, are now seeking admission. Moreover, Mr. Swartout has commenced work at Uclalakht, and will thus gradually gain influence with these people, and induce, we hope, a number of them to send their children, so that we think before very long.\nthe full capacity of the new building will be required. The intention is to leave the old building where it is, and in some measure to utilize it in the same connection. Mr. Swartout thinks that much good would be accomplished if industrial work were begun, some of the children showing special aptitudes, which he would like to cultivate. There is evidently a large and opening field for usefulness, which we would like to develop to the best of our ability.\n\n2. As to the breathing space of the dormitories. I have submitted to our architect, Mr. Gordon, your suggestion, and he informs me that the Ontario Statute requires two hundred and fifty cubic feet per child in our Day Schools, and that in these dormitories for forty children there are four hundred cubic feet each child, or if fifty were received that there would still be three hundred and thirty cubic feet for each, which he considers sufficient space.\n\n3. The third point, as to ventilation, I have also submitted your proposal as to having boxing along the base board of the walls. He says that his intention was that the ventilation should be by registers in the chimneys,- inasmuch as there was one in connection with each dormitory. The method proposed by you, he says, is not much now in use, inasmuch as its advantages are over balanced by the disadvantage of leaving spaces in which\nToronto,\n\ndust and vermin accumulate, as well as producing draughts near the floor. However, he says, that if the Department has a decided preference for that method of ventilation that it can be easily and inexpensively adopted. He believes that registers in the chimneys, not too near the ceiling, will both make an escape for foul air, and at the same time, not cause the warm air to pass out of the room, as it would if nearer the ceiling.\n\n4. You object to what is called the \"man's room\" on the ground floor, and say that the presence of a man at all in the girls' building is regarded as objectionable. We on the other hand thought it so desirable that there should a trustworthy man about a place where there are so many women and children, that we made a special effort to provide that room. There are sixteen acres of land, which are cultivated in the interests of the Home, and Mr. McKee, who is at present employed, is an elderly man of special faithfulness and general usefulness, that we feel ourselves fortunate in having his services, and as well as giving a sense of security to the ladies employed in connection with the Mission. If however, the Department strongly objects to his occupancy of the room assigned to him in the new building, we, no doubt, can arrange otherwise. It would be necessary to have somebody on the ground capable of providing wood, and rendering such other ser-\nvices as a man only can render.\n\n5. There is no class room provided for in the Home, inasmuch as we have already a School House built upon the property, in which the children are instructed,- that School House was erected only a year ago, and as I understand, is very satisfactory.\n\n6. As to the bath room in the attic, as well as the first floor, we also considered that, and decided against it, for the reason that it was supposed better not to indulge that class of children with too many of the modern conveniences. Our Matron stated that the children were very fond of bathing in the river,- that even when there were several inches of snow upon the ground, they delighted to go out bathing. She fears that their taste for that practise, which she regards as a healthful one, might be destroyed if too much accommodation were provided in the Home,- she, of course, exercises prudence as to allowing the weaker children, or any of them, to such exposure as might be hurtful. The ladies of the W. F. M. S., to whom the plans were submitted, also expressed the same view. Hence the decision arrived at. I have no doubt, however, that the Committee would be prepared to re-consider that decision if you still adhere to your suggestion.\n\n7. The only other question to which attention has been drawn is the necessity of having the $1500.00 grant expended by the 30th., June. I hope that will be done, for we are anxious, as\nquickly as possible, to get the extra accommodation. Mr. Swertout will use his best endeavors to that end. The matter was delayed by sickness on the part of agents and architects, etc., considerably beyond the date at which we hoped to have had the building under way. We shall do our best to fulfill the requirements of the Government. At the same time, I am sure, we may anticipate generous consideration at the hands of the Government, as to the question of time, should we be unable for any cause beyond our control, to complete the building within the stated period.\n\nI need not say that there is no intention on the part of the Committee to call upon the Department for the expenditure in the erection of the building, of anything more than the sum named.\n\nAgain thanking you for your kindly and generous interest in the work,\n\nI remain, very truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSec'ty F. M. Committee.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th last relative to the proposed building for the reception of girls at Alberni etc.\n\nIn this connection I beg to submit herewith for your information copy of the Rev. M. Stewart's reply to Mr. Agent Gaudet's letter which included the several items of objections made by the Department to the plan of the proposed building.\n\nThe having boys in the same building with girls as stated by Mr. Stewart appears in my mind to be a very objectionable feature.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nMy dear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of this date, covering extracts from a letter you have received from Ottawa dated 25th Dec 1894.\n\nI have the honor to say - 1st as to breathing space in dormitories: When the Foreign Mission Committee of the Rocky Mt. Church in Canada first made application for a grant to the proposed Home it was calculated that accommodation for twenty children would be sufficient, and the original plan was drawn on that basis. Upon the Committee's reconsidering this matter after my arrival it was decided to increase the size of the dormitories and economize space in other parts of the building. An entirely new plan was therefore drawn showing a completed attic which was lacking in the first plan, and the breathing space in the dormitories amounts to upwards of 16,500 cubic feet or about 330 cubic feet for each child of 50 are accommodated, or 400 cubic feet for each child of 40 children are in the building.\n\n2nd As to ventilation - I will ask the executive to refer the matter to their architects and I have no doubt the suggestions made by your Department will be followed.\n\n3rd As to \"manse-room\" There are sixteen acres of land connected with the buildings belonging to the Committee at Alberni, the cultivation of which together with the ordinary work connected with supply of wood...\nwood be to make the presence of a man a necessity. As to some arrangement for him outside the building, I will refer this to our executive\u2014but permit me to remind you that since the opening of the present building\u2014a nearly 50\u2014boys have been accommodated in the building. Now as well as girls. This was not originally intended, but the circumstances have seemed to justify it. The Committee has never made a formal declaration upon the subject so that the phraseology used in the correspondence has remained unchanged but in case boys are not received there is no provision made for them. Would this fact not alter the opinion of your Department as to the presence of a man in the building?\n\nAs to classroom\u2014the Committee has provided a building for a Day School upon its premises in which teaching is carried on\u2014I have only to say that should my explanations appear satisfactory to your Department I trust they may have the effect of facilitating its approval of the plan, but in the mean time I shall forward your letter to Toronto and suggest that the Committee's reply be sent direct to your Department at Ottawa, and that a statement from their architects relative to provisions for breathing space be be enclosed.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Swartout\nSir,\n\nI have received from Mr W.F. Hodgins M.P., your letter to him of the 26th November last suggesting certain changes which you think should be made in the Indian Reserve at Alberni, and having made enquiries of the officers of this Department in British Columbia, I find that Mr Chilled, the Indian Agent, at that point, has recently seen you in the matter, and he reports the reasons given you for suggesting the removal of the Indians to the Tahlaht Reserve on the west side of the River one mile further up. Mr Chilled remarks in regard to this that in some respects it is not desirable to have a public road between the front of an Indian Reserve and the River, but that this tribe had the Reserve given them before Alberni was settled and permission was asked from the Indians to have the road where it is; that to remove them to the west side of the River one mile further away would have little effect in checking the facilities for procuring liquor; that as the Reserve on the West side of the River belongs to another Tribe it would not do to bring the two tribes together as they would not assimilate.\n\nRevd Wilson Stilt,\nAlberni B.C.,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6433, File 877-5, part 1)\nassimilate and further that the improvements on the Reserve at Alberni are of considerable value to the Indians, and if the land were sold it would not realize enough to pay them for their houses and improvements; and besides, it is not likely that the Band would agree to the removal.\n\nI think that if you will consider these and many other points which may suggest themselves to you, you must readily admit that any attempt to remove the Indians would be an act of injustice towards them and would only result in failure, as the obstacles to be overcome, apart from all other considerations, are at present insurmountable.\n\nMr Guillard has not reported on your remark that the Indians are a nuisance where they are now; but it is possible that the Town of Alberni may have been laid out somewhat too close to the Indian Reserve and in that case the fault rests with those who did so and not with the Indians.\n\nAs regards the Grant made by the Department towards the Indian School at Alberni, Mr Agent Guillard will be happy to furnish you with all the particulars you may require upon your applying to him therefor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nof Indian Affairs.\nMemorandum\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 11th October, 1895\n\n1st Mr. Campbell see 123496\n2nd C.C. see 123487\n\nL.P.

Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th inst., relative to a communication received by you from Mr. Shortt, relating to certain charges and views expressed by the Deptl about the building which I propose to erect at Alberni, and in reply to inform you that the committee has been unable to adopt any other plan than the one now under consideration, and therefore cannot agree to the proposal made by Mr. Shortt.\n\nThe committee is convinced that if the system of ventilation suggested by him is adopted, the school will be able to accommodate all the pupils being increased to the number mentioned, without any additional expense.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6433, File 877-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES OF CANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nThe Dept. also thinks that there should be a little room in the attic as well as on the first floor, all the more so in view of the probability of the number of pupils being considerably increased, nor does it see why the fact of having these facilities when required, must be allowed to interfere with the habit of practice of open air bathing without regard to the time or any other inconvenience in the house, although the difficulties which you contemplate in the erection of a wall about the premises are sometimes necessary, somewhat you say the individual whom you propose to occupy would be a most undesirable an undesirable as could be found, but more than that the principle of having a small family and sleeping under the same roof in a female institution can not be repelled with some, and it will be on the side. It is thought that no great difficulty would be found in arranging to have some little place for him to proceed to the building. That such course would be distinctly preferable. In this connection, etc., etc.\nWith reference to information given to me by Mr. Stewart, the Dept. considers his request to experience that it is most objectionable to have boys and girls in the same institution, unless by leaving separate buildings, or by some other arrangement they can be kept from the possibility of access to each other.\n\nWhile the Dept. would willingly afford any possible consideration with respect to utilization of the time or other which the grant might remain available, the difficulty is that funds do not go expenditure to the course of any public school year, except at the close thereof, and present control, but no doubt the purchase of materials the expenditure could be made before 30th June next.\n\nHodgson, Reid\n\nD.

D. McLean, Esq.\nActing Deputy Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI went to Indian school, Alberni, on 24th inst., to give Mr. Forrest the levels for new barn, the N.E. corner is nine feet lower than the S.W. corner.\n\nOwing to it being so high on the west side, we will have to do away with the door to the feed alley on that side, and put in a window in its place.\n\nWhile I was there Mr. Currie came along, and stated that he would like some changes. So I got the contractor to figure what the difference would be.\n\nMr. Currie wanted a high back concrete cow manger with metal divisions. In place of the low concrete manger, with metal back and divisions.\n\nHe would also like floor feed carrier, in place of the raise and lower feed carrier. He wants a bull pen, front and gate, to make up the difference.\nMr. Currie would also like the manure carrier track extended forty feet outside of barn. The contractor was running the track ten feet outside of barn.\n\nAs the water pipe will have to be extended from the school to the barn, a distance of five hundred and twenty feet. I told the contractor to send in a price, to supply two hundred feet of two inch galvanized pipe with elbows and connections and connect and lay same with three hundred and twenty feet supplied by Mr. Currie.\n\nThe doors in dormer at top of gangway on west side, calls for sliding doors, but as the eaves project one foot six inches, it will not be possible to open doors unless we build the dormer out two feet more. That would cost about sixteen dollars extra. Will I ask contractor for price for above before he gets that far with building.\n\nWill it be all right for contractor to use London barn fixtures?\n\nYou might please have the twelve columns.\nwith caps and bases, sent as soon as possible.

Trusting same will meet with your favourable consideration.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6433, File 877-5, part 2)\nThis is a new building which was completed in 1920 and opened December of that same year.\n\nThere is accommodation for about eighty pupils and a staff of eight teachers. With very slight change the attic could be used to accommodate at least ten more pupils. A fire escape from the attic to the second floor could be very easily arranged and this would make the attic available for any additional pupils that might apply for admission to this school.\n\nA new kind of covering was put upon the roof. This has not proved serviceable, as the roof leaks in several places. The beaver board on the ceiling in some of the rooms has been damaged. This mars the appearance of these rooms very much. My own opinion is that this roof will give trouble until it has been covered with shingles.\n\nDRAINAGE.\n\nAll drains are working well but the overflow from the septic tank lies around and becomes stagnant. In warm weather it is a menace to the health of the pupils. Six hundred feet of six inch pipe would carry this overflow to the river. The principal will undertake the work if the Department will supply the material. The cost would amount to about $100.00\n\nR. H. Cairns,\nInsp.\nOttawa, February 7, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 17th ult., with reference to the electric power used at the Alberni Indian Boarding School, I beg to say that if an electric lighting plant were installed at the school, the initial cost of installation, the operating of the plant, when taking into consideration the yearly depreciation of the storage batteries, would amount to more than what you are now paying for electric current used in the building.\n\nWith reference to your remarks regarding the operating of the laundry machinery, in order to overcome this difficulty, the Department is prepared to give consideration to the installing of a 3 H. P. Gasoline engine to operate the laundry machinery, in place of the present system.\n\nI should be very glad to hear from you regarding the installing of a gasoline engine, if it is your desire that this engine be installed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J. D. McLean)\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. H. B. Currie,\nPrincipal, Indian Boarding School,\nAlberni - B. C.\nA letter has been received from the Principal of Alberni Indian Boarding School complaining that the cost of the electric current used for lighting this institution is too high and asking that consideration be given to the installing of a generating plant at the school. The building is now lighted from current furnished by the city of Alberni and the yearly cost at the rate of 15 cents per kilowatt hour amounts to approximately $280.00 per year. In his letter the Principal states that this yearly outlay for light would soon pay for a plant at the school.\n\nWith reference to this matter, I beg to say that the cost of operating an electric lighting plant if installed at the school, taking into consideration the yearly depreciation in the storage batteries, would amount to more than what is now being paid by the school for electric current, and I cannot recommend the installing of a lighting plant.\n\nThere is a point, however, regarding the current furnished the school, which might be given serious consideration. The city turns off the current during the day time and as the school is depending on this electric current for the operating of their laundry machinery, it is necessary for them to do most of the laundry work at night. To overcome this difficulty, a 3 H.P. Gasoline engine could be installed to operate the laundry machinery.\n\nThe cost of a 3 type Fairbanks-Morse 3 H.P. Gas. engine would be approximately $175.00, and I beg to recommend that Mr. Currie be authorized to purchase and have same installed.\n\nArchitect.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTo W. H.

The steel columns will be here on the 22nd they are to cost $196.00.\n\nThe frame for the 1st story wall is up, the beams in place, and the joists laid.\n\nThe 8 bents are made and erected.\n\nThe work will go on a little faster now, as the tradesmen are working up off the ground. It is very muddy around the building just now, owing to the heavy rains, and the hauling of building material.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nW.W. Warnock.\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nHon Sirs,\n\nIn the matter of the Electric Power for our school. Should this not be paid by the Department? At present we buy the power from the City of Alberni. And while we try to economize in the amount used yet our bills run into an average of $21.00 per month.\n\nFrom 1st July till 31 Dec. we used 94 K.W.H. at 15\u00a2 per K.W.H. plus 20% -Fe#--Power-PURPOSES-#-LAUNDRY--------$ 16.92 and 589 K.W.H. at 15\u00a2 per K.W.H. plus 20%, for lighting purposes $106.02\n\nMeter Rental 3.00\nTotal $125.94\n\nIf the Department expect this expenditure to be met out of Maintenance. Then I think some other means must be employed to light the school. For $250.00 per year for light will soon pay for a plant of our own. Then we can have the power when we wish it. As it is we only have night service. And all our washing with the laundry machinery has to be done at night when the power is on. In the winter this is not too bad for we get the power about 4 P.M. and have it till about 9 A.M. But in the summer it is often 9 P.M. when the power comes on and is off again by 5 A.M. We see what chance this gives a staff to use the Laundry machinery in the summer months.\n\nIf the Department will assume the payment of the power as now, it will save the cost of the installation of a plan of our own. But if this is to be met out of Maintenance then I believe I can save by adopting some other lighting system and running the Laundry machinery by a small gasoline engine. Yours faithfully,\n\nH.B.

Deputy Secretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn checking up measurements in barn for fixtures, I find that you can't get a 5' horse stall as marked on plan; the measurements only give you 4' 5\".\nThe measurements for the cow stalls is 42\" so you can't take anything off the cow stalls, as they are small enough.\nThe space between cow stalls and horse stalls is 4' 10\" by taking the 10\" and adding it to horse stalls it would make them 4' 72\", but that is too small for heavy horses.\nThe bull pen is 12' and as the Contractor has ordered the bull pen front, I don't think we can make any change there.\nIf the London Company takes the stall measurement off the plan I'm afraid they will have to be altered. As they are shipped from Guelph.\nI think the best way out of it will be to make 3 stalls instead of 4. Let me know as soon as you can what to do.\n\nYours Respectfully,\nD.W.

The painters had to stop working on the 14th of Feb. 16th on account of snow and rain.\n\nMr. Currie is satisfied with 3 horse stalls in place of 4, that will make a saving to the department of about $275.\n\nThere should be a 4\" field tile on the west side of foundation, as there is quite a fall to that side of barn. There will have to be about 110 yds of loamy hard pan graded. The silo floor will be about 4 ft below ground on west side. The feed room door is now 3 ft below ground. There will have to be a road graded past the drive-way, and Silo around west side and past...\nthe feed room door. The material that is taken from west & south sides will be used to level around north & east sides. The contractor has leveled down all the material he excavated. Will I get tender for the grading, or will you expect McCurrie to do the work? I mentioned it to him, and he said that he did not have the time.\n\nMcCurrie wants to know if the Department is going to put up eve troughs and down spouts. I do not think it is necessary.\n\nI asked Contractor if he would put up a concrete wall on each side of drive way and fill in between, in place of 6x6\" posts & 2\" plank floor. He wanted $65 extra. I told him it was too much, then he came down to $50. I think that is also too much, so we would better let him do it according to specifications.\n\nNumber of men employed:\n\n| Feb 3rd | Feb 10th |\n|---------|----------|\n| 3       | 5        |\n| 5       | 12       |\n| 6       | 13       |\n| 4       | 14       |\n| 8       | 15       |\n| 9       | 16       |\n\nMaking doors in carpenter shop.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nW.W.

I, therefore, had The Albion Store Works, of this city, send up one of their experts to attend to the matter. He has reported that the oven is now in good shape. You will remember when furnishing the Alberni School it was impossible to obtain a new portable oven on the Coast and in order that one might be on hand at the opening of the School a second-hand one was purchased locally.\n\nI would recommend that this account be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Two steel fire escapes should be provided, leading from rear windows to the balcony. Will you communicate with Mr. Agent Cox, with a view to getting any information needed, secure competitive prices for the manufacture of the necessary equipment and place the order.

The Presbyterian Church authorities have drawn our attention to the advisability of supplying this equipment, in view of the increasing pupilage. Mr. Inspector Bitchburn has been instructed to secure prices and to arrange for the installation. Any assistance you can give him will be appreciated. Kindly inform the Principal.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education has mentioned the need of a drain from the level below the septic tank. You are authorized to purchase, after securing competitive prices, 600 ft. of 6\" field tile. The Rev.

It was the intention to use the attic floor for dormitory accommodation, when an increased pupilage made the extra space needed. It is now the intention, with the sanction of the Department, to take in more pupils, and two steel fire escapes must be installed from back windows to the balcony floor. The cost will not likely exceed $500.

By adopting this method the cost would, no doubt, be considerably less.\n\nPlease let me hear from you in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E.

You will note that Mr. Currie is willing to finance part of the enterprise, even if this would mean the sacrifice of something else.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6433, File 877-5, part 2)\nIpperwash Beach,\nSept. 3rd, 1923.\n\nTo -\nRev. J. H. Edmison, D. D.,\nHome Mission Office,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Edmison:\n\nPlease find enclosed some draft plans with accompanying explanation and estimated cost, sent me by Mr. Currie of Alberni, who asks that they may be forwarded to Ottawa. He also expresses the hope that they will go endorsed by you and the W. M. S.\n\nThe recreation hall is needed and was, I think, recommended by Drs. Wilson and Clay in the report they sent you some time ago, following their visit to Alberni.\n\nThe present rooms are not adequate, nor are they suitable as recreation rooms. They are in the basement, and are suitable places for the children to gather in and tidy up before going into the dining and class rooms. Even if they were suitable for recreation purposes, they would not give proper accommodation to more than half the present pupilage.\n\nI sent these papers all down to Mrs. Clark, in order that she might consult with you. You were out of town at the time, and now Mrs. Clark has been ordered to bed for three weeks absolute rest. So the matter has been returned to me to place before you. Mrs. Clark and I feel there is need for this recreation hall, but we regret that the request did not come in earlier, so as to be included in the Gov't estimates for the fiscal year.\n\nThe sum, however, is small, and Mr. Currie is prepared to assume half of it, so possibly it might be considered as an emergency and secured in that way. I would like to have spoken with you on the matter, but that would cause further delay as I do not return to the city until Sept. 11th.\n\nWhen you send this on to Ottawa, will you, at the same time, kindly draw attention to the absolute necessity of making provision for baths and toilets on the third floor at Alberni, now that they are having to use it for dormitory purposes.\n\nI spoke of this to Mr. Ditchburn when I met him in Victoria, and saw that he was not enthusiastic about the expenditure. Mr. Currie, in his letter, says - \"In the matter of bath and toilet accommodation on the upper floor, I took this up with Mr. Ditchburn. He would not sanction the expenditure, but referred the matter to Ottawa. I have had no word since.\"\nThe water pipes are laid to that floor, but there are no fittings. I would not consider the pressing of this matter in any way unreasonable. It is a necessity. Moreover, if this school is to have a male teacher, other changes should be made in the matter of staff room and toilet arrangements.\n\nThe present plan provides for a female staff only - apart, of course from the principal, and present arrangements will not be suitable when there is a mixed staff. If there are any points in connection with either of these matters on which I could give you further information, my address until Sept. 8th, will be Ipperwash Beach, Ravenswood P.O., Ontario. After Sept. 11th, I expect to be in Toronto, again.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSigned: (Mrs. H. R. & Helen W. Horne,\nAss't Sec. for Indian Work.)\nAlberni, B. C., August, 1923.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nHon. Sirs:\n\nAt the present time we have 90 pupils enrolled, 48 boys and 42 girls. This number is ready to grow just as soon as this school is ready to open her doors to new pupils. From thirty to fifty pupils might readily be obtained right now, were we open to receive them. I only mention this here to indicate to you that this school is bound to grow, and so the thing I am at this time approaching you for is not for the present only, but is a part of the necessary equipment, the need of which will, as time goes on, be felt more and more.\n\nThere are two play rooms in our school, one for boys, one for girls. The size of the said play rooms is 21 x 33 feet. I might here draw your attention to the need of play rooms here on the West Coast of Vancouver Island, more perhaps than any other place in the whole Dominion. For days at a time, (I might say weeks and be literally true) it never stops raining at certain periods of the year. At such periods the pupils out of Class Room hours, have no place to go but to the said play rooms, where they are so crowded that they cannot play. It is bad for their health and for their morals. It is little short of criminal to continue or to try to put in another winter (the wet season) as we now are, with our increased enrollment. It was bad last winter, but so many new pupils makes it imperative that the matter be no longer delayed, but that steps be taken to remedy the situation at once before the wet season starts. Our climate is the finest in the world and all the play hours are spent out of doors.\n\nAfter much mature consideration, I have come to the conclusion that to meet the situation a building at least 80 by 36 feet with 14 foot walls, suitable for such games as Basket Ball and for Gymnasium, is what we require. This building does not necessarily need be warm or expensive, but on account of its size it is bound to run into quite an item. For the time being, I would like to try it with an earth floor. If the earth floor proves unsatisfactory, I would make provision while building so that Joists and floor may be easily be added later.\n\nI am submitting for your approval a plan with estimates of the said play room. This is a proposition rather larger than I am able to finance at the present time, unsided, but to assure its immediate construction, I am ready to sacrifice in some other quarter and will agree to meet half the cost. Or what is perhaps more definite, if the Indian Department will contribute $600.00, I will undertake to erect such a building, in every way, neat, strong and satisfactory.\n\nAs this is a matter urgent I will be pleased to receive your early approval of the proposition. Your cheque for the six hundred after the completion to the satisfaction of your Indian Agent.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSigned: H. B.

To estimate cost of same is very difficult.\n\nFire hose for use on hydrants outside the building is worn out, is leaking badly and would most likely give out if used under full pressure. Immediate replacement advised.\n\nEdward E. Frost,\nAgt.\nOttawa, June 4th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Agent Frost, Port Alberni, has brought to the notice of the Department the need of repairs to the plumbing system at the Alberni Indian Residential School, and requests that early consideration be given to same. He forwards a letter from Robert Herbertson, a plumber of Port Alberni, in which it is stated that it is very difficult to give an estimate as to the cost of the work required to be carried out, as some of the work is covered up in the concrete floors. It is also stated that all the water closet flush tanks are falling down, as apparently they were only fastened to lath.\n\nI have to request that you will furnish a report stating what is required to repair and place this system in good condition. You should also state the approximate cost of having any work which you recommend carried out. I shall be pleased to have this information at your early convenience.\n\nThe Agent also draws attention to the urgent need of new fire hose, as he states that the hose at present in use is practically worn out. In this connection I enclose herewith a copy of his report regarding the matter. I shall be pleased if you will arrange to purchase, after obtaining competitive prices, approximately 250' of 1\u00bd\" hose, also 1 nozzle, 2 reducers and 5 sets of couplings. This equipment should be supplied at an early date. Please forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred. A memo. should accompany your vouchers showing the names of the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nBox 666, Victoria, B.C.\nOttawa, June 4th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st ultimo, regarding the repairs required to the plumbing system at the Alberni Indian Residential School and the need of a new supply of fire hose.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that we are referring these requests to Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn, and requesting him to report regarding the repairs to the plumbing and to arrange for the purchase and supplying of the fire equipment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to bring to the notice of the Department of Indian Affairs, the need of repairs to the plumbing system at the Alberni Indian Residential School, and respectfully request that this matter be given early consideration. I requested Mr. Herbertson, a plumber, to examine the system and if possible to make an estimate of the probable cost to put the system in good order; a copy of Mr. Herbertson's letter is attached hereto.\n\nI also found the hose supplied for use for fire protection, is worn out and should be replaced as early as possible; the hose on hand is canvas, 2\", and has been in use about 5 years; it leaks badly in many places under easy pressure, and would undoubtedly burst if subject to a full head of pressure in the event of a fire. I would further respectfully suggest that the hose supplied to replace that wornout, should be 1\u00bd\", and that the necessary reducers be fitted to the hydrants at which this hose is used, my reasons for the suggestion are, The hydrants are 2\", and a far better head of pressure is obtained when a smaller diameter hose is used, further the city has on hand hose that could be used in connection with 1\u00bd\" fittings, but has no hose or connections to match that now in use at the Alberni School, so that in the event of a serious fire at that institution, it is now dependant entirely on its own resources, but, if supplied with hose matching that in use by the city fire brigade, outside appliances could be used in the event of a serious fire.\n\nI made enquiries of the Fire Chiefs, as to the efficiency of the 1\u00bd\" hose and they strongly recommend it with 2\" hydrants.\n\n1\u00bd\" Insurance Mill brand hose, 250 feet would cost $90.00, Nozzle, $1.50, 2 reducers for hydrants from 2\" to 1\u00bd\", $2.50, each, 5 sets of couplings, attached to 5 fifty foot lengths of hose, $14.00. The probable approximate cost will be under one hundred fifteen dollars, including express or freight.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEdward E.

I her leave to submit report to you as follows:\n\nIt is almost impossible to give estimate on work to be done as for instance, none of the work is covered up in the concrete floors, almost all of the W.C. flush tanks are falling down as apparently they were only fastened to lath; these would have to be taken down and a bound set flush with plaster to fasten tank in a satisfactory manner. In disturbing old work one cannot tell what is likely to happen before the job can be passed as O.K.\n\nIt has always been my policy to do first class work and if I am favored with instructions from you to proceed with the necessary repairs, I can promise you a first class job, and reasonable.

Mr. Cairns refers to the present hogpen as a poor object lesson for the boys of the school.

Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\n602 Holden Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\n602 Holden Building,\nVancouver, B.C.,\nMarch 17th, 1925.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir:\n\nThis acknowledges the receipt of your letter of March the 9th, No. 159-1-5. With reference to the filthy state of the pig pen at Alberni Residential School, I may say that I mentioned the matter to the Principal and he and I visited the pig pen. He also informed me that a few days previous a litter of pigs had died because of the bad conditions that prevailed. He further told me that he intended to erect a new pig pen at an early date, at the same time showing the location for the new building.\n\nIn my reports on this school, I have frequently urged that work should be done to bring the surroundings into harmony with the striking appearance of the school building and the new barn. Very little has been done. May I request the Department to write Mr. Currie, the Principal, suggesting that he put things in better shape.\n\nThe old barn might be torn down, something might be done with the building that was used as a classroom. The lumber in these buildings would go far toward erecting a good pig pen. A hen house and a wood-shed should be erected. There is a surplus of over $580.00; some of this might be used to put things in better shape.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools of B.C.\nOttawa, March 9th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your report on your inspection of the Alberni Indian Residential School drawing attention to the condition of the place where the pigs are kept, I have to request that you will state whether you gave any instructions to the Principal to have the same cleaned up and placed in a more satisfactory condition. We note the need of a pigpen and henhouse, but have no funds at the present time to erect new buildings for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. H.

Scott, Esq., F.A.S.C., Litt.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nOn November 20th, we wrote giving a list of our requirements for 1924. In that list we asked for half the cost of a recreation hall at Alberni, B.C. Recently I learned from the Women's Missionary Society that the need for this had become so urgent that Mr. Currie went ahead with the work and I believe it is completed. I at once got in touch with Mrs. Horne of the W.M.S. and asked her if she would secure from Mr. Currie the statement of the cost and the receipts. I am enclosing now a copy of a letter sent by Mr. Currie to Mrs. Horne, with the receipts, also a copy of a letter from Mrs. Horne, dated February 18th. I hope the Department will grant us half the cost of this. If these receipts are not necessary for your files, we would be glad to have them returned.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/EWS\n\nIndian Affairs.

This hall solves the problem, and we are hoping that the Department will find it possible to grant our request, made some time ago, and allow us for at least half of the cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd.)

Ditchburn,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nRearrangement of Staff accommodation, with addition of necessary bathroom, etc.\n\nHalf the cost of Recreation Hall.\n\nThe erection of a Recreation Hall at Alberni is in line with recommendations made to us in a report by our Home Mission Superintendent for B.C., and a representative of Victoria Presbytery, after visiting Alberni School in company with Mr. Ditchburn, Inspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThey strongly advised the appointment of a male assistant for the Principal, to help particularly with the boys, and recommended the erection of a recreation hall. We heartily concurred in this. The B.C. climate demands for considerable periods, indoor recreation rooms. Those provided in the Alberni School are in the basement, and are too small for the number of pupils now in attendance. The need is particularly marked on the boys' side. The sewing room in some measure relieves the difficulty on the girls' side.\n\nPlans were submitted to the Department during the past summer; the estimated cost was small, and the Principal undertook to meet half. It was urgent that the building should be ready before the bad weather set in this fall.\n\nThe Principal is meeting half the cost, and we are confidently hoping that the Department will make good the other half as requested in the explanations which accompanied the plans now in the hands of the Department.\n\nThe request for rearranged Staff accommodation, with additional Staff bathroom, grows out of the report above referred to, followed also by a similar request from the Department re the appointment of a male assistant for the Principal. We have endeavored to comply with this request, but as can be readily seen, the introduction of increased male staff to a building arranged with a view to a female staff only, means rearrangement of rooms, and consequent additional bathroom accommodation. Representations regarding this requirement are already in the possession of the Department.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to herewith submit Voucher No. 50A for $10.84 in favor of the Albion Stove Works, of this city.\n\nIn explanation of this account I beg to say that recently when on a visit to the Alberni Industrial School a complaint was made to me that the kitchen range would not sufficiently heat the hot water in the 80-gallon tank, and on my return to the city I took the matter up with the Albion Stove Works, who furnished the range, to see what could be done to remedy this difficulty. The firm informed me that the only way to overcome this trouble was to put in a second coil in the range. I therefore authorized the firm to make the coil and ship the same to the School by prepaid freight and notified the Principal to this effect. I would recommend, therefore, that this account be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E.

E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nChief Sup't. Indian Agencies,\nVictoria B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn,\n\nI have at last got quotations on the plumbing fixtures required before the top Dormitory of our School can be put into use.\n\nWhat I require is one toilet on the second floor, on the girls side of the school. (The floors are -- Basement, Ground Floor, First Floor, Second Floor.) For this toilet I propose to have one corner (North West) partitioned off 4 x 4 feet, this taken in one window, see the photo enclosed. The soil pipe from this toilet will go through the wall and run down the outside of the building, as indicated by red line on Photo, and connect with a waste dead end now there. Water to supply this Toilet for flushing purposes is now in this Dormitory and can easily be connected up. The only carpenter work in connection with this is 3 feet of partition 8 feet high, and one door.\n\nOn the Boys side of the school one toilet is required for the boys. One toilet for the Staff, A Staff Bath Tub, and a wash bowl. I propose to install the whole lot, in the small room taken off the Dormitory on the second floor at the time the school was built, for a disinfecting room. This Disinfecting room is directly over the boys wash room on the first floor. The soil pipe from the above fixtures will come through the floor and be suspended to the ceiling in the boys wash room, cross this room, run down the wall, exposed, again going through the floor to the hall of the ground floor, crossing said hall suspended to ceiling, passing through hall wall, into hall that runs to the laundry, then down to connect with soil pipe passing, at present, through the groceries store room or the basement floor. This soil pipe at present is in use in connection with the bath room fixtures in the Boys Infirmary. The Carpenter work necessary is as I have indicated on the rough sketch enclosed. And a window in the roof both for light and ventilation. At present this disinfecting room is dark.\n\nI am enclosing you the three tenders I have received for this work, together with my remarks to each. The first tender is Thacker and Holt, Victoria, for $530.00 the school to furnish accommodation for their mechanic, freight fixtures from station to school and in conversation with me said that it would not pay to take a carpenter from Victoria to Alberni but for me to add to their tender what I considered the cost of the Carpenter work and material would amount to. My estimate for this, and what I would agree to have it done for is one hundred dollars. So really for the complete work Thacker and Holts tender is $630.00\n\nThe second tender is that of R.W.Evans, Alberni, for the complete work at $622.00. This is the tender that were I to let the contract would accept.\n\nThe third tender is in two parts, I might say three parts. The first part of this tender is from the Port Alberni Hardware store and is for the fixtures only $275.00. The second part of the tender is from H.E. Neale, to do the installation, supply soil pipe and fixtures at $462.50. The third part of this is the Carpenter work, you see Mr. Neal says he has not figured on that at all. So I take it that he wants us to\nprovide the carpenter to do this work. In such a case I think again one hundred dollars should be added to this contract price. So the three fixtures, Alberni Hardware Co., $275.00; Labor, Pipe, fittings H.E. Reale $462.00; Carpenter work added $100.00.\n\nTotal $837.00\n\nIn your letter you told me to consult Mr. A.W. Neill member for Comox-Alberni, as to who should be asked to tender. The parties that he wished to have a chance to tender was the parties sending in the third and highest tender. I called Mr. Neill up and informed him the prices quoted and he said in view of the much lower tender of Mr. Evans they could scarcely expect their tender to be considered.\n\nTrusting this is sufficiently full information and that the work may be got under way just as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.B.

Principal Currie also wrote me about this subject some two months ago but as he did not say just what was wanted or give any approximation of the cost I wrote him requesting that he obtain estimates locally and forward the same to this office, together with a sketch, when I would lay the matter before you. I informed Dr. Scott of what I had done.\n\nI have just received a letter from Principal Currie, with which he has furnished a sketch of what he requires, and tenders from three firms are as hereunder:\u2014\n\nR. W. Evans, Alberni........................................... $622.00\nThacker & Holt, Victoria, $530.00+$100.00.................. 630.00\nH. H. Neale, Port Alberni................................. 837.00\n\nProviding the Principal's estimate of the cost for carpenter work is correct ($100.00) the most acceptable tender is that of R. W. Evans, of Alberni.\n\nAttached hereto please find Principal Currie's letter, sketches and tenders. I would recommend that these fixtures be installed. If you concur in this, please determine on which tender is the most favourable and instruct me in the matter. I should like the papers returned after you have made copies for your own files.\n\nW.B./W.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEnclosures:\u2014\n\nW. E.

What matters are to attend to are as follows:\n\nThe supply of water seems to have a certain amount of grit washing through which has cut the seats of some of the valves and taps, destroying the washers; about 20 taps will require to have the seats reground and about 50 taps to be rewashed. Seventeen of these taps are in the Laundry. Four compression taps in the public lavatory have the handles broken off and will need renewal. Two lavatory basins have come loose from the wall and will need to be reset; one toilet bowl is choked by something becoming permanently lodged in the earthenware bowl and will need to be renewed; one Toilet Bowl is cracked and will need renewal. There are six Toilet Tanks out of order; one of these will have to be renewed, the others wanting certain parts and all want new rubber flush valves and ball cock washers.\n\nThe supply to the Slop Sink is choked in the wall and needs to be cut out and cleared. There are two Toilet Seats broken and will have to be replaced; new stoppers for twelve wash basins and four baths are required. The Bath in the girls Lavatory on ground floor is disconnected and the waste in the concrete floor choked; a portion of the floor will have to be taken up, the pipe cleared and repaired and the bath replaced, the main waste valve on the washing machine is broken and needs repairs.\n\nThe estimated cost of the above work will amount to approximately $225.00, and we hereby guarantee to do the work at this figure.\n\nAwaiting your further esteemed orders.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThacker & Holt Per (Sgd.)

June 30, 1925.\n\nYour File 159-1-5.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 4th instant referring to the report from Mr. Agent Frost, of the West Coast Agency, that the plumbing system at the Alberni Indian School was in need of considerable repair, I beg to inform you that recently Mr. Wm. Holt, of the firm of Thacker and Holt, Victoria, (who installed the plumbing system at this School) informed me that he had to go up to Alberni on business, and, as he was conversant with the system at the School, I asked him to look over the condition of the plumbing and give the Department a report on what was necessary and the price for putting the same in good condition.\n\nTo-day I have received a report from Messrs. Thacker and Holt on what is considered to be necessary and offering a price of $225.00 to do the work. A copy of this report is attached hereto for your information.\n\nThe wearing out of the valves and washers in the taps is no doubt due to the fact that considerable sediment got into the water main, where it broke on two occasions a few years ago. It would appear to me that the blame of this work necessary at this time is due to either carelessness or willful destruction on the part of the pupils owing to lack of proper oversight by the authorities at the School, for it is remarkable to say the least, that whereas the plumbing system at the Kuper Island School put in by Messrs. Thacker and Holt now nearly fourteen years ago, is to-day in splendid condition, but the system at the Alberni School is, after a much less time, in the condition reported.\n\nAs the plumber Robert Herbertson, of Port Alberni, does not appear to be in a position to give a figure for the work, I would recommend that the offer of Messrs. Thacker and Holt be accepted.\n\nWith regard to the 250 feet of 1\u00bd\" hose, couplings, nozzle and reducers which you requested me to purchase, I beg to say that these were ordered from the Dominion Rubber System (Pacific) Limited a week or so ago, and voucher and abstract of tender have been forwarded to the Department.\n\nWED/HM.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

This is a substantial building\nwith a good cement foundation. Mr. Cairns further suggests\nthat a portion of the work could be done locally under the\nsupervision of Mr. Currie and Mr. Johnson, who has manual\ntraining.\n\nWe are anxious to make it possible to retain Mr.\nJohnson in this position, and await your favorable reply at\nthe earliest date possible.\n\nIt will be necessary also in the near future to\nprovide a cottage for the farmer on the property if we are\nto keep a competent man.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSec.

This was while Mr. Holt was repairing the plumbing system.\n\nI got in touch with Mr. Holt, asking him what he knew about the work spoken of by Indian Agent Frost and he stated that while the Principal had him look over the blow-down return valve, the front arch of the firedoor and the grates of the boiler, he did not know anything about the tubing being pitted but he would see the Inspector of Boilers and make a report to me. The Inspector of Boilers has only just returned to Victoria and Mr. Holt has reported that so far as the pitting of the tubing is concerned this can be retarded by the use of a little soda and Principal Currie has been so instructed.

I thought you would like to see this \"Old Class Room\". You will note it is a good substantial building. You see the North End or the East Side in the Photo.\n\nNote how the hill falls away rapidly from the East Side of the School. The removal of the School will require to fill in the basement, and grade up the ground at this point, at least 200 yards of earth. The contour of the hill is about like this. The blue shading present indicating the necessary fill.\n\nH.B. Carne.\nOttawa, March 27th, 1926.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, relative to the starting of a manual training class at the Alberni Indian Residential School and the moving of the old classroom to another site. The sketch plan of the present lay out of the grounds and buildings, as well as the photo of the old classroom building, was also received.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has not contemplated the question of the moving of this old building to another site. You may, therefore, arrange to have the roof repaired and any painting required carried out. It is noted that you have the material for the purpose on hand. Any labour required for the purpose should be performed without any expense to the Department.\n\nWe regret that we have no funds to provide for the expense in supplying any equipment required for manual training purposes or for the payment of the services of a teacher. If, however, you are able to arrange for the carrying on of this activity, and the supplying of a moderate equipment for the purpose, the Department will be pleased if you will commence this work for the benefit of the senior pupils.\n\nThe photo of the old classroom is returned herewith as requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. H. E. Corrie,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nAlberni, B.C.\nI desire the Indian Department to start a manual training centre at Alberni Indian Boarding School as soon as convenient. Our S.S. teacher Mr. Gee Johnson has manual training qualifications. We only pay Mr. Johnson $900.00 per year. And he is a man who can command more. As I understand the Department pay about $500 per lesson to the Manual teachers. It would add about $200.00 more per year to Mr. Johnson's salary. Add be more of inducement for him to stay.\n\nWe have a very good building that might be used for this purpose with very little expenditure. (Our old Class Room.) I understand this matter has been already before the Department for their consideration. And further that a recommendation has been made to move the Old Class Room to another location. It is this latter that I object to. My reasons for objecting are:\n\n1. That we need this building as it is. Not so much for the upper portion that will be used as a Manual Training Work room. But this building is erected on a splendid Concrete wall and has a concrete floor. It is next to indispensable for the storage of roots. We have no other place where they might be kept. And keep them we must, and if this building is removed another will have to be provided for the same purpose.\n\nI understand the special idea in moving the Old Class Room from a scenic standpoint. From such a standpoint then the Teachers Cottage erected in 1925 should not have been erected at its present site. And further the new proposed site for the Old Class Room, from a scenic standpoint, is even more objectionable than where it now is. The proposed new site is on the North West corner of the Girls play ground, this is a menace to the safety of the girls. To bring the boys right where the girls are all the time, where the Old Class Room is now just to the East of the girls play ground but by erecting a fence from the old Class Room or the Teachers Cottage it is practically cut off from the girls play ground. In such case entrance may be obtained to the old Class Room from the Public Road or the North Boundary of the Property.\n\nI am enclosing you a Plan of our present lay out. From this plan you will see there is a roadway right around the girls play ground. While I object to the moving of the Old Class Room, yet if it is your idea that it should be moved then I propose that at least it be moved say 80 or 100 feet further West than is now proposed. This will take it across the road and out of the girls play ground altogether.\n\nI would like you to give careful consideration to the rough sketch I am sending before deciding this matter.\n\nThe Old Class Room does need a new Roof and paint both of which I purchased last summer, and would have had them on only this matter of the Removal of the School came up and was delayed doing the work till the matter was settled. I sincerely believe my proposals are the ones that should prevail, from a practical standpoint.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.B. Currie\n\nIndian Affairs.

Your recommendation concerning manual training activity at the Alberni Indian Residential School has been favourably considered. Mr. Indian Agent Frost, with whom the Department has been in correspondence, is of the opinion that classes might start immediately, using the old classroom, as it has lately been fixed up somewhat by the school management. He is being authorized to engage an instructor and to purchase a few tools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCommissioner's Office,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C., Oct. 30, 1926.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Indian Education\n\nIn connection with my report on the Estimates for the Fiscal Year 1927-28, I dealt only with the item for General Administration, leaving out anything pertaining to Indian Education.\n\nAt the Alberni school the Principal is desirous of having a manual training department. It is proposed that the old classroom building should be moved close to the main school and fitted out for manual training purposes, the cost of which will be approximately $600.00 to cover the cost of removing present building, equipment, all tools and working materials.\n\nI am attaching hereto copies of correspondence from Indian Agent Frost on this subject. As these came to hand after the Estimates for 1926-27 had been forwarded to Ottawa, I decided to hold the matter off until dealing with those for 1927-28.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) W. E. DITCHBURN,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to bring to your attention the question of Manual Training for boy pupils of the Alberni Indian Residential School, and would like to know if you think the expenditure necessary for that purpose would be justified.\n\nThe training of boy pupils is at present confined entirely to farming, and that, only in a limited way, as the facilities of the school does not admit of a thorough training. The boys are taught dairying, hog and poultry raising, and the cultivation of such ordinary farm crops as are suitable for use at the school and on the school farm, but, as farming is the least likely industry to be practiced by the boys after leaving school, I think other lines of training could be taught that would be of more practical benefit in fitting the boys to earn a livelihood.\n\nThe facilities existing at the school in favour of this project, are, the building previously used as a classroom would be suitable, if moved and sills put under it, I estimate the cost of moving the building $100.00, the cost of material for sills $25.00. A fully qualified Manual Training instructor is available whose services could, I think be secured for $5.00 per week for two lessons, or say $200.00 per year.\n\nThe cost of tools I estimate at about $300.00, and material for interior fitting of the building for training purposes, $25.00, the work itself could be done by the pupils as part of their training.\n\nIf you consider this suggestion worth consideration, I could get expert estimates as to cost of moving the building, and tools, if you so direct.\n\nI may say that I discussed this matter with Mr. Cairns on his recent visit and he expressed himself as in favour of the suggestion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"Edward E. Frost\".\n\nW.E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nVictoria, B. C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nVictoria, B.C.,\nJanuary 19, 1926.\n\nYour File 1410/26/1\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant referring to the matter of giving manual training instruction to the pupils of the Alberni Residential School, and in reply I beg to say that I am perfectly in accord with your remarks contained therein.\n\nIn various places throughout the Province of British Columbia, the Department has already in operation a system such as the one to which you refer, that is by employing a qualified manual training instructor of the district for this purpose. This instructor is generally connected with some of the white public schools.\n\nI, therefore, would be glad if you would go further into this matter, and get an estimate on the cost of having the buildings and the tools. You should also give particulars as to who the qualified manual training instructor is to whom you refer. On receipt of this information from you, I will then take up the matter with the Department and, if possible, have the scheme put through, for I am fully impressed with the fact that it is something of this character that the Indian boys of the West Coast should be taught, as they are not now, and never will be able to do anything very much in the way of farming, consequently any extensive instruction along this line will be of no practical value to them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\"W.H.Ditchburn\",\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nH.E.Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nDuncan Scott, Esq., Litt.D., F.R.S.C., Toronto,\nDeputy Superintendent General, Nov. 15,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, 1926.\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nWe are urged by the Woman's Missionary Society of the United Church of Canada to make application for a grant to build an Assembly Hall in connection with the Alberni, B.C., Indian Residential School.\n\nThere is no place in connection with this school where the Indian parents can meet with their children at any of the school exercises or meetings, and it is desired that an Assembly Hall which would accommodate 200 people should be erected during the coming summer.\n\nI trust that an appropriation will be made for this purpose.\n\nI am,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.E.

There is only five miserable milk cows here and two good cows will give me more milk than the five. It is easy to pick up cheap miserable stuff like what is now here. But it is not much of a training to boys to handle such stuff. I know from actual experience at Alberni that as soon as good cows came on the place the interest of the boys increased 100%. At Alberni I built up the very best herd of dual purpose Pure Bred Shorthorns in the Province. Just look up Report No. 18 of Pure Bred Dairy Cattle of the Dom. Government. There you will see in the 4 year old Shorthorn Section my cow \"Augusta Glad Eyes\" led all Canada in her class, and Roan Marie in the Mature Class occupied 4th place in Canada. In leaving Alberni, nothing grieved me so much as leaving them behind. I left over 30 head at Alberni that any one might envy, and that number is more than the present Principal needs, or can handle to advantage. \"I must have cows here after the summer vacation, my resources will only permit me to secure \"just cows\". I believe I can buy four cows or heifers from Alberni School for $600.00 and pay the transportation. Will you allow me a grant of $600.00 for this purpose?\"\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the absence of Rev.

I regret that there was no specific appropriation for this purpose; but an item of $1,500 was allowed for the purpose of erecting a farmer's cottage at this school. I am somewhat in doubt as to which building is the more important and I am writing to Mr. Indian Commissioner Ditchburn for a recommendation. If you can comment on the relative importance of the two buildings in question, I shall be pleased to have a further communication.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

The church authorities have pressed for an assembly hall, which may be used as a gymnasium. From other sources, the Department has learned that a farmer's cottage is more urgently required. Please make enquiries and let me know which of the two buildings should be erected this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E.

BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., July 6, 1927.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that I have received a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Frost with regard to the barn at the Alberni Indian Residential School which is apparently in need of some repairs as the building seems to have gotten out of plumb. I would, therefore, advise that immediate steps be taken to have the building put back into its proper position. In order that this may be done I have asked Mr. Frost to obtain tenders for the work and submit the same to yourself. I am attaching hereto copy of Agent Frost's letter with which he enclosed a rough sketch which I am also attaching hereto.\n\nWED/KD.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIndian Agent's Office\n\nPort Alberni, B.C.,\nJune 7th, 1927.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRepairs needed to new barn at Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nI beg to advise you that the new barn at the Alberni Indian Residential School is in need of some repairs to doors. This damage has, in my opinion, been contributed to by their failure to open freely, caused by the pulling out of plumb of the barn, caused by the weight of the manure conveyer which is attached to the upper portion of that structure and supported, originally, only by guys or stays which are fixed to the higher portion of upper structure. The weight of the conveyer with its load has pulled the building out of plumb endways and caused the doors to stick in closing or made it impossible to close them. The weight strain has recently been relieved by placing a post and beam support at the extreme end of the conveyer arm and I think will prevent the further movement of the building, but I think it would be advisable to have the building put back in to plumb and braced to prevent it again moving.\n\nRough sketch enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) Edward E. Frost,\nIndian Agent.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to bring to the attention of the Department the enclosed account for plumbing repairs at the Alberni Indian Residential School, Vouch No. 54, amount $9.85. I respectfully request the approval of the Department for the work done, and recommend the payment of the account, as on visiting the school on the 7th instant I found the toilet in question out of repair and in urgent need of attention and the outlet or sewer pipe blocked causing flooding which was unsanitary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEdward E.

Herbertson & Son, Port Alberni, B.C., for repairs to plumbing at Alberni Indian Residential School, June, 1927.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\n\n[Handwritten note: Urgent repairs made pending report and approval.]\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEdward B. Host\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 1\nSir:\n\nIn accordance with instructions contained in your No. 15/9097, of 28th ultimo, re need of assembly hall or farmer's cottage for Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nI beg to report that I have carefully looked into this matter and in my opinion, which is concurred in by the new Principal, Rev. F.B. Pitts, there is more need of a cottage for the farming instructor than there is for an assembly hall at that school. The need of the assembly hall is not apparent and the purpose of such a building is not clear to me, while the need of farmer's cottage is apparent. The present occupant of that position has held it for the past two years and during that time has only been able to be with his family for a few days on three occasions during the school holidays. He has tried to obtain housing accommodation for his family in Alberni but has failed to do so as there are no vacant houses in this vicinity.\n\nThere is at present a building which was erected in 1925 and is being used as a play and games room for the boys during the winter and in bad weather. It is approximately seventeen feet long by thirty-five feet wide. It is constructed of rough lumber on a concrete foundation but it is not floored. If funds are available the building might be floored, windows repaired and screened and whatever gymnastic appliances deemed necessary installed if so desired. If you desire I will get an estimate of the approximate cost of a concrete or lumber floor for this building. I do not think a concrete floor is best suitable for a playroom or gym. The building is already fitted for electric light. The estimated cost of any kind of floor you prefer and the cost of window repairs and screening will be obtained and submitted at your instruction.\n\nI may say that a suitable site for a cottage is available, less a hundred yards from the school in close proximity to farm buildings, just outside the school enclosure.\n\nYour further instructions if any awaited.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) Edward B. Frost,\nIndian Agent.\n\nW. M. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th May in which you desire that information be obtained as to whether it would be more desirable to build a cottage for the farmer at the Alberni Residential School or an assembly hall which might be used as a gymnasium.\n\nIn reply I beg to say this matter was taken up with Mr. Indian Agent Frost and the Rev. Mr. Pitts, Principal of the School, and they both concur that the building of a cottage for the Farming Instructor is much more essential than is an assembly hall.\n\nThe Indian Agent informs me, however, that there is a building at present which was erected in 1923 and is now being used as a play and game room for the boys during the winter and in bad weather. It is constructed of rough lumber on a concrete foundation but is not floored. If funds were available the Indian Agent suggests that the building might be floored and the windows repaired and screened. This would answer the purpose of a gymnasium for some time. I would, therefore, beg to recommend that a cottage for the Farming Instructor be erected in preference to an assembly hall but if there are sufficient funds available a wood flooring might be put in the present gymnasium room and the windows repaired and a small amount of gymnastic equipment purchased.\n\nAttached hereto please find copy of Mr. Indian Agent Frost's letter on the subject.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nEnclosure:-\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 13, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15/9511 of the 6th instant, reporting that a farmer's cottage is the most urgent building requirement at the Alberni Indian Residential School. I am pleased to inform you that $1,500 is available for this purpose, and I am enclosing a set of plans of a building that can be erected for this amount. You should secure a competent carpenter foreman, who would get out a list of the material necessary so that you could make the purchase, and who would then take charge of the construction of the cottage at the school. It would be well to engage local labour, and the school management should be given to understand that all hauling and rough labour should be provided by the members of the staff and the older boys, without cost to the Department. If any saving can be effected, the balance will be available for flooring the outdoor playroom and making other repairs.\n\nI have also your 15/9512 of the 6th instant, regarding the barn at this institution, and in reply I beg to state that the Department will await the tenders that Mr. Indian Agent Frost is to forward.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

There are still some thirty tons of hay lying in the fields waiting for favourable weather conditions and as same now prevail it would in the best interest of the school to harvest same as soon as the bracing beam mentioned in the item No 6 can be put in place.\n\nApproval of the action taken by this office is respectfully requested please.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEdward E. Host\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. Henion has followed up by visits to the building a report received at Head Office that the heating system at the above building was not giving satisfaction.\n\nMr. Henion found that the local authorities called in Messrs. R. Robertson & Sons, Heating Contractors at Fort Alberni, to go over the system, in an endeavour to locate the trouble, and correct same.\n\nThe Contractors were not familiar with this work or type of system, and did not do the original installation. They wrote to the C.A. Dunham Co., asking for full particulars regarding the job. Upon receipt of this arrangements were made to have Mr. Henion make an inspection.\n\nIt was found three or four radiators would at times fail to heat up, and also a part of system farthest removed from the boiler room appeared somewhat sluggish. In order to overcome this condition the boiler pressure was raised to 5 to 8 lbs.\n\nSome of the connections will need to be changed to give proper grading to the spring pipe to the radiators. This matter was taken up by Mr. Henion with Mr. Robertson, and instructions given how to accomplish the necessary change.\n\nThe reason that the system farthest removed from the boiler room does not heat is due to carrying excessive pressure on the type of system installed. The system as installed is a gravity system of steam heating with the air relieved from the return piping through a Dunham Air Eliminator. When pressures over one above 8 ozs. are carried on the system the Eliminator seals the system, due to the water rising in the stand pipe and causing the float to close the valve on the Eliminator and thus preventing air from leaving the system. The continued carrying of high pressure above 8 ozs. makes the system practically a sealed system, and steam cannot find enter the radiation due to the fact that air cannot find its way out of the return piping.\n\nThis condition noted above is due to the manner of firing and the fuel used, which is wood, which causes the steam pressure on the boiler to build up before the radiation throughout the system is filled with steam, therefore the radiators at the end of the system or mains, are the ones that suffer by lack of steam.\n\nWe would recommend that a No. 10 Dunham Return Trap be installed which will permit the pressure on the boiler to be carried at any time from 1 to 10 lbs., and the air would be vented out of the return mains through an eliminator, and the water returned to the boiler by the return trap.\n\nIt is almost impossible to maintain a steady condition of pressure on the boiler when burning wood as fuel, and a gravity steam heating system using only an air eliminator for venting the air from system will freeze.\ntime to time give trouble as is being experienced on this system, but with\nthe installation of a Dunham Return trap air will have a free vent from\nthe return piping regardless of pressure carried on the boiler.\n\nWe would further recommend that all of the traps be gone over and\ncleaned. That is the covers and discs taken off, and any foreign matter\nwithin the trap bodies removed.\n\nThere appears to be evidence of having carried too high a water\nline on the boiler, and we believe that the manufacturers of the boiler\nshould be communicated with and the height of the water line for the boiler\nascertained, and the operator instructed to carry the water line at\nthe level stipulated by the manufacturer.\n\nThe Damper Regulator which is now connected to the boiler, should\nbe connected to the balanced Check Damper on the smoke pipe, and to the\ndraft damper on front of the boiler, so that these can work together with\nthe damper regulator, and assist in maintaining a steady pressure on\nthe boiler.\n\nWe would recommend that a compound gauge be installed on the\nboiler, since the gauge now on the boiler has been found defective\nand causing trouble in the past.\n\nThe Air Line Valves now installed on the end of steam mains to\nbe replaced with No. 1 Dunham Radiator traps to give a freer venting\nof air from the steam pipes into the return piping.\n\nSome of the return piping in the boiler room is badly packed,\nand this will need to be straightened up.\n\nAll of the matters covered in this report were discussed with\nthe Contractors called in on the job, and with the above recommendations\nfollowed out this system should operate satisfactorily.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nC.

The continued carrying of high pressure above 8 ozs. makes the system practically a sealed system, and steam cannot find enter the radiation due to the fact that air cannot find its way out of the return piping.\n\nThis condition noted above is due to the manner of firing and the fuel used, which is wood, which causes the steam pressure on the boiler to build up before the radiation throughout the system is filled with steam, therefore the radiators at the end of the system or mains, are the ones that suffer by lack of steam.\n\nWe would recommend that a No. 10 Dunham Return Trap be installed which will permit the pressure on the boiler to be carried at any time from 1 to 10 lbs. and the air would be vented out of the return mains through an eliminator, and the water returned to the boiler by the Return trap.\n\nIt is almost impossible to maintain a steady condition of pressure on the boiler when burning wood as fuel, and a gravity steam heating system using only an air eliminator for venting the air from system will from time\ntime to time give trouble as is being experienced on this system, but with\nthe installation of a Dunham Return trap air will have a free vent from\nthe return piping regardless of pressure carried on the boiler.\n\nWe would further recommend that all of the traps be gone over and\ncleaned. That is the covers and discs taken off, and any foreign matter\nwithin the trap bodies removed.\n\nThere appears to be evidence of having carried too high a water\nline on the boiler, and we believe that the manufacturers of the boiler\nshould be communicated with and the height of the water line for the boiler\nascertained, and the operator instructed to carry the water line at\nthe level stipulated by the manufacturer.\n\nThe Damper Regulator which is now connected to the boiler, should\nbe connected to the Balanced Check Damper on the smoke pipe, and to the\ndraft damper on top of the boiler, so that these can work together with\nthe damper regulator, and assist in maintaining a steady pressure on\nthe boiler.\n\nWe would recommend that a compound gauge be installed on the\nboiler, since the gauge now on the boiler has been found defective\nand causing trouble in the past.\n\nThe Air Line Valves now installed on the end of steam mains to\nbe replaced with No. 1 Dunham Radiator traps to give a freer venting\nof air from the steam pipes into the return piping.\n\nSome of the return piping in the boiler room is badly pocketed,\nand this will need to be straightened up.\n\nAll of the matters covered in this report were discussed with\nthe Contractors called in on the job, and with the above recommendations\nfollowed out this system should operate satisfactorily.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nC. A. DUNHAM CO. LTD.\nEngineering Department,\n\nM. W. Shears, Engr.\nWest Coast Agency\nFort Alberni, B.C.\nAugust 30th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit herewith a report from the manual training Instructor to the classes at the Alberni Indian Residential School for your information.\n\nThe report covers the period from commencement of instruction, in January to the closing of the school for the summer holidays, on June 30th, 1927, 6 months.\n\nThe boys have proved themselves apt and willing pupils, and their ability to grasp the lessons presented to them is very marked, and I feel confident that the drawing of plans and constructing of models to scale will prove of great benefit to the boys of this Agency as the most important and almost sole means of livelihood for the Indians of the West Coast is fishing and the repairing of the craft and plant buildings in which they are employed, and I hope in due time it will lead to the construction of a better type of dwelling on Indian Reserves.\n\nIn conclusion I beg to state that the estimated cost of manual training at the Alberni school for the current school year, to end of June 1928, will be approximately, $300.00, which will include Instructor's salary, tools if any are needed and material for the class to work with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEdward E. Frost\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit the following report on manual training at the Indian Residential School, Alberni, B.C., for the year ending June 30th, 1927.\n\nDuring the year, 85 classes were held, showing a total instruction period of 209\u00bd hours. This total was divided among 3 classes. The number of boys receiving instruction was 26, of which 17 are expected to return after the holidays.\n\nThe type of instruction given has been almost identical with that given in the public schools of this Province, each model being accompanied by a working drawing. The models have been small combining utility with economy, requiring simple tool operation. The course so far has been fairly rigid\u2014few alternative problems being allowed, thus each class has faced the same projects and has tackled the same problems. Friendly competition and discussion have been encouraged.\n\nFor the future I feel that for the bigger boys a different course should be arranged, one more suited to the needs of an Indian boy who will soon be earning his living on a fishing boat. Household utensils or simple furniture will be undertaken as individual projects, while for those boys more apt or more willing, special instruction in boat building will be given, in this way the training will provide the boy with a working knowledge of the tools and methods used in the construction of wooden articles used every day.\n\nWhile the various metals offer splendid mediums for manual training I think that too much should not be attempted at this stage. Therefore I propose to adhere closely to wood, paying special attention to lumber which is produced locally. When the time is ripe for the introduction of more technical education in Indian schools the boys will prove themselves to be apt and willing students of all branches of handicraft.\n\nIn conclusion I wish to acknowledge with thanks the valuable advice, blueprints and books given by Mr. John Kyle, Organizer of Technical Education. I also wish to thank you, Sir, for your kindly consideration, assistance and hearty co-operation, without which manual training could not have been so successfully commenced at this school.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeorge Johnson, Instructor.\n\nReceived\n\nAUG 20 1927\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6433, File 877-5, part 2)\nOttawa, September 7, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, enclosing a report from the manual training instructor with reference to the classes conducted by him at the Alberni Indian Residential School for the year ended June 30th, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this report has been read with considerable interest, and you may arrange to have this work continued during the coming year. I note that you estimate the cost to be approximately $300, which will include the instructor's salary, also any tools and material that may be required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I did not have a reply from her in regard to this matter until a few days ago when she gave me to understand that it is her judgment that the farmer's cottage is the more desirable. She seemed to be under the impression that it was already being erected. As to this you will of course have all information. They would be delighted if both buildings could be provided as soon as possible.\n\nI am,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nC. E.

Pitts, B.A., Principal\n\nDr. Duncan Scott\nAsst. Gen. of Indian Affairs\nAlberni, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to yours of Oct 6th 27 to Principals of Indian Residential schools re fire protection and escapes. I beg to report for Alberni Residential school as follows:\n\n1. Fire Alarm - There is no general fire alarm in the school - only small bells, similar to door bells in a private home. These are used by the children if they are sick or require to call a member of staff in the night. There should be a bell or alarm centrally located and sufficiently loud to alarm the whole school at once.\n2. The only fire escapes except the stairs are brass rods, similar to those used by fire departments in fire halls. As the ceilings here are 12 ft high it makes about 16 ft from where a child takes hold of the rod to the floor below. If they hold too tightly they are likely to burn their hands and let go or if too loosely they are likely to drop to the floor below. Even these rods change from one room to another at each floor. This would likely cause confusion if there was smoke or danger.\n\nI have taken Agent E.E. Reid and Inspector Gavin of Vancouver over the building and both concern with\nI see in this report that the fire alarm and the means of exit are both adequate for the number of children and size of the building we have here.\n\n3. Our hydrants, hose, and water pressure are good.\n\n4. Our fire extinguishers are only 2 quart size and in these large rooms would not do the work. I would like to suggest that these be replaced at the earliest convenience with Booth & Coulter 2\u00bd or 3 gal. extinguishers tested at 300-350 lbs.\n\n5. Nearly all the doors in this building lock with a different key.\nIf these are necessarily locked at night and would cause delay and confusion in getting through the building I would therefore recommend that 12 fire axes with picks on the back be placed conveniently throughout the building so that they could be used to break down the doors or get at the source of the fire.\n\nI would not like to take the responsibility of suggesting what kind of fire escape should be used or where it should be placed.\n\nI would like to see the fire extinguishers and fire axes placed at our disposal at the earliest convenience.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nF.E. Pitts\nOttawa, November 28, 1927.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nPlease arrange to forward as soon as possible, addressed to Rev. F. E. Pitts, Principal, Indian Residential School, Alberni, B. C., the following:\n\n3 - 5 gallon Pump Tank Extinguishers,\ncomplete with non freeze charges, and\n\n3 - 1\u00bd quart Pyrene Extinguishers,\ncomplete with non freeze charges.\n\nThese should be supplied at the price charged this Department. Please forward your account in duplicate covering the cost, which should be f. o. b. Alberni, B. C., addressed to Edward E. Frost, Indian Agent, Port Alberni, B. C. He is being informed of the order placed with you and requested, upon receipt of the extinguishers, to certify and send the account to the Department for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. H. Paget,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent.\n\nThe Pyrene Manufacturing Co., of Canada, Ltd.,\n1197 King St. West,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, November 28, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Rev. F. E. Pitts, Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School, relative to fire protection. I have to request that you will obtain an estimate of the cost of installing a fire alarm gong, which should be centrally located in the main building, wherein you should secure an estimate of the cost of erecting an outside wooden fire escape or a steel staircase, to be erected at a strategic point leading from the building and as convenient as possible to the exits from the dormitories. When we have this information, consideration will be given to authorizing the installing of the above equipment.\n\nWe are placing an order with the Pyrene Manufacturing Company of Canada, Limited, to forward, addressed to the Principal -\n\n3 - 5 gallon Pump Tanks, complete with non freeze charges and\n3 - 1\u00bd quart Pyrene Extinguishers complete with non freeze charges.\n\nThe account covering the cost will be sent to you, and, upon receipt of the extinguishers, you should certify and send the account to the Department for payment. The smaller type extinguishers should be placed where there is danger from oil, grease or electrical machinery, and the larger sizes should be placed at strategic points in the building.\n\nYou should arrange to have the extinguishers now on hand recharged and put in good condition, purchasing any chemical required for this purpose.

I therefore referred the matter to Mr Commissioner, W.E.

The approximate cost of the toilets suggested would be as under: 3 stall $275.00, 2 stall $220.00, 35 inch urinal $50.00. The above estimated costs include the toilets complete with fittings and installation, but does not include the cost of such concrete work as might be needed in floors or the erection of wood partitions, the latter I believe could be erected by the manual training class as part of their instruction, so that only the cost of the necessary lumber for same would be incurred.\n\nAn early intimation of the Department's views on the above matter is respectfully requested please as further expenditure on the repairs to the present system is urgent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, February 8, 1928.\n\nEDWARD E.

A.\nOttawa, February 9th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, relative to the toilet system in the girls' and boys' toilets on the lower floor at the Alberni Indian Residential School, and recommending that they be replaced. In this connection I beg to confirm the following telegram to you of yesterday's date:\n\n\"You may arrange installation toilets mentioned your letter 31st. Incur no unnecessary expense.\"\n\nIt is noted that you recommend the installation of the Standard Automatic Syphon Education Range Toilets in the three stalls in the girls' toilet and in the two stalls, with 36\" urinal, in the boys' section. We note that you estimate the cost of this equipment, installed, to be approximately $545, which cost does not include any concrete work that may be needed in the floors or in the erection of wooden partitions. You may arrange to have any concrete work required in the making of the changes in the equipment in the toilets carried out, and also for the supplying of any lumber for partitions. It is considered that all carpenter work should be performed by the pupils and staff. You should see that a satisfactory job is completed in the installation of the new toilet system and that all costs are kept down to the lowest possible point. You should also arrange for all purchases, obtaining accounts, in duplicate, which you should certify in the usual manner and send to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS\n\nCANADA\n\nVictoria, B.C. 15th February, 1928.\n\nT.W. Fuller, Esq.,\nChief Architect,\nPublic Works Dept.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Government Owned Indian Residential School - Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nAs instructed by your letter of the 16th ultimo, file #87551 an inspection of the above named building has been made, and I now beg to report as follows:\n\nThe building is a three storey frame building with basement. Roof covered with rubberized felt roofing. The building is divided into two by a lath and plaster wall dividing the boys from the girls, and whatever method of fire escape is used it will have to accommodate both ends of the school.\n\nThe fire preventative service has been taken care of, to some extent by the installation of a number of large three and a half gallon chemical hand tanks and several smaller pyrene fire extinguishers placed at convenient points.\n\nThe stair wells are situated at each end of the building, and if a fire should occur in the basement or on the first floor, the occupants of the upper floors would be cut off as the fire and smoke would no doubt travel up the stair wells. There is a brass pole, from one floor to the other, after the fire hall style, but should a fire occur, this again, would cause a draft and the smoke and flames would travel up through these holes, and even if there were not smoke and flames to contend with, the smaller children could not possibly make use of these poles at any time without considerable danger to themselves.\n\nThere is no fire alarm system in the building. This should be rectified by the installation of an electric alarm system of songs to be placed at suitable positions on the various floors as shown on plan and served by a six volt storage battery, one battery to be kept in stock fully charged as a spare.\n\nIt was found that the heating of the building was carried on by the boys under the supervision of the Master, or of some person who has the necessary engineer's certificate. This system means that the boys do most of the firing, as on the occasion of the inspection, a large number of boys in the boiler room were found drying their clothes over a small box stove which was red hot and a menace to the building.\n\nIf wrought iron......\nIf wrought iron fire escapes were placed on the front wall in the recess above and at the sides of the main entrance steps, as marked on plan, it would take care of each of the floors.\n\nThe children on the different dormitories on the second floor could be mustered in the wash rooms (which have terrazzo floors) as there is an entrance to the wash rooms from each dormitory in each end of the buildings, and those on the third floor would have direct access to the fire escape.\n\nDoorways should be cut in the walls on the second floor, where indicated on the plan, to give access to the staff from the staff rooms to the dormitories.

On the recommendation of Mr. Ditchburn, the resident architect of the Department of Public Works at Victoria was asked to make an inspection of the building and report on the requirements. This has been received and it is recommended that steel fire escapes of the stair type be installed on the front of the building which will provide exit from each of the floors. The cost will be approximately $2,000.00. As this building is badly in need of proper fire exits I would recommend that Mr. Ditchburn be authorized to proceed with the work immediately, in accordance with the recommendation submitted.\n\n[Signature]\n\nARCHITECT.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Brown, District Architect of the Department of Public Works, Victoria.\n\nIn reply I beg to say in view of the fact that I have had no experience in connection with such matters I deemed it advisable to request Mr. Brown to get up specifications and call for tenders. This has been done and three tenders have been received as follows:\n\nPort Alberni Marine Rly. & Machine Co. $1250.00\nMarked cheque for 10% attached.\n\nHafer Machine Co., Ltd., Victoria $1425.00\nMarked cheque for 10% attached.\n\nVictoria Machinery Depot Co., Ltd., Victoria $1595.00\nNo marked cheque attached.\n\nI would respectfully recommend that the tender be awarded to the Port Alberni Marine Rly. Co., of Port Alberni, and the matter of inspecting the work to be carried out by the officers of the Public Works Department from time to time during its progress.\n\nMention was made in Mr. Brown's report to his Department dated the 15th ultimo, a copy of which you no doubt received, dealing with the question of the installation of an electric alarm system of gongs to be placed at suitable positions on the various floors as shown on the plan. Architect Brown also drew the attention of the Department to the necessity of doors being cut in the walls of the second floor, where indicated on the plan, to give access from the staff room to the dormitories in case of fire coming from below by way of the staircases. The installation of the electric alarm system of gongs and the cutting of these doors I consider would be most important and this matter should be given attention to.\n\nI would be pleased to hear from you at your earliest possible convenience as to whether or not my recommendation with regard to the awarding of this tender for the fire escapes to the Port Alberni Marine Rly.

A note is being made for our Estimates to provide the funds required next year, and the matter of renewing the roof will have to stand over until that time. In the meantime, any minor repairs absolutely required to prevent leakage may be carried out, but any expense for the purpose should be kept down to the lowest possible point. As you are aware, the Department is considering the authorizing of the painting of the school building, and the cost involved in this work is the full amount that is available for the present year. Please advise the Principal that the work of installing new roofing will have to stand over until next year.

E. Scott\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101.\nDear Sirs:\n\nAt Alberni Indian School, please note that when your Architect Mr. Dawson of Victoria came to see the building before getting out the plans, I pointed out to him that the school had been erected with a view to keeping the boys and girls sides of the building absolutely separated on the top flats and that any fire-escape should keep this in view and also that as we were near the Reserve there should be no access from the ground to the dormitories. I also pointed out to him that there was one side of the front porch was the office and on the other side was the reception room and that these were the only front rooms we had in the building for use of staff and that these windows should not be blocked by the fire-escape.\n\nPractical men and builders agreed with me that the fire-escape could have started from the same place had access through the same windows and been attached to the blank wall of the projections on either side of the porch and would have thus avoided all the difficulties I have referred to.\n\nAs it is erected the top balconies of the escape are connected along the roof, the second balconies are connected or are of easy access across the roof of the front porch and the balconies of the ground floor (that is above the basement) are of easy access from the floor of the front porch. The balconies of the ground floor are right in front of the office and reception room windows.\n\nSince the fire escape is so easy of access from the ground and makes possible access from one side of the building to the other it becomes necessary to have these windows opening on the fire-escape securely locked, as I do not want to take the responsibility of fastening up the access to the fire-escape. I wish to ask your instructions as to what way those windows shall be secured to prevent any one from gaining access to the dormitories or store rooms in the night.\n\nAgain, just in front of each of the windows opening on the balconies there is a hole 3 feet 6 inches long by 15 inches high, level with the floor and opening to the well-hole of the steps. A child crawling out of the window and going a little too far or rolling over would drop down the steps clearing all ahead of him or else drop through the outside rail which is also 15 inches from the steps. There should be a second bar or some wire screening put on this rail to ensure that no such accident happens.\n\nI sincerely hope you will have these things inspected and give instructions as to what should be done.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Ed) F.E. Pitts.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to advise the Department that the fire escape has been erected at the Alberni Indian Residential School, and I am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter from the Rev. F.B. Pitts, Principal of that school in which he wishes to bring to the notice of the Department some points in connection with the fire escape. The Rev. Principal's points are 4 in number and are:\n\n1. The keeping of boys and girls separate,\n2. Windows obscured by the fire escape,\n3. Access to dormitories by means of fire escape,\n4. Dangerous openings in the railing of the escape.\n\nWith reference to the fire escape and the Rev. Principal's remarks, I beg to state that in my opinion the escape is very staunchly constructed and in every particular complies with requirements called for by the fire protection regulations of the Province.\n\n1. Keeping boys and girls separate. To prevent the access from one dormitory to another by the fire escape and over a portion of the roof, I beg to suggest that hinged screens be placed on the inside of the dormitory windows where necessary, that the screens be fastened with a padlock and that a fireman's axe be kept hanging on the wall immediately by the screen so that no time need be lost in effecting exit in case of fire.\n\n2. Position of the escape. There can be no possible doubt but that the same escape could have been erected leading to the same exits without obscuring the window, s of either office or reception rooms, and that without any additional cost.\n\n3. Access to dormitories from the ground by means of the escape. The hinged screens recommended for 2 will prevent this.\n\n4. Dangerous openings in railing of the escape. To remedy this, I requested the Rev. Principal to have some heavy wire netting stretched over these and securely wired to the railing of the escape. Cost will be very little.\n\nI beg to add that I was present when the attention of the Architect was drawn to the necessity of not obscuring the office and reception room windows, at the time the survey of the building was made for the drawing of plans for the escape.\n\nAs no plan was available either at the school or in this office, no opportunity was given to bring these points to the notice of the Department before the structure was erected, no plan of the structure has yet been seen here.\n\nRe the placing of the hinged screens, recommended for 1 and 3, these are being held in abeyance for the approval of the Department or for the orders for some other method of prevention as approved by them. Early instructions regarding same are respectfully requested please.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd. E. Short\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 25, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing copy of a letter which the Department has received from Mr. Agent Frost, of Port Alberni, also copy of a communication from Rev. P. E. Pitts, Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School, both with reference to the fire escape recently installed at that institution. You will note the Principal's remarks relative to the fire escapes. I shall be pleased to have a report from you regarding the matters mentioned in his letter. If you consider that early action should be taken in carrying out the suggestions made by the agent, you may arrange to have this done. Please report the action taken by you and make any further recommendations as to what should be done to put the fire escape in a satisfactory condition.\n\nEnclos. 2.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nBox 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nOttawa, June 25, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, enclosing copy of a communication from the Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School, relative to the fire escape which has recently been installed. The questions raised by the Principal and your suggestions have been noted. We are referring this matter to Mr. Inspector Ditchburn, requesting him to make any changes considered necessary and to advise the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni,\nB. C.\nAlberni Residential School\nF.E.Pitts, B.A. Principal.\n\nMr. E.E. Frost,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear sir:\n\nYours of the 12th inst ref painting of this school to hand.\n\nYou ask if in my opinion the painting of the whole building is absolutely necessary. In reply the same was erected and opened in December 1920. With the exception of the steps and porch floors no painting has been done on it since. For both appearance and economy I would say that the painting was very necessary, but of course paint is never absolutely necessary.\n\nReplying to whether the work of putting on the paint could be done by the staff and older boys. The building is over 40 feet to the eaves, this requires the best of scaffolding and a man accustomed to working at 40 feet in the air\u2014we could not do the scaffolding and I would not take the risk of young boys working at that height, nor have we anyone on our staff that who could do so. We are busy long days and all day with school and farm work and would have to hire extra help for any extra work. Our outlay for repairs, fencing and cleaning land has been heavy during the past year and so we cannot take on any extra expense just now.\n\nAgain, it does not seem to be economy to have an $80,000.00 dollar building painted by amateurs, and as holidays start soon we could not possibly finish the painting, along with harvesting etc before the wet weather begins in the fall.\n\nWe appreciate the willingness of the Department to furnish the paint but cannot accept it on these conditions.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(F.E.) F.E. Pitts.\nINDIAN OFFICE\n\nAT\n\nSample of roofing\nSir:-\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Department letter of lst instant re the painting of the Alberni Indian Residential School building and beg to advise the Department that the suggestions contained in same were referred to the Rev Principal of the school for his information and remarks, a copy of his reply is attached hereto for the Departments information.\n\nWith reference to the Department's enquiry as to whether the whole of the painting asked for in my letter of the 25th ultimo is necessary, I beg to advise the Department that if the building is given one coat of paint this summer it would then go the customary time without further attention but if the painting is postponed until next summer it will necessitate the applying of two coats of paint which will nearly double the expense and the building will then only be able to go the same length of time till painting is again necessary. As there are no facilities on the building for the use of a swinging scaffold the scaffold will have to be erected from the ground, for which suitable appliances and experience in using them will be necessary, and the further question of the ability of boys to work at considerable height above ground, with safety, for consideration,\n\nRespectfully awaiting the Department's further instructions in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd. E. Trotter\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nMemorandum:\n\nJune 26, 1928.\n\nDR. SCOTT.\n\nMr. Agent Frost and the Principal have strongly urged the necessity of the exterior painting of the Alberni Indian Residential School building. The roof of the main building and the exterior walls require one coat of paint, also the steps, verandah, ceilings and floors. The estimated cost of this work, including material and labour, is $755.\n\nThis building was erected in 1920 and no painting has been done on it since. The Principal states that for both appearance and economy the painting is necessary. The Agent was informed that we would authorize the supplying of the paint required, to the amount of $315, if the school would be responsible for the labour, to the amount of $440.\n\nThe Principal states that the building is over 40 ft. to the eaves, that this would require the best of scaffolding and a man accustomed to working thereon and he would not take the risk of young boys working at that height. He will be unable to provide any of the labour in having the work done.\n\nNo funds have been specially provided; but the amount required - $755 - could be taken from our appropriation for Indian Education. I would recommend that authority be granted to have this painting carried out and will be pleased to have the necessary approval, also the name of the man who should be engaged as foreman in charge of the painting.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6433, File 877-5, part 3)\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report that, at the request of the Dominion Public Works Architect, Mr. J.G. Brown, I this day inspected and tested the fire alarm system recently installed at the Alberni Indian Residential School and found the same worked satisfactorily from each alarm box to all alarm gongs and in my opinion the system is quite satisfactory.\n\nThe above certificate has no reference to contract conditions as I have not seen any tracing or copy of contract.\n\nWith reference to the above alarm system I beg to suggest that a supply of spare glasses for alarm boxes be supplied so that broken glasses may be replaced without delay in order that no unnecessary drain be put on the electric battery.\n\nA dozen spare glasses would probably cost one dollar.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd.

Frost\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 28, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, informing the Department that, as a result of your inspection and test of the fire alarm system recently installed at the Alberni Indian Residential School, it was found that same worked satisfactorily.\n\nWith reference to this fire alarm system, I beg to say that you may arrange for the supplying of twelve spare glasses for the alarm boxes. These should be placed in charge of the Principal, in order that broken glasses may be replaced without delay. It is noted that the cost will be nominal and you should forward an account, in duplicate, covering the expense incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

You should arrange for the purchase of all paint and other materials required from Mr. C. A. McNaughton, of Fort Alberni, and see that a good grade of paint, etc., is obtained.\n\nThe exterior of the building is to be given one coat of paint; the hand rails, steps and verandah floors, two coats; and the verandah ceilings and window and door screens, one coat. The total cost of the material and labour should not exceed approximately the estimate given in your letter of May 25th last, viz., $755. An account-able cheque for $400 will be sent you under separate cover, to pay the labour, and you should render time sheets, as requested above, in accounting for the expenditure of this amount.

Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, with enclosed letters, and I might state that the construction of the fire escape is in accordance with the B.C. fire Marshall's specifications.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Pitts remarks that the fire escape could have been attached to the blank walls of the building, I might state that the cost of construction would have been half as much again, and almost impracticable to have put an escape from the dormer windows, which would have had to be brought at right angles across the valleys and along the roof, also at each side practically the same landing would have had to be put at the windows as at present to ensure using both windows for quick exit, and then carried along the blank wall and the same accessibility from the ground would be available. The present location is considered the best position.\n\nMr. Pitts remarks that the top balconies are connected is not true, and any persons attempting to get from one balcony to another are endangering their lives, as they would have to travel along the gutter of the building which is a very dangerous proceeding. I am aware that one boy did this during the erection of the fire escape, but the roof was covered with jacks and scaffolding for the use of the workmen.\n\nMr. Pitts objection to the stopping of light into rooms was taken into consideration and pointed out to him that it would make very little difference to the light.\n\nThe sashes and screens of all the windows leading to the fire escape should be hinged and bolted inside, a fire axe should also be hung up on each floor at a convenient point.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) J.G. Brown,\nDist. Res. Architect.\n\nPer: \"C.F.D.\"\n\nCED/MB.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo together with copy of letter from Mr. Indian Agent Frost and a communication from Rev. F.E. Pitts, Principal of the School, the latter criticising the location of the fire escape and manner of construction. It is noted Mr. Frost makes certain recommendations in the matter of further safeguards.\n\nIn reply I beg to say this matter was taken up with J.G. Brown, Esq., District Resident Architect of the Dominion Public Works Department, and I have received a letter from him to the effect that the said fire escape was constructed according to the specifications of the British Columbia Fire Marshall. It is also pointed out that to have erected this fire escape in any other position than which it was, would have increased the cost by one half. Mr. Dawson, who superintended this work, personally explained to me also that another reason for having the fire escape located in the position in which it is, was that of safety of the children. In fact, it is a fact that the rooms of the school in which exit to the fire escape is provided are those which have terrazzo flooring and all the children could be grouped in these rooms with considerable more safety than would be the case in the dormitories.\n\nI am attaching hereto copy of Mr. Brown's letter in this regard for your information.\n\nIn connection with the recommendations made by Mr. Indian Agent Frost, I may say that Mr. Brown concurs that it would be advisable to have the net screens placed as well as some covering on the side of the fire escape and I have, therefore, authorized Mr. Indian Agent Frost to have this work carried out without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure:-\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 20, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 16th ultimo, relative to the location and manner of construction of the fire escape recently installed at the Alberni Indian Residential School, I beg to enclose herewith copy of a communication from the District Resident Architect of the Dominion Public Works Department. It is considered, in view of this report, that the fire escape has been satisfactorily installed, and at an advantageous location, in order to save unnecessary expense.\n\nMr. Commissioner Ditchburn has been requested to have net screens, as well as some covering, placed on the side of the fire escape, and to purchase fire axes, and, if considered necessary, to have the sashes and screens of all windows leading to the fire escape hinged and bolted inside.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6433, File 877-5, part 3)\nI have the honour to submit to the Department a request by the Rev. F.E. Pitts, B.A., Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School, for authority to re-appropriate the old class room of that school, which has been, during the past two years, used for Manual Training purposes, and use the same as an additional class room for part of Grades 1 and 2, and for the supply by the Department of the necessary equipment for that purpose; and further, to sanction the transfer of the Manual Training classes, equipment, and fixtures (except the electric lighting fixtures) to the basement of the same building, and the installing of electric lights in the latter room, for Manual Training use.\n\nI respectfully recommend the above request to the Department for favourable consideration for the following reasons. There are 71 pupils in Grades 1 and 2, and I believe, insufficient air space as called for by regulations, in the junior classes' room when filled to its capacity, further, as a large portion of the pupils in this room are beginners, the class is too large for any one teacher to handle satisfactorily.\n\nThis request was held in abeyance until the visit of Mr. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools, in order that the matter might be thoroughly investigated by him and discussed with the Principal and myself, this having been done on 7th instant and received Mr. Cairns approval.\n\nThe transfer of the Manual Training classes and equipment to the basement of this building will cause no inconvenience to those classes as the basement room is larger than the floor above, it has airtight concrete walls and floor and heat heating facilities but will need electric lighting fixtures to be installed at an estimated cost of approximately $20.00.\n\nThe estimated cost of the equipment needed for the proposed additional classroom is approximately $500.50 including freight, and is compiled as follows: 15 desks size B, $180.00; 15 desks size C $172.50; 1 Teachers desk $25.00; 12 kindergarten chairs $21.00; Hyloplate 4' x 30' $35.00; 1 galvanised green liquid slating $6.50; 1 Union Jack $7.50; 1 hand bell $5.00; freight $30.00.\n\nTotal cost of equipping both rooms for the purposes stated, including electric light fittings for basement $520.50.\n\nRequisition for the equipment needed is attached hereto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd E. Frost\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Residential School\nRev.F.E.Pitts,B.A.Principal\n\nAlberni,B.C.,September,15th,19\n\nE.E.Frost,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni,B.C.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nEnclosed herewith find a special requisition for desks &c to equip a third class-room in Alberni Residential School.\n\nOur reasons for opening a third class-room are evident from our quarterly report. Since January 1st 1927, thirty-nine new pupils have entered the school, with the exception of two these have all been beginners who have had very little English, consequently our standards 1 and 2 have become crowded too much for one teacher and as these so much individual attention the teacher in the senior room cannot do justice to the older ones and take part of these standards 1 and 2.\n\nWe are asking, therefore, to move the Manual Training to the basement of the former school building and use the present Manual Training room for the Primary class and equip it for thirty beginners. The second teacher to take part of standard 1 and part of standard 2 and the senior teacher to take the others, this arrangement would seem to relieve the situation and give all a fair chance.\n\nMay I add that I have gone into these matters with you yourself and Mr Inspector Cairns and we all agreed that,\n\n1. The basement of the separate class-room building was very suitable for Manual Training.\n\n2. That the present Manual Training room is also suitable for a primary class-room.\n\n3. That it is desirable and necessary to make the changes above asked for. We therefore sincerely hope that the Indian Department may grant to us the sanction and the equipment asked for.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(signed) F.E.Pitts, Principal.\n**REQUISITION FOR SCHOOL MATERIAL**\n\nFor Alberni Residential School on West Coast Agency\n\nReserve Agency\n\nDate: Sept. 16th 1925\n\n| ARTICLES | NO.

(RG 10, Volume 6433, File 877-5, part 3)\nOttawa, October 10, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, informing the Department that there will be approximately $75 worth of painting material left over after the barn at the Alberni Indian Residential School has been painted, which work was authorized by official letter of the 4th instant.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say it is considered that an excessive quantity of paint was purchased for the purpose of painting the school building. The Department would have no use for any painting material which will be left over after the painting of the barn is completed, and it is thought that you should return this excess paint to the Alberni Hardware Co., Ltd., from whom it was purchased, and obtain a refund from them for same, and you should forward the amount obtained to the Department. It is presumed that this paint was included in the account rendered by the above Company to the total amount of $254.16, a cheque for which was sent them in August, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. E.

A voucher for one day's pay for Mr. J. Taylor has been received and a cheque is being forwarded to him today.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nA.W. Neill, Esq., M.P.,\nAlberni, B.C.\nMr. Herbert,\n\nfor the\nthat this\nman is\npaid.\n\nVoucher in today. Cheque will\nissue tomorrow.\nDear Doctor Scott,\n\nIndian Agent Frost is sending in a voucher for one day's pay for J. Taylor.\n\nHe borrowed this man from the Provincial Govt in an attempt to have the painting on the school done by day's work. A master painter named Thomas was to meet him on the work with two other men to begin but he turned up without any men and said it was no use Taylor alone starting so the idea of doing it by day's work was abandoned.\n\nMeantime Taylor who had been regularly employed by the Prov. Govt lost a day's work and had to be paid. Hence the voucher.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA.W. Neill\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the attached claim presented by James Taylor for $4.50 for one day's time in connection with the painting of the Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nExplanation. Mr. A.J. Thomas, who was appointed foreman to superintend the work, reported to me that he could not get painters, and asked me to try and find one or two to help him out. I saw the Provincial Public Works Engineer and secured the loan of James Taylor, and Taylor was instructed by me in writing, with the approval of Mr. Thomas, to report at Alberni School not later than 8 a.m. on Monday August 27th for work. Taylor reported at the time and place named. Mr. Thomas arrived later and stated that he had failed to get any men to work with Taylor, and as it was useless for one man to commence the work and he, Thomas, could see no likelihood of getting men, he asked to be relieved of his appointment as foreman.\n\nIt was then too late for Taylor to return to his work with the P.W.D., as he had come in some 12 miles from a road camp. Taylor consequently lost a day's work with the P.W.D., hence the claim, which having due regard to the facts, is in my opinion, legal, and I respectfully recommend the payment of the same by the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd.

It is considered that the cartage of the lumber and gravel, and the labour in carrying out the work in completing this playroom, should be performed by the school authorities without cost to the Department.

Pitts, Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School, for the consideration of the Department.\n\nRegarding the matter, I beg to state that the hall in question needs flooring before it is fit for use either for games or drill purposes; the soil of the floor is a soft loam, which becomes powdery from use when dry and soapy when damp.\n\nThe condition of children and their clothing can be easily understood, when they have played in the hall under either condition.\n\nShould the Department favourably consider the request of the Rev. Principal, I beg to suggest that the putting in of the floor foundation and floor be done by the elder boys as part of their Manual Training instruction, under the supervision of the Manual Training Instructor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnc\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Frost\nIndian Agent\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nAlberni, B.C.\u2014November 22, 1928.\n\nDear sir:\n\nSome five or six years ago, the Indian Department erected a hall for recreation purposes at this school. The size of the building is 80' by 36', stands on a cement foundation and is in good repair, except that it was never finished. The only floor is the natural soil on which it stands. In any dry weather this works up into dust and the children require a bath after a game of ball, or if the floor is sprinkled it becomes very slippery and muddy. It is very rough at all times and any amount of work at smoothing and levelling lasts for only a short time.\n\nThe necessity for such a playroom is self-evident to anyone who knows anything of this climate.
