It is said that Mr. Gladstone's Tacheverism was smashed in Toronto and that a mob of Young British broke the windows of the hotel in which his Eminence was being banqueting. And the police came called, and the mob fled, and it is stated that St. Michael's Palace, the residence of Archbishop Lynch, would be attacked. All this is, of course, new to Canadians, but there is money in it for the imaginative correspondent.\n\nThe Scotch yacht having failed to win the America cup and carry it back to the old country, an Irish yacht has been constructed in Canada, it cannot succeed where the Scotch yacht failed. It is conceded on all hands that the Scotch yacht did the best it could. Its failure to win the cup is owing to its construction rather than to its way in sailing; it was handled, the Irish have established the superiority of the centre board where speed is the object sought. The yacht which is probably the best is being of Irish design, to be built in Ireland and sailed by an Irish crew. Under these circumstances it must be admitted that it will be sufficiently Irish to satisfy the greatest lover of the sea and will be found on either side of the Atlantic coast. Our American cousins are planning themselves on the fact that they are able to turn out yachts which run away from their Scotch competitors. Perhaps they will not be able to run away from the Irish ones. An Irish yacht would arouse a great deal of enthusiasm in the United States, where there are so many Irishmen, but enthusiasm would not fill the void, and the Irishman would need the proper system it need hardly cross the Atlantic to compete against the fast sailing yachts to be found over here.\n\nIt looks as if matters in Ireland were approaching a crisis. Mr. Gladstone is vigorously denouncing the Government for enforcing the Crimes Act and is championing the Irish cause with great zeal, even going so far as to attack the police. He has been obliged to use his authority set them to do. But despite Mr. Gladstone's vigorous denunciations the Government seems determined to continue in the line it has taken up for itself, the purpose of which is to make the Irish question to be raised by the Executive or the National League. Whatever people's opinion on the abstract question of home rule may be, there certainly is a difference of opinion in regard to this type of Executive. To enforce the laws passed by parliament for the express purpose of governing the Green Isle. Mr. Gladstone describes the present system as \"Irish Government\" by the word \"imperative,\" which he declares to be the only one by which it can be described. No doubt every law on the statute book is looked upon as an impermanence by those who desire it to be repealed, but as the law affecting Ireland were passed by the same authority as the laws affecting England or Scotland, it is hard to see where the impermanence lies. With Mr. Gladstone pushing the question forward and the Government driving them back, it is not at all surprising that occasional collisions should take place. There are those who are looking forward with no little apprehension to seeing something much more serious occur.\n\nThe Toronto Telegram says that in defending that Canada could only have considered itself independent of the United States at the close of separation from Great Britain, Mr. Champlain evidently not only said what he meant but meant what he said. As a result of the arrangement between the colonies and the mother country is only a temporary one and cannot remain as it is; either it will be strengthened by ties of federation or loosened altogether. Until it is strengthened, Canada can not be permitted to make a trade arrangement with the United States of the character proposed, for \"it is impossible that Great Britain should retain all the responsibilities and obligations of the colonial connection when all the advantages are taken away.\" From the British point of view this seems fair enough. In the event of Canada becoming involved in difficulty with any other country Britain would not be able to offer protection. The only nation that Canada could possibly have trouble with is the United States. It would be asking a good deal of the British Government to Canada to expect her to take on the cudgels on her behalf after entering into a bargain with the United States to shut the door against British goods coming to this continent. It is clear that this scheme is not Mr. Champlain's idea, when Sir John Macdonald pronounced against commercial union, which he is sure to do, he will have the British Government at his back, and will thus be able to hold his own and keep the old flag flying.\n\nANNUAL SCHOOL MEETING.\n\nELECTION OF TRUSTEES, ETC.\n\nThe annual school meeting of School District No. 3 was held on Tuesday last in the new school building.\n\nThe various reports were read and adopted, when the election for trustees took place.\n\nThe following were nominated:\n\nJ. F. Beattie, J. M. Campbell, T. O. Davis, J. L. Johnson, John Stewart, James Macfarlane and W. J. Carter, trustees; Robert Johnson and Macfarlane, deputies. The poll demanded, the vote at 4 p.m., stood:\n\nJ. M. Campbell ........... 38\nJ. F. Beattie ............. 39\nT. O. Davis .................. 34\nW. J. Carter ............... 27\n\nThus the Board of Trustees for the current year will be Messrs. Campbell, Beattie, Davis and Carter.\n\nWhile congratulating those gentlemen upon the honor conferred upon them, we would remind them that they have a very important position to fill. The sustaining of an efficient school is one of the greatest assets that can be possessed by any community, and it is to be hoped the same deep interest that has been taken in the school by the old Board of Trustees will not lessen in those who have been appointed to fill their positions.\n\nThe old Board of Trustees deserves the hearty thanks of every citizen for the excellence to which the school has attained under their management, and more particularly of the very handsome building they have left as a monument of their term of office.\n\nADVERTISERS\n\nCan learn the exact cost of any proposed line of Advertising in American Papers by addressing Geo.
