Poirier, O.M.I., has requested that they be supplied with a potato peeler. He points out that there is altogether too much work for the pupils. The potato peeling, dishwashing and scrubbing is just straight labour and takes too much time away from their studies. The classroom takes half the time and the balance is spent in the laundry, kitchen and in sewing and mending.

Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to the request of the Principal of the Guy School for a potato peeler.\n\nPlease let me know the size and type required and, if possible, let me have a catalogue number of some reputable firm, so that I will be in a position to give the Purchasing Branch the information that they require.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMarch the 10th, 1946.\n\nMr. Samuel Lovell,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am sorry to say that our lighting plant batteries are run down and that they cannot do another year; in fact I do not see how they can do until next fall. Though they were evidently declining, I did not say anything before because they had a 7-year guarantee dating from March 1940, but it is clear now that we will need a new set of batteries to start the next school year. And as the transport is so much easier by the winter roads, I ask you to try and get them for us within a month to Atik. I know this is a very short time for everything to go through Ottawa, and the manufacture and back here, but, since you are aware of our transport problem in summer, I trust that you will do your best to obtain what I am asking for.\n\nThe set of batteries that we are using now is described thus on the invoice from Mumford, Medland Limited, Winnipeg, Mar. 8, 1940:\n\n\"I Set Globelite Storage Batteries (for power-plant), GD-15, 200 Ampere hour (intermittent rating) 56 cells, 15 plates (5-3/4\" X 7\") per cell, 110 volt, 7 year guarantee.\"\n\nAll these batteries are charged and discharged in series. I do not think we could come back on the company because the batteries fail 1 year before the guarantee, because I would be unable to prove that the batteries have always received the proper care, due especially to the emplacement of the machine room under the water tank, which has been leaking badly so often.\n\nThanking you in advance for your cooperation,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. L. Poirier, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nThe Pas, Manitoba,\nMarch 14, 1946.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose a letter which I received from Father Poirier, Principal, Guy Indian Residential School, Sturgeon Landing, Saskatchewan, which speaks for itself.\n\nI would appreciate an early reply, as the season is now getting short for winter freighting. I am sorry, the Father did not attend to this earlier, but you will note, I just received the letter.\n\nIn the last paragraph of his letter, he refers to the machine room roof, which was leaking badly. I beg to advise that this roof was fixed last summer, and at the present time, is in first-class condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. Lovell,\nIndian Agent.\n\nSL/FH\nEnc.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**REQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES**\n\nOttawa, March 22, 1946.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\n(File 132-7-5)\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF:\n\n**Guy Indian Residential School**\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 12-422\n\nSHIP TO Reverend L.

Plourde, O.M.I.,\nOttawa University,\nLaurier Ave., East.,\nOttawa.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Diesel stationery engine for Guy School.\n\nAttention: Mr. P. Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nThe principal of the Guy Indian Residential School has had considerable difficulty for the last several years in the operation of the steam engine which is now used to supply electricity and general electric power for his school.\n\nAmong other complaints he lists the following:\n(1) The engine is not powerful enough to do the work properly.\n(2) Wood is getting more costly every day and the distance between the school and the forest is lengthening all the time.\n(3) It is almost impossible to find or secure a steam-engineer in such a far away place.\n(4) The running costs of a steam engine have considerably increased for the last several years because of the long working hours of the engineer who, during all the winter, has to be on duty from 8 a.m. to 9.30 p.m. and cannot do any other work during that period.\n\nIt has to be admitted that a diesel would be safer and at least as dependable. The size of the engine required is said to be 20-25 H.P. as it has to operate the dynamo, the water pump, the laundry machinery, the bread-mixer, etc. I admit that the purchase of this motor constitutes quite a heavy expense, but I think nevertheless that it ought to be approved as Sturgeon Landing is situated quite a distance from the railroad and civilization as well, and it is very difficult to secure proper and experienced help for steam engine operation.\n\nThanking you in anticipation I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\n\nP.S.: The freight address of Guy Indian School is:\nATIK, Manitoba.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Requisitions for Guy Indian School\nAttention: Mr. P. Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nReverend Father Poirier, principal of the above school, has applied for the following items for general school repairs:\n\n(1) 10 gallons concrete floor paint, gray\n25 gallons inside gloss white\n15 gallons outside gloss white\n\n(2) 1 roll of Battleship linoleum, green\n\n(3) Linoleum binding, 300 yards, 2\", brass, with nails.\n\n(4) 1 - 40' ladder with pulley extension device.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O.

(RG 10, Volume 6314, file 655-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI am sorry nothing has been done yet, since a year that I first mentioned it, but I can not believe that you will altogether disregard this honest plea for a piece of equipment that means so much to the school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. L. Poirier, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Diesel Stationery Engine.\n\nAttention: Mr.F.Phelan.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI would like to expose to you a few more details concerning our need of a new stationery engine to replace our old steam engine.\n\nThe question was introduced to you by Rev.Father J.O.Plourde in a letter of January the 28th,1947, and,as I was given to understand, the matter was receiving your kind consideration; so I did not insist any more. But we have had to begin another winter with the old equipment, and no sign yet of any development in answer to the letter above mentioned.\n\nTHE OLD ENGINE-\n\nEngine specifications: The engine now in use is a 16 H.P. vertical steam engine, cyl 7\" diz. by 8\" stroke, speed 275 RPM driving belt pulley 20\" diz. by 10\u00bd\" face, shaft dizm. 2\u00bd\", balance wheel 26\" dizm. x 6\u00be\" face. Weight 1500 lbs. The invoice from Mumford Melland Limited, Winnipeg, which contains these details about the engine is dated February 3, 1939.\n\nInstallation: The engine was put in place shortly after its arrival,in the spring 1939.\n\nHours of service: Since about March 1939,that engine has been running an average of 8 hours a day, in weeks of 76-80 hours in winter to weeks of a mere 32-35 hours in summer: a sum of 26,000 hours in 9 years.\n\nUses: Insufficiency: Every machine in the school depends on that motor: dynamo, water pump, laundry washer and extractor, drier, bread-mixer. When, at times, several machines have to work simultaneously the motor is overloaded and the service is very poor.\n\nCondition and servicing:The engine has not been serviced nor repaired by any outside specialist since its use, but our local engineer always did himself in a very satisfactory way the repairs and adjustments needed. However he is finding it ever more difficult to obtain from it the necessary power, and the oiler, apparently defective from the start, has been giving more than its share of trouble.\n\nOriginal cost: The invoice bears the price of $191.40, plus tax of 15.31, plus freight prepaid of 69.92, making a total cost of $276.63. N.B.-The engineer who received it here does not believe that this was a new engine.\n\nCost of wood: No one thinks any more that wood is cheap as long as you live in a bush country. About 300 cords of wood,at $5.00 a cord,go for the high-pressure boiler every year.\nCost of labour: To the cost of fuel must be added the cost of labour. A steam engineer is hard to get, especially in this far-away and isolated place, and needs a good pay; and all the time the engine is running he can do practically no other work. The running cost of the engine is thus increased by the full wages of the engineer.\n\nDanger: The element of danger with a high-pressure boiler in the school basement may well be considered too.\n\nSUMMARY: The wear of the engine, its insufficient power (or at least its actual insufficiency), the cost of wood, the difficulty to secure an engineer, and the high price wood and engineer together mean for each running hour, all this will justify, I think, a change and here is my request:\n\nDIESEL POWER REQUESTED-\n\nCapacity: A 20 to 25 H.P. stationary Diesel motor.\n\nAdvantages over the old engine:\n\n- More dependable\n\n- Stronger: would care for the occasional bigger demands of power, and when under less strain would not wear out so quick.\n\n- More economic on fuel.\n\n- More economic on labour: Diesel engine operators are becoming more common, and while in charge of the machines the engineer or operator could also attend to many other jobs.\n\n- Safer.\n\nIn view of these advantages, I trust that the Department will consider very seriously this demand and answer it favorably. The question of dependable power in a building of this size which is far from all outside help can not be dealt with lightly, and though I do not disregard the cost of the new engine I am pressed by the circumstances to insist in demanding it.\n\nI believe that the steam engine may take us through this winter, providing the poor health of our actual engineer does not break down. If we get the engine requested, we shall have it installed as soon as arrived, but in all events we strongly beseech you to make haste so that, if sent, it would be in time before the winter freighting is over, in which all heavy material is handled.\n\nOur batteries are good yet, as it is only their second year.\n\nAs to the steam boiler itself, which has not been inspected for three years, it could be used yet as steam is needed, though with less pressure, for the laundry on wash days; steam is used also for heating the water pipe leading from the reservoir, and for other smaller uses.\n\nSo that is our problem, our biggest problem right now on the material level, as simply as I can put it to you.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI am enclosing letter addressed to the Secretary of Indian Affairs Branch, by Reverend Fr. L. Poirier, Principal of the Guy Indian Residential School, regarding the purchase of a new Diesel engine for his school.\n\nThe information given is, in my estimation, quite conclusive and it is to be hoped that the Department will purchase this equipment as soon as possible.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\n\nEncl.\nOTTAWA, December 11, 1947.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nEnclosed please find telegram received today from Reverend Father L. Poirier, Principal of the Guy Indian Residential School, Sturgeon Landing, Sask., re the purchase of the diesel engine about which I first wrote to the Department January 28, 1947. As stated in the telegram, the matter is quite urgent. I hope that you will be able to act upon it immediately.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O.

The further information required re the electricity at the schools mentioned below is as follows:\n\nGuy Residential School. The generator is a Fairbanks of 125 to 160 volts. The motive power is furnished by a St. Clair steam boiler of 16 h.p., which was purchased in 1939 and was believed then to be second hand. This generator charges Globalite storage batteries G.D.-220 A.H., 110 volts. These batteries were purchased in 1946.\n\nOnion Lake R.C. Residential School. This school has a Fairbanks generator, 110 volts, and is generated by a 25 h.p. engine. The batteries are 15 watt, 315 A.H., 110 volts and were purchased in 1946.\n\nI would draw to your attention the fact that the lighting unit must be shipped during the winter as this is the only time during which heavy machinery can be transported.

The further information required re the electricity at the schools mentioned below is as follows:\n\n**Guy Residential School.** The generator is a Fairbanks of 125 to 150 volts. The motive power is furnished by a St. Clair steam boiler of 16 h.p., which was purchased in 1939 and was believed then to be second hand. This generator charges Globelite storage batteries G.D.-220 A.H., 110 volts. These batteries were purchased in 1946.\n\n**Onion Lake R.C. Residential School.** This school has a Fairbanks generator, 110 volts, and is generated by a 25 h.p. engine. The batteries are 15 watt, 315 A.H., 110 volts and were purchased in 1946.\n\nI would draw to your attention the fact that the lighting unit must be shipped during the winter as this is the only time during which heavy machinery can be transported. Hence, a particular rush on this order.\n\nDirector.\n\nAJD/MGD\nfor us boys. We had a wind storm, but the snow has drifted now. I hope the snow will last for a long time.\n\nWhen will you come again? We enjoyed your visit last October very much. We boys will be very glad if we had some other thing to play with and we will pray for you too in returned.\n\nFrom\nHoward Capot\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Sturgeon Landing School\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nThe enclosed letter addressed to His Excellency Bishop Guy, will no doubt touch the heart of the Officials of the Indian Affairs Branch, and as a result they will want to forward to this school the playground accessories asked for.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Mark the location of power plant and power lines between buildings.\n\n7. Give any additional information in detail concerning the operation of the equipment at the school, that requires power in its operation, and which may have a bearing on the size of the diesel electric unit required.\n\n8. You should also let us have complete information regarding the type of storage battery at present in the school, giving its amperage, number of cells, etc.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Diesel Engine for\nGuy Indian Residential School\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nOn January 23rd last, the principal of the above school, Reverend Father L. Poirier, had this to say about the Diesel engine which is required for his school:\n\n\"We are now at the end of January, in two months from now winter transportation will be over. We are therefore waiting very anxiously for the arrival of this much needed machine.\"\n\nHoping that you will be able to come to Father Poirier's assistance, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nFebruary 23, 1948.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWe have your letter of the 13th instant in connection with the requisition for a new diesel engine for the Guy Residential School.\n\nBefore the order is placed, the Purchasing Branch requires considerable additional information and we wrote the principal on the 13th instant requesting him to give us this information. As soon as he replies, the matter will have further consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nLaurier Avenue East,\nOttawa.\n\nPP/MGD\n5. WATTAGE USED DAILY:\n\nA tabulated report over a period of one week, if made now, would give no idea of the wattage used in mid-winter. It is now March, and save for cloudy days, no lights are now required from breakfast to supper time.\n\nDuring the evening now, the meters on the control panel indicate a flow of electricity from 10 to 15 amperes at 120 volts, and in the morning from 8 to 10 amps before breakfast. At night, after the surfaces 2 to 3 amps are illuminated. The heavy current now required for only a few hours a day, is required for a much longer period in the short days of winter.\n\nSo far, there are no electric motors in the school, and we deprive ourselves of strong lights, because of the strain on the motor when other machines than the dynamo are on the move.\n\n6. BUILDINGS LOCATION AND DISTANCE:\n\nSee attached SKET #1.\n\nOTHER EQUIPMENT REQUIRING MOTOR:\n\nThe accompanying sketch #2 will illustrate the size of power required, since a few of the machines indicated often have to be run simultaneously.\n\nThe estimated horse-power needed to operate each machine is:\n\nfor the dynamo 5 to 7 H.P., up to 10 hrs. a day from Oct. to reb.\n\" water-pump 6 H.P. 2 hrs. each day\n\" washer 2 H.P. 2 or 3 half days per week\n\" extractor 4 H.P. as needed during washing\n\" bread-mixer 9 H.P. for 2 twenty minute periods, every day or every second day.\n\n7. STORAGE BATTERIES:\n\nGlobelite Batteries, 56 cells, 110 volts,\nType GD15\n210 ampere Hours.\n\nArrived June 1946.\n\nNOTA BENE:\n\nThe only time to install a motor would be during the summer holidays. Since all our heavy freight is done on winter roads, we hope the Department will still be able, with your recommendation, to ship us soon a DIESEL STATIONARY ENGINE, 20 to 25 H.P.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) Rev. L. Poirier, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nGuy Indian Residential School,\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.,\nMarch the 9th, 1943.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe INFORMATIONS AS TO POWER NEEDS\n\nIn reply to your questionnaire sent on February 12th, I shall answer every question in the same order as they are asked.\n\n1. GENERATOR: BEFCO KW 7.5 R.F.M. 1150\n   Volte 125/160 Amp 47\n   Rating: Cont. Wound Shunt\n   Pulley: 12\" dia.\n   6\" wide.\n   Date: Supplied in March 1940.\n\n2. CONTROL PANEL: consists of:\n   - 1 rheostat\n   - 1 main cut-out switch from dynamo to lights\n   - 1 voltmeter, for dynamo, batteries or lights\n   - 1 ammeter, for dynamo or batteries\n   - 1 battery switch, for charge, discharge, or neutral\n   - 1 battery charging condenser.\n\nPRIME MOVER:\nA 16 H.P. steam engine, operating at 265 R.F.M., turns a main shaft by belt and pulley. On this shaft, 1-11/16\" dia., are the driving wheels for all motor-run equipment, dynamo included.\n\nThe main-shaft is made of 2 parts: the first one, working whenever the engine runs, commands the dynamo and the water-pump, which has one loose-pulley; Extending it, and clutch-controlled, the second part of the shaft commands the washing machine, the drier-fan, the extractor, and the bread-mixer, this last one through another shaft and pulley.\n\nSEE accompanying SKETCH #2.\n\n3. POWER TRANSMISSION TROUBLES:\n\nThe main-shaft, of 1-11/16\" dia., was primarily intended for a 10 H.P. engine and has broken twice under the 16 H.P. Therefore it would be advisable, if a stronger motor is sent as required, that a bigger and stronger shaft be installed too. This drive shaft, or main, consists of two lengths of 20 feet each.\n\n4. FREQUENCY OF CHARGE REQUIRED:\n\nThe batteries have to be charged every day, a short period excepted in the long days of summer holidays.\n5. WATTAGE USED DAILY:\n\nA tabulated report over a period of one week, if made now, would give no idea of the wattage used in mid-winter. It is now March, and save for cloudy days, no lights are now required from breakfast to supper time.\n\nDuring the evening now, the meters on the control panel indicate a flow of electricity from 10 to 15 amperes at 120 volts, and in the morning from 3 to 12 amps before breakfast. At night, after the curfew, 2 to 3 amps are indicated. The heavy current now required for only a few hours a day, is required for a much longer period in the short days of winter.\n\nSo far, there are no electric motors in the school, and we deprive ourselves of strong lights, because of the strain on the motor when other machines than the dynamo are on the move.\n\n6.

The engine shall be used to drive a 1-1/16 inch diameter line shaft through a belt drive from the diesel engine at approximately 335 R.P.M., and a pulley with flat face ten inches in width shall be mounted on the engine shaft and one (1) provided for the line shaft both suitable to the engine speed to give a line shaft speed of 335 R.P.M. Provide all additional equipment necessary for complete installation including fuel tank, fifteen (15) feet of fuel lines, muffler and twenty (20) feet of exhaust piping.\n\n(2) One (1) only, fully automatic radiator cooled diesel electric lighting plant to operate with an existing 210 ampere hour, 110 volt, 56 cell storage battery. The engine shall have a capacity of 30 H.P. and shall be mounted on the same base and direct connected to a 10 Kw., 115 volt D.C. generator. The plant shall automatically start when the load exceeds 1500 watts and shall continue in operation delivering current to the line and the low charging current to the batteries until the load demand drops below this figure at which time it shall automatically stop, the load then being supplied by the battery. Provide a control panel containing all automatic controls and also manual controls for generator set operation, meters, voltage regulator, fuse protection and any additional controls required for plant operation. Provide fuel tank, muffler, twenty (20) feet exhaust piping, fifteen (15) feet of fuel lines and all wiring necessary between generating unit, panel and battery, assuming panel located fifteen (15) feet from the unit and five (5) feet from the battery bank.\n\nAll tenders must be accompanied by detailed description and specification of equipment offered.\n\nThe successful tenderer shall supply complete instructions for the installation, operation and maintenance of equipment.\nRe: Guy Indian Residential School, Sturgeon Landing, Saskatchewan\n\nIn compliance with your notation of March 15th appearing on Mr. Hoey's memorandum to you of the 13th ultimo, we have investigated the situation at the above School and make the following comments:\n\nIn our memorandum dated February 9, 1948, we requested further information which was obtained by the Indian Affairs Branch and forwarded in Rev. Principal Poirier's letter dated March 9th along with Mr. Hoey's memorandum. From data contained therein, it appears that they require a new engine to replace the existing steam engine used to drive a power line shaft delivering power to a water pump generator and laundry and baking equipment.\n\nWe believe the best solution to the power requirements would be to provide electric motors on each piece of equipment and a power plant to suit, thus eliminating the undesirable feature of line shaft and belt drives.\n\nIt is realized, however, that this would be costly in view of existing installed equipment and that considerable time for execution would be required, and as power equipment is urgently needed, we have in our analysis kept to the present system arrangement using existing equipment and suggested new equipment, as outlined in our recommendations, to provide a reliable power and lighting system.\n\nWe recommend that a self-contained diesel electric plant be purchased with full automatic control for operation with existing battery bank for the lighting system and a diesel engine for the operation of power shaft line to replace the existing steam engine. With this new equipment, the strain on the shaft line caused by the generator operating a maximum of six hours per day, would be removed and it is likely that the shaft troubles mentioned in Rev. Principal Poirier's letter will not recur. By retaining present generator and control panel and auxiliary gas engine, a standby source of power would be available for both the power shaft line and the electrical system for use in case of emergencies and when maintenance to the diesel engines is required. A clutch should be...\n\nR. A.

Enclosed please find the papers you had sent illustrating the electric plant.\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt was very gratifying to receive your prompt reply of the 17th instant, offering a 10 KW electric light plant in response to our demand for a Diesel motor.\n\nThis electric light plant would surely answer all our needs regarding electricity, but it would not serve the other machines, such as water pump, laundry machinery, etc., unless individual electric motors could be supplied and installed for each machine. This would mean the additional buying of:\n\n- 1 electric motor of 6 h.p. for the water-pump\n- 1 \" \" \" 5 h.p. \" \" bread-mixer\n- 1 \" \" \" 2 h.p. \" \" washer\n- 1 \" \" \" 4 h.p. \" \" extractor\n\nOr if the motor of an electric plant as the one offered had another pulley by which to command other machinery than the dynamo, simultaneously or not, it would be fine too.\n\nAnother alternative to this would be one Diesel engine, only the engine, between 20 and 30 h.p., that would simply be put in place of the actual steam engine, though this would also entail the buying of a new and bigger drive shaft, with proportionate bearings.\n\nSo, while your present offer does not quite meet our requirements, I shall be very grateful to see you adopt one of the three solutions:\n\n1/ The Onan electric plant, plus the electric motors as indicated.\n2/ An electric plant similar to the above, but with another pulley acting as power take-off for other machinery.\n3/ A Diesel stationary engine, from 20 to 30 h.p.\nJune 11, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nRe: Electric Lighting Plant for the Guy Indian Residential School - your file 77161-15-16\n\nOn receipt of your memorandum of May 5th we forwarding the information regarding the equipment offered by the Power and Mine Supply Company to the principal.

Principal Poirier's letter of May 28th last, in reply to Mr. B.F. Neary's of the 17th instant, that he comments on Indian Affairs offer of providing a 10 KW. lighting plant only, no mention being made of the stationary diesel engine to provide power for the shaft line.\n\nIn our memorandum of April 1st last, we suggested and prepared our specifications on the basis of a lighting plant for the electrical loads and a diesel engine to power existing line shaft driving other machinery. In view of the fact that the Rev. Poirier makes no mention of the stationary diesel engine in his comments, it would appear that perhaps Indian Affairs are considering some other means of powering the line shafting to take care of water pump, laundering machinery, etc. Before further consideration is given to the tenders received, we would like the Indian Affairs Branch to advise this Division if they are considering some other means of providing power for mechanical loads in which case we need only concern ourselves with the lighting plant. It should be pointed out, however, that the lighting plant equipment tendered on would not be of sufficient capacity for the operation of lighting and power loads if the electrification of mechanical equipment is under consideration.\n\nUntil advice, as indicated above is received, we will retain the tenders forwarded.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.A.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSince I have answered on May the 28th to your so interesting offer of an electric plant so long desired, I have been expecting every mail to hear more about it.\n\nI have been wondering also if you wouldn't have found me too hard to please.\n\nIt may be too that your engineers are actually considering other points and aspects of the project, and enquiring about the plants available.\n\nIn any event, I would be very thankful to you to let me know if and what we may hope for in a near future in respect to our power and electric problems.\n\nFor a while it looked as if we would be able to change our motor during the summer holidays, when it would less disturb the normal operations; the high water would equally have made easier the transport of a heavy machine by way of a boat on the Saskatchewan River. Now the water is slowly receding but will likely allow that boat to travel all summer.\n\nHowever to put a new Diesel motor in, we shall not mind going into a lot of trouble at any time and it will be good news to learn it is coming.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. L. Poirier, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal;\nAIR MAIL\n\nJuly 26, 1948.\n\nDear Father Poirier:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant, we wrote you on July 8th enclosing a copy of memorandum we had received from the Lands and Development Services Branch. We are awaiting an answer to that letter before proceeding with the purchase.\n\nAs it is possible that you did not receive the letter mentioned, I am enclosing a copy of the memorandum to which we require your reply.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nRev. L. Poirier, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nGuy Indian Residential School,\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.\n\nPP/MGD\nAugust the 5th, 1948.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of July the 8th with the attached memorandum was unfortunately missed by the Post Office to Cumberland House and thus arrived in Sturgeon Landing two weeks late.\n\nBy that time I had already been enquiring about such information as contained therein. To which enquiry you have also kindly replied. Meanwhile I went away for ten days, and it is only on my return that I have found both your letters of July the 8th and of July the 26th, to which I am sorry to be so late in replying.\n\nThe Memorandum of your technical officers is pointing out precisely to the difficulty I was mentioning in my letter of May the 28th, viz. that the electrical plant offered was not providing for the power supply necessary for machines other than the dynamo.\n\nIn their own words: \"We suggested and prepared our specifications on the basis of a lighting plant for the electrical loads and a diesel engine to power the existing line shaft driving other machinery\". In other terms they seem to advise the use of two different motors: one included with a dynamo, which would be the lighting plant already offered in yours of May 17th, and separately, a diesel engine to power the already existing line shaft driving other machinery.\n\nActually, with the lighting plant already tendered, there is no provision made for the needs other than electric lighting. But the solution proposed by the engineers of having another separate engine to drive the line shaft would take care of everything, and I would be most in favor of it because it would save the replacing of the actual shaft and bearings.\n\nI fail to see any other information that they would desire right now, but I will make it a point to answer immediately any further enquiry that may arise, since this power question is a vital one to the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

In other terms they seem to advise the use of two different motors; one included with a dynamo, which would be the lighting plant already offered in yours of May 17th, and, separately, a diesel engine to power the already existing line shaft driving other machinery.\"\n\"Actually, with the lighting plant already tendered, there is no provision made for the needs other than electric lighting.

L. Poirier, of the Guy Indian Residential School at Sturgeon Landing, Saskatchewan, to send an inspector at the earliest possible date to inspect their boilers which were causing them a good deal of concern. This was followed by a telegram to our Prince Albert Inspector, Mr. M.B. Crook in who's district Sturgeon Landing is situated, to come as early as possible to make the inspection as we had given the Rev. L. Poirier, Mr. Crook's address.\n\nWith a good deal of difficulty, Mr. Crook journeyed to Sturgeon Landing to make the inspection and inspected all the boilers. He found that the high pressure boiler had developed a very dangerous condition. This boiler, which was shut down due to a leaking stay-bolt in the water leg was found to be completely blocked with scale in the rear of the boiler and was in parts of the side legs.\n\nMr. Crook spent the better part of two days assisting one of the Brothers at the school in cleaning the boiler and removing accumulated scale and before he left had the boiler in such condition that it could be operated.\n\nIn view of the fact that this inspection was specially requested, we are billing the Department for the out-of-pocket expenses of our inspector in connection with same, in addition to the regular boiler inspection fees. These accounts are enclosed herewith and we shall be pleased to receive payment of same at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) Joseph Taylor,\nChief Inspector.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n| DATE | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Nov. 23 | To inspection of boilers at Guy Indian        |        |\n|       | Residential School                           | $20.00 |\n|       | Expenses of boiler inspector                 | $29.05 |\n\nTotal: $49.05\n\nNote: See letter of November 18th from the Department of Labour, Province of Saskatchewan, attached to this voucher.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Plourde, O.M.I.,\nOttawa University,\nLaurier Avenue,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th instant enclosing an account for beds purchased for use at the Guy Residential School, we have decided to allow an amount of $90.00 towards the cost of the beds. A cheque for this amount will be forwarded to the Principal.\n\nWe hope that this account is a different one than the one you forwarded in your letter of 20th December. We have no copy of that particular account, as we had to send it to the Treasury Branch. You will remember that I acknowledged your letter of 20th December in official letter of 28th December.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nJanuary 27, 1949\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Mr. W.M. Vincent\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nSubject: Requisition No. 77161\nFile: 15/16 - Your Order 36802\n\nGentlemen:\n\nThe subject order covers one (1) only Fairbanks-Morse Model 48AS4 Diesel Power Unit developing 16 HP at 1200 RPM. This engine is to drive a line shaft at approximately 335 RPM. In our quotation, we included two suitable pulleys for the engine and the line shaft. The specification calls for flat face pulleys 10\" in width. We have had correspondence with Reverend L. Poisier, Principal of the Guy Residential School, and he advises that the 10\" width has probably been specified because of the fact that 10\" pulleys are presently in use. We received information from a supplier that we should furnish 11\" pulleys with crown faces and we advised the reverend Poisier accordingly. Upon checking this subject further, we have now learned that 6\" belting will be ample in size for this transmission and that 7\" pulleys should be provided. We are confident that this latter recommendation will prove most satisfactory.\n\nThere are two reasons why we prefer to furnish pulleys 7\" in width if acceptable to you. Firstly, we can provide a standard concentric pulley instead of an off-set hub type pulley which would be required if 11\" wide. We believe that with the overhanging effect encountered with the 11\" pulley in time, it may be possibly prove detrimental to the smooth running of the clutch bearings. Secondly, these pulleys are standard and can be shipped promptly.\n\nIf an off-set is required, then it must be made up specially with the consequent delay in delivery. We intend to furnish an ordinarily pulley for the line shaft, assuming that it can be mounted from the end and that a split hub type is not required. If pulleys 7\" in width are acceptable, then we would appreciate receiving your confirmation. The belting used for this drive should be medium heavy duty belting. This engine was shipped from the factory on January 14th, so that we would request that you give this subject your immediate attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.D.

Roads in that section of the country are extremely bad following the spring thaw, and consequently, we are anxious to have this shipment get to Atik before the condition mentioned arises.\n\nPlease let me hear from you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nThe Western Paint Co.

This gravity tank may, at any time, go out of order as it is constructed of wood, and the bottom is badly warped. The engine room and laundry are both much too small and the laundry needs a ventilator fan very badly. The school should be enlarged to accommodate 200 children if it is the intention to continue to operate a residential school for that area, which, in my opinion, is desirable. The barn was very badly planned in the first instance, the foundation being about 2 ft. below the ground surrounding the barn, with the result that there is no drainage and the floor of the barn is always wet. I considered the possibility of raising the floor about 6 ft., in order to give drainage. This will be very costly, and I am not sure that it is justified. Perhaps it would be better to build a new barn and dismantle the old one, using as much of the material as possible. All of these matters suggest that an engineer should be sent to that school to examine and report on the various needs, with a view to placing quite a large amount in the Estimates for 1950-51, as I presume there is little hope of getting it done in the coming fiscal year.\n\n(2) This school is under very excellent management and is doing a very fine work. Most of the Indian children attending the school could not be well served by day schools as they come from a very scattered area, consisting mostly of quite small groups, where the livelihood is derived almost entirely from trapping and fishing. A great deal more school accommodation is needed for that area, and I believe that the most economical way to meet this need, at least partly, is by enlarging the Guy School to accommodate 200 pupils.\n\nThere is an item in the Estimates for a new day school at Pine Bluff. I enquired into the possibilities there, and I do not recommend a day school at that point as I see little hope of a permanent living for the Indians, and I am sure that the attendance at such a day school would not justify the large expenditure that would be necessary. The children of that group should go to the Guy School if it is enlarged, and, in the meantime, I do not recommend any great expenditure upon the old day school. The classroom is an old log building which might be temporarily improved by an expenditure of $500.00 for a ceiling of plasterboard, or some such material; replastering of the log walls, and repairs to the floor. Indian Superintendent Jones will submit a requisition in this connection in due course, and I intend to recommend its approval. The teacherage, hardly fit for habitation, has been built in three pieces of very poor log construction, with the result that no expenditure upon that building would make a good building, therefore it cannot be recommended.\n\nJ.P.B.

This gravity tank may, at any time, go out of order as it is constructed of wood, and the bottom is badly warped.\n\n\"The engine room and laundry are both much too small.\n\n\"The barn was very badly planned in the first instance, the foundation being about 2 ft. below the ground surrounding the barn, with the result that there is no drainage, and the floor of the barn is always wet. I considered the possibility of raising the floor about 4 ft. in order to give drainage. This will be very costly, and I am not sure that it is justified. Perhaps it would be better to build a new barn and dismantle the old one, using as much of the material as possible.\n\n\"This school is under very excellent management and is doing very fine work. Most of the Indian children attending the school could not be well served by day schools as they come from a very scattered area, consisting mostly of quite small groups, where the livelihood is derived almost entirely from trapping and fishing. A great deal more school accommodation is needed.\"\nfor that area, and I believe that the most economical way to meet this need, at least partly, is by enlarging the Guy School to accommodate 200 pupils.\"\n\nIn view of the above, I would appreciate it if you could arrange to have one of your engineers visit this school during the coming summer and submit a report in order that we may further consider the matter when we prepare our estimates for the fiscal year 1949-50.\n\nPP/ST Director.\n29th March, 1949.\n\nMr. J.P.B.

This will explain that the control panel, shipped on March the 21st, was not at Atik yet last Tuesday, and that the confirmation for arrival of same will take some time yet to reach you.\n\nI am glad there is a special mail occasion to-morrow, so these invoices will not be much more delayed.

Jones, Supt.,\nCarleton Indian Agency,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLast winter the department sent us 12 new closet bowls to replace the old ones near the children playrooms, and the work is now being done by a plumber from the Pas.\n\nWe are just now realizing that the factory, Crane Ltd., has sent no seats for those bowls. I could not say, from the purchase order which I still have on hand and am forwarding to you, whether the seats were included or not in the order.\n\nBut there is no doubt that seats are needed, and the children are coming 18 days from now. So with the purchase order, and also one copy of the invoice of Crane which I am forwarding also to you, I am asking you to assist us in procuring these toilet bowl seats in the least possible delay.\n\nSo the order would be for 12 on. closet horseshoe seats, without cover.\n\nAs to the material, you may decide yourself if they will be straight wood finish, or, as our plumber recommends for public toilets, those Viceroy rubber-wood composition seats which never need anything else than washing and are unbreakable.\n\nPlease have them shipped to: Guy Indian Residential School, Sturgeon Landing, Sask.

Clark reports that when making an inspection at the Guy Indian Residential School last week it was noted that the Power Plant at the school has apparently not been properly connected up with the switch board and although the plant can and is being started manually, the generator is not charging properly and some action should be taken immediately to have an electrician proceed to this school and properly connect the wiring.\n\nThe work required would not take more than two or three hours of an electrician's time and consequently the cost involved would possibly not exceed the sum of $100.00, which amount would be made up largely of transportation costs by air and return from The Pas.\n\nIt is suggested that, if possible, arrangements be made to have this work done immediately in order to prevent possible damage to the Power Plant which is practically a new unit.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWWP/MD\nSupervising Engineer\nRegina, September 22nd, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nEnclosed is copy of a letter from Mr. W.W.

Clark, on the unsatisfactory conditions surrounding the electrical installations at the Guy Indian Residential School.\n\nMr. Clark was sent to the school to make his recommendations on various other matters in connection with the school, but this matter regarding the lights is too urgent to be dealt with in the usual manner.\n\nI would ask that instructions be issued to Indian Superintendent E.S. Jones, of the Carlton Agency, to have an engineer visit the Guy School at once for the purpose of carrying out the necessary work in connection with the electricity.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Perrie mentions transportation costs by air for the engineer from The Pas as being approximately $100.00. The total cost will be this air transportation plus necessary material, and the electrician's time, and will probably not exceed a further $100.00, making a total of $200.00.\n\nJ.P.B.

I plan on doing this from one week to ten days after the opening of the fall term. A few days before my visit one hundred and forty Patch Tests were sent in with instructions to the Sister nurse in charge that they be placed on the pupils on the 27th of August.\n\nTom Lamb's Norseman flew Mrs. Dalman, Mrs. Yule and myself to the school on the morning of August 29th. This is the usual assistance I have taken in for the last several years to enable me to do any Tonsil work found necessary amongst the new pupils.\n\nLast year with one hundred and thirty-nine pupils I considered the school well filled, but this year I found one hundred and fifty-six enrolled. This meant that sixteen were not Patch Tested. There were thirty-eight new pupils, the majority of whom I had not examined. It involved a considerable amount of work in making the individual examinations. As many of the new pupils were from British, the tonsil problem from that reserve is at least partially solved. My examination showed that there were about thirty pupils in the whole school requiring their tonsils removed. We started this work on the morning of the 30th. After we had done twenty-five pair we decided to call it a day and left the other five for another time. As there is now a yearly visit by our dentist, no teeth extractions were done.\n\nThe Patch Tests were removed and the readings taken on the following day\u2014the 31st. The negative ones (12 boys and 18 girls) were given HCG. The school was given BCG in 1946 which probably accounts for the small number of negative cases. In about two months' time I plan on sending in enough Patch Tests to do the whole school.\n\nThe large attendance at once raises the question of overcrowding. I obtained a statement from the Principal giving the size of the various dormitories. I understand that this information is already in your possession. The Manitoba School Act requires 200 cubic feet of air per pupil. If we use this as a yard-stick there is apparently enough air space even for this increased number. The position of the windows permit of adequate ventilation. As there are ninety girls to sixty-five boys the overcrowding is more particularly in the girls' dormitory. However, there are a couple of smaller rooms being used as sleeping quarters for the girls. The staggered hours in the classrooms solve the problem of overcrowding there.\n\nI have recommended to Dr. E.J. Ross, Manitoba Sanitorium Board, and Dr. Ridge that the X-ray Clinic be held at Guy School during the current month. My reasons are as follows,\n\n1. The large number of new pupils.\n2. The Saskatchewan pupils. There are fourteen new pupils from Saskatchewan Reserves. These, along with the previously...\nenrolled Saskatchewan students, make up approximately half of the enrolment. I understand that no X-ray work was done in Saskatchewan reserves this year.\n\nThis matter was discussed personally with both doctors who were in my office the day after my return from Sturgeon Landing. They agreed to carry out my recommendation.\n\nSister Francois de Jesus, R.N., who has been in charge of this school since September 1941, was forced to return East this summer on account of ill health. She has been replaced by Sister St. Thomas, R.N., who appears to be equally as efficient. While we were very disappointed in losing the services of Sister Francois, we welcome Sister St. Thomas and have no doubt that she will do excellent work.\n\nWe found the school being conducted with its usual quiet efficiency. The children are well fed and apparently happy. There appears to be an excellent relationship between the pupils and staff.\n\nThe school has one hundred acres of land under cultivation\u2014wheat, oats and barley. If the amount of straw in the fields is any criterion, the yield will be heavy. There was also the usual splendid crop of potatoes, tomatoes, carrots, etc., and raspberries. There was even a crabapple tree loaded with apples. This is in fact a mixed farm with its hens, pigs, cows and horses. However, the major part of the field work is done by tractor.\n\nI might add that we returned to The Pas on Thursday, the 2nd, bringing with us two pupils from the school for hospital attention\u2014Angelique Morin, 15, has developed a T.B. spine, and Joe Bear, 14, was found to have a congenital hernia. Angelique is being sent to Brandon Sanatorium for further treatment (she is a previous San. patient). A Herniotomy was performed on Joe a few days after his arrival at St. Anthony's Hospital.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) Robt. F.

J. Clark following an inspection made at the above school in accordance with the request contained in a memorandum from the Director, Indian Affairs Branch, under date of March 29, 1949. Attached also is a blueprint copy of a plan showing the general layout of the school buildings, water and sewer lines and contours over the land adjacent to the buildings.\n\nIt will be noted that this school is overcrowded and consideration should be given, in the near future, to the possibility of either enlarging the present building or to the erection of an additional building to provide more housing accommodation. Consideration should also be given to the possibility of erecting a new barn, the present structure being too small and entirely unsuited for the purpose. No estimate of the cost of an addition to the school building or of a new barn can be given as the design in both cases would depend largely upon the funds that could be provided for the purpose.\n\nMr. Clark has listed, in his report, the items of work that it is recommended should be undertaken during 1950 and his estimate of the cost of this work can be considered to be reasonably close to what the actual cost will be. It is desirable that all the work detailed be proceeded with if the funds are available but early action is very necessary in connection with the replacement of the water supply tank, the materials for which should be delivered to the...\nsite during the winter months when the hauling can be done over the winter road. The estimate of cost on the replacement of the water supply tank is based upon a tentative design for the replacement of the present tower and tank with one of treated timber. In the event that the present elevated tank was replaced with an underground tank of either concrete or steel, pressure would have to be obtained by the use of a pump and the installation of a pressure tank in the school basement which is already overcrowded.\n\nThe reference to the necessity of properly connecting up the wiring of the power plant to the switchboard was referred to Mr. J.P. Ostrander, Regional Supervisor, Indian Affairs Branch on September 22nd and it is possible that this matter has now been attended to.\n\nWWP#MD\nEncls.\n\nSupervising Engineer\n\nMr. G. V. F. Weir, Chief,\nEngineering & Construction Division,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nNorlite Building,\nOttawa, Canada.\nW. W. Perrie, Esq.,\nSupervising Engineer,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nEngineering & Construction Division,\n416 Post Office Bldg.,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReport: Guy Indian Residential School,\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.\n\nAccording to instructions, proceeded to The Pas\nManitoba. A plane was secured at this point to\nmake the trip to Sturgeon Landing, where the Guy\nIndian Residential School is located.\n\nThe inspection included the various buildings\nincluded under the school's jurisdiction, such as\nbarns, piggery, hen house, machine sheds, warehouses,\ngarages and out-buildings; also the inspection of\nwater supply, sewage disposal, lighting and the\ninspection of the school building itself.\n\nThe population of the school is as follows:\n70 boys, 90 girls, 16 sisters, 5 staff, one farm\nforeman, one engineer, making a total of 183. The\nschool is overcrowded; for instance, the older\nboys dormitory has been turned into a class room,\nand these older boys placed in with the younger ones,\nand to facilitate bathing a room in the basement\nhas been turned into a steam bath, the walls of\nwhich the plaster has broken away exposing the lath.\nIf this room continues to be used for bathing\nwould recommend a sheet metal wall be erected to\nreplace the present one, or plywood.\n\nThe principal requests that a Walkin\nrefrigerator be installed as he finds it extremely\ndifficult to preserve fresh meats, milk and perish-\nable foods. He suggests that this be located\nadjoining the pantry directly across the corridor\nfrom the kitchen. To do this the basement wall\nwould have to be torn out to make room for this installation. He also recommends that the school building be painted on the outside this coming summer. It was painted about 5 years ago, and is showing signs of peeling and deterioration. Altogether, the school building and surrounding buildings are well maintained and with few exceptions in good condition. These exceptions are the elevated water tank, a leak in the roof which has caused the plaster in the dormitories and stair wells to break away from the lath.\n\nThe various outbuildings such as machine sheds, garages, warehouses, piggery, henhouse, barn, etc., were in good condition with the exception of the barn. This barn which is 28'6\" x 50'0\" was erected in 1926, is very poorly placed. The foundation is above the ground level, but the floor is two feet below the ground level, and in freezing weather all the fluid from horses and cattle collects on the floor with no possibility of drainage to the outside of the building, consequently making the floor damp and unsanitary.\n\nThe principal of the school, Father Poirier, states that the structure is too small to accommodate the live stock, and recommends that a new structure be erected (at a point suggested on accompanying plan) of suitable dimensions.\n\nThe water supply to the school is well planned, and has been well maintained. The only objectionable feature at present is the storage tank. The tank was built in 1926 and at present is in a precarious condition. The bottom is badly warped and the wood is rotten so that the structure is liable to collapse at any time. The tank is constructed on a tower 70 feet high which gives a gravity supply to the school. This should be renewed, or failing that, to construct either a concrete or steel tank with a pressure system similar to other schools. The cost would be approximately the same in either case. If a tower is decided to be erected, would recommend treated timber for the whole structure.\n\nIt is recommended that this structure be demolished and a steel or concrete tank installed to take care of the school supply as well as the barn. If a steel tank is decided as suitable, it will have to be shipped during the winter season, as that is the only time heavy materials can be transported to the school from the railway.\n\nThe tank can either be buried underground at the rear of the school building or else housed in a small addition to the school building, and steam lines run out from the main building for heating.\nSewage disposal has been well planned. There are two lines, one from the laundry which by-passes the septic tank, and the sanitary line which leaves the main building from the girls' playroom enters the septic tank and goes through to the river. The lines are clear as well as the septic tank, the tank having been pumped out recently.\n\nThe heating system has been well maintained and is in good working order. There is only one objection to find, and that is the insulation on both boilers and also the high pressure steam boiler should be renewed as soon as possible. This has broken away in several places.\n\nPower Plant for the school is practically new. This consists of two Diesel Engines and Dynamos. The engine for lighting the buildings has to be started manually as the connection with the switchboard is not hooked up properly. It is recommended that a skilled electrical mechanic be sent in from The Pas and have this attended to as soon as possible, as the school engineer is not familiar with this plant.\n\nThe machinery and laundry rooms are badly cramped for space. In the machinery room, the belt from Power Plant to the line shaft is in a dangerous position. It is placed in such a way that any inspection or repair work around the power plant is liable to catch the clothing of the operator.\n\nThe following data identifies this engine:\n\nFairbanks-Morse Engine\n48-AG 46, 2 Cyl.\nH.P. 16, F106349 Engine No.\nR.F.M. 1200\nSwitch Board connecting the above engine\nNo. 1090\n10 Kw - 120 volts\n24V-D.C. Ungrounded control\nBattery charging control unit\n\nThere are 56 batteries with this unit and they are all in first class condition.\n\nThe other engine is controlled manually and is not automatic. It is used for power to water pumps, laundry, bread mixer, etc.\n\nEngine No. F106331\n48 A.S. 4 2 Cyl.\nH.P. 16, R.F.M. 1200\n\nThis unit is in good condition.\n\nA fuel tank should be installed for these units, as all fuel is taken to the engine room in pails, and creates a fire hazard. Would suggest a tank of 400 gallon capacity.\nThe roof on the north side of the main building is leaking, and in heavy rain and wind the water is forced up under the shingles and in the valleys under the flashing. This condition should be repaired as soon as possible as the plaster in the girls dormitory and also the boys dormitory, on the third floor, is breaking away from the lath which is exposed in several places.\n\nThe stair wells walls are in poor shape as the water is getting inside the walls which are bulging out and cracking the plaster on each floor landing. There will be considerable patching to do and would recommend that this work be performed by day labor or cost plus. The work would entail the service of a plasterer and a painter for approximately 90 hours each.\n\nRoad from Atik on the Flin-Flon The Pas Railway (C.N.R.) to Sturgeon Landing, Sask.\n\nThis road is approximately 25 miles in length and would provide access to the Guy Indian School at all times. This would eliminate the use of airplane travel, and provide transportation of heavy supplies, which are either shipped in winter, or transported from The Pas in Manitoba up the Saskatchewan River to Cumberland House, and thence into Nannu Lake and Sturgeon Landing in the summer.\n\nAt present the road is partially cleared and can be used by light trucks in very dry weather. There are a few scratch rock cuttings which will have to be excavated and some drainage work on short muskegs. It is estimated that this road can be put in good shape for two thousand dollars per mile.\n\nThe gravel as far as can be ascertained at this time is near the railway line and would necessarily be a long haul, however, it is altogether likely that other deposits will be discovered along the road when the time comes for construction work.\n\nThe following is a summary of work suggested to be undertaken during the coming year.\n\n| Item                        | Cost   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| Tank (water) and Tower      | $4,400.00 |\n| Boiler insulation           | 175.00 |\n| Walk-in Refrigerator        | 1,200.00 |\n| Painting building outside   | 3,600.00 |\n| Plastering                  | 425.00 |\n| Painting inside             | 350.00 |\n| **Total**                   | **$10,150.00** |\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.J.C.

Giard, O.M.I., Principal of the Guy Indian Residential School, at Sturgeon Landing, has written Indian Superintendent E.S. Jones regarding the proposal for a new barn at that school.\n\nThis was the subject of a report from Mr. W.W. Perrie, Supervising Engineer, Engineering and Construction Division, Department of Mines and Resources, Regina, about three months ago. Nothing was done with regard to making provision in next year's Estimates for this barn, but a new barn is certainly needed.\n\nIt is my opinion that about all that could be done this winter with regard to the new barn would be to purchase a quantity of the necessary material from this year's Appropriation (if funds are available), with a view to having the barn erected in 1950. If it is decided to build a new barn at the Guy School, and funds are available in this year's Appropriation to purchase the material, and I am so advised by the Department, I shall ask Indian Superintendent Jones to discuss with Reverend Father Giard the type and size of the barn needed, and, having secured a plan for the purpose, endeavour to purchase most of the material this winter.\n\nJ.P.B.

As you are, no doubt, aware, the funds provided by Parliament are for the education of Indian children only. The Peterson children take the status of the father and are not wards of the Department. It will therefore not be possible to allow the usual per capita grant in their case.\n\nRelative to the applications for Marie Lina Head and Elise Ballantyne, I have directed that the local Indian Agent, Mr. Pas, report concerning their eligibility for admission to your school. Should his report indicate that these two children are eligible, their admission will be approved.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nReverend N. Doyon, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nGuy Indian Residential School,\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.\nOttawa, March 18, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Principal of the Guy Indian Residential School has written the Honourable the Superintendent General, regarding the case of two children whom, he states, he has been keeping at the school for some time, and requesting that the Department approve their admission as grant-earning pupils. He forwarded an application for their admission, which I am enclosing, with the request that you will state if these children are wards of this Department. You should ascertain if the parents are Indians and members of a Band or if they are half-breeds, non-treaty or white. Please state, also, if they had been residing on a reserve and living the Indian mode of life thereon. If you consider they are wards of this Department and eligible for admission as grant-earning pupils, I would request that you fill in the number of the ticket under which annuity is paid and sign the applications. Please give as complete information as possible, regarding the status of the two children, and state whether you would recommend that their admission be approved.

Lovell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nPP/O'M.\nOttawa, April 14, 1936.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nReferring to conversation with Your Lordship during your recent visit to the Department, regarding the age limit for the discharge of those boys who are 14 years of age from the residential schools conducted under your auspices, in order that they can be returned to their parents to acquire knowledge of hunting, trapping, etc., I have to say that this meets with the approval of the Department. The Indian Agents at The Pas, Norway House, and Battleford are being informed and requested to advise the Principals of the Guy, Cross Lake and Beauval Indian Residential Schools accordingly.\n\nIt is not intended that all the boys, upon attaining 14 years of age, shall be granted discharge, but only those cases which the Principals consider to be in sufficiently good health to accompany their parents on their hunting and trapping trips. It is thought that Indian boys should have acquired sufficient education for their future needs by the time they reach 14 years of age and that it would be to their future advantage to acquire a knowledge of hunting and trapping, on which their future livelihood will, to a great extent, depend.\n\nI would suggest that Your Lordship discuss the matter with the Principals of the above named schools and advise them that careful selection should be made by them of the boys whose discharge they would recommend at 14 years of age.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRight Rev. M. Lajeunesse, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, April 14, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Lajeunesse, during a recent visit to the Department, discussed the matter of the age limit for the discharge of the boys from the Indian Residential Schools conducted under his auspices. He recommended that those boys who are in good health should be given their discharge when they reach 14 years of age, in order that they can be returned to their parents or guardians, with a view to acquiring a knowledge of hunting and trapping, which will be the main source of their future livelihood.\n\nThe Department considers that it would be in the interests of the boys to be granted their discharge at 14 years of age, as they should by that time have acquired an education sufficient to meet their future needs. You may, therefore, inform the Principal of the Guy Indian Residential School that, when he considers that a boy, upon attaining his fourteenth birthday, should receive his discharge, he should make application to the Department, through your office, in the usual manner.\n\nIt is not intended that all boys upon reaching 14 years of age are to be discharged, but, as stated, only those who are in sufficiently healthy condition to accompany their parents or guardians in order to acquire a knowledge of hunting, trapping, etc.\n\nI would request that you advise the Principal accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

Her father is living but she has been raised by her grandfather, whose lives in the vicinity of Moose Lake Reserve. She did not live on the Reserve but very close to it. (She is not a treaty Indian or a ward of the Department.)\n\nElise Ballandyne is a halfbreed child. Her mother is dead and her father is in the sanatorium at Prince Albert. The father brought the child into The Pas when he went into the sanatorium at Prince Albert. She was placed in the Hospital here. The Hospital finally had her transferred to Guy School. (She is not a treaty Indian or a ward of the Department.)\n\nThe parents of both these children earned their living and lived in a similar manner to the Indians, that is by hunting and trapping and they also associated with them more or less.\n\nI cannot, and obey the instructions of the Department, recommend them as grant earning pupils. I would say that they are wards of the Provincial Government. These children are destitute and there does not seem to be anyone who will accept responsibility for them.\n\nI will hold the applications here and await your further instructions.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSamuel Donell\nIndian Agent.\nCOPY SENT TO MR. AGENT LOVELL.\n\nOttawa, April 16, 1936.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 8th ultimo, regarding certain children whom you request be admitted as grant earning pupils to the Guy Residential School, the Department has received the following report:\n\n\"Marie Lina Head is a half-breed child whose mother is dead. Her father is living but she has been raised by her grandfather, who lives in the vicinity of Moose Lake Reserve. She did not live on the Reserve but very close to it.\n\nElise Ballandyne is a half-breed child. Her mother is dead and her father is in the sanatorium at Prince Albert. The father brought the child into The Pas when he went into the sanatorium at Prince Albert. She was placed in the hospital here. The hospital finally had her transferred to Guy school.\"\n\nIn view of the above information, these children cannot be considered wards of this Department, and, therefore, we are not prepared to allow per capita grant for them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. N. Doyon, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nGuy Indian Residential School,\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Principal has requested me to write to you for authority to spend $150.00 for transportation of the children of the Guy Indian Residential School to their homes and back for the summer holidays.\n\nThis is the usual amount that has been allowed in previous years.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSamuel Lovell\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 24, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, you may inform the Principal of the Guy Indian Residential School that the Department will allow an amount not exceeding $150 towards the transportation expenses of children to and from the school during the summer of 1936.\n\nWhen applying for the grant promised in this letter, you should forward a voucher giving a detailed statement of the expenditure incurred by the management for transportation expenses, to which should be attached receipts for expenditures made. Transport requisitions should not be issued in payment of transportation. All transportation costs should be paid by the school management and, on receipt of your voucher in proper order, refund to the amount of $150.00 will be made to the Principal of the Guy School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

There was very few details in the statement and a lot of the items were not covered by receipts, and the account itself could not be understood.\n\nAs the authority only allows an expense of $150.00, I have had an account made up in this office from the receipts for that amount. I realize that it is desirable to have more details in an expense account of this kind. However if I sent the account back to Sturgeon Landing, it would probably be at least two months before it was returned.\n\nI recommend that the account be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSamuel Lovell\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT GUY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\n**STURGEON LANDING, SASK.**\n\n**SCHOOL DURING**\n\n**QUARTER, 193**\n\n| No. | NAME                  | Date of Admission | Band          | Father                  | Mother                  | Religion of Parents | State of Education upon entering the School | Place and period of Previous Education |\n|-----|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 0133| Bibiana Bighitty      | Aug. 7            | Mathias Colomb | Mark\u00e9 Bighitty          | Maggie Bighitty         | R.C.                | None                                        | Home                                   |\n| 0134| Marie Adile Caribou   |                   |               |                         |                         |                     |                                             |                                        |\n| 0135| Nancy Dumas           |                   |               |                         |                         |                     |                                             |                                        |\n| 0136| Henriette Morin       |                   | Peter Ballantyne | Thomas Morin             | Helene Morin            | R.C.                | None                                        | Home                                   |\n| 0137| Agnes Ballantyne      |                   |               |                         |                         |                     |                                             |                                        |\n| 0138| Bibiana Ballantyne    |                   |               |                         |                         |                     |                                             |                                        |\n| 0139| Henriette Cook        |                   |               |                         |                         |                     |                                             |                                        |\n| 0140| Madeleine Head        |                   |               |                         |                         |                     |                                             |                                        |\n\n### DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | NAME                  | Date of Discharge | Periods in the School | State of Education | Trade or Industry Taught and Proficiency in It | Remarks Upon Discharge Reasons for Same |\n|-----|-----------------------|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|     |                       |                   | Years Months Days      | On Admission       | On Discharge                                  |                                        |\n| 0141| Suzanne Colomb        | Aug. 15           | 4                      | None               | Level                                         |                                        |\n| 0142| Vronique Bear         |                   |                        | None               | Very good                                     |                                        |\n\n**NOTE:** One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\n---\n\n**FORM 33**\n\nIndian Affairs.

I tried again at treaty time this past summer, to have some Indian at Cross Lake take charge of these children, but without success.\n\nAs stated on the application form, by the examining physician, Dr Falconer, the children have been under supervision at St Anthony's hospital for the past six months, and they can now be sent safely to a residential school.\n\nI may say that I never saw either of the parents, as they never lived on the Cross Lake since I came to Norway House, but at Pikwitonei, Man; and their annuities were always sent to them by mail until this year.\n\nWill you kindly advise me of the decision of the Department regarding the above applications.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G.

Lovell,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 21, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nA review of the December quarter return of the Guy Indian Residential School shows that Henrietta Morin, No. 0136, is over the age of 16.\n\nNo application for retaining this child in your school has been received and in this connection I wish to direct your attention to circular letter of July 21, 1939, a copy of which is enclosed.\n\nAs pointed out in the circular letter the Department realizes that frequently there are reasons for keeping certain children after they reach the age of 16 but at the same time the consent of the Superintendent General (Minister) must be obtained.\n\nI may add that in the past the Department has been favourably disposed to allowing certain pupils, especially girls, to remain in residential schools after they reach the age of 16 if good reasons for such action are given by the Principal and approved by the Indian Agent. However, in view of the fact that the number of children of school age is apparently increasing and the further consideration that due to the conditions now confronting us there is no immediate prospect of our securing funds to provide increased pupilage at Indian residential schools, it is considered that in future it will be necessary to adhere more strictly to the provision of the Indian Act requiring discharge of pupils at 16 years of age.\n\nI feel you will agree with me that it is not fair to deprive children of education simply because the accommodation that might be available for them in\n\nRev. N. Doyon, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nGuy Indian Residential School,\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.\na residential school is being used by those who have had the advantage of residential school training for some years and who have reached the age of 16 years.\n\nUntil further advised you should make arrangements for the discharge of pupils when they reach the age of 16 unless there are some very exceptional circumstances and in this event full particulars should be given to the Department and our permission obtained before such pupils reach the age of 16.\n\nWith the above in mind I desire to hear from you at the earliest possible date stating the date on which the pupil mentioned in the first part of this letter can be discharged from your school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to official letters Nos 132-7-10 of January 2nd, and 132-7-10 of January 25th, approving the admission to Guy Residential School of William Miller, and Jean Miller respectively, I beg to advise you that I have received a communication from Mr S. Lovell, Indian Agent at The Pas, advising me that the Priest took these two children to the Cross Lake R.C. Residential School in December, and that new applications would have to be prepared for them, for their admission to that school.\n\nI presume that the approval of the admission of these two children to the Guy Residential School, will be cancelled, and that the new applications will be dealt with when received.

(RG 10, Volume 434, file 655-10, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Rev. Father Doyen, Principal of Guy Indian Residential School, is in the habit of taking destitute half-breed children into the School as resident pupils.\n\nThese children are not examined by Dr. Falconer and as far as I know are not examined by any doctor; consequently there is a grave possibility of these children taking disease into the School. There were three children admitted to the school last week. These children came from a district where there was diptheria. It so happened that the Provincial Medical Health Officer heard about it and mentioned it to Dr. Falconer and the children were put into Hospital for a few days for observation. While there they developed chicken pox.\n\nIt would seem to me that destitute half-breed children are a Provincial responsibility. When they are admitted to Guy School, even if they are not grant earning pupils, they become, to a certain extent, a responsibility of the Department as far as medical attendance and education is concerned.\n\nIf the Principal is to be allowed the unrestricted privilege of admitting half-breed children, one can easily see, that at times, it would lead to overcrowding.\n\nI would therefore like the Department to give me a ruling on this matter. Is the Principal entitled to admit children without reference to the Department. I refer of course to non-grant earning pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 634, file 655-10, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nApril 18, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 11th instant with reference to admitting destitute halfbreed children to the Guy Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Guy Indian Residential School was erected and is maintained for Treaty Indian children. Consequently halfbreed children should not be admitted even though the Department is not requested to allow any grant for their maintenance.\n\nThe Department realizes that it is sometimes necessary to allow children to enter the Guy School before official approval has been received from us but only Treaty Indian children should be accepted in this manner. Any doubtful case should not be admitted but full particulars should be forwarded to this office and our decision given before a child is allowed to enter the school.\n\nHowever, as stated above, destitute halfbreed children whose maintenance is a Provincial responsibility must not be taken into the Guy Indian Residential School. If there are any such children in this school at the present time you should advise the Principal that the Department desires them discharged immediately and you should advise this office when such action has been taken.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. S. Lovell,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nMay 13, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLast year the Department allowed the Guy Residential School an amount of $150.00 for the transportation of children to and from the school for holidays. In view of a decrease in our appropriation it will only be possible to allow an amount not exceeding $75.00 for the summer of 1940. You should so inform the Principal and co-operate with him in arranging to have the Indian parents bring their children to and from the school this year.\n\nI should appreciate receiving a reply to official letter of the 18th ultimo with reference to the taking of destitute halfbreed children into the Guy School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. S.

This morning I spoke to the Rev. Father Trudeau about it and he assured me the children would be discharged at the end of the school year.\n\nI will report again when I am assured that the Principal has taken the action you have ordered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n| No. | Name | Date of Admission | Band | State of Education | Period in the School | Reason for Discharge |\n|-----|------|------------------|------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n|     |      |                  |      |                   |                      | Died at the hospital |\n\n**Note:** One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Doyen, the Principal of Guy Residential School, which shows he paid the Arrow Airways $1225.40 for transportation, presumably for children going and coming back from their holidays. There is very little detail on the account.\n\nHe has requested that I ask the Department for a grant to help to pay for this expense. I do not recall ever having received any letter of authorization for expenditure of this kind during the present year. If the Department is prepared to make a grant, I would be pleased if you would inform how much it will be and how you require the voucher prepared.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nOctober 31, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your recent letter enclosing account showing expenditure made by the Principal of the Guy Residential School in connection with the transportation of children to and from the school during the past summer. The Department is surprised that the Principal encouraged such extremely heavy expenditure. If it was not possible to transport the children more economically than in the manner which he adopted it is felt that the children should have remained at the school instead of being sent home for holidays.\n\nLast year we allowed an amount of $75.00 for travelling expenses of children going on holidays from this school. It is very difficult for us to increase this amount to any large extent. However, it has been decided to allow $100.00 this year. You may, therefore, submit a voucher in his favour for $100.00. You should attach to it the accounts from the Arrow Airways Limited which I am returning to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. S. Lovell,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa,\nOctober 31, 1941.\n\nDear Bishop Lajeunesse:\n\nWe are in receipt of a request for a grant toward the transportation of children going on holidays from the Guy Residential School during the summer of 1941. Last year we allowed $75.00 for this service and it is extremely difficult for us to increase this amount to any large extent. However, it has been decided to provide $100.00.\n\nThe Principal has submitted accounts showing that he expended a total of $1225.40 for return transportation of children to their homes for holidays. All this amount was expended for aeroplane travel.\n\nIn view of conditions existing at the present time I am surprised that the Principal of any residential school would incur such an extremely heavy expenditure for the purpose mentioned. Even though the money is being paid from school funds the Department is vitally interested because if this expenditure had not been incurred for that purpose the money would have been available for other necessities at the school.\n\nIt is felt that if the children could not be sent home by some more economical means of transportation they should have been kept at the school during the holidays. I should appreciate it if you would give this matter your very careful\n\nRt. Rev. M. Lajeunesse, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nThe Pas, Man.\nconsideration.

We tried this year to have the Pelican Narrows Indians bring their children by canoe and while they promised to do so, nothing in fact resulted. We were obliged to round them up again by plane.\n\nYour suggestion to keep the children at school during the summer months would most likely bring about a more complex situation, a fast declining school enrollment.\n\nHowever, we appreciate your remarks and we will give the matter further consideration with the hopes of finding some means for the better.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Vicar Apostolique du Keewatin]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Please advise regarding this girl.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. S.

Welfare and Training,\nDept. of Mines and Resources, I.A.Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have a letter from our Indian Agent stating that No. 0132 Virginie Dumas appeared on the September quarter, but not the December quarter of our school return. I should have put her name on the list of all the children who were discharged in September; but unwillingly I omitted her name, but if you look over the September quarterly return, you will see that No. 0132 Virginie Dumas is stated as one to be discharged because last year that girl did not come back to school neither last August. That's why I am asking for her discharge as being kept by her parents at Akitawagan.\n\nHere is another question I want to speak to you of today and I am confident that you will understand my situation. On the December return I have been paid for two children who are not in school, not being back yet although their father wrote to me on September last stating that he was coming back to Sturgeon Landing as soon as possible. At the end of December I have been away for few days. When coming back the sisters had prepared the quarterly return. I just signed them and sent them away to the Indian agent, forgetting those two children. Those two children are No. 091 Melanie Caribou and No. 092 Memiet Caribou.\n\nYou could deduct the amount of money due to your Dept by this school on the March quarterly return, or if you want me to make a cheque for the amount due, please state so.\n\nI hope that this will agree with your approval and satisfaction, as this happened for the first time since fifteen years.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 5, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo the discharge of Virginie Dumas, No. 0138, is approved.\n\nI note that no grant should have been requested on the December quarter return for pupils 091 and 092. We allowed for them grant for 184 days and this will be deducted from the March quarter per capita allowance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. N. Doyon, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nGuy Indian Residential School,\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter 132-7-10, dated the 13th ultimo, I beg to advise that Rev. Father Doyen, the Principal of Guy School, has just informed me he has been writing to you direct regarding 0132 Virginia Dumas and that you have given him authority for the discharge of this girl.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n0102 - Howsa Head\n16 3/4 yrs for discharge\nin June.\n\n0111 - Joseph Morasky\non Dec. not shown\non March Return\nOttawa,\nApril 7, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the March quarter return of the Guy Residential School. The name of Josephine Merasty, No. O111, was shown on the December quarter return but does not appear on the March quarter return, although no application has been received for her discharge. Please advise regarding this girl.\n\nLouisa Head, No. O102, is shown to be over 16 years of age. At the end of June the Principal should either apply for her discharge or supply information indicating his reasons why she should remain longer in the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. S. Lovell,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nGuy Indian Residential B.School,\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.\nApril 17th, 1942.\n\nMr R.A. Hoey, Supt. of Welfare and Training,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nYesterday I had a letter from our Indian Agent stating that Josephine Merasty No 011 was shown on the Dec. return but does not appear on March quarterly return. I beg to say that this is a mistake of my secretary, for the said girl is certainly in the school. Would you please notify your secretary about this matter?\n\nIf the quarterly grant has been paid out entirely, I would suggest that the $43.75 due for the above girl will be placed with the $500.00 we are expecting from your Dept. for the road I really need so badly.\n\nYou can be sure that if the money is granted for the road, I will do my very best to have the work done properly without any remuneration whatever for my trouble.\n\nWe received lately a special grant for the school that was very welcome and for which we are very thankfull to you and your Dept. I understand the situation, the difficulties of the present time, but the necessities created by the local circumstances pressed me to ask.\n\nI have here this morning the agent of the Singer Sewing Machine Co., for inspection of our machines in the school. You will receive his report and see that the request I have made for new machines was not without any reasons.\n\nI received from your Dept. all the paint that has been granted for the outside painting of the school. The quantity will certainly not be sufficient, but all of it will be carefully spread over during the summer. As I want to finish the painting of the inside of the school, I already ordered 15 galls of white paint and 10 galls of cement paint for the playrooms and kitchen and dining-rooms. All this and the work will be paid by the school, for I am always anxious to keep on with the success of this school in every point of view.\n\nHope this letter will find your kind approbation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nApril 21, 1948.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, the name of Josephine Morasty, No. 0111, has been added to the March quarter return of the Guy Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. N. Doyon, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nGuy Indian Residential School,\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.\nOttawa,\nApril 23, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have carefully considered the contents of your letter of April 11. I note that you are discharging all pupils at 15 years of age. I would like to know if there is any special reason for this action. At other residential schools they have found that it is desirable to keep the girls at least until 16 years of age.\n\nThe funds at our disposal will not permit our making any definite promise regarding assistance to ex-pupils. As a matter of fact, I doubt if distribution of assistance is the best manner in which to assist ex-pupils. The majority of these have been in residential schools for many years at Government expense and have received training and every possible physical care and attention. At some period of their lives they must expect to do something for themselves. It is, therefore, felt that the exercise of influence toward this end on the part of Indian Agents and Missionaries would probably be the best assistance that we could give them. The whole matter is a very broad one and will require a great deal of consideration before any definite policy can be reached. In the meantime, however, we hope that our Principals of residential schools will impress on those graduating that the Department expects them to make a real effort to put in use the training that they have received at school. If this is done the Department will be more inclined to grant them some assistance later.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. N.

(RG 10, Volume 6314, file 655-10, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nMr. Samuel Lovell,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am sending herewith the quarterly return to the end of June. Here are some explanations about a few particulars.\n\nIn yours of April 10th, you had asked that the children so far marked as \"not back to school\" should be discharged if they were unlikely to return. By enquiring from the teachers and from the other children, it appears that all or mostly all of those \"not back to school\" will likely be back here in September. Therefore I have left their names once more on the report, but if they fail to return by next term, then I will put them on the list of children to be discharged.\n\nRe pupil 0207, Gertrude Merasty, the number of days in residence exceeds the number of days in quarter, because the days of her presence during the precedent term have been added to those of this term, because her name was not on the last report, since she was not yet officially admitted. About this pupil, may I ask you that one copy of her \"Application for admission\" and \"Physical examination\" be sent back to school to file with the others for reference.\n\nRe pupil 0206, Marie Claire Bighetty, something very extraordinary has occurred. That child has been in school and attending class for 2 full years and you may verify that it is now the first time that her name figures in the quarterly return. Apparently the principal must have forgotten to give that name to the teacher along with the other names of the children officially admitted as per your list in a letter dated October 4, 1941. So the teacher must have thought this pupil not yet officially admitted and had kept on omitting that name in the class attendance record, which is used to make up the quarterly return. I have discovered this serious omission in making out this report and I call your attention to the fact that the grant for this child has not yet been paid since two years. The total number days of her attendance during this whole period is 684. Should this number be put on this term instead of 91, thus increasing by 593 the Total No of days pupil residence during Quarter and making it 11,151? The average attendance of pupils during quarter would thus become 121.4. If this way of doing is right, may I ask you to change yourself the figures on the report, or if you will advise on another procedure to be taken, I will gladly hear about it.\n\nTruly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing herewith Quarterly Return of Guy Indian Residential School for the quarter ending June 30th, 1943.\n\nThe Principal has claimed for Gertrude Merasty an Marie Claire Bighetty grant exceeding the number of days in the quarter. I am including herewith the Principal's letter of explanation.\n\nS. Lovell,\nIndian Agent.\nMr. Samuel Lovell,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg leave to present to you and the Indian Department a demand of admission to school which has to do with special conditions.\n\nCharles Charlette, a resident of Sturgeon Landing, originally a Cold Lake Indian, but non-treaty, has been with the permission of the Department admitted in our Residential Schools, seven years at Duck Lake and three years here at Sturgeon Landing. His wife died two weeks ago, leaving him four children she had from her first husband, Thomas Morin of South End (or Pelican), who was treaty-Indian, and two young ones who are Charles' own children.\n\nThree of the Morin already have belonged to the school for years and still do, they being \"Treaty\" by both of their parents, and now at Charles Charlette's request I present to you his demand to have at least the older of his children, a girl of nearly four years called Nancy, also admitted to the school with her half-brothers and half-sister.\n\nThe mother of Nancy Charlette was a Treaty Indian, her father is an ex-pupil of the school and his misfortune makes him incapable of keeping care of her. I strongly hope that the Department will deem those reasons sufficient to approve the admission to Guy school of the said child, under age but with nobody else to take care of her.\n\nAs to the baby, seven months old, his father is looking for someone to adopt and raise him, not wanting to ask that much from the Department and the school staff.\n\nI want to express here my deep regret of having been unable so far to call on you when in The Pas, sometimes on account of your absence, and sometimes because I am there only at night. I hope that before long I shall have the occasion and pleasure to meet you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter I have received from the Principal of Guy Indian Residential School with regard to the admission of two half-breed children.\n\nKindly let me know your decision in this matter.\n\nS.

The boys are Joseph Colomb, 16, and Jeremie Colomb, 15, both of Pukatawagan, Man., and Frank Morin, of Pelican Narrows, Man.\"\n\nPlease let me have a complete report regarding the above incident.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. L. Poirier,\nSsangagam Residential School,\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.\nAt about 9.30 Pm Cst., Rathbone I/c The Pas Detachment received a telephone call from Father E. Ringuet to the effect that he had received information by letter delivered to him by Indian Messenger Joseph Morin that three boys had escaped from the Indian School at that point (Sturgeon Landing Mission School). The letter when translated from French to English went something as what follows:\n\nThree boys have escaped the Sturgeon Landing Indian School yesterday the 18th at 4:30 P.M.\n\nWe don't know what direction they have taken. It is quite possible they went to Atik if they have succeeded to cross the river not very far from the school; that can be done.\n\nBoys Names:\nJoseph Colomb 16 years old from Pakitawagan\nJeremie Colomb 15 \" \" \" from Southend or Pelican Narrows.\nFrank Morin 15 \" \" \" from Southend or Pelican Narrows.\n\nThe two Colomb are quite familiar with Cold Lake. They are wearing their weekly suits (overalls black sweater with colored stripes, and may be a blue jacket) or wind-breaker.\n\nAs far as the Principal knows the boys have just a very little quantity of food with them. Joseph Colomb is just as tall as an ordinary man; the others have the average height of boys of their age.\n\nThe Principal of the School says no other directions could have been taken than the one to Atik. If they have taken another direction, Father's fear is that the boys most likely counted on more strength than they possess to reach any other point.\n\nE. Ringuet, OMI\n\nOn the morning of the 20th accompanied by Joseph Morin, Messenger, we left The Pas at 4.30 Am by Police Car and proceeded to Atik. I left at this hour to be ahead of the train leaving The Pas at 7.20 Am and thus cut off these boys should they attempt to catch the train at Atik they did not board this train so I proceeded to Cranberry Portage making enquiries enroute, anticipating that I would have to go inland I returned to Mile 39 where I met Father L. Peirier, Priest, in charge of Sturgeon Landing Mission. Father Peirier had a canoe and motor and I accompanied him in a search of the north end of Goose Lake to Rat Creek, there were no signs to indicate that the three runaway boys were on this lake, it was then arranged that I would return and make inquiries elsewhere. Father Peirier covered the remaining portion of Goose Lake on his return to the mission, and I would report results on my return.\nContinued from page one. Leaving P. Peirier at Mile 99 I continued with enquiries at Simonhouse, Atik, and Wanless and questioned the camp operators and section men without success. I had been in touch with Capt. Rathbone earlier in the day and it was arranged that I would return to The Pas arriving in late PM at Atik, Man. I was requested by Fred Petryk, the contractor to bring Edward Cook to The Pas for medical treatment. He was suffering from crushed fingers. This is a subject of a separate report.\n\nOn the evening of the 22nd, I met Father Peirier on his arrival at The Pas from Sturgeon Landing Mission when he advised that the three boys had returned voluntarily to the mission. It appears that these three boys stole a canoe at near Sturgeon Landing and travelled as far as an island located about the center of Goose Lake, where they camped until May 20th, and were forced to return to the mission due to lack of food and clothing and necessary means to defend themselves against wolves which are thick in that area. They apparently suffered no ill affects from their experiences and were happy to return to the mission.\n\nRegarding the canoe stolen by these boys the same was the property of Father Peirier and he has no desire to press a charge of Theft of Canoe.\n\nCONCLUDED\n\nExpenses incurred on period 16th-31st, 1944, May.\n\nThe O.C., R.C.M.P., Dauphin S/Div., Dauphin, Man.\n\nFeb. 25-6-44 Having regard to the fact that these boys were poorly equipped to travel any distance in a country such as they would have to travel, I deemed it necessary to have immediate enquiries made. Due to the remoteness of Sturgeon Landing, word could not possibly reach this detachment that the boys had returned, until the evening of the 22nd. The fact that they returned voluntarily and as soon as they did, saved considerable amount of time and effort and public funds.\n\nR. C.

(RG 10, Volume 6314, file 655-10, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe article you have seen in the Winnipeg Free Press about three boys missing from Sturgeon Landing school was not without reason, but I am afraid it has caused you undue apprehension. Here is what happened.\n\nIn the afternoon of May 18, shortly before supper time, three boys took to the bush, running away from school. The boys were Joseph Colomb, 16 years old, from Pakitawagan; Jeremie Colomb, 15, from the same place, and Frank Morin, 14, from South End Reindeer Lake. I was notified about their absence at 6.30 p.m.\n\nI was sure that those boys were not lost accidentally, but that they had fled on purpose. For bad conduct they had been excluded from a reward given that same afternoon to many other children, but they were the only three big boys not to be there; they knew it in advance and they had planned their evasion for that day.\n\nWhere did they want to go? Home, evidently, but their homes were far away; so they would likely go to the nearest Indian settlements, and the fastest way to get there, if not the only one, was the railroad, 23 miles away from the school.\n\nI thought they might change their minds the same evening or during the night and I did not organize any pursuit right away, I just had all the buildings watched very closely all night for fear of fire.\n\nOn the morning of May 19, as they were not back, I sent a messenger to The Pas to notify the Agent or the Mounted Police; the Agent was not home, but the Police was asked to keep an eye on Cold Lake near Sherridon, and Beaver Lake, near Flin Flon where they would likely go if they had money to get on the train.\n\nIn the meanwhile I went myself at the end of an 8 mile road leading to Goose Lake, where I had left a canoe the week before and they might have used to go to the railroad if they would rather paddle than walk. The canoe was gone!... It was before noon when I found that out, so I went right back with the truck to get another canoe and a motor and I went as fast as I could right to the rail, Mile 39 of the Flin Flon Railway; my canoe was not there yet, so I was...\nahead of them and had cut their shortest way of escape by water. They were probably somewhere on the lake but it was too late that evening to start and search around the shore; so I camped there and in the early morning I saw the gas-car of R.C.M.P. coming from The Pas; they had made sure already that the boys had not taken the train yet and so they could not be farther than Cranberry Portage; so I went as far as there with the special constable, we searched for a while on the lake and then I went back toward home, while the Police was going back to The Pas where I promised to go on Monday 22, to tell them if I had found the children or not.\n\nAt 7 p.m. of May the 20th, when I got back to the place where my canoe had been, and from where it had been taken, the canoe was back in its place, and on the wheel of the truck I had left there was a note from the Boys: \"We are going back home, we are sorry for what we have done.\"\n\nWhen I got to the school at 9 p.m., they had been there 3 hours ahead of me.\n\nAfter two nights in the bush, with no blankets and but very little grub, and still a long way to go, and with pursuers already ahead of them, and wolves and bears to scare them, they had lost their enthusiasm for anything further.\n\nThey admitted afterwards that their plan was to reach the railroad, but since they had no money they had planned to walk the railroad up to Flin Flon, a walk of over 50 miles.\n\nThis school is so far from all communications and from Indian Reserves that it is fairly impossible for a child to run away with any chance of making it home; that is why an incident like this one is absolutely exceptional in the history of the school. And the failure of these boys to make it is likely to discourage any other attempt for a long time.\n\nJoe Colomb is being discharged because he is of age; Jeremie Colomb, who was the leader of the trio, will not be allowed to come back; he is old enough too and besides that his conduct makes him absolutely undesirable; as to Frank Morin, the youngest of the three, we are ready to take him again next year.\n\nI am sorry that the matter came up to the Press because it may have caused wrong impressions and regrettable reactions against the school, where otherwise I am certain that practically all the children enjoy to be.\n\nAs for you, though, I am glad that you knew it, for it shows me what interest you take in whatever concerns the schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nJune 14, 1944.\n\nDear Father Poirier:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, regarding three boys who truanted from the Guy Residential School. I am also in receipt of a report from the R.C.M.P. in which they also report regarding the incident. I understand that the boys have now returned to the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. L.

They have either truanted or they have not returned from their annual leave.

Most of them belong to the Nelson House Band and reside at South Indian Lake.\n\nI told the Chief of the Nelson House Band about this matter and asked him to assist us to get the children back, but I find nothing was done. It would be difficult to bring these children back other than by plane. The School authorities are not willing to charter a plane again to go to South Indian Lake to try and get the children to return, as it is too expensive. I could, if the Department would authorize it, charter a plane and take a R.C.M.P. constable in and bring out the children. This is the only way we would be able to get them back to School.\n\nS. Lovell,\nIndian Agent.\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to advise that the Right Rev. M. Lejeuness, Bishop of the R.C. Diocese of Keewatin, came to the Office a few days ago and requested me to write to the Department and ask permission to admit to Guy School the undermentioned children of William Chartier of Gillam, Man. This man is in the Sanatorium suffering from T.B. There is very little chance of him being able to support his children in future and they are now destitute. The Bishop tells me there is no other School these children can be admitted to. He is not asking that these children be admitted as grant earning pupils, only that they be allowed to remain in the School. Their maintenance will be provided for by the Church.\n\nKindly let me know your decision regarding the Bishop's request as soon as possible.\n\nS. Lovell,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 26, 1945.\n\nMr. S. Lovell, Indian Agent, The Pas, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to the request of the Right Reverend M. Lajeunesse, Bishop of Keewatin, to allow the children of William Chartier to be placed in the Guy Indian Residential School as non-grant-earning pupils.\n\nI presume from your letter that Mr. Chartier is not an Indian, and consequently his children would not be eligible for admission to an Indian residential school as grant-earning pupils. However, regarding the request to have them admitted as non-grant-earning pupils, similar applications have been received in the past and have always been refused. Many complications would result from having white children admitted to an Indian residential school. I feel it is unnecessary for me to outline what these complications would be, as I am certain they will readily suggest themselves to you. Taking everything into consideration, the Department regrets that we cannot see our way clear to grant Bishop Lajeunesse's request.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nCOPY SENT TO FATHER PLOURDE\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT ONZ.

They appeared very grateful about the Family Allowance. All complained regarding the Guy School at Sturgeon Landing. They wanted more education in the classroom and they wanted the children to receive a better training in cooking, sewing and in plain carpentering. They laughed at the idea of doing fretwork and said the boys should know how to make handles for tools and cut rafters and boards. They pointed out this was the kind of work they would be required to do and so they should have training along this line.\n\nThere is no day school; about 20 children go to the Guy School. There are perhaps 100 others who receive no education. A much larger number should be sent to the Guy School - certainly there should be no trouble in securing their full quota. Last year there was measles and whooping cough among the Indians when the children were supposed to go to School and many did not return. They were told very emphatically that all children enrolled must return and that other children must be sent so that the school is filled to capacity.\nThe Pas, Manitoba,\nAugust 1st, 1945.\n\nReport of 1945 Treaty Trip\n\nPelican Narrows\n\nDue partly to the number who have or are attending Guy and Lac la Ronge schools, this is becoming an increasingly easy reserve to handle.\n\nRobt.

F. Yule,\nMedical Supt., The Pas Agency.\n\nORIGINAL on File: 76-128\ndated 1st October/45.\n\n\"New Pupils - There are 30 new pupils in the school and only two or three had been examined on the Reserves. There were about half a dozen doubtful cases (chest) but as the Clinic was expected to come in from Cumberland the next week, I decided to leave them until its arrival. As it turned out the Clinic did not get in and three of these cases are now at Clearwater Lake Sanitorium. I expect to have at least three more before spring. However, the nurse in charge is very capable and I do not feel that the other children are being exposed to any unnecessary risk for as soon as symptoms develop she will send them in to The Pas.\"\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRE: Air Travel Expenses Summer 1945, for the Guy Indian Residential School.\n\nAttention: Mr. Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nEnclosed please find recruiting expenses for the year 1945, of the Guy Indian Residential School. Last year you paid part of these expenses and I hope that you will be able to do the same again.\n\nI well remember your remarks about the very unusual conditions prevailing at this school and the hope that you expressed that during the coming years, a reversion to the old method of travelling might be undertaken.\n\nThe Principal informs me in the letter covering this matter that water conditions are so bad that it is impossible for the parents of these Indian children to undertake to bring them to school by the old canoe method. The number of portages is so great that the expenses would be almost as high as air travel. Furthermore, the Principal advises me that as soon as water conditions favour a change to the old methods that he will certainly have recourse to them in his recruiting.\n\nUnder these circumstances I hope that you will do your best to pay as large a proportion as you can of the enclosed accounts.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.G.

(RG 10, Volume 6314, file 655-10, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nReport concerning AIR TRAVEL EXPENSES for children\nof the Guy Indian Residential School to and from their homes.\n\nIn 1941, when for the first time accounts were submitted to the Indian Affairs Branch for aeroplane transportation of children to and from school for their holidays, it aroused much surprise at Ottawa, and the hope was expressed by them that such expenditures would not have to be repeated. To the contrary, and notwithstanding the desire of the school authorities to avoid expenses that the Department could not approve and the payment of which they did not share, the air travel expenses for children have been steadily increasing from year to year, and while the accounts of 1941 showed the amount of $1225.00, the accounts of 1946 are showing the staggering figure of $3225.00. The Indian Affairs Branch will evidently and rightly look for an explanation; I shall try to give it by presenting the history of children transportation to this school, and comparing the present system of transportation with the other alternatives.\n\n* * * * *\n\n-Location of the school,\n-Canoe travelling,\n-Such travelling was made for other reasons than children:\n\nSturgeon Landing, Sask., was proposed as a good location for an Indian Residential School in the 1920s; it was certainly at the time a very reasonable choice. Sturgeon Landing was not indeed close to any of the Reserves it was intended to serve, but it was situated on the main road leading to all those reserves; Sturgeon Landing was truly then the Gateway of the North.\n\nFrom Pelican Narrows, South Reindeer Lake, Pakitawagan, canoes came every summer to get the supplies of the fur companies; those canoe trips were not then any shorter nor easier than they are now. From 100 to 400 miles one way, up and down rivers strewn with rapids, over long or steep or swampy portages numbering as many as forty on one trip, across lakes where wind and furious waves would hold them often for days on the shore, stormed by mosquitoes or drenched by heavy rains with only a light tent for protection, sweating by day and freezing by night, the Indian travellers bravely carried on their backs or took to the northern posts the supplies of the Hudson's Bay Company or other companies, on which depended their living for the following winter.\n\nThose freighters worked thus all summer and thought nothing of it because it was their livelihood: without those goods they would have nothing from the stores in the winter, and besides, they were paid for this canoe freighting. Therefore it was not asking too much of the Indians to add their children to the load in June and to bring them in their empty canoes in August. As long as they were given food supplies for the kids, they were just glad because their travelling expenses and their time were paid for from other sources anyhow.\n\nVery often indeed did the children arrive at school sick, after such trips where so much depends on the weather. When an Indian is travelling with his family, wife and children, he is not as a rule in a hurry and whenever the weather threatens, they pitch the tent and make everything comfortable as they can for the children, ready to wait until good conditions prevail; when men are travelling for freight, it is different; they do not like to stop unless it is really tough, because they are not usually supplied with food for any more than the average time required for this trip, and if they stop too long they will starve, and this happened more than once.\nSo hardship often resulting in sickness was encountered in those trips, and a great number of sick and dead during the first ten years of the school might well be traced back to those hardships of travel.\n\nSuch were in 1926 the transport \"facilities\" - if it is not mockery to call them so - for the children of the Guy School of Sturgeon Landing. In the circumstances they were indeed facilities, as experience was to prove.\n\n-Change of conditions with building of railway:\n\nAt the same time the school was being built in 1925-26, a much bigger enterprise was heading North, and that was to spell the end of Sturgeon Landing as the Gateway of the North. Flin Flon was developing and a railway was being built from The Pas to the new mining camp, soon to be a town; it was passing twenty three miles east of the school and the only access to it in summer was (and pretty well is yet) a difficult canoe route of thirty miles. If the actual developments of this region could have been foreseen then, it is doubtful whether Guy School would have been erected where it stands now.\n\nThe new railway opened up Flin Flon and Sherridon, bringing to an end the water transportation between The Pas and Sturgeon Landing, and between this place and the northern posts. The hitherto \"facilities\" of transportation described above vanished with the settlement and very few families of Indians and Halfbreeds were all that was left in Sturgeon Landing besides the school.\n\nThe water route of long ago always remained opened from Sturgeon Landing north, but who was to use it when there was no more freight to get and no more retribution for the hardwork of the trip? And soon there was to be no summer freight at all for the Indians, as the tractors from the mining centres were to reach all the Indian settlements of the region on winter roads.\n\nFrom Pelican Narrows, South End and North Reindeer Lake (Brochet) some Indians still volunteered to come as far as Sturgeon Landing for their children, but already the school had to pay more in food and other help to make sure that the Indians would keep coming. While there was no more freight from Sturgeon Landing, there was also work now in the North for the Indians who cared to work and the men would not undertake weeks of canoe travel without pay just for the sake of taking their children to school.\n\nFrom Pakitawagan the railroad provided some help to cover a great part of the distance. But Sturgeon Landing is 30 miles by water from the railroad and Pakitawagan from Sherridon is a two day canoe trip when conditions are at their very best: the wind on Cold Lake has often stopped the canoes for days at a time, and the same thing happened between the railroad and Sturgeon Landing on Goose Lake. So it meant organizing a flotilla of canoes from the school to the railroad and make sure that another flotilla would be at the other end of the rail to receive them, while there was no accommodation in Cold Lake for the children. It was often worse when the children were coming back; there had to be somebody from the school waiting for the children in Cold Lake (Sherridon) while a group of men and canoes had to wait at Goose Lake for an indefinite number of days. Everything taken into account, there was hardly anything to gain with the railroad.\n\nSo from all sides the expenses, time and trouble gone into for the transportation of the children, the dissatisfaction of the Indians and the dangers of all kinds for the pupils, the consequently increasing difficulties of recruiting, everything definitely called for a change and the plane was all indicated.\nFirst plane trips,\nCanoe vs plane:\n\nThe first plane trips for children were made in June 1940. In August many children came back by air too. This first trial proved satisfactory and in 1941 a few more trips were made, the accounts of which aroused the Department at the time.\n\nAn account in the thousand dollars for transportation of children had likely not been seen yet at the Indian Affairs, except maybe in the form of payment for the purchase of busses or trucks used for gathering up children or taking them home in some other schools.\n\nThis expense was startling at first sight, but further exploration of the question would show that the expense was not at all a new item nor a new figure in the list of disbursements.\n\n\"Transportation\", be it air transportation or other kind, had always been a burden to the school, especially since the canoe freighting had stopped; the $5 per 100 dollars contributed annually by the Branch specifically for the transportation of children was never more than a token retribution compared to the real expenses incurred therein, in the form of wages, gasoline, motors and canoes, food and clothing, a decreasing enrolment and the plain loss of children through sickness, some of those and other items not to be counted in dollars and cents.\n\nRight now it is generally admitted in this part of the country that to travel far the plane is still the cheapest way, -and the Indians themselves widely use it.\n\nThere are not here, like in other northern regions great water routes to afford easy and cheap communications from one place to the other. To make sure of that, I did not only look at the maps of the country, but since I have been appointed principal of this school, I have been out two summers, more than a month altogether, to see by canoe and all that was necessary, our children come from, and the description I have attempted above of the country and of canoe travelling is not only hearsay: it is sheer experience. I could have made the same trips by plane with less expense and in a much easier way, but then I would not have felt confident enough to present this plea in favor of plane transportation for our children.\n\nIncreasing accounts and why:\n\nThe aeroplane accounts have been going up though since the start, and this is due to several causes:\n1/ the rates of the flying companies have been raised;\n2/ their conditions have become onerous, v.g., as not to take so many children as before in one aircraft,-or refusing to make charter trips between regular schedule stops;\n3/ the proportion of children from places cared for by air has increased, so as to be the near totality now:105 this last August; so that higher fares and more children from far are the only explanation of the later accounts.\n\nContributions of the Branch:\n\nThe contribution of the Indian Affairs Branch to the transportation of children since the plane is used has been increasing too, as these figures show:\n\n| Year | Amount |\n|------|--------|\n| 1941 & 1942 | $100.00 |\n| 1943 | $150.00 |\n| 1944 | $450.00 |\n| 1945 | $550.00 |\n\nThe better interests of the school and of the Indians were evidently seen and I again take the opportunity to thank very sincerely the officers of the Branch for their more generous help in these later years.\nGreat sacrifices though have still to be made by the school or the church authorities who pay the major part of the children transportation. It is that much money that can not be spent otherwise for the benefit of the children, but with a school only half full the school finances would be still in a worse position.\n\nConclusion and request:\n\nAll governments insist so much nowadays on education that the actual opportunities of Guy School ought not to be left unemployed for lack of adequate means of transportation. The reason for plane transportation I hope I have made clear enough, and if Guy School is to remain opened to Indian children I beseech the authorities of the Indian Affairs Branch not to oppose this way of doing, which was forced upon us by circumstances herein explained.\n\nIf this report may cause the Indian Affairs Branch officials to admit and even to approve it is hoped, the actual method of transportation of children to Guy School, may they have the Branch assume a greater part if not all of the payment of the said transportation. The consequences of such a move, may they rest assured, would be all to the benefit of the children themselves whose welfare they so earnestly desire.\n\nRev. L.

Laurent Poirier,\nGuy Indian Res. School,\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nre Cecilia Jebb and Michael Jebb,\nApplication for admission.\n\nYou will find herewith the Application for Admission of Cecilia and Michael Jebb, sister and brother of Therese Jebb, already in this school, #0274, 13 yrs old.\n\nThe mother of these children, herself a former pupil of this school, has asked us to take care of her children, while she has been called for a stay in the Sanatorium. Cecilia is old enough to go to class and will likely stay with us even after her mother's recovery.\n\nMichael being too young will be returned to his mother if and when she goes back home. Though Michael's form is not completed on the Physical Examination side, he has been taken in the school only with the consent of our Medical Superintendent, Dr. R.F. Yule.\n\nDoctor Yule however has not deemed necessary to fill in the form since he thinks that the little boy's stay will only be temporary.\n\nSince the school is not quite full to capacity, I nevertheless ask the Indian Affairs Branch to officially admit Michael Jebb, so that he may be included in the Quarterly Return for the per capita allowance.\n\nIf it is your advice, I shall have the form normally completed at the next visit of the Doctor.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

On the total amount then of $3,225.00 the Indian Affairs Branch has refunded to us the sum of $1,500.00, for which I was most grateful.\n\nThe conditions which asked for these expenses have not changed, and therefore I submit these new accounts, which have already been paid by the R.C. Episcopla Corporation at The Pas, with the hope that a similar help may be extended to us once more. And why not express openly my confidence that eventually, through your sympathetic understanding of our difficulties, the Department will himself absorb more and more the payment of this extraordinary expenditure.\n\nYou will note that we have been able to carry a few passengers other than school children on these chartered trips and this has helped us to a certain amount.\n\nThe gross expense was... in June $1,575.00\nin Aug. 1,660.00\n3,235.00\n\nBy passengers accommodated, June $200.00\nAug 387.70\n587.70\n\nNet expenses $2,647.30\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

I have added a voucher as requested. The fact that you require these copies assure me that our case is being considered and is in good hands.\n\nI regret that the loss of the first accounts may be giving you more work, but I hope you will be able yet to help us.\n\nThanking you in advance,\n\nI remain yours truly,\n\nRev.

Please note, that the 35 pupils marked truant, are listed as being in residential quarters for 46 days. I might add that these children did not return to school this term, and are on their Reserves.\n\nAs all children went home this summer for June and July, returning August 15th, I cannot see how it can be stated that the school quarter has 92 days in it. The Principal of the school is away at present and will not return for sometime, so this matter cannot be taken up with him.\n\nI have signed this report but would appreciate advice as to how the first column in attendance section on this form is made up.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

Phelan.\nRe: Duration of School Year at the A.M.\nGuy Indian Residential School.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nReverend Father L. Poirier, O.M.I., Principal of the above school, says in a letter received today that the children of this school left for their homes by plane, on the 14-15-16- of June. The children returned on the 16th and 17th of August, as the 15th fell on a Sunday.\n\nStrictly speaking, it may be said that the children left on the 16th of June and returned on the 16th of August which would constitute the two months of vacation which they are allowed on the school reports. The leaving date was put down as June the 15th and the returning date was the 15th of August.\n\nReverend Father Poirier says that the Department wrote to him last year to find out why summer vacations were allowed on the dates mentioned above and adds that his answer to your letter must have been found satisfactory as neither your agent or your office wrote again about the subject.\n\nHoping that the above explanation will be found satisfactory,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nNovember 23, 1948.\n\nMr. E.

Though the number of children has increased at the school re-opening, I have been able to manage so that the air travel accounts did not increase in proportion.\n\nAir travel is becoming ever more common in this part of the country, so much that the Indians themselves coming out to the railroad hardly ever do so now in any other way than flying. The Indian Agents of The Pas and Prince Albert, the former one especially, and the Medical Superintendent of The Pas Agency, Dr. Yule, would be ready witnesses to this fact and to the conclusion that it is absolutely out of the question now to have the Indians bring their children by canoe for days and weeks of travel.\n\nYour financial aid in this respect, which amounted to $1500.00 for last year and the year before, was great help, since it covered about half of the total expenses. Since our own financial condition is worsening with the years, and since we were not included in the last augmentation of the per capita grant, may we hope this year to receive a still greater compensation for our air travel expenses on account of the children.\n\nI am leaving the whole thing to your sympathetic understanding of our conditions, and dare believe that we may see once more the effect of your devoted consideration,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. L. Poirier, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nOTTAWA, December 23rd, 1948.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention: Mr. P. Phelan.\nRe: Transportation accounts for the Children of Guy Indian Residential School.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nYou will find attached transportation accounts for the Children of the Guy Indian Residential School for the year 1948. These accounts comprise the expenses incurred last June and September. We hope that they will be paid in full, if it is at all possible to do so.\n\nI agree with what you have told me on several occasions regarding air transportation expenses in general, but I doubt if it applies in the present case. Last summer, I visited the Guy School for the first time and noticed the total absence of roads in that part of Manitoba and Saskatchewan. His Excellency Bishop Lajeunesse had to charter a special plane for my visit, at the cost of $600.00. I admit that I thought the charges were excessive but I was informed that the owner of the plane was undercharging all competitors for my trip. I therefore know that amounts paid by the principal of the Guy School are reasonable and should be accepted by the Department.\n\nSchools which have no transportation difficulties are certainly advantaged when compared to schools like the Guy, as the full grant can then be applied for the maintenance of the Institution.\n\nWishing you the compliments of the season,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, o.m.i.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nReference letter 132-7-10 (E.l.) of December 28, 1948 in connection with pupils approved by the Department for admittance in The Guy Indian Residential School.\n\nThe name of Jimmie Spence was included with others. Please be advised that Jimmie Spence does not come under the Jurisdiction of this agency, neither is he a pupil at The Guy Indian Residential School.\n\nE.S. Jones,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\n\nESJ/AG\n19th January, 1949.\n\nMr. E.

There had been indeed quite a mistake on my part when I sent you these forms. What happened is this: I had set one copy of every form apart from the other two I wanted to send to you, and I put in the envelope the wrong pile of papers. The ones I sent you were the less complete, and that is why I wanted to keep them for myself.\n\nThe same thing happened to the forms I sent to Prince Albert. Since they are asking for all three forms over there, I think I might as well send you all I have also regarding the children of your agency; so with the contents of this envelope and what you have already on hand, you should find three copies of all applications for admission. In many cases I received only one copy from the Reserves, and even then it did not always bear all the required signatures.\n\nI deeply regret this extra work my mistake has entailed for you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSgd. Rev. L. Poirier, O.M.I.,\nRev. L. Poirier, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nThe Pas, Manitoba,\nSeptember 23rd, 1949.\n\nI am enclosing herewith 22 Applications for Admission to the Guy Indian Residential School at Sturgeon Landing, Saskatchewan.\n\nThere are four of these applications which have not been witnessed, no witness being available. Also in several instances the duplicate copy is forwarded, as these copies contained the most information to complete same. I also enclose copy of Father Polrier's letter to Mr. Law explaining reason for this and trust that they will be accepted by the Department.\n\nMr. Law is at present on holidays and will not be returning until October 3rd and I did not wish to hold these up until his return. Mr. Law signed duplicates of these applications which did not have the parents signature and were returned for that reason.\n\nQ. P. Jackson\nfor E. Law,\nSuperintendent.\n\nQJ/DL\nMr. E.S.

Law,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nThe Pas, Man.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd instant, file 128-25-2, the Department approves the admission of the following children to the Guy Indian Residential School:\n\nAndre Bighetty, Marie Annie Dumas\nEdward Bighetty, Flora Hart\nLouis Bighetty Louise Highway\nMary Ann Bighetty Philippe Jose\nAnnie Denechezhe Angus Linklater\nLucia Denechezhe Fleurette Linklater\nMarie Adele Denechezhe Marie Elizabeth Linklater\nLeon Dettanikkeaze Eugenie McCellum\nJohn Dumas Veronique St. Pierre\nBernadette Tsannie Cecile Sha\"oulle\nEdward Tsannie Marguerite Tsannie\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith further reference to the boy, John Baptiste Dentouzie, referred to in my letter of the 24th instant, File 2279-25-2-171, enclosed is copy of a letter received from Mr. L.D. Ward, Assistant, Indian Agency, Stoney Rapids, Saskatchewan, of the Athabasca Indian Agency, in connection with this boy.\n\nIt would appear that there is a possibility that the information which Mr. Davis had obtained regarding the boy was incorrect, as he was informed that the father and mother left the boy, and that the father had since died. The information in Mr. Ward's letter is to the effect that the step-father and mother of the boy about whom Mr. Ward is writing, are both living at Stoney Rapids, but the step-father refuses to let the boy live with them. Assuming that this is correct, I would recommend that the Department take steps to have the necessary instructions go to Mr. Ward that he insist upon the mother and step-father supporting the boy, as the boy's mother's marriage to an Indian of another band gave her the right to live at the home of her husband, and certainly should not deprive her child of the same privilege.\n\nJ.P.B.

L. Porier, O.M.I.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nReference Departmental letter 655-10 (E.6) of\nAugust 23rd re: increase of pupilage for the Guy Indian\nResidential School. I am enclosing a letter received\nfrom Rev. Father Poirier outlining available dormitory\nspace. It will readily be seen that space will not allow\nfor an increase in the number of pupils based on the\nminimum requirements of 500 cu.ft. per pupil.\n\nFather Poirier has recently advised this office\nhe has 156 children in residence, a number of whom were\nsent in by the parents from distant points unsolicited by\nFather Poirier. The children mentioned came in by plane\nfrom the Brochet area, and as stated by Father Poirier, the\nplane was not returning to Brochet, consequently, he had no\nalternative but to keep the children.\n\nI am sure satisfactory arrangements will be made\nby the staff at this school to accommodate these additions.\nIt is my intention to visit the Residential School at\nSturgeon Landing in the near future at which time I intend\nto make a thorough inspection of the dormitories. If I find\nthat the sleeping quarters are over-crowded and the children\ncan not be accommodated adequately, I will immediately report\nto this effect on my return.\n\nE. S.

To the contrary, and notwithstanding the desire of the school authorities to avoid expenses that the Department would not approve and the payment of which it would not share, the air travel expenses for children have been steadily increasing from year to year, and while the accounts of 1941 showed the amount of $125.00, the accounts of 1946 are showing the staggering figure of $325.00. The Indian Affairs Branch will evidently and rightly look for an explanation; I shall try to give it by presenting the history of children transportation to this school, and comparing the present system of transportation with the other alternatives.\n\n* * * * *\n\n- Location of the school,\n- Canoe travelling,\n- Such travelling was made for other reasons than children:\n\nSturgeon Landing, Sask., was proposed as a good location for an Indian Residential School in the 1920s: it was certainly at the time a very reasonable choice. Sturgeon Landing was not indeed close to any of the Reserves it was intended to serve, but it was situated on the main road leading to all those reserves; Sturgeon Landing was truly then the Gateway of the North.\n\nFrom Pelican Narrows, South Reindeer Lake, Pakitawagan, canoes came every summer to get the supplies of the fur companies; those canoe trips were not then any shorter nor easier than they are now. From 100 to 400 miles one way, up and down rivers strewn with rapids, over long or steep or swampy portages numbering as many as forty on one trip, across lakes where wind and furious waves would hold them often for days on the shore, stormed by mosquitoes or drenched by heavy rains with only a light tent for protection, sweating by day and freezing by night, the Indian travellers bravely carried on their task of taking to the northern posts the supplies of the Hudson's Bay Company or other companies, on which depended their living for the following winter.\n\nThose freighters worked thus all summer and thought nothing of it because it was their livelihood; without those goods they would have nothing from the stores in the winter, and besides, they were paid for this canoe freighting. Therefore it was not asking too much of the Indians to add their children to the load in June and to bring them in their empty canoes in August. As long as they were given food supplies for the kids, they were just glad because their travelling expenses and their time were paid for from other sources anyhow.\n\nVery often indeed did the children arrive at school sick, after such trips where so much depends on the weather. When an Indian is travelling with his family, wife and children, he is not as a rule in a hurry and whenever weather threatens, they pitch the tent and make everything comfortable as they can for the children, ready to wait until good conditions prevail; when men are travelling for freight, it is different; they do not like to stop unless it is really tough, because they are not usually supplied with food for any more than the average time required for this trip, and if they stop too long they will starve, and this happened more than once.\nSo hardship often resulting in sickness was encountered in those trips, and a great number of sick and dead during the first ten years of the school might well be traced back to those hardships of travel.\n\nSuch were in 1926 the transport \"facilities\" -if it is not mockery to call them so- for the children of the Guy School of Sturgeon Landing. In the circumstances they were indeed facilities, as experience was to prove.\n\n-Change of conditions with building of railway:\n\nAt the same time the school was being built in 1925-26, a much bigger enterprise was heading North, and that was to spell the end of Sturgeon Landing as the Gateway of the North. Flin Flon was developing and a railway was being built from The Pas to the new mining camp, soon to be a town; it was passing twenty-three miles east of the school and the only access to it in summer was (and pretty well is yet) a difficult canoe route of thirty miles. If the actual developments of this region could have been foreseen then, it is doubtful whether Guy School would have been erected where it stands now.\n\nThe new railway opened up Flin Flon and Sherridon, bringing to an end the water transportation between The Pas and Sturgeon Landing, and between this place and the northern posts. The hitherto \"facilities\" of transportation described above vanished with the settlement and very few families of Indians and Halfbreeds were all that was left in Sturgeon Landing besides the school.\n\nThe water route of long ago always remained opened from Sturgeon Landing north, but who was to use it when there was no more freight to get and no retribution for the hardwork of the trip? And soon there was to be no summer freight at all for the Indians, as the tractors from the mining centres were to reach all the Indian settlements of the region on winter roads.\n\nFrom Pelican Narrows, South End and North Reindeer Lake (Brochet) some Indians still volunteered to come as far as Sturgeon Landing for their children, but already the school had to pay more in food and other help to make sure that the Indians would keep coming. While there was no more freight from Sturgeon Landing, there was also work now in the North for the Indians who cared to work and the men would not undertake weeks of canoe travel without pay just for the sake of taking their children to school.\n\nFrom Pakitawagan the railroad provided some help to cover a great part of the distance. But Sturgeon Landing is 30 miles by water from the railroad and Pakitawagan from Sherridon is a two day canoe trip when conditions are at their very best: the wind on Cold Lake has often stopped the canoes for days at a time, and the same thing happened between the railroad and Sturgeon Landing on Goose Lake. So it meant organizing a flotilla of canoes from the school to the railroad and make sure that another flotilla would be at the other end of the rail to receive them, while there was no accommodation in Cold Lake for the children. It was even worse when the children were coming back: there had to be somebody from the school waiting for the children in Cold Lake (Sherridon) while a group of men and canoes had to wait at Goose Lake for an indefinite number of days. Everything taken into account, there was hardly anything to gain with the railroad.\n\nSo from all sides the expenses, time and trouble gone into for the transportation of the children, the dissatisfaction of the Indians and the dangers of all kinds for the pupils, the consequently increasing difficulties of recruiting, everything definitely called for a change and the plane was all indicated.\nFirst plane trips,\nCanoe vs plane:\n\nThe first plane trips for children were made in June 1940. In August many children came back by air too. This first trial proved satisfactory and in 1941 a few more trips were made, the accounts of which aroused the Department at the time.\n\nAn account in the thousand dollars for transportation of children had likely not been seen yet at the Indian Affairs, except maybe in the form of payment for the purchase of busses or trucks used for gathering up children or taking them home in some other schools.\n\nThe expense was startling at first sight, but further exploration of the question would show that the expense was not at all a new item nor a new figure in the list of disbursements. \"Transportation\" be it air transportation or other kind, had always been a burden to the school, especially since the canoe freighting had stopped; the 75 or 100 dollars contributed yearly by the Branch specifically for the transportation of children was never more than a token retribution compared to the real expenses incurred therein, in the form of wages, gasoline, motors and canoes, food and clothing, a decreasing enrolment and the plain loss of children through sickness, some of those and other items not to be counted in dollars and cents.\n\nRight now it is generally admitted in this part of the country that to travel far the plane is still the cheapest way, -and the Indians themselves widely use it.\n\nThere are not here, like in other northern regions great water routes to afford easy and cheap communications from one place to the other. To make sure of that, I did not only look at the maps of the country, but since I have been appointed principal of this school, I have been out two summers, more than a month altogether, to go by canoe into all but one of the reserves our children come from, and the description I have attempted above of the country and of canoe travelling is not only hearsay: it is sheer experience. I could have made the same trips by plane with less expense and in a much easier way, but then I would not have felt confident enough to present this plea in favor of plane transportation for our children.\n\nIncreasing accounts and why:\n\nThe aeroplane accounts have been going up though since the start, and this is due to several causes:\n1/ the rates of the flying companies have been raised;\n2/ their conditions have become onerous, v.g., as not to take so many children as before in one aircraft, or refusing to make charter trips between regular schedule stops;\n3/ the proportion of children from places cared for by air has increased, so as to be the near totality now: 103 this last August; so that higher fares and more children from far are the only explanation of the later accounts.\n\nContributions of the Branch:\n\nThe contribution of the Indian Affairs Branch to the transportation of children since the plane is used has been increasing too, as these figures show:\n\n| Year | Amount |\n|------|--------|\n| 1941 | $100.00 |\n| 1942 | $150.00 |\n| 1943 | $450.00 |\n| 1944 | $550.00 |\n\nThe better interests of the school and of the Indians were evidently seen and I again take the opportunity to thank very sincerely the officers of the branch for their more generous help in these later years.\nGreat sacrifices though have still to be made by the school or the church authorities who pay the major part of the children transportation. It is that much money that can not be spent otherwise for the benefit of the children but with a school only half full the school finances would be still in a worse position.\n\nConclusion and request:\n\nAll governments insist so much nowadays on education that the actual opportunities of Guy School ought not to be left unemployed for lack of adequate means of transportation. The reason for plane transportation I hope I have made clear enough, and if Guy School is to remain opened to Indian children I beseech the authorities of the Indian Affairs Branch not to oppose this way of doing, which was forced upon us by circumstances herein explained.\n\nIf this report may cause the Indian Affairs Branch officials to admit and even to approve, it is hoped, the actual method of transportation of children to Guy School, may they have the Branch assume a greater part if not all of the payment of the said transportation. The consequences of such a move, may they rest assured, would be all to the benefit of the children themselves whose welfare they so earnestly desire.\n\nRev. L.

Cecilia is old enough to go to class and will likely stay with us even after her mother's recovery.\n\nMichael being too young will be returned to his mother if and when she goes back home. Though Michael's form is not completed on the Physical Examination side, he has been taken in the school only with the consent of our Medical Superintendent, Dr. R.F. Yule.\n\nDoctor Yule however has not deemed necessary to fill in the form since he thinks that the little boy's stay will only be temporary.\n\nSince the school is not quite full to capacity, I nevertheless ask the Indian Affairs Branch to officially admit Michael Jebb, so that he may be included in the Quarterly Return for the per capita allowance.\n\nIf it is your advice, I shall have the form normally completed at the next visit of the Doctor.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

On the total amount then of $3,225.00 the Indian Affairs Branch has refunded to us the sum of $1,500.00, for which I was most grateful.\n\nThe conditions which asked for these expenses have not changed, and therefore I submit these new accounts, which have already been paid by the R.C. Episcopal Corporation at The Pas, with the hope that a similar help may be extended to us once more. And why not express openly my confidence that eventually, through your sympathetic understanding of our difficulties, the Department will himself absorb more and more the payment of this extraordinary expenditure.\n\nYou will note that we have been able to carry a few passengers other than school children on these chartered trips and this has helped us to a certain amount.\n\nThe gross expense was...in June $1,575.00\nin Aug. 1,660.00\n3,235.00\n\nBy passengers accommodated, June $200.00\nAug 387.70\n587.70\n\nNet expenses $2,647.30\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

I have added a voucher as requested. The fact that you require these copies assure me that our case is being considered and is in good hands.\n\nI regret that the loss of the first accounts may be giving you more work, but I hope you will be able yet to help us.\n\nThanking you in advance,\n\nI remain yours truly,\n\nRev.

Neary\n\nDear Sir:\n\nGuy Indian Residential School Quarterly Report for quarter ending September 30th enclosed. Please note, that the 35 pupils marked truant, are listed as being in residential quarters for 46 days. I might add that these children did not return to school this term, and are on their Reserves.\n\nAs all children went home this summer for June and July, returning August 15th, I cannot see how it can be stated that the school quarter has 92 days in it. The Principal of the school is away at present and will not return for sometime, so this matter cannot be taken up with him.\n\nI have signed this report but would appreciate advice as to how the first column in attendance section on this form is made up.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. Law,\nSupt. Indian Agency.\nOTTAWA, November 13th, 1948.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention: Mr. P. Phelan.\nRe: Duration of School Year at the Guy Indian Residential School.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nReverend Father L. Poirier, O.M.I., Principal of the above school, says in a letter received today that the children of this school left for their homes by plane, on the 14-15-16th of June. The children returned on the 16th and 17th of August, as the 15th fell on a Sunday.\n\nStrictly speaking, it may be said that the children left on the 16th of June and returned on the 16th of August which would constitute the two months of vacation which they are allowed on the school reports. The leaving date was put down as June the 15th and the returning date was the 15th of August.\n\nReverend Father Poirier says that the Department wrote to him last year to find out why summer vacations were allowed on the dates mentioned above and adds that his answer to your letter must have been found satisfactory as neither your agent or your office wrote again about the subject.\n\nHoping that the above explanation will be found satisfactory,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nNovember 23, 1948.\n\nMr. E. Law,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nWe have received your letter of October 15th with reference to the September quarter return of the Guy Residential School.\n\nPlease note that the return requires the principal to show the number of days in the quarter. That means that on the March quarter return he shows 90 days, on the June quarter 91 days, on the September quarter 92 days and on the December quarter 92 days.\n\nThe return as prepared by the principal was correct. Attached is a copy of a circular letter regarding the preparation of the quarterly return and I would also direct your attention to the instructions contained on the quarterly return form.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Education Division.\n\nPP/MGD\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSeptember 26, 1948\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Guy Indian Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: Suzette Cursiteur\nEnglish name:\nAge: April 19, 1941\nName of Band: Pelican Narrows (Peter Ballantyne)\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid:\nFather's full name and No.: Antoine Cursiteur\nMother's full name and No.: Suzanne Siwap\nParents living or dead: living\nState of child's health: good\nReligion: Roman Catholic\nDoes applicant speak English?: no\nPreviously attended: no school for years\n\n(Signature of father)\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\n*Signature of Missionary or other Witness*\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.*\n\nNOTE\u2014If mother or guardian signs, agent must forward full explanatory note.\n\nI recommend the admission of the above child, who is of good moral character and is eligible to be admitted as a grant-earning pupil.\n\nFORM No. 1-A 406\n\nR 2788\n\nNote\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

Though the number of children has increased at the school re-opening, I have been able to manage so that the air travel accounts did not increase in proportion.\n\nAir travel is becoming ever more common in this part of the country, so much that the Indians themselves coming out to the railroad hardly ever do so now in any other way than flying. The Indian Agents of The Pas and Prince Albert, the former one especially, and the Medical Superintendent of The Pas Agency, Dr. Yule, would be ready witnesses to this fact and to the conclusion that it is absolutely out of the question now to have the Indians bring their children by canoe for days and weeks of travel.\n\nYour financial aid in this respect, which amounted to $1500.00 for last year and the year before, was great help, since it covered about half of the total expenses. Since our own financial condition is worsening with the years, and since we were not included in the last augmentation of the per capita grant, may we hope this year to receive a still greater compensation for our air travel expenses on account of the children.\n\nI am leaving the whole thing to your sympathetic understanding of our conditions, and dare believe that we may see once more the effect of your devoted consideration,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. L. Poirier, C.M.,\n\nPrincipal.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention: Mr. P. Phelan.\nRe: Transportation accounts for the Children of Guy Indian Residential School.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nYou will find attached transportation accounts for the Children of the Guy Indian Residential School for the year 1948. These accounts comprise the expenses incurred last June and September. We hope that they will be paid in full, if it is at all possible to do so.\n\nI agree with what you have told me on several occasions regarding air transportation expenses in general, but I doubt if it applies in the present case. Last summer, I visited the Guy School for the first time and noticed the total absence of roads in that part of Manitoba and Saskatchewan. His Excellency Bishop Lajeunesse had to charter a special plane for my visit, at the cost of $600.00. I admit that I thought the charges were excessive but I was informed that the owner of the plane was undercharging all competitors for my trip. I therefore know that amounts paid by the principal of the Guy School are reasonable and should be accepted by the Department.\n\nSchools which have no transportation difficulties are certainly advantaged when compared to schools like the Guy, as the full grant can then be applied for the maintenance of the Institution.\n\nWishing you the compliments of the season,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, o.m.i.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nReference letter 132-7-10 (E.l.) of December 28, 1948 in connection with pupils approved by the Department for admittance in The Guy Indian Residential School.\n\nThe name of Jimmie Spence was included with others. Please be advised that Jimmie Spence does not come under the jurisdiction of this agency, neither is he a pupil at The Guy Indian Residential School.\n\nE.S. Jones,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\n\nESJ/AG\n19th January, 1949.\n\nMr. E. Law,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nThe Department approves the admission of Emile Moose to the Guy Residential School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\n19th January, 1949.\n\nMr. E.S. Jones,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nPrince Albert, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant we regret that the name of Jimmie Spence was included in our letter of 28th December, 1948.

Yule, M.D.\n\nAug 29\nMr. Eric Law,\nSupt Indian Agency,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received this week without any accompanying letter most of the Applications for Admission which you were returning to me. There had been indeed quite a mistake on my part when I sent you these forms. What happened is this: I had set one copy of every form apart from the other two I wanted to send to you, and I put in the envelope the wrong pile of papers. The ones I sent you were the less complete, and that is why I wanted to keep them for myself.\n\nThe same thing happened to the forms I sent to Prince Albert. Since they are asking for all three forms over there, I think I might as well send you all I have also regarding the children of your agency; so with the contents of this envelope and what you have already on hand, you should find three copies of all applications for admission. In many cases I received only one copy from the Reserves, and even then it did not always bear all the required signatures.\n\nI deeply regret this extra work my mistake has entailed for you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSgd. Rev. L. Poirier, G.M.I.\nRev. L. Poirier, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nI am enclosing herewith 22 Applications for Admission to the Guy Indian Residential School at Sturgeon Landing, Saskatchewan.\n\nThere are four of these applications which have not been witnessed, no witness being available. Also in several instances the duplicate copy is forwarded, as these copies contained the most information to complete same. I also enclose copy of Father Poirier's letter to Mr. Law explaining reason for this and trust that they will be accepted by the Department.\n\nMr. Law is at present on holidays and will not be returning until October 3rd and I did not wish to hold these up until his return. Mr. Law signed duplicates of these applications which did not have the parents signature and were returned for that reason.\n\nQ. P. Jackson\nfor E.

Law,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nThe Pas, Man.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd instant, file 128-25-2, the Department approves the admission of the following children to the Guy Indian Residential School:\n\nAndre Bighetty, Marie Annie Dumas\nEdward Bighetty, Flora Hart\nLouis Bighetty Louise Highway\nMary Ann Bighetty Philippe Jose\nAnnie Denecheze Angus Linklater\nLucia Denecheze Fleurette Linklater\nMarie Adele Denecheze Marie Elizabeth Linklater\nLeon Dettanikkeaze Eugenie McCallum\nJohn Dumas Veronique St. Pierre\nBernadette Tsannie Cecile Sha\"oullie\nEdward Tsannie Marguerite Tsannie\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith further reference to the boy, John Baptiste Dentouzie, referred to in my letter of the 24th instant, File 2279-25-2-171, enclosed is copy of a letter received from Mr. L.D. Ward, Assistant, Indian Agency, Stoney Rapids, Saskatchewan, of the Athabasca Indian Agency, in connection with this boy.\n\nIt would appear that there is a possibility that the information which Mr. Davis had obtained regarding the boy was incorrect, as he was informed that the father and mother left the boy, and that the father had since died. The information in Mr. Ward's letter is to the effect that the step-father and mother of the boy about whom Mr. Ward is writing, are both living at Stoney Rapids, but the step-father refuses to let the boy live with them. Assuming that this is correct, I would recommend that the Department take steps to have the necessary instructions go to Mr. Ward that he insist upon the mother and step-father supporting the boy, as the boy's mother's marriage to an Indian of another band gave her the right to live at the home of her husband, and certainly should not deprive her child of the same privilege.\n\nJ.P.B.

I am enclosing a letter received from Rev. Father Poirier outlining available dormitory space. It will readily be seen that space will not allow for an increase in the number of pupils based on the minimum requirements of 500 cu.ft. per pupil.\n\nFather Poirier has recently advised this office he has 156 children in residence, a number of whom were sent in by the parents from distant points unsolicited by Father Poirier. The children mentioned came in by plane from the Brochet area, and as stated by Father Poirier, the plane was not returning to Brochet, consequently, he had no alternative but to keep the children.\n\nI am sure satisfactory arrangements will be made by the staff at this school to accommodate these additions. It is my intention to visit the Residential School at Sturgeon Landing in the near future at which time I intend to make a thorough inspection of the dormitories. If I find that the sleeping quarters are over-crowded and the children cannot be accommodated adequately, I will immediately report to this effect on my return.\n\nE. S.

It will be noted that the boy is a member of the Barren Land's Band (Manitoba). There was some considerable difficulty in identifying the boy when the matter was first brought to my attention by Mr. Ward, and although it is now disclosed that he is a Manitoba Indian child, I presume it is as well for the completion of the formal admission of the boy to the Beauval School to be carried out through this office.

Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith regard to my Christmas Present, John Baptiste Dentouzie, I just got a letter from Father Darveau, from Brochet, Man., stating John Baptiste's Guardian is reclaiming the boy this summer. The Guardian's name is Louis Deneganaze, from Brochet.\n\nI do not know if you have any objection to let John Baptiste have his Summer holidays and may be let him have the choice to go to Sturgeon Landing School, as he will be with his own band there.\n\nAs for me, it will be very hard to keep him this Summer as the brother in charge of the boys will take a well deserved holiday. So I would prefer not to keep him during the Summer.\n\nFor your information, I am very glad to report that John Baptiste is doing very fine here and is now getting along very good with the other boys. He is fond of hockey and ball, but unfortunately he is unable to play at the present time. He has sore feet. If he does not get well soon, I will have to take him to the hospital.\n\nRegarding his plane fare to Brochet, I suppose the Department will take care of that?\n\nOn May 19th, the school children will give a concert at 3.30 P.M. for the patients in the San, C.K.B.I. will broadcast it and they mention \"It is very good\".\n\nHoping for the best in the next future.\n\nYours very truly, Sgd. F.X. Gagnon, Principal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nPlease refer to Department Letter dated February 7th, 1950, File 655-10 (EL), regarding John Baptiste Dentouzie, who was placed in the Beauval Indian Residential School on December 22nd, 1949.\n\nEnclosed is copy of a letter today received from Reverend Father F.X. Gagnon, O.M.I., Principal of the Beauval Indian Residential School. Father Gagnon reports that he has received a letter from Father Darveau, Missionary at Brochet, Manitoba, stating that John Baptiste Dentouzie's guardian is reclaiming the boy this summer. The guardian's name is Louis Deneganaze, of Brochet.\n\nAt the urgent request of Mr. L.D. Ward, Assistant, Indian Agency, Stony Rapids, the boy was placed in the Beauval School, as Mr. Ward stated that the boy's mother and stepfather refused to keep him, and it was considered necessary for his welfare to place him in an Indian residential school.\n\nAt that time it was practically impossible to have the boy placed in the Guy School, at Sturgeon Landing, as there was no plane transportation direct between the two points, and there was no other method of travel.\n\nAs it now appears from Father Gagnon's letter that Louis Deneganaze is an uncle of the boy, and is willing to accept responsibility for him, I think the boy should be returned by plane to Brochet to be in charge of Louis Deneganaze, and not returned to the Beauval School for the beginning of the next term. If he is to attend residential school it would be better for him to be admitted to the Guy Indian Residential School, at Sturgeon Landing.\n\nIt will be noted that.....\nIt will be noted that Father Gagnon advises it will be difficult to keep the boy at the Beauval School for the summer as the brother in charge of the boys will be away for a holiday, and there will be no one to take care of him. He was reported to be very difficult to handle, and was so when first admitted to the Beauval School, but has not given much trouble recently.\n\nI would recommend that the Department approve sending the boy by plane from Beauval to Brochet, at the expense of the Department, and that a telegram be sent direct to Reverend Father Gagnon from the Department authorizing the same.\n\nJ.P.B.
