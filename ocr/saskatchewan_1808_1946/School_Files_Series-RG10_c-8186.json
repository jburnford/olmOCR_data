Mr. Ross drove there yesterday and found out cause of complaint. The roof of the school-house appears to have been leaking and the teacher told him that she had to place pans around the room to catch the water coming through the ceiling which resulted in opening up the latter and then with the extreme heat of the stove of shrinking the timber up again. This also caused the spots on the paint which look very badly. However we will send men down to repair ceiling and repaint all in one coat but in doing so you will have to protect the roof.\n\nRe the protection of the roof \u2014 as we have the size of the building and can give you cost of same we beg to herewith submit quotation. We will shingle same with best Cedar shingles laid on felt 4/2\" to weather with saddle boards flushing\nMR. J. D.

This you will understand could no doubt be done cheaper if the place were more convenient.\n\nShould you decide to repair roof we will go down either next Saturday or the week following to repair the ceiling\u2014 before the ice breaks up.\n\nYours very truly\n\nDict.

However, in conversation with Miss E. L. Halligan former teacher and Miss M. White the present teacher, I find the roof had leaked in two spots and both within a space of about 3 square feet, hence I am at a loss to see how that could affect the entire work. The roof only looked over six inches while damp.\n\nI am of the opinion that Ross & Co. should not be paid for same.\n\nThe shingling seems to be all right but I could not see it all as it was partly covered with snow on Monday last.\n\nJ.

Daillon,\nAgent.\nOttawa, April 26, 1912.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nReferring to your account for $21.22 for repairs to the interior woodwork of the St. Regis Island School-house I beg to say that a letter has been received from the Indian Agent in reference to this account, in which he states that both the former and the present teacher inform him that the roof did leak in two places, but both within a space of about three square feet. Such being the case it is not seen how the generally inferior condition of the interior woodwork could be due to the leaking of the roof, in fact, Miss White, the present teacher, states that the roof only leaked on one occasion since she took charge on the first of October, last. The Agent is of opinion that the checking was possibly owing to lumber that was not sufficiently dried being used.\n\nIn view of this report the Department does not consider that it should be called upon to reimburse you for the expenditure incurred in making this job good.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMessrs.

The present teacher represented to me (the writer) the exact nature of leakage in roof of school house as written you; as for the ceiling this too was in the condition stated in our favor of the lst. ultimo. Now we do not ask the Government to assume any responsibility that should be ours and under the circumstances we feel justified in our request. You can readily recognize how quickly a ceiling in wood would bulge and spring from a leakage of this kind\u2014and the writer thinks that the ceiling must have been in a state of dampness right along owing to the condition in which he found the roof, however if you still feel that our claim is not a just one that ends it. We may say further that had the writer not made a personal\nexamination of this work we might not have been so confident regarding this matter, we are\n\nYours very truly,\n\nROSS & CO.\n\nDICT.

I would suggest that the floor remain as it is for the next school year, and in the meantime arrangements made for the erection of a new school.\n\nRegarding a few about school lot, I know very well where it is and could attached to this school; there is only the site on which it stands.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAttorney, West.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. E. Maclean,\nAgent.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the St. Regis Island Day School, Sept. 14, 1920. Original on 151936-6\n\nSome repairs on the building are urgently needed. The outhouses are in poor condition and the floor of the school room is bulged in the middle, making it difficult to walk over it.\n\nA. Luther Gilman,\nInsp.\nOttawa, November 5, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Gilman, in his report on his recent inspection of the St. Regis Island Indian Day School, states that some repairs to the building are urgently needed. He states the outhouses are in poor condition and the floor of the school-room is bulged in the middle, making it difficult to walk over.\n\nYou should arrange to have the outhouses cleaned and put in good condition and any minor repairs required should be attended to. You should give this matter your early attention. The expense in the matter should be as low as possible. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of having the closets cleaned and the repairs made should be forwarded.\n\nWith reference to the floor of the school-room I have to request that you will be good enough to furnish a report as to the cost of having the same repaired. You should also give this matter your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. E.

You should state the approximate cost of the material and labour required in rebuilding the chimney, repairing the foundation and floor, and in making any other repairs that are required. You should also state what arrangements you can make to have the above repairs carried out. The Department prefers, if possible, that the work be done by day labour under the charge of a competent foreman, you to purchase all material and see that the work is satisfactorily performed.\n\nRegarding the coal shed, you should state the size, the quantity of material required and the cost of the same, as well as the labour.\n\nWe will await your report giving the above information which should be furnished as soon as possible after the school closes for the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Plasticine, blue, red, green and mauve, one pound of each.\n\nOne school-room, eight day clock.\n\nWith reference to the clock, I beg to say, that there is a Big Ben Clock at this school, but is out of commission, and is not worth repairing. A good reliable eight day clock, can be purchased at Cornwall, Ont. for $8.00 or $10.00, and which I consider is far ahead, than purchasing a Big Ben, which costs $4.50 or $5.00.\n\nI visited above school on October, 28th. The school appears to be running in good order. The attendance is good, with twenty two pupils on the register. All classes are progressing nicely, and a marked advancement is noticed. Mr. Chisholm teacher, reports, that the attendance is regular, with the exception of pupils absent due to sickness.\n\nWith reference to vaccinating, I may say that there are three children attending above school, who are not vaccinated, also six children who were vaccinated, about a year ago, that the vaccine did not take effect. I intend making arrangements with Dr. Gardner, of Cornwall, Ont. to visit this school, and vaccinate the children who are not vaccinated.\n\nI am,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, November 2, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, relative to the school room clock and plasticine required for the use of the Cornwall Island Indian Day School.\n\nIn connection with the plasticine, I have to say that an order will be placed with the Government Stationery Office to send to the teacher's address the quantity of this material required. You may incur an expenditure not exceeding approximately the sum of $10 in the purchase of a reliable eight-day clock and have same delivered at the school. Please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nIt is noted that the work in the classroom is making progress.\n\nWe note that you will arrange with Dr. Gardner to visit this school and vaccinate any children who were not vaccinated previously.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

MacGibbon\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nEXTRACT FROM AGENT McGIBBON ON ST. REGIS ISLAND SCHOOL.\n\nThe foundation in this building requires repairs. Stone work is in poor shape; loose and falling away in different places.\nOttawa, March 19, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your report on the St. Regis Island Indian Day School for the month of February, last, regarding the condition of the foundation of the school building, I have to request that you will forward a full report as to the work required in placing this foundation in a satisfactory condition. You should state how you would propose having the work carried out, giving an approximate estimate of the cost of any material required in having the work done. When we have this information, consideration will be given to authorizing having the necessary repairs carried out when weather conditions permit this coming Spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. A. MacGibbon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, P.Q.\nSt. Regis Island Indian Day School.\n\nThe foundation under this school is entirely done. In many places there is no foundation at all. To place this building in shape a new foundation is required, of stone or cement. I would consider cement the best, and almost as cheap. The building should be raised about fifteen inches from the ground. I consulted Mr. Thompson, caretaker of this school, about two weeks ago with respect to this work. Thompson promised to let me know, but has not to date. I expect due to the river breaking up and clearing of ice. As to the cost of this work, I would say that between $70.00 and $80.00 would complete the job. Perhaps Thompson's figure may be lower than that. This is an old building, but by putting a good foundation under it the building would serve for some years yet.\nOttawa, April 16, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 10th instant regarding the repairs required to the foundation of the St. Regis Indian Day School building, I have to say that the Department will approve of your arranging to have this work carried out.\n\nYou may arrange to have the building raised approximately 15 inches from the ground, and a new cement foundation placed under same. You should see that the services of a competent man are engaged to carry out this work; you to purchase the cement and other material required.

St. Regis Island School should be painted, exterior, also the shed at this school, which was newly built in 1929, should be painted.\n\nThese outside jobs could be done by Indians of the reserve. Work is very scarce for Indians of St. Regis reserve, and by giving some painting jobs, would help out some families who are in rather close circumstances.\nOttawa, May 13, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to redecorating and repairing the Chetlain, St. Regis Village and St. Regis Island Indian Day Schools.\n\nIn reply I have to say that our appropriation for the current fiscal year has been considerably reduced, and it is necessary to limit our expenditures to the work absolutely essential.

The clapboards are loose and split, the shingles on the roof are in very poor condition, some holes showing, the windows are loose in poor frames, the boarded walls of the interior are full of knots which show through the faded paint.\n\nThis building should be re-clapboarded or stuccoed, the windows and frames repaired or new ones put in, the roof reshingled. The wall within a cupboard built underneath the chimney requires plastering.\n\nA few hundred dollars spent on this building would result in an improved building but probably the Department would consider the construction of a new school building, if funds were available.\n\nI hesitate to recommend the spending of too much money on this old building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 26th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant, the Department is not prepared to authorize any heavy expenditure on repairs to the St. Regis Island Indian Day School.\n\nPlease let me know the approximate cost of doing what is absolutely necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

These heaters had a cast iron fire-box. Already the heater in the Sr. Room of the village school has had to be replaced and a similar situation has arisen at St. Regis Ild. The cast firebox has become cracked in several places and while it has been patched up on different occasions I fear that this will not serve much longer as new breaks are showing.\n\nI would ask authority to purchase a new heater, if such is obtainable, and if not, that permission be given without delay for the purchase of a rebuilt heater.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa,\nNovember 30, 1942.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMr. D.P.

Welfare & Training.\n\nAn inspection of the St. Regis Isl. Day School discloses that the following urgent repairs are required as well as materials listed.\n\nThe window sash is in such a state of decay that they will no longer hold the glass in place; new window frames are needed as well, as the building is very old and it is impossible to install new sash in the old frames which are reminiscent of the \"square nail era\". The fact that storm windows were never on this school has not helped matters any and these should be supplied as well. The building has a cement casement around it with no air outlet with the result that, so far as is visible, the north end of the school is sagging due to dewayed sills. The recent earthquake, of course, has provided many air outlets in the cement casing and has not helped in the general condition of the building. The floor needs repairs as the centre is convexed to a point about II inches. A new chimney will have to be built.\n\nI am not aware whether or not it is the Department's intention to build a new school on St. Regis Island. One is badly needed and has been for a number of years. I would like to have your opinion on this school as I hesitate to make such repairs if it is the intention to construct a new school in the very near future. If such is not the intention however, these repairs will have to be made this Fall. I would like to know your intention by return mail as the windows and frames will have to be made at the factory and I am going to have a hard time getting the order through. If too much delay is not experienced I believe I can get a carpenter locally to do the work, i.e., installing frames, etc., and raising the N.end of the building and putting in a new sill. A list is enclosed showing our requirements for above.\n\nT.L. Bonnah, Agent.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 21, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMr. T.L. Bonnah, Indian Agent, St. Regis, Que.\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to the condition of the St. Regis Island School. It is impossible for me, at the present time, to give a definite reply to your question regarding the erection of a new school. However, we have noted the necessity for a new building at this point. In order that the work may be done before the cold weather the Department approves local purchase of the articles shown on the attached requisition. It is noted from the latter part of your letter that you are able to secure a carpenter to do the work.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nReceived from T. L.

REGIS INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OCTOBER, 1944.\n\nConsiderable repairs are being made at the St. Regis Island Day School. New windows and window frames are being installed complete with storm windows and a new chimney has been built. Previously, no storm windows were on this school, with the result that the fixed windows had been so weatherbeaten that they would no longer hold the lights. The old chimney which was constructed in the interior of the building and had become unsafe due to the earthquake, was torn down and the new chimney erected on the exterior. Repairs were also made to the floor of the classroom to remove a disconcerting hump. It is hoped that through this operation, both teacher and students will be able in future to maintain a more even keel. It was necessary, to replace the sills at the rear of the building, as between dry rot and the squirrels, very little of the old sill was left. It seems reasonable to assume that when repairs are completed, the building should be at least 80% warmer.\n\nTo provide some recreational facilities for the children in the village, some ploughing and levelling was done so that we could operate a skating rink this year. A small amount of sports equipment has been purchased to date.\n\nT.L.

REGIS ISLAND SCHOOL\n\nA very old building, sills in very bad shape and should be replaced as well as the floor.\nOttawa, June 25, 1945.\n\nMr. T. L. Bonnah, Indian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\n\nInspector Thibault has reported\nthat the sills and the floor of the St. Regis\nIsland Indian Day School should be replaced.\n\nI realize this is an old\nbuilding, but at the same time you know that\nit is impossible to erect a new one this year.\nWould it be possible to carry out the repairs\nsuggested by Inspector Thibault? If so, you\nshould obtain an estimate of the cost and let\nme know if you can have the work done during\nthe summer holidays.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nI wish to refer to your letter of June 23 regarding Inspector Thibault's report on the condition of the St. Regis Island Indian Day School.\n\nI am quite in agreement with the Inspector's recommendation, but to replace the sills and floor of this school will require considerable amount of work and material. As stated in your letter, this is a very old building and it is difficult to say just what trouble we will run into when we start to raise the building. As you know, last year we put in new windows and storm sashes and also built a new chimney on the outside, and had some repairs made to the floor. Due to the impossibility of obtaining skilled help for this kind of a job, the work will have to be left in abeyance. Again, there is very little use in going to such an expense as outlined in your letter unless the entire building is sheeted on the outside as well. If it is the intention to continue using this school, then as soon as help, materials, and money are available, the inside of the building could be sheeted with Ten-Test and painted, a new floor laid, new sills under the building, and the building jacked up on a foundation, and have the outside sheeted with featheredge. We would then have as good a school as we could possibly want with the small attendance on that island.\n\nT. L.

In this connection I might point out that the teachers' residence comprises two rooms in a private home on St. Regis Island. It is, at present, heated by a very small Leroy cook stove. This stove is too small to hold a coal fire until the teacher gets home from school with the result that the place is quite often cold. I think that to put a larger stove in such a small place would be going to extremes. Some months ago I discussed this matter with Mr. Doucet and suggested that a 3-burner Perfection oil stove with an oven be supplied for cooking purposes. Also that a small capacity oil burner (Duo-Therm or otherwise) be supplied to be used in case of necessity. Under this way the heating requirements would be taken care of and the temperature could be controlled according to the wishes of the teacher. There is a possibility that a type of heating and cooking combination oil stove exists and if so, possibly this would suffice. Also it might be possible to install burners in the present cook stove. You might advise me in this regard.\n\nRegarding the requisition for the St. Regis School Junior and Senior Rooms, articles are requested for sewing classes and an allowance of $30.00 for materials under the heading of Domestic Science. I am given to understand that more stress will be placed upon this phase of education in the coming year. There are also some articles I have ticked off in the pencil which may not be considered as necessities. No doubt the chest of drawers could be made good use of for storage purposes.\n\nT. L. Bonnah,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 28, 1946.\n\nMr. T.L. Bonnah, Indian Agent, P.O. Box 957,\nCornwall, Ontario.\n\nYour communication of May 10th has been referred to me for comment and answer.\n\nYou refer to the St. Regis Island School and state that there is a small Leroy cook stove. Due to the fact that the apartment is small and should not be cluttered up with heating apparatus, I would suggest that you obtain an oil unit that would fit in the cook stove. I just wonder whether or not the Leroy would have a sufficient firebox capacity to provide for a two burner. This, I believe, would supply sufficient heat for the two rooms and at the same time provide for cooking. I wish that you would inquire in Cornwall and find out whether or not the Leroy is suitable for this transformation. You might at the same time inquire as to the cost of such a transformation.\n\nA.J.

As matters on the St Regis Reserve have quieted down to a considerable extent, the school might be re-opened at an early date, but before doing so it would be necessary to obtain a properly qualified teacher. Miss Hughes, the present applicant was first brought to the notice of the Department by the Hon David Laird, Indian Commissioner at Winnipeg, who recommended her in connection with a vacancy at Couchiching.\n\nMiss Hughes holds a first class teaching certificate from the Normal School at Prince Edward Island and has had some experience in an Indian school, having taught on the Garden River Reserve. She is a Roman Catholic and a niece of Archbishop O'Brien of Halifax. She refers to Mr Prendergast, Separate School Inspector, for recommendation as to her capability and fitness for the position.\n\nMiss Hughes who has called once or twice at the office, appears to be bright and intelligent and very\nvery much interested in Indian education, and should make a capable and energetic teacher.\n\nThe school on the St Regis Reserve has been most unsatisfactory for some years, and although the late teacher was fully qualified, he failed to make a success of it, owing, I have no doubt to the unsettled state of mind of the Indians. The children are all backward in their studies, and I think that a change to a lady teacher might be beneficial.\n\nMartin Beards\nOTTAWA, 28th June, 1899\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department would be glad to have your views as to the advisability of re-opening the St Regis school, which in accordance with your suggestion was closed on the 1st of April.\n\nIt is thought that, as matters have quieted down on the Reserve, the school might be started again at an early date. The Department has received an application for the position of teacher of this school from a properly qualified young lady, and it would like to have your report in this matter at as early a date as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

D. McLEAN\n\nGeo. Long, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nSt Regis, Que\nThere was a Xmas tree at the village school and its the first one ever held, it took well and the teacher deserves credit the way she had the children so well trained in so short a time, the parents was delighted to hear the children sing, something they never heard before. There were five chiefs present also the priest and Agent Long, was there. Mr. Agent Long made a few remarks, the school-house was crowded. It was held in the afternoon. I think it will make a good impression to the parents so that they will send their children regular to school.\nMy dear Mrs. Benson,\n\nI should very much like to have formal permission to dismiss my junior class, about thirteen (13) in all, at half past eleven in the morning and half past three in the afternoon. With two exceptions the ages of these children range from six to eight years.\n\nI was so dissatisfied with the attendance that I made a trial of early dismissals this week. It has been a decided success\u2014the average attendance moved by three, better order in school, more willing work and all say they like it better. The parents seem to approve of it too.\n\nThe attendance today was 24.\n\nThe regular pupils have been studying as closely as they could all winter and I should like to have this relaxation allowed the little ones, as they have only 15 minutes recess twice a day.\n\nWith the earnest hope that this will meet with your favorable consideration,\n\nYour very sincerely,\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I expect a decided increase in the number of girls after Easter. Many of them have been keeping at home since they had that little gift in January. The children seem very much interested in the talks on tuberculosis. I think we should have a set of lessons in very simple English prepared to fit for our Indian schools. I shall try it with my pupils, at least.\n\nThe children are growing very ambitious to imitate the scholars in the outside world. Several of the older boys would like to go away to school to learn trades.\nThe girls have a Sunshine Society with fortnightly evenings at my boarding-house.\n\nThe Dry Temperance League has begun to attract the elders\u2014partly because of its jolly outside meetings. They began with a supper and evening with me, and I could not have found a more sentimentally set of little fellows in Canada, or more at their ease. There were only eleven of them there.\n\nWe accept invitations to the boys' homes in turn now, and we have a negro minstrel and comedy actors' troupe I can repeat each evening, from seven until nine o'clock. The little farces are written up between us and the dialogue is in English. Sometimes we play games, in English too, and always have a five minute talk on Temperance. I wish I could see a gymnasium and card-playing club room for the young men here, with pictures and books and music. They are crazy about these things. I believe they'd win the field from the saloons. It is good only to see these people laugh at the boys' troubles.\n\nI do not expect to go up to Ottawa for Easter but I should be glad if my cheque came early. Sometimes it is well in coming. If she has not forgotten her doctor's day, I hope that he shall be kind & see her at any time.

Would you kindly let me know what reason I am so abruptly dismissed. Did I not meet the requirements? Have I not faithfully discharged my duties. I have been\nOttawa, April 28, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nOn March 31, last, Miss Nolan, teacher of the St. Regis Indian school, was notified that her services would not be required after June 30, next. The reason for dispensing with her services is, that the school has made no progress during the time she has been in charge, since September, 1906.\n\nMiss Nolan's qualifications are sufficient, but she has given no evidence her ability to interest the Indians in the school. Mr. Inspector Ramsden, who visited St. Regis in November, last, reported that he found only seven children in attendance, where he considered there should be an average of 25 or 30. He also found the out-buildings in a very filthy condition.\n\nMr. Cook, of this Department, who was at St. Regis on official business lately, found only six children present at the school when he called, although it was an exceedingly fine day.\n\nI know of no Indian school which would afford a better opportunity for a zealous teacher to obtain tangible results. The children all live in the immediate neighborhood of the school and their parents are fairly well-to-do and there is good accommodation for a teacher.\n\nThe\nThe Department pays a salary of $350, which is a high salary compared with public schools in the province of Quebec and a much more active teacher could and should be obtained for the money. Miss Nolan is apparently content to let matters drift along quietly and draw her salary. This might do for a white school but to make a success of an Indian school it is necessary to have a live teacher. Scholarship does not count so much as energy and earnestness.\n\nI notice in Miss Nolan's letters to the Department that she refuses to accept her dismissal without cause and explanation. She has had ample notice and if we wish to make anything of this school a change of teachers would seem to be necessary.\n\nSome years ago the school on St. Regis Island and at the Chenail were closed, with the idea that the children would attend the village school. This scheme has not worked up to the present, owing to the difficulty in their transport, their parents naturally objecting to allowing small children to cross the channels in boats. This might be overcome by arranging with the Dundee ferry to convey the children night and morning to and from St. Regis, if there were a good school there, but this is another story, which will be dealt with on the St. Regis Island file.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

A lunch is being provided for the Indian children on St. Regis Island, but in that case they come a long distance to school and cannot go home for their mid-day meal.

The practice of frequently changing the school to which the girl is sent must prevent progress in her studies. The best course would appear to be for you and the teacher to point out to the parents the disadvantage under which they are placing the girl by their actions and it may be that they will keep her home and see that she is regularly sent to the school in the village.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nFrancis H.

Careful inquiry should, however, be made before any action is taken. It is not considered necessary that you should obtain the services of a doctor, as you should be able from inquiry to ascertain whether a child is ill or being kept home for other reasons.

GILMAN\n\nFOR THE\n\nSCHOOL YEAR 1911-1912\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to forward you my annual report.\n\nTERRITORY.\n\nMy district of inspection comprises the counties of Huntingdon, Beauharnois, Chateauguay, Soulange, Vaudreuil, Napierville, Laprairie and parts of Missisquoi and St. Johns.\n\nI also inspect the Indian schools at St. R\u00e9gis, Yellow Island and Chenail under the Federal Government.\n\nTwo of the Indian schools are taught by Indian women or squaws as they are called by the natives; about 150 Indian pupils attend these schools and they are doing very satisfactory work.\n\nThe school-houses and out-houses are in excellent condition and well furnished with modern equipment. A fine new building was erected at St. R\u00e9gis village last year. The Indian agent, Mr. Taillon, is enforcing, in a local way, a compulsory educational law. On the day of my last visit, a very stormy day, 42 pupils were present. The children are well clothed, neat, and everything extremely tidy. They all speak the Indian language, but read and recite their lessons in good English. Another Indian school will be erected at Sugar Bush Island next year.\n\nAll the schools of my district except one, were in operation during the year. No qualified teacher could be secured for the salary offered and the commissioners did not care to engage a person without proper qualifications. Higher remuneration will be offered next year\u2014and, no doubt, the pupils\nwill have the advantage of a good school, under the tuition of a qualified teacher.\n\nEXAMINATION.\n\nWritten and oral examinations were held and certificates of standing awarded; written reports were sent to the commissioners and trustees. The general proficiency of the schools was higher during the year than any previous year. Arithmetic, which has been weak during the past six years was fairly satisfactory\u2014averaging sixty-one per cent over the whole district, a gain of eleven per cent over last year, and nine per cent over any one of the past six years.\n\nATTENDANCE.\n\nI am sorry to report a small loss in the average attendance during the past year. I am also sorry to have to report a continual decrease in the number enrolled in the different municipalities. I am of the opinion that the decrease in the number attending the rural schools is general throughout the English portion of the Province.\n\nCLASSIFICATION.\n\nThe municipalities are classified according to the regulations prescribed by the Educational Department, for proficiency of the pupils, qualification of the teachers, salaries paid, condition and equipment of the buildings and grounds.\n\nEXCELLENT.\n\nSt. Joachim de Beauharnois, Howick, St. Chrysostome, Godmanchester, Ormstown, Elgin and Hinchinbrook in part.\n\nGOOD.\n\nFranklin, Havelock, Dundee, St. Thomas, Lacolle, L'Acadie and St. George de Clarenceville in part, Hemmingford.\n\nMEDIUM.\n\nThe remaining municipalities.\n\nUNSATISFACTORY.\n\nNone this year, unless I mention St. Urbain and St. Constant (in Laurier) which are improving.\n\nSCHOOL-HOUSES.\n\nMost of the buildings are in a very satisfactory condition and fairly well equipped.\n\nThere are no regular libraries and few reference books or Encyclopaedias.\n\nThere are a few supplementary readers and a few odd books donated by the Department. A couple of sets of books supplied by the association of Protestant teachers are in circulation.\n\nThey form a small circulating library and are placed in charge of the inspector who is responsible for the circulation.\n\nTAXATION.\n\nThe school taxes are generally low in my district of inspection\u2014ranging from two to six mills and the fees from five to twenty-five cents per capita a month. Many of the school boards visit their schools once a year, some make two visits a year and a few do not make any efforts to encourage their schools or teachers. It is usually the poor municipalities which are neglected.\n\nTHE ACCOUNTS.\n\nThe secretary-treasurers keep their accounts well and have their books annually audited.\n\nTEACHERS.\n\nThe teachers have been faithful to their charges, anxious to advance their pupils and diligent in their work. A very excellent class of young people were placed in charge of the schools of my district last year and excellent work has been done.\n\nI regret to state that there were employed in my district, five young girls, who had neither diplomas nor the proper qualification to enable them to obtain them through service.\n\nPermission from the Department was obtained to engage them.\nWe hope to eliminate this class from our ranks as soon as possible. We do not want them, and hope the Government will take steps to extend the possibilities of the Normal School training so as to reach young people who are anxious to teach but have not the means to qualify. It is difficult to secure qualified teachers for the salaries now offered in some municipalities.\n\nMany of the young teachers who have passed grade II academy and have regular permits are doing excellent work but they lack the confidence of trained teachers who have had the advantages of a year or two at Macdonald College.\n\nCONFERENCES.\n\nThe usual annual conferences were held in ten local centres and they were attended by nearly all the teachers of my district of inspection. A few of the commissioners and secretaries also attended. At Humington the local member, Mr. W. H. Walker, addressed the teachers in the morning, and commissioner Dr. Clouston and the local clergyman in the afternoon.\n\nRETIRED TEACHERS.\n\nI called on the retired teachers residing in my district and made a report of the state of their health to the Department. One of the pioneers of education in this Province passed away during the past year\u2014Mr. Ringland, of Hudson, after a long and painful illness. The late Mr. Ringland was one of nature's gentlemen, gentle, kind, generous, a lover of sports and vigorous exercises, but a close student of literature and of men. Unlike most schoolmasters, he saw the bright side of life even in his declining years.\n\nBONUSES.\n\nBonuses were awarded as usual, but no honour cards, as none were received for distribution.\n\nPrizes were awarded to the four municipalities which made the greater efforts towards improvement during the year. Both lists were published in the local newspapers.\n\nGENERAL.\n\nGradual improvement is being made in all the departments of education, better school-houses, better equipment, better salaries and consequently better teachers. We expect to be able in a short time to have every school taught by a Normal School graduate of experience. Commissioners and trustees have generally ceased trying to secure their neighbour's daughters as teachers, because they can reside at home and teach for very small salaries. A short time ago it was quite common to find young girls teaching without diplomas or permits in our best schools. We are happy to report that this condition does not prevail any longer. We expect to find every school next year taught by a qualified teacher. Our salaries range from $200 to $375 per annum, a higher average than on any previous year.\n\nBULLETINS.\n\nThe Educational Department has received during the year bulletins of inspection from each municipality, for each district, containing statistical information for every school, also comments and recommendations made by the inspector while in the different districts.\n\nThese bulletins and recommendations together with the report are respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour, etc.,\n\nA. LUTHER GILMAN,\nSchool Inspector.\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your of January 13th instant #157938/1, I have\n\nCloser today for December quarter.\n\nI beg to state that some new for\n\nwould to the Department on Jan-\n\n6th instant.\n\nI would have sent them\n\nin on Dec 31st ultimo but did not\n\nhave a sufficient supply of Draft\n\nFund blanks and had to wait until\n\nsome were received before trans-\n\nmitting voucher.\n\nJ. D. M. Leon See,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. E. Daillon\nAgent\nIn order to make my pupils speak English I do not permit them to use their own language during recreation. Yesterday I was correcting Julius Jacobs breaking the rule and he told me to \"Go to hell\" for he would talk Indian when he liked. I slapped him for saying such a thing to me. He told me he would tell his father on me when he went home. Noon his mother came to the school called me every dirty thing she could say she would never let him come to school again. He did not return. I sent word to his father to have him come to school but received the same message as from his son. I reported the case to the truant officer, but he will not enquire into any case of truancy unless the agent sends him. The agent being absent I thought it better to have your advice on the subject as I would consider it useless.\nto try to teach them if I cannot control them and have the parents come to school and use any kind of language they wish to me before the children.\n\nThe boy is only eight years old and would be quite intelligent if his parents had not told him to do he wished at school.\n\nFrom my experience among them I should think the best thing to do is to have the child brought to school at once otherwise it will encourage others to do like wise. If steps are not taken at once to have him return I will be obliged to expel his brother as he thinks he is now master and can follow his fathers orders.\n\nAn immediate reply will be very satisfactory.\n\nD.

McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMartin Benson, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 14, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Benson of this Department is going to St. Regis on Monday, the 17th instant, to look into school matters on the reserve and I have to request that you will be good enough to give him all the assistance in your power in making these inquiries.\n\nHe is also going to see about the selection of a site for the proposed new school on the lower Chenail and the Department would like you to accompany him when looking over the ground.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. E. Taillon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\nOttawa, March 31, 1915.\n\nTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:\u2014\n\nThis is to certify that Miss Lena Gilhooly taught the Indian school in the village of St. Regis, province of Quebec, for one year from September 1905 to September 1906.\n\nMiss Gilhooly's services were entirely satisfactory to the Department and the reports on her work received from the Public School Inspector were most favourable and the Department regretted that she found it necessary to resign.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nOriginal sent to Miss Rose Gilhooly today (Sep. 1-13).\nMemorandum: Mr. Redley.\n\nActing on instructions I left Ottawa on Monday, the 17th instant, for St. Regis going by way of Hogansburg.\n\nI went down to the reserve and called on Mr. Agent Tallon who accompanied me to the Village School which is in charge of Miss Gallagher. We found 25 children in attendance, 18 boys and 11 girls. They were put through their regular exercises and the work compared very favourably with that done by the Indian children at the school on the American side of the reserve which I visited. The reading was loud and distinct and, although the pupils are not generally very far advanced, they are getting on as well as can be expected considering the irregular attendance.\n\nThe new school building is well situated, but the yard wants a few loads of gravel to level it off and the school should be repainted. A new fence is required. I found that the plaster on the inside of the building is shrinking from the window and door frames and is loose in some parts. I think that a poor job was made of this part of the work. There is an immense box stove in the room which smokes occasionally and was smoking when I was there, caused by the pipes being higher over the stove than at the chimney. The wind carried away the cap of the\nthe chimney and loosened some of the bricks. I advised Mr. Taillon to have the caps replaced on the chimney, the chimney mended and the pipe lowered.\n\nMiss Gallagher is a capable teacher, but she is very unpopular with the Indians; so much so that they have made several complaints as to her harsh treatment of the children and the indiscreet remarks made to them. It was chiefly on account of these complaints that I was sent to St. Regis. I advised Miss Gallagher of the purpose of my visit and told her to be present at the Agent's office at three o'clock on the following afternoon.\n\nThe two chiefs of the St. Regis Band, the parents who made the complaints against Miss Gallagher and the truant officer as well as Miss Gallagher were present in the Agent's office on Tuesday afternoon. The Indians claimed that Miss Gallagher used undue severity in punishing the children. Mrs. Hopps, who is a sister of the Priest and married an Indian, stated that her little girl was so severely punished that her arms were black and blue. Joe Smoke stated that she nearly tore the ear off his son's head and John Jacobs stated that his daughter was badly hurt. Several others made similar complaints. They also stated that when the children left the school-room for any purpose the door was shut and they were kept out in the cold until such time as she saw fit to let them in. They complained of the coldness of the school-room and stated that when reproving the children for any faults she used very insulting language. Chief Jacobs and Chief Jake Fire made long harangues in Indian, which were interpreted. These went\nwent to show that Miss Gallagher's treatment of the children was too harsh and that they had always received kind treatment from the other teachers who had been in charge of the school previous to her engagement and they demanded her instant dismissal.\n\nMiss Gallagher, when called upon, denied the charges, although she admitted that in order to maintain discipline she found it necessary to correct the children sometimes with the strap. She said she never used a stick or a ruler.\n\nThe Priest told me that he had seen the black and blue marks on the wrists of his niece and that Miss Gallagher was altogether too severe with the children.\n\nI endeavoured to arrive at an amicable settlement of the trouble and the chiefs agreed to Miss Gallagher's remaining on till the 30th of June on condition that she would be more gentle in her ways and Miss Gallagher agreed to this arrangement. I am afraid, however, that the chiefs will persist in their demand for a change after that date, as Miss Gallagher is, as before said, unpopular with the villagers. They are very ready to take offence and seem to be annoyed at her ways. She informed me that it is impossible for her to get a suitable lodging in the village and they attribute her living in Hogansburg to her pride. Although she is a devout Roman Catholic she attends the church in Hogansburg and I think the Priest is annoyed at her for doing so. As far as I can make out the whole trouble appears to be that the Indians do not want a white teacher on the reserve. Jacobs is a very domineering man and he has a niece who was\neducated in the United States, whom he would like to have placed in charge of the St. Regis School. All the other teachers on the reserve are Indians and none of them have certificates. Mr. Taillon, who lives in the village and understands the Iroquois thoroughly, does not place much reliance on the complaints. He says that Miss Gallagher is attentive and competent and wishes to have a good school with regular attendance and good discipline and that she receives little or no encouragement, although all the Indians admit she is a good teacher. The Indians, while agreeing to let bygones be bygones, demand a change after the summer holidays.\n\nI am of opinion that the Indians will never take kindly to Miss Gallagher and I would suggest that she be transferred to some other school. There was no case made against her that would call for her dismissal and I am sure that she would be glad of a change. I may say here that the Agent, who saw Mrs. Hopps' child, failed to find any marks on her.\n\nI was not able to go to the St. Regis Island School, but I saw Miss White, the teacher, on the 16th, who told me that she has thirteen children present on that day and that she had had a very fair attendance all through the winter. Miss White is an Indian girl who was educated at the Carlyle Institute and who, Mr. Agent Taillon, tells me, is doing very well.\nTuesday, 18th March. -- Mr. Agent Taillon and I drove down to the lower Chenail to look for a suitable site for the proposed new school at the East end of the reserve. After examining several locations along the road we came to the conclusion that the best one for the new school building would be on the lot just purchased for the St. Regis Indians known as lot number three, on the Cadastral plan. This location is well adapted for school purposes, as it is convenient to the river road and is high and dry, would accommodate all the Indians who are too far from the present Chenail School. Some of the Indians were present when we looked over the grounds and they were satisfied that it would be the most suitable place for the school. There a few Indians living at Sugarbush Island, who would be quite near enough to attend, as well as some of the Indians living on the lower end of the Yellow Island.\n\nA school site of suitable dimensions could be laid out when the surveyor is sent to survey the land.\nOn our return we called on the Chenail School which is charge of Mrs. Sarah Back. I found 26 children present: 13 boys and 13 girls. The school room has a seating capacity for only 36 and there are 51 children on roll. If the new school is built it will relieve this one, as many of the children would be able to attend it.\n\nMrs. Back is doing good work and is popular with the Indians. I found the room was very drafty and I recommend that the building should be provided with double windows before the next winter sets in. A map of Province Quebec should be sent them as the one they have is in French and the teaching is in English.\n\nI drove back to Hogansburg where we had dinner and after that went back to the village.\n\nOn Wednesday the 19th. I went to Cornwall and had dinner, and crossed the bridge to Uscam and went down to Miss Roundpoint's school. There were 32 pupils present: 19 boys and 13 girls. The room, considering the conditions of the roads was clean and comfortable.\nThe seating accommodation was for 36 pupils. The school is well supplied with material. The children seemed bright and intelligent. I examined the classes, the senior pupils did well; their reading was loud and distinct and they understood what they read. Both Mrs. Back and Miss Roundpoint had good control of their pupils and are well liked by both pupils and parents.\n\nThe Cornwall Island School Building will need some slight repairs, painting the foundation and ceiling, but these can be done in the summer holidays. I noticed some broken panes of glass, the agent should be asked to see that the slight repairs be attended to.\n\nA little boy named Lawrence White who is in Miss Roundpoint's school asked to be taken to Ottawa. I made inquiries and found that his father had left his wife. The mother works when she can but does not bear a very good character, and the boy is certainly a bright little fellow and should be given a chance.\nThere is another little boy in the school named Robert Jacobs who is similarly situated. He is only eight years old and his case is deserving consideration. Another application was made by a widow named Jacobs for her little boys to be placed in the orphanage here. She has two children there already and three at home. Should the department feel inclined to do anything for these children it could on the usual terms: $60.00 a year and clothes.\n\nI found Mr. Taillon most obliging and I consider him a very efficient Agent. He is young and energetic and has a fair knowledge of the language of the Indians, knows them well and is highly thought of by them. He showed me over his house which has been repaired on the inside with the exception of the cellar, which should have a drain and would be better with a concrete floor, as it was wet when I was there. There are also some slight repairs to be made to the outbuildings and I think if he were furnished with the lumber he would have them done.\n\nMr. Taillon has charge of about 1600 Indians and...\nand is one of the few Agents who live on the reserve. You can understand that living in the village he is constantly called upon by the Indians. He tells me that his salary from this Department is only $250.00 a year and, although he holds the positions of custom house officer and post master, his total receipts from these three sources of revenue only amount to $755.00. His work in connection with the Indians is the most exacting and when you consider the duties he performs I think that in all fairness he should have a substantial increase.\n\nMr. Taillon told me that he wished the Department would let him have a telephone, as in case of sickness he has no readier means of communicating with the doctor than by mail or driving to Hogansburg to phone him.\n\nI noticed that the American government had built a most up-to-date road from the Indian reserve on their side of the border and as soon as you cross the line you can at once tell that you are on the Canadian side by the condition of the roads.\n\nA day or two before I was at St. Regis a violent cyclone struck this section of the country, breaking off pine trees, overturning outbuildings and causing slight damage in the village, striking the school and the church.\nThe church suffered considerably, as there were a number of slates torn off the roof and a great many panes of glass broken. The Indians were anxious to have the roof of the church repaired out of their funds.\n\nThere was no sickness on any portion of the reserve at the time of my visit and the Indians seem to be fairly well off, especially those who were working their own lands. I was told that the Cornwall Island Indians obtained first prize for butter at the Cornwall fair and more of the village Indians could be placed on land to their advantage as there is no regular employment for them there.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

At the meeting today it was generally stated by those present that if she returned to the reserve the parents would refuse to send their children to school, this would be too bad because it would greatly retard school work, and on the other hand it would be too bad to discharge Miss Gallagher as she is an excellent teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.F.

Taillon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\nSir,\n\nI desire to place before you, for official approval of my action in the undersigned matter.\n\nAnd Jake Boy, a member of the St. Regis Band of Indians, #370 in the pay list, has resided and is residing in the United States, on the American reserve. He has a son named who has attended the village school here very irregularly during school year 1913-1914, for example, March 29th 1914, present 22 days, absent 38 days; June 29th 1914, present 23 days, absent 29 days; Sept. 29th 1914 he attended 3 days only and in October ultimo, this day, Oct. 15th 1914 when he was expelled from the school for non-attendance. By this you will readily see that his attendance was extremely poor.\n\nAs Boy resides in the United States you will at once grasp the situation \u2014 he was and is beyond our jurisdiction, although as stated above \u2014 a Canadian Indian.\n\nThe trustees often called on the parents at various times and they failed to send the boy to school, even giving...\nSir,\n\nthe officer in question, as far as the Department and agent are concerned.\n\nIn the face of the boy's absence and the parents neglecting to send him to school, I instructed the teacher and town officer to not allow the boy to attend the school, which they have done, although three attempts have been made by the boy to re-enter the school, i.e., Oct 12-14-26 respectively.\n\nI may add that Mr. A. J. Williams, Lawyer, of the Department was here last month. I explained the case to him and he assured me I had acted correctly in the matter.\n\nLast evening Boy accompanied by the so called chief Thunderwater and several others came to the office and this Thunderwater endeavored to induce me to allow this boy to return to the school, this I refused to do as long as Boy resides in the United States.\n\nFinding he could not convince me to coincide with his views, he, with the assertion that the boy would be readmitted as he intended to lay the matter before the Department, took his departure.\nSir,\n\nIt is simply a case of discipline and jurisdiction. I may add that had Boy sent his boy regularly, I would not have issued the instructions as stated. I cannot help feel that the Department will give its approval to my action and will uphold me in the face of any representations that may be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. W. Leon Jr.\nAttorney, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. E. Macdonald,\nAgent.\nUtica, N.Y. Nov. 24th. 1914.\n\nTo The Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWe respectfully call to your attention, and for your consideration the following facts.\n\nJacob Bay, an Indian of the St Regis Band, Mohawk tribe, drawing annuities and owning land at St. Regis, has been sending his nine year old son to the school situated on the reservation.\n\nIt being considered essential to his financial interests, that he keep his boy out of the school at times, he did so.\n\nLater when things had become somewhat settled, he sent the boy to school. The boy was sent back home and told that he could not attend the reservation school. The father again sent the boy to school, and again the boy was sent home. A third time the boy was sent to the school, and again the boy was sent home.\n\nYour agent Mr. Taillon told me that the trouble has been existing for about two years, and that Mr. Bay was under the impression that he could send the boy to school when he chose.\n\nThe father has some land on the American side of the reservation and is \"working\" that land. Mr. Taillon holds that as he does not live on the Canada side of the line, that he cannot send his boy to the Canadian school.\nHe also holds that he has no authority to allow the boy to go to the Canadian school.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Indians in question ARE WARDS OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA, and not of the UNITED STATES, This Council takes the stand that the boy belongs in the Canadian school, and should not be deprived of an education because of so trivial a dispute.\n\nThe father has been instructed that he MUST send the boy to school regularly, as, to send him at intervals only, would be a great trouble to the teacher and would tend to set the boy back with his studies.\n\nThe father, agreed to send the boy to school regularly, and that in the presence of Mr. Taillon and several of our Council members, yet your agent tells us that he has no authority to allow the boy to go to the school while the father resides on the American side of the line.\n\nInconsistent as it may seem, he also tells us that he has previously allowed the boy to go to the Canadian school while the father resided on the U.S. side. Mr. Taillon also informed me that he bore no malice toward Mr. Bay. If Mr. Taillon had authority to allow the boy to go to the school under the circumstances before, why has he not that authority now?\n\nIt is our belief that favoritism is being shown on the reservation, and that there exist irregularities that require the attention of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nInvestigation reveals the fact that large quantities of alcoholic liquors are being consumed by some of the Indians on the reservation,\nI am personally informed that Mr. Taillon's father sells whisky to the Indians, and that when Mr. Taillon asks Indians where they got their liquor, and they answer that they purchased the same from Mr. Taillon's father, that he does not take the liquor from them. But, if they say that they purchased the whisky at Cornwall, that he does take the liquor from them.\n\nThese matters and many other, can be settled by your Office, and I hope that you will give them your prompt attention as the Council has authorized me to engage counsel to take to the courts many cases that are considered irregular. I wish to avoid as much litigation as possible, but in many instances I am convinced that the wrongs are so glaring that publicity is necessary.\n\nSome time ago I suggested that it would be good policy to send an investigating representative from your Office to St. Regis reservation to look into the affairs of the people on the reservation. I repeat that in my opinion it would be best that your Office do so at once.\n\nThis will be all for this time, wishing you\n\nGood cheer, and clear insight to the end that the work of God, Clean Justice and Humanity may proceed smoothly.\n\nChief Thunderwater\n\nP.S. Carbon copy of this letter has been forwarded to Mr. Taillon at the reservation, that he may know just what we are doing. It is my policy never to do anything behind a person's back unless I am dealing with a wanton rogue.\nOttawa, 28th November, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to the case of Angus Bay, a pupil from the American side, who has been allowed to attend the St. Regis School, but whom for reason given you have had expelled from the said school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in view of the facts set forth the Department concurs in the position you have taken in this matter.\n\nThe Department yesterday received a communication from Chief Thunderwater with reference to the above case and alleging other irregularities particularly with reference to the sale of liquor to the Indians. He states that he sent you a copy of this communication. This man was advised that the Department approved of the position that you had taken in the school matter. The Department desires, however, that you report as to the allegations made by Chief Thunderwater with respect to the liquor traffic.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.E.Tailon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, 27th November, 1914.\n\nChief,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, and note your observations with respect to the case of the son of one Jacob Bay, who was expelled from the St. Regis School on the instructions of Mr. Agent Taillon, and with respect to alleged irregularities with regard to liquor traffic among the Indians.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the school matter had been fully reported on by Mr. Taillon whose action in the matter is approved by the Department, and that any action that you have taken in this matter appears to have been quite unnecessary. The allegations with respect to the liquor traffic are being inquired into.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst.

She is considered \"unusually bright,\" or she had spent about nine years in school.

I asked him to show me how badly injured the boy was.\nSir,\n\nwas, and to my surprise and delight, he examined one hand and then the other but could not show any trace of a severe punishment. In fact, after five days he was trapped, he scolded the boy and sent him off to school; so the boy and his mother shortly after the boy had been punished, and in all much as there was not any marks upon his hands, it was quite evident the boy did not receive an excessive punishment.\n\nIf my memory serves me right, I made inquiries from the pupils at the school and they stated the teacher did not abuse the child.\n\nDuring my residence here, I have examined some of these alleged severe punishments inflicted upon the pupils and have always found the allegations could not be substantiated.\n\nIt is an unwritten law with these Indians, that the children must not be punished at schools still within the confines of their own homes they can and do beat them.\nSir,\n\nvery severely, but let a teacher consist of a pupil, even though the punishment is ever so slight, and let the parents are up in arms.\n\nIt is quite essential for the good of the school, that there should be some method and discipline, and if at times the teachers find after all endeavors fail, that it is necessary to resort to corporal punishment in a moderate way.\n\nShould this agitator Thunderwater object? If he is anxious to promote the welfare of these Indians, he does not show it by taking the advice of his chief adviser P. Pafier.\n\nI would advise Chief Thunderwater and his informant to endeavor to inculcate into the Indians respect for Law and Order, Teachers and superior officers, instead of complaining against the less stricter the children have had in years.\n\nReally, I am surprised at John Fire, sending through Pafier such a complaint, in as much; that during the closing exercises held in the school last June, he efforts to\nSir,\n\nThe assembled guests, praising him keen and repeating her to return for another term, while excusing new lovers, he spoke with her, endeavoring to secure her promise to return.

I understand that you are concerned about the condition of the school and the lack of proper facilities.\n\nTherefore, when I wrote the suggestion that the council should be asked for assistance, it was not with the expectation that it would be used as such until the end of the June quarter, and to relieve a very unsatisfactory condition in the school. I do quite fully expect that upon the opening of the schools for September, the proposed addition would have been completed, and then there could not have been any complaint offered.\n\nPersonally, I do not like the idea of the school being used for any purpose other than its intended use, but I am willing to consider the possibility of using it for a community purpose if necessary. However, I do not believe that the idea of using it for any purpose other than its intended use is justified by the fact that it has not been used properly by any group desiring to occupy the premises.\n\nIndian Affairs.

At my age, and with my experience, I feel that I ought to be earning more than I am at present receiving.\n\nPerhaps when you take into consideration, the fact that I have been in your employ for two years, you will not think this an unreasonable request. I am taking a Correspondence Course this year, for a higher grade Certificate, and at my present salary I can barely meet expenses. I shall kindly ask for an increase of One Hundred Dollars per year.\n\nKindly let me know immediately if you will be able to grant this increase or not.

(RG 10, Volume 6107, file 331-1, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMiss Loretto McGrath, senior teacher of the St. Regis Village Day School, has applied for an increase in her salary.\n\nShe began duties at this school on January 25th, 1918, at a salary of $500.00 per annum, which was increased to $600.00 per annum from July 1st, 1918, and is the rate at which she is at present paid. Besides this she receives a bonus at the rate of $150.00, making a combined salary and bonus of $750.00. Her qualifications consist of a Model School Diploma for the province of Quebec.\n\nThe Public School Inspector, Mr. Gilman, in a report of his inspection dated September 24th, last, states that Miss McGrath is successful in her work and recommends that she be re-engaged, if possible. He states that the school is well managed and the pupils making progress. She has an enrollment of about 25 pupils.\n\nMiss McGrath states that she is taking a correspondence course in order to obtain a higher grade certificate.\n\nAs long as the bonus at the present rate is continued I would consider that Miss McGrath is receiving a good salary for her work, which is in excess of that paid to most of the other teachers in Quebec by this Department and is the equal to that paid to the teachers in the provincial rural schools of Quebec.\n\nI shall be pleased to be informed as to what reply should be made to Miss McGrath's request.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You now receive a salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum and a bonus at the rate of $150.00, making a combined salary and bonus of $750.00.\n\nIt is considered, for the qualifications you possess, that you are receiving a higher amount than is paid to any other teacher in the Department's service in Quebec or the Maritime Provinces, and a salary in excess of that paid by the provincial government for the Province of Quebec to teachers in its rural schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Asst.

Now, nor associate with them even in the house but holds herself aloof at all times.\n\nwhich as you can easily comprehend does not tend to help making things very convenient, as if there is at its best difficult for white persons.\n\nFurther, I may say, I fear that unless she is dismissed someone or more of the others may resign, whose services are necessary here, as they do not feel like living in such a manner, having a person in the house who scarcely speaks to them.\n\nJ.

Even when they have asked for it, she would not give it to them.\n\nNow I want to know what I am going to do next. The first time she drove him out, I sent him back again.

He was provided with a pencil for the purpose. As the teacher could not maintain discipline in any other way, she told him to go home. You should tell your son that it is necessary that he obey the instructions of the teacher, as it is impossible for her to carry on the work in the class-room unless the children follow her instructions. Your son will receive every attention from the teacher, but it is necessary that he obey her. The Department considers that you have no cause for complaint of the treatment your son received and you should see that he attends regularly and obeys the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Thompson (Indian) charged with Assault.\n\nOn Jan 27th, I received instructions from Det.Sergt Ramsay, to go to St Regis Reserve (ue), and investigate the above case.\n\nOn January 28th, accompanied by Sergt.No.7992 Constable Tahamont, I left Ogdensburg Station (N.Y.) & traveled, for Syamsburg N.Y., at 6:15 A.M., arriving at Hogansburg N.Y., at 10:42 A.M. We took Auto to Hogansburg N.Y., and put up at the Murphy Hotel; After lunch we proceeded to St Regis (ue), distance about three miles, and interviewed Mr Taillon, Indian Agent, who stated the particulars of the case in question. We then interviewed Miss Gertie Legarde, school teacher of the St Regis Village School, also Miss Brown another school teacher of the same school, who witnessed what took place; after hearing their statements of what happened, I came to the conclusion to learn information and communicate with one Mrs John L. Thompson, an Indian, who, on the 24th day of January 1921, did enter the school house in the Village of St Regis (ue), between the hours of 3:00 and 4:00 P.M. on said date, and assault one Miss Gertie Legarde, school teacher, by catching hold of said Miss Gertie Legarde and striking her.\n\nAfter making out the Warrant for her arrest, Mr Taillon, Indian Agent, thought that it would be better if we would have the case taken before a Magistrate, stating that he thought that it would have more of a moral effect on this party, and the Indians in general; he suggested that we take Mrs John L. Thompson before Mr John Macmillan, at Dundee (ue), who is in the same County as St Regis Village, which is a distance of 12 miles from St Regis (ue), and would be nearer than Cornwall, as the only way of crossing the river was quite away down.\n\nOn January the 29th, at 8:30 A.M., I left Hogansburg N.Y., accompanied by Constable Tahamont, in his Uniform, and went to St Regis Village where we went to the house of Mrs John L. Thompson and placed her under arrest; and accompanied by Miss Gertie Legarde and Miss Brown we proceeded to Dundee (ue).\n\nMr MacMillan tried this case under Section 29, after hearing the evidence, he found the accused guilty, sentenced her to pay a Fine of $20.00 and $2.00 each month in Goal at Valleyfield (ue); The Fine was paid immediately.\n\nThe Court adjourned, Mr MacMillan told Mrs Thompson or any other Indian off the Reserve appear before the same Judge there would be no option, but a fixed sentence; we then returned to Hogansburg N.Y.\n\nIn the afternoon we again returned to the Village, Constable Tahamont still in Uniform, and saw Mr Taillon, in reference to warning the People about sending their children to school. Mr Taillon, was under the impression that I was to make prosecutions in regards to the different families who were not sending their children to school, explained to him my orders as I received them and warning \"but I stated that if he thought it was necessary to be done by prosecution right away, that I would order to Cornwall, and get in touch with Supt Belcher Officer of \"A\" Division before I proceeded with the warning\".\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6107, file 331-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nTaillon said that he thought it better to go ahead as I had received my instructions from the Dept. He then handed me a list of names of 12 different families, affecting some 30 children, who were not attending school. We then proceeded with Comst Tahamont, and made the rounds of these families, stating to them all, that if they did not send all their children, aged under 16 years of age, that in the course of 40 days or two weeks, there would be someone down to prosecute the heads of each family failing to do so, and would probably mean that the child in question would be taken away, and sent to the Spanish River school.\n\nAfter completing the rounds, I made arrangements to meet Mr. Taillon at the school house on Cornwall Island, which is a part of the reserve. On Monday morning at 9:00 A.M., Jan 31st; we then proceeded from St. Regis Village to Gananoque, Ont., and from there across the river to Cornwall Ont., arriving at 7:00 P.M. Monday Dec 31st, accompanied by Rgt. No. 799E, Const Tahamont. I left Cornwall Ont. at 8:30 A.M., crossing the railway bridge on foot to Cornwall Island, where we hired a horse and cutter from an Indian living near the bridge, and then proceeded to the school house where we met Mr. Taillon, Indian Agent, who furnished us with a list of families who were not sending their children to school regularly on Cornwall Island\u2014St. Regis and Yellow Island, which is all in the Reserve. This list included some 15 families on Cornwall Island, three families on St. Regis Island, and three families on Yellow Island, effecting some 44 children. After receiving this list from Mr. Taillon, he recommended one Peter Bay (Indian) on Cornwall Island, and six Policemen on the Reserve, to accompany us as a guide, and interpret to any one who could not talk the English language; I took this man for the day, and he was very satisfactory, as a large amount of the people we interviewed did not, or could not, talk English. We completed our work and returned to Ottawa about 6:30 A.M.\n\nI have to state that in regard to the Indians living in the village of St. Regis, we, they took the warning all right, and promised to send their children to school; but on St. Regis Island, Yellow and Cornwall Island Ont., there was quite a lot of dissenting; some said that it was too far to go to school for small children, some having to go over two miles; and some said that it was no use sending their children to school, as they did not learn anything there, as the teacher was no good, and some various other complaints. But I told them that if they had any complaints against the teacher, or the way the school was run, they had better lay their complaints before Mr. Taillon the Indian Agent.\n\nBut I might state that there was one case which drew my particular attention; on my list there was included one Mr. Peter Belormer, who had 3 girls and one boy of school age, whom I interviewed and gave the regular warning; this woman is a widow, and has I think six small children up to the age of nine years of age, and two boys around 15 or 16 years of age; this woman told me it would be a godsend to have some of the children sent to the Spanish River school, as she is not able to clothe them warm enough to send them to school, which is about two miles away. This family looked to me to be in destitution.\n\nAlthough there was quite a lot of talk about us being sent onto the Reserve, especially one man in Uniform, there was nothing unusual occurred.\n\nOn Tuesday morning Feb 1st, accompanied by Comst Tahamont, we left Cornwall Ont., via Ry, and Ottawa at 9:15 A.M., arriving in Ottawa at 11:45 A.M.\n\nF.M.

It is considered that maple would serve the purpose. These trees should be obtained and planted as soon as the weather conditions permit. The price of the trees should not exceed your estimate and the labour of having them transplanted in the school grounds should be performed as cheaply as possible.\n\nIf you consider that any protection should be placed round these trees in order to prevent them being damaged by the children, you may also arrange to have this done, but it should not be of an expensive nature.\n\nWhen the trees have been secured and planted and the work completed, you will be good enough to furnish properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nIt is hoped that when these trees are planted that they will progress successfully in growth and in a few years add to the appearance of the grounds.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

If this transfer is made, Miss Sloane would be paid the same salary as she now receives at the Island School.

The children acquire the Indian language as a matter of course in the homes where they learn it better than at the teachers.\nCould teach it.\n\nWe mothers realize the necessity and importance of the English language. But we do not wish to repeat in our children the handicap which we have found so grievous and detrimental to adjust to conditions outside of the reserve. We ask therefore that English be taught and spoken in the schools.\n\nWe would also request on behalf of our daughters that a few hours each week be devoted to teaching writing, crochet and sewing. They will be the mothers in a short while and we realize how necessary and useful a knowledge of such matters are!\nin the house.\n\nThe mothers pledge their\nallegiance to co-operate with\nthe Indian Dept in furthering\nthe big gesture but need\nmore.\n\nWe are your humble servants,\n\nMrs Christie Cook\nMrs Joe Smoke\nMrs Tom Sam\nMrs Tom Thomas\nMrs Jane Day\nMrs Ohe\nMrs Louis Hope\nMrs George Jacobs\nOttawa, September 3rd, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith copy of a petition received from a number of Indian women on the St. Regis Reserve in which they complain that the teachers in the St. Regis Village School teach in the Indian language and allow the same to be spoken during school hours. It is doubtful if there are any grounds for their complaint regarding the teaching of the Indian language, as we are not aware that the teachers have sufficient knowledge of the same to impart instruction in that language. However, I shall be pleased if you will enquire into the matter referred to in the petition and furnish a report to the Department.\n\nYou might also furnish your views regarding the teaching of sewing, knitting, etc., by the teachers to the older girls in the school. If the teachers will undertake this work, the department will supply a small quantity of sewing material, etc., upon receipt of a requisition for the material required. You might take this matter up with the teachers and ascertain whether they would be prepared to devote, say, one hour per day for two days each week during the regular class hours for the teaching of sewing as part of the classroom work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

TAILLON, INDIAN AGENT, DATED JANUARY 15, 1925.\n\nWe will, as in the past, endeavour to have the children attend as regularly as possible and I think the teachers could do a great deal if they would try and make the school work attractive for the pupils and be courteous to them as well. If the teachers would be compelled to teach singing, speaking and have recitations say every two weeks with an occasional Concert by the pupils as was done when we had teachers like the Misses Keon, McGeoy and McCaffery this would arouse the interest of not only the parents but the children as well and I believe would have a tendency to break the feeling that exists between the parents and the schools. Unfortunately of later years the teachers do not seem to take the proper interest in the school that they should.\nOttawa, January 26, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your letter of the 15th instant, in which you recommend that everything possible be done to make the instruction more attractive at the St. Regis Indian schools. Please instruct the teachers that the Department expects them to teach hand work to the younger pupils, to have sewing classes, and gymnastic exercises for all children and to give the older girls some instruction in sewing and related domestic science. Particularly in the Village School, there should be a determined effort to make the classroom and playground activity so interesting, that the children will enjoy their school day. The teachers should personally supervise the recess period, which should be at least 20 minutes in duration, and group games should be taught and practised. If any supplementary athletic equipment is required, please submit a requisition. Further, the Department will supply a small quantity of sewing material, yarn, etc., and any other aids considered advisable, upon request, and the teachers should devote one hour, twice a week during the regular class period, for the teaching of sewing, knitting, etc.\n\nAt each school, the teacher should immediately commence training and preparation for a school concert, which will be held at the end of the academic year in June and to which the parents should be invited. You may inform the teachers that the failure of any or all of them to comply with these instructions and to brighten up the teaching will be considered by the Department good and sufficient reason for their dismissal. It is hoped that this effort and that of the newly appointed truant officer will materially increase the attendance at the St. Regis Indian Day Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

(near Cornwall, Ont.) This position requires a teacher with tact and good judgment, as her success will depend to a considerable extent on her activity outside of the classroom.\n\nThe residence for this school is in the Indian Village of St. Regis and is occupied not only by the two teachers of the Village School, but by the worker from St. Regis Island. I have to make a change for the next academic year, as the disposition of the present incumbent of the senior room is not too sweet. Which one of the young ladies in our employ would you recommend for this position? She must, of course, be Roman Catholic and should be in her thirties. Ontario professional qualifications will be satisfactory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. M. Bennett, Esq.,\nSeparate School Inspector,\n47 Browning Ave.,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Mr. Ferguson,\n\nJust reached home after an extensive trip west. Your letter of March 2nd re a teacher for St. Regis has me puzzled. I just thought you want a real live teacher, earnest, active with lots of initiative and promiscuity\u2014at least so you say\u2014and with Ontario qualifications. I am sorry to say that none in my Indian schools meet the requirements. In the first place only one has Ontario certificate, she is too young.\n\nNow leaving that out of the question, Miss R. Chaplet at Gander River might do but she hasn't life enough outside the classroom. Yet maybe I don't know her. Miss Bush at Gander River might do but I feel she isn't too strong in teaching methods. Lillian Addy at Blind River is about the same. The best Indian school teachers are those ladies at Spanish, Sheshegwaning etc. That Order. There is one who comes quite close to them in earnestness, ability, promiscuity, and\n\n[Signature]\n\nToronto, MAR 10, 1926\n\nIndian Affairs.

She is surely the most outstanding of the boy teachers and she knows what to do with Indians, at least those in Mission Bay but she is too young and really too earnest.\n\nDon't make a decision just yet. Why not look around for some of our old timers qualified second class teachers who are without positions. There are quite a few now.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.M. Bennett\n\nP.S. I often intended calling to Ottawa to just talk over teachers until you have never got the opportunity yet.\nOttawa, April 6, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Bennett:\n\nI have to thank you for your letter of the 30th ultimo and to state that I shall not make a decision regarding a senior teacher for St. Regis at the present time. I am taking the liberty, however, of looking to you for a nomination. If you can secure a teacher who would be satisfactory for an Indian reserve and also act as \"Big Sister\" to younger teachers with whom she will live, I think the Department can provide a suitable salary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. M. Bennett, Esq., M.A.,\nInspector of Separate Schools,\n47 Browning Ave.,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, May 1, 1926.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, applying for the position of senior teacher at the St. Regis Indian Day School. It is true that there will be a vacancy as on September first, next, and the Department wishes to make a careful selection before making an appointment. No decision will be reached for a few weeks and it would be advisable for you to apply in person, at Room 501, Booth Building, Ottawa, at your convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Mary Feeny,\nFort Coulonge,\nP. Q.\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI am afraid that since I do not know conditions at my Regio that it will be impossible for me to give a nomination.\n\nI am enclosing a letter from a Miss McCurry which should go to me. But I have nothing to say.\n\nThere is also one from Miss Grant who lives near Ottawa. Maybe she might call and offer could just be yourself. This girl has come from a fine Catholic High School and convent. I know very little about her.\n\nBoth these are qualified Ontario teachers with experience.\n\nNow I am also enclosing a letter sent me lately by Miss Addy. When I wrote I asked her about taking a real heavy position. Her answer is in that letter.\n\nKindly return these three letters yourself.\n\nAPR 30 1926\nMaybe Miss Addley might be. She is the closest to your requirements, but in lacking in training & teaching methods. I am not making a recommendation merely suggestions to aid you in a decision.\n\nShe is another teacher there with 10 yrs experience, Ontario Second Class who has had varied experience as principal. Although Irish Canadian she has done well in a Hindu camp four rooms school filled with French Canadian children with 3\u00bd Canadian teachers under her. She has put discipline in the place and taught the Indian children teachers under her how to have patience & discipline in the children in the school. If she can do this under the present conditions and trying circumstances maybe she can do the same at St Regis. Her salary is $958.00 at present. She has received more mother schools. Her home is in Ottawa. Present address in Logania Ont; Name is Miss Margaret McNally. The only thing I don't know is how she would act to teachers while living with them.\n\nMaybe from the above you can make a choice.\n\nI gathered together a few general critical thoughts on Indian Education. I may send them to you.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nJ.M. Bennett\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTo: Mr. Ferrier\n\nKindly please be advised.\n\nI already sent you a letter with this teacher's name mentioned. I have an idea that this teacher would be quite satisfactory for St. Regis. She has experience and is well recommended. So if you wish please correspond with her at her own address.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.M.

She has taught for 5 or 6 years and during that time, no doubt, has added much to her efficiency. I would feel confident in recommending her so far as an individual classroom is concerned, but I would be somewhat hesitant in giving you equal assurance as to her capacity for supervising a school comprising a number of teachers.

I explained to them that any teacher who could not work and live in harmony with the others on the reserve had a disturbing influence which would interfere with success in the classrooms. Miss E. Prudhomme, of Chetlain, handed in her resignation to take effect as soon as she could be relieved. I definitely placed Miss MacInulty in charge of the girls, both as far as their classroom activity was concerned and in their residence. I laid down the rule that the village residence was to be used by the Chetlain and Chenail teachers from Saturday until Sunday only and that they upon those occasions were to meet a fair share of the cost and to assist in the work. I arranged for the installation of Miss Carmel Dunnigan, the new teacher at St. Regis Island, who is to live with the two village teachers in the village residence.

I note that, in my telegram, I inadvertently stated duties would commence on the first proximo. I have now to state that it will be the 6th of September before the classes will commence. Mr. Indian Agent W. A. MacGibbon, of St. Regis Village, is the Department's local representative and you should look to him and to Miss Margaret MacNulty, the principal of the school, for instruction and advice. I am informing Miss MacNulty of your appointment and she will write to you, advising you what personal effects you should take with you.\n\nThe St. Regis Indian Day School is a two-roomed school and you will be in charge of the junior room. There is a furnished teacher's residence right in the village. The best method of reaching the reserve is to detrain at Lyando, New York State, which is a station or two past Cornwall, Ont. A bus service will take you back about three miles into Canada and on the reserve.

Please let me know if the teachers of the Cornwall Island and Chetlain Schools would expect the same privilege.\n\nI note that the three teachers mentioned in your letter expect to attend summer school. Please advise me what summer school they expect to attend and the date on which this opens.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. A. MacGibbon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\nOttawa, March 27, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to official letter of the 16th instant, concerning the Easter holidays, I have to advise you that information is now to hand, which suggests that the Department would be well advised to keep some, if not all, of the schools in your agency open during Easter week and close them a week earlier in June. I understand that there are religious exercises the last week in June, which seriously interfere with the attendance. Please authorize the St. Regis Village and the Chenail teachers to continue their schools during Easter week and to close for the summer holidays on June 22nd.\n\nYou should ascertain, at an early date, if the St. Regis Island and Chetlain teachers, also, are desirous of making the change. If so, all four schools will be uniform in this practice. I do not consider it advisable to disturb the regular routine in the case of the Cornwall Island Indian Day School.\n\nPlease give this matter your early attention and, at a later date, report to the Department what action is being taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. A. MacGibbon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, P. Q.\nSir:\n\nI beg to say in reply to Departmental letter of March 16th/28, regarding the three teachers, Miss Mac Lulity, Miss Norris and Miss Reillard, desiring to keep their schools open during the Easter Holidays. Mr. F. Burns, teacher of Cornwall Island school and Miss Stacey, teacher of St. Regis Island school, had planned on Easter Holidays, and wish to have them as usual. Miss Leonard, teacher of Chetlain school, says either way suits her, she would teach during the holidays or have the school closed.\n\nRegarding the summer school the three teachers expect to attend, and the date on which the school would open, this they could not tell at present, not until about the middle of April, when they would be advised regarding summer schools.\n\nPlease give me an early reply regarding this matter.\n\nI Am,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nW. G. Mac Gibbon\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAgent,\nSir:\n\nWith further reference regarding Easter holidays, in connection with the schools I beg to say that all the teachers of Lorette, Peguis Que. Reserve, intend keeping their schools open during Easter holidays, including Cornwall Island. Mr. Frank Birne, teacher of Cornwall Island school informed me that he received word from his home, Guelph, Ont., that he had the opportunity of being engaged as teacher, for the summer months. I advised Mr. Birne, that he could keep the Island school open during the holidays, and close the 2nd, of June. I felt that this would be satisfactory to the Department.\n\nI Am,\nYour Obedient Servant.\n\nW.A. Mac Gibbon\nAgent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nMiss. F. Morris, teacher of St. Regis Village school, (junior room) report to me as follows:\n\nOn April 19th./28 I had occasion to retain some of my class in school after school hours, for certain work they neglected to finish during the day. Among the number kept in was Bernatine Oake. About 5 o'clock P.M., an older sister of Bernatine Oake who is not attending school, name Charlotte Oake, came to the school and wanted to know the reason why her sister was not coming home. I politely told her the reason. Charlotte Oake used slang at me; also on leaving the room told me \"to go to ---\". Regarding the above matter I visited Charlotte Oake, and informed her the seriousness of her actions, and advised her not to interfere with the teachers whatever, also that if she had any complaints to make, to report them to the agent. The above case should be dealt with, as it sets a very bad example to the school children, also the Indians should be taught to have nothing to do with the teachers whatever. Please advise me what action should be taken, or if any.\n\nI might further say, that I have had complaints about all the teachers on the Reserve, from Indians, regarding their children at school. But none of these complaints were but what could be looked for from the Indians. I have not reported any of these complaints to the Department, as I considered it not necessary to do so. All the teachers are doing good work, this can be readily seen on visiting the schools.\n\nI Am,\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nW. A.

(RG 10, Volume 6107, file 331-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 1st, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, informing the Department of the complaint which you received from Miss Morris, assistant teacher at the St. Regis Village School, that Charlotte Oake visited her classroom and used insulting language. The Department has noted the steps taken by you in the matter, also that you have informed Charlotte Oake of the seriousness of her action and instructed her not to interfere with the teacher in future. It is hoped that as a result of the advice which you gave there will be no further trouble.\n\nThe Department has also noted that complaints are made from time to time by the Indian parents regarding all the teachers on the Reserve. It is thought that if tact is used by the teachers and yourself in dealing with the Indian parents any fancied grievances on their part can be adjusted without referring these cases to the Department. We note that all the teachers are doing good work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. A.

We understand that all teachers on the St. Regis Reserve will return for the next school year. We have no vacancy at the present time to which you could be appointed.

Browne,\nDirector, Junior Red Cross,\n410 Sherbourne St.,\nToronto 5, Ont.\nJuly 5, 1929.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nMiss MacNulty visited the Department today, and she reports that Miss Duggan, in the junior room, is not as successful as the former teacher. It might be advisable to consider a change here. I have examined the file and I note that her name was given to the Honourable the Superintendent General by J. L. Murray, of Renfrew.\n\nMiss MacNulty informs me that over 20 of our Canadian Indian children are in attendance at the convent at Hogansburg. This is a residential school. Occasionally our children take advantage of the bus service and go to the U.S. Government Day School at Hogansburg. When they get fed up down there, they return to our own school. When Mr. MacGibbon is being written regarding bolstering up the attendance and preventing Indian parents from annoying the teachers at the school, he should be informed that the practice of the pupils transferring from the Canadian to the United States Day School should cease.\n\nMr. MacGibbon should be informed that the Junior Red Cross activity is strongly supported by the Department.\n\nSubsequent conversation indicates that Miss Duggan has really failed to secure proper discipline in her classroom.\n\nMiss MacNulty will try to get Miss Duggan's resignation.\n\nRussell T.

(RG 10, Volume 6107, file 331-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, July 19, 1929.\n\nMadam:\n\nThe Department has been thinking of the future of the St. Regis Indian Day School, and I believe it advisable if you would consider transferring to somewhat easier work. I know that the discipline problem in the junior room is rather difficult of solution, and I believe that the services of a more experienced teacher are desirable. There is an opening at the Kaboni Indian Day School, on Manitoulin Island. The Department maintains a partly furnished teacher's residence there. The teacher would have to live alone, as the school is 6 miles from the nearest other Indian school and an equal distance from Manitowaning, where the Agent lives. I could offer a salary of $85 per teaching month.\n\nThere is also an opening at the Congo Bridge Indian Day School, 2\u00bd miles from Maniwaki, Que. The teacher would have to live at Maniwaki. The best that I could offer for this school would be what you received last year, viz., $60 per teaching month.\n\nThe Department would be glad to hear from you in the immediate future and would like to have an expression concerning your wishes for the coming academic year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Will you advise the teachers that parents should not be allowed in the school without your permission and will you, also, please arrange to accompany any Indians that you feel have reason for making a visit to the school?\n\nThere is still considerable truancy in the village and the Department requests you to bend every energy to keep the children in school. You should visit the homes of any delinquents and, if necessary, you should not hesitate to take action under Section 10 of the Indian Act.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Morris and Miss Robillard, who reside at the teacher's residence, St. Regis Village, request that I write the Department requesting that if permissible, that they be allowed to keep their schools open on Thanksgiving Day, November 11th, and in exchange to be off on leave November the 4th.\n\nAs All Saints Day comes on Friday, November 1st, and if they were allowed November 4th, this would give them ample leave to visit their homes, which they desire to do.\n\nAwaiting your instructions,\n\nI am,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.A. Mac Gibbon\nAgent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 27, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, relative to the request of three teachers of the St. Regis Reserve for permission to keep their schools open on Thanksgiving Day, November 11th, and to be granted leave of absence November 4th.\n\nIn connection with this request, I have to say that the department desires that its schools be taught during the regular teaching days. The first consideration is the interest of the Indian pupils. It has been found, where a change has been made in order to allow teachers to conduct school on statutory holidays, fast days and Thanksgiving Day, that the Indian parents in many cases object. It is, therefore, regretted that the department will be unable to comply with the request of the teachers at St. Regis for any change in the regular teaching period.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You have been made acquainted with Miss MacNulty, who is in charge of this school and of the teachers' residence, and it will not be necessary to repeat in this letter the instructions Mr. Ferrier has already given.

The Department accepts your resignation with regret and I am arranging for a successor, who will commence duties as soon after February first as possible. Mr. Indian Agent MacGibbon is being advised, and he will let you know when your successor will arrive.\n\nAs you were hopeful of being able to complete the academic year when you were in Ottawa at Christmas time, I write now to ask if you feel free to give a full report concerning the reasons why it is necessary for you to resign.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

You will be further advised in this connection. I should like to have a confidential report from you, concerning the real reasons why Miss Dubois finds it necessary to tender her resignation. When she was in Ottawa at Christmas time, she was in pretty good health, and, when she returned for duty on the 7th instant, she was hopeful that she would complete the academic year. Apparently, there must be some unstated reason for her resignation. Please make discreet enquiries and let the Department have a full report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. A. MacGibbon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis,\nP. Q.\nOttawa, January 16, 1931.\n\nMadam:\n\nPursuant to a resignation, there is now a vacancy in the junior room at the St. Regis Village Indian Day School, on the St. Lawrence river, opposite Cornwall, Ont. At this school, there two rooms, and, as there are two other Indian schools nearby, the Department has erected, in the Indian Village, a teachers' residence, accommodating all four of our school employees there. The present incumbents are Miss Margaret MacNulty, of Ashfield, Ont., and the Misses Bertha and Mary Fitzpatrick, whose home, I believe, is in Quebec, not far from Pembroke. The Fitzpatrick girls are your own age and Miss MacNulty is older. Miss MacNulty is principal of the Village two-roomed School and the Fitzpatrick sisters are employed at the rural schools.\n\nThe teacher of the junior room in the Village School has resigned. The Department has received good reports concerning your work at your present school, and, as your home is in Pembroke, I thought you might be interested in a transfer to St. Regis. A salary of $90 per teaching month would be allowed. The St. Regis School is in Quebec and it is only suitable for an Ontario qualified teacher who has already secured her permanency. I presume that, during the past year, you have secured your permanent certificate. Of course, experience in Quebec would not count on your permanency.\n\nThe St. Regis Village is in the extreme southwest corner of Quebec. It is right on the St. Lawrence river and is but 200 yards from the international border and one-half mile from Ontario. The best way to reach the school is not from Cornwall. One continues on the train to Nyando Junction, in New York State, and drives back to the St. Lawrence river. At St. Regis, there is a post office, a customs office, a hotel, stores, a Catholic church with resident priest and approximately 300 Indians.\n\nPlease give this offer careful consideration and, within 24 hours, send your answer by collect telegram to the Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell F.

I advised her that she had better see a doctor. On January, 13th, in the evening, Miss Dubois and Miss Mac Nulty went to Cornwall, and she, Miss Dubois was examined by a doctor (Dr. Gardner) as to the cause of the sore side. The doctor informed her that she had appendicitis, and advised her to discontinue teaching, go home and prepare herself for an operation. I may say that I did not know that Miss Dubois had went to a doctor, until yesterday, Jan. 19th, as they went over to Cornwall in the evening and returned the same evening.\n\nUpon talking to Miss Dubois, in regards to resigning, she stated that she would not have resigned, if she was in good health. She also stated, that due to her health coupled with rather heavy class duties, that she resigned.\n\nI have heard rumors, not from any of the teachers, but from outsiders, that the teachers residing at the residence find it rather hard at times to all agree, with respect to residential duties. Whether this reflects upon any one individual or not, I am not prepared to say. I do not interfere with private matters at the residence, as I don't think it would be good policy on my part, to do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nWhen I was in Ottawa you were speaking about requiring a teacher as Principal of, I think, St. Regis School, and I was wondering if the appointee would have to have a knowledge of French.\n\nIf not, I believe we could find you just the woman you want. This one is approaching 40, she has had considerable experience in various separate schools, (in which foreign children largely predominated), is very interested in her work, and is moreover, a capable teacher and an excellent disciplinarian.\n\nThis year she is not teaching at all so that I have not seen her at work personally, but I have heard her spoken of very highly by the different principals under whom she served. What I think happened was that she rather worked herself out, and, being above the average in ambition, got discouraged with results of which many would be proud. At any rate, she decided to \"quit\" teaching, even to go dishwashing. She is now working with a publishing house in Winnipeg. I shall be in Winnipeg in the next month or so, and would call and see her if you wished. I did not want to approach her, however, until I discovered whether French was essential, or whether you would hold the job for her.\n\nAlthough I do not know the lady personally, I should have no hesitation, from reports gathered from reliable sources, in recommending her for any school in my jurisdiction, and cannot promise not to coax her into one of my schools should occasion arise.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. J. Greening\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq., M.A.\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, February 7, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Greening:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to a teacher of considerable experience, who might be suitable to take charge of the Department's educational activity at St. Regis, Que. The French language is not essential at this school, and, if you are sure she would be a good mother to the younger teachers in the residence, as well as an efficient senior teacher in the two-roomed school in the village, you may tell her that the Department will engage her for one year, on probation. You may offer her from $90 to $105 per teaching month, whatever you really believe she is worth, and the smaller the initial salary, the more the increases if she does well.\n\nAs soon as you have had an interview with her, please write without delay, as I want to have plenty of time to secure a suitable teacher if she is not available. Of course, in your letter you should mention her qualifications, experience, etc.\n\nMany thanks for your interest and assistance.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

First, she pounds them with her fists. Secondly, that they pull their ears, which has caused much concern. One of the children, that has had this treatment, has been ruined. He is still suffering from the effects.\n\nThirdly, that she uses ink rulers, which have an iron through it. They use this on the children's hands, which many times cause cuts & sores.\n\nFourthly, is that the teacher expels children from school until their noses to come back then they send for the Indian agent to go for them, when they have them back.\nthey punish them. We know that this is no way to treat our children. We are putting this before you, that you may have this matter investigated. Otherwise we shall not leave our children go to school.\n\nAnother thing is that the teacher does not let the children run late between recess hours, and many of them come home with their clothes wet.\n\nWe demand this be investigated, and we prefer the teacher be changed. We want someone who will teach our children properly.

Miss Morris is known to you, as she has had previous experience at this school. She will commence duties on or about September first and will have charge of both rooms of the Village School.

Mac Donald, I beg to say, that I recall the incident.\n\nSometime in May, Mrs. Oake and daughter Mabel, called at the office (which was not the first time on school matters) complaining that the junior teacher, Miss. Mac Donald was ill using Mabel at school. That she had torn a dress that Mabel was wearing, and that she had struck Mabel with a stick or ruler.\n\nA day or so later, I interviewed Miss. Mac Donald in the matter, and who denied of having struck Mabel at all, or having torn her dress.\n\nIt is pretty hard for me to doubt the teacher's word.\n\nThere has been so much wrangling and quarrelling going on at the village school and residence among the teachers for the past four-five months, that it is hard for me to say, who is at fault in this school matter.\n\nOne thing I do know is, that when I was first shown the dress that was supposed to be torn, I took note of the damage done. A few days later, I visited Mrs. Oakes residence, making further enquiry in the matter. The dress was again shown me, and I noticed that the dress was torn as much again, as when the first time it was shown me.\n\nFor me, I would not put too much stock in the Oake's story, for they have been causing trouble very frequently in one way or another, in school matters.\n\nOf course, in the position I am in, I uphold the teacher as far as I can, for it would not do for me to side with the Indian in all school complaints, for if I did, it would not be long before many children would refuse to attend school, through their parents.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nAgent.\nOttawa, September 6th, 1933.\n\nSir,-\n\nMrs. Garrow and an Indian named Bonaparte, of the St. Regis Reserve, visited the Department today and stated that a married brother of Miss McDonald, together with his wife and child, are now residing at the St. Regis Village teachers' residence.

Donald, wife and child residing at St. Regis Village Teacher's residence, I beg to say that I have interviewed Miss. Morris, principal, and who informs me that a Mrs. Brooks, and two children, ages three and one years, are living with them at the residence.\n\nMiss. Morris and the other teachers have hired Mrs. Brooks as a house-keeper at the residence, and are paying her themselves, and considered this would be in order.\n\nMiss. Morris said that she did not think that this arrangement would be objectionable by the Department, and regrets in not asking the Department previous to their return to St. Regis.\n\nMiss. Morris intends visiting the Department the latter part of this week.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Deputy directed that a letter be written to Mr. Macgibbon for the purpose of obtaining definite information on this point.\n\nIf Mr. Brooks is living at the teachers' residence or visits his wife at more or less frequent intervals, the Department is not prepared to approve the continuance of Mrs. Brooks and her children residing at the teachers' residence.\n\nIt should not be inferred from the above that the Department has any objection to the teachers engaging a housekeeper if they so desire, but, for reasons that will readily suggest themselves, the Department does not wish to have a male person living at the teachers' residence for any length of time.\nOttawa, September 15, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, in which you state that Mrs. Brooks is acting as housekeeper for the four teachers using the residence on the St. Regis Reserve.\n\nYou do not state definitely in your letter whether or not Mrs. Brooks' husband is also residing there or if he visits the Reserve at intervals. I may say that Miss Morris visited the Department on Saturday and stated that Mr. Brooks was not living in the residence nor would he visit there. The Department would appreciate having a definite statement from you in this regard.\n\nThe Department has no objection to the teachers engaging a housekeeper if they so desire, but we could not give permission for any male person to live in the teachers' residence for any length of time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. A. MacGibbon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, P.Q.\nST REGIS COUNCIL MEETING HELD SEPT. 11TH, 1938.\n\nFirst matter discussed was in regards to a woman and two children living with the teachers at the residence in the village.\n\nThe Council and members present objected very strongly to having these white people reside on the reserve. If this woman and children were visitors of the teachers, there would be no objection, but to reside at the residence for the winter, as the understanding was, this could not be allowed. The council requested that these white people be asked to leave the reserve shortly.\n\nWith reference to a white woman and two children residing with the teachers, village residence, I beg to say that this matter was reported to you on the 11th inst.\n\nThe Indians object strongly in having these white people at the residence. I don't see otherwise than to ask them to leave the reserve, and wish to be advised on this matter.\n\nW. A. MacGibbon,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 21, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of minute of the St. Regis Council meeting held on the 11th instant, with reference to the housekeeper at present employed by the teachers in the residence at the St. Regis Village School.\n\nAs requested in official letter of the 15th instant, you should advise the Department whether or not Mr. Brooks is living in the residence or visits there.\n\nAs you were informed in the third paragraph of the above letter, the Department has no objection to the teachers engaging a housekeeper, if they so desire, but we are not prepared to give permission for any male person to live in the residence for any length of time. You should so inform the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. A. MacGibbon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, P.Q.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 18th inst. with further reference to a housekeeper at the teacher's residence, St. Regis Village, I beg to say that the only persons at the residence, in addition to the teachers are Mrs. Brooks and her two children. Mr. Brooks, the husband, accompanied his wife and children to the reserve on the 3rd of September, and left on the 6th, and does not intend to return to the reserve to live.\n\nIf Mrs. Brooks and family are going to stay at the residence, I would expect that the husband would visit his family occasionally.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Dec. 4th meeting.\n\nWith reference to the case of Arthur Oakes, expelled from the village school. I herewith enclose a report on A. Oakes behaviour, from his teacher Mary McDonald, also a letter handed in at the council meeting by Mrs. Richard Oakes, regarding the matter.\n\nArthur Oakes is 14 years of age, a large boy for his age, and from reports from the village school teachers, has a bad influence on the other children.\n\nMrs. Oakes is willing and would be glad if her son Arthur could be placed at a residential school, at Spanish if possible, as recommended by the Council.\n\nW. A. MacGibbon,\nAgent.\nOttawa, December 23, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your letter of the 11th instant, with copies of correspondence attached regarding the case of Arthur Oakes, who has been expelled from the St. Regis Village Indian Day School. If this boy is not amenable to discipline, the teachers may refuse to allow him to attend. It would appear, from the correspondence, that the teachers have given this boy every opportunity.\n\nWith reference to the mother's request that the boy be placed in a residential school, I have to say that, at the present time, there are no vacancies at the Spanish Indian Residential School. The boy can remain at home until such time as it may be possible to have him placed in a residential school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. A.

After the last attack of Tonsilitis I saw a Specialist in Ottawa, Dr. Ravary. He advised me to have my tonsils out at once.\n\nAs the doctor advised a two week's rest and more if possible after the operation, I decided that if you will permit me to have the last two weeks in December off, I could have my operation on the tenth. That would allow me almost four weeks rest before using my voice again.\n\nIt is necessary to talk a great deal in teaching Junior pupils and that is why I would like to have the operation just before Christmas. It would give me a good rest before beginning school again.\n\nMiss McDonald will keep my class at school during that time. I shall leave work prepared for the pupils.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nFrances Morris.\nOttawa, December 4, 1934.\n\nMadam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo, I beg to say that the Department approves leave of absence for you as teacher of the St. Regis Village Indian Day School from December 10th, in order that you may have an operation on your throat.\n\nIt will not be possible to pay for any substitute teacher during the last two weeks of the term.

Consequently,\n\n- it has not\nit has not been our policy to dispense with the services of teachers who are doing satisfactory work. Reports regarding the five teachers mentioned above indicate that good progress is being made at each of the schools. As far as I am aware at the present time, none of these five teachers intend to give up duties at the end of the current academic year and, therefore, there will not likely be any vacancy to which a new teacher could be appointed.\n\nI attach Mr. Black's letter.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMR.

The latter was appointed on September 1st, 1932, and has an Ontario Second Class Certificate. The Inspector states: \"The school is well managed.

When such is the case, I feel that it is not in the best interests of the work to make any change.

Councillor Boneparte complained that the children of the village were not receiving sufficient homework to do. He thought, if more homework was given the children would make better progress. Chief John J. Peters spoke in the same strain regarding Cornwall Island West school.\n\nI have spoken with Miss McDonald, Principal of the St Regis village Indian day school regarding the matter and was advised that the trend now is to not give too much homework excepting possibly near an exam period.\n\nD.P.

I did so - they asked me to find out the cost of a short course. I discussed this with the Superior - the Director of Courses at Ste. Marie, - they are willing to arrange a 2-weeks course for weaving only, for a group of not less than eight - from June 27 to July 9. The cost of board, lodging & tuition would be only extra is for $15 for the two weeks, materials used.\n\nThe group would have the cottage.\nacross from the convent, & as Ste. Martine is on the St. Lawrence River, it is pleasantly located.\n\nIf you think well of it, will you please send this information to each of the lady teachers at Sr. Regis agency? There are the six girls \u2014 they probably could make up the group of eight from among their friends. I have written Miss Macdonald suggesting that if Miss Legarde is not celebrated she might let Legarde take the course \u2014 also Miss Harris to take the course. As the Superior's wife of the Mountie should know by about the 12th if a group is coming, could you have letters in the mail Thursday or Friday? The girls said they'd take it if the course didn't cost them too much, & they certainly won't mind $15.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am thinking she has the makings of a good teacher. She is a widow with one child dependent upon her. This fact would have some bearing on her attentiveness to the duties of the position.\n\nHowever the above is just for your information. Mrs Daoust address is 5563 Rosemount, Montreal Quebec.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nONTARIO\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\n\nTORONTO, August 23, 1939.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI beg leave to state that you fulfilled\nthe attendance requirements and passed the final examinations\nof Part I of the Summer Course conducted by the Ontario\nDepartment of Education at Ottawa leading to the Elementary\nManual Training Type B certificate.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nAssistant Deputy Minister.\n\nMiss Mary T.

The last letter that we received from you regarding Miss Terrance was dated February 6 and at that time you considered that her services were satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. D. P. McNaughton,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\nOttawa, March 27, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am sending forward herewith copy of a letter signed by Mary Mitchell, an Indian of the St. Regis Reserve, and also copy of a statement signed by Claude Hall, M.D. The original of this correspondence was sent forward to the Department by Mr. Lionel Chevrier, M.P.\n\nThe Department is anxious to know if Mary Mitchell visited you with her daughter on a certain date and, if so, what action you took in respect to the charges made by her at that time. In view of the fact that a number of complaints have recently reached the Department in respect to Miss Billings' classroom work and her conduct on and off the reserve, it will be necessary for you to make a thorough investigation of these charges and any other charges that may have reached you regarding this teacher's work during the last year. In your report you should express an opinion with respect to the desirability of having an official from the Department investigate the conduct of Miss Billings and conditions generally at the St. Regis Village School. It is of the utmost importance that you should undertake this investigation immediately and report at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMr. D. P. McNaughton,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\nCornwall, Feb. 18, 1941.\n\nTo whom it may concern:\n\nAt the request of Mrs. Mary Mitchell, St. Regis, Que., I did examine her daughter Annabelle and find that she has a discoloration of aduxia (?) of left eye, apparently from a blow of some kind. Her son, Joseph Mitchell, has blood stained and swollen right ear.\n\nNow, Mrs. Mitchell told me that these injuries are due to injuries inflicted by the school teacher. I think this should be investigated.\n\n(sgd.) Claude Hall, M.D.\nSt. Regis, Que.,\nMarch 14, 1941.\n\nTo Whom it may concern:\n\nI'm now obliged to take this case up against the teacher, Miss Billings. She is going too far in beating children - similar case has happened previous to this - it was last winter in February. She pushed Wilma against the desk, hurt her side and this child was in the hospital before this. She had an operation on her side and I'm quite positive the teacher knows. I went and told her that I didn't want the child to be handled rough. Well, she said, it wouldn't happen again. In March it was Annabelle; the teacher said as the children were coming out of school for dinner, dragged her on ice at school yard; this didn't satisfy her; in the afternoon when the child got back to school, she was again beaten up again; this time the teacher made a good job of it. The child's face was swollen black and blue, one side of her face; then after beating her up to her satisfaction she told the child to go home, little, as she is, only 11 years old. Any common person could lick her properly without injury.\n\nAlso my boy told me some day this winter that the teacher scratched his ears when she tried to pull it; he caught cold on it and there is still sore to it. I took Annabelle to the Agent, McNaughton, to see the child's face himself. He just said: \"I got a note from the teacher, I'll see her\". So then I took the children, Jos. and Annabelle to Dr. Hall in Cornwall. He wrote the note I'm enclosing. I asked him what I should do. He told me to see a lawyer, so I did. The lawyer told me to show the note to Mr. McNaughton, if he doesn't do anything, then come back. I showed the note to McNaughton. He just said: \"Oh, forget it, it was like that when I was going to school\".\n\nThe teacher is always late in the morning, when the man she goes out with brings her back in the mornings, they even missed school 3 days in one week some time ago; she claimed she was sick.\n\nIf there's any more complaints you want you'll get it. I personally don't want such a teacher.\n\nI'm yours truly,\n\n(sgd.) Mary Mitchell.\nHOUSE OF COMMONS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, March 19, 1941.\n\nW. J. F.

So Mrs. Garnet demanded a ward or someone to work there that Mrs. Layton had such sore legs she was unable to walk and had big family.\n\nSo I was asked by Mr. McKeown himself if I take the job. I said yes, he offered me $25 a week, I said no, it wasn't enough, there was so much work to be done for the big family. I asked for at least $30 a week, he agreed to pay that. I said will I start right away? he said yes, start in the morning. I went immediately anywhere and done just other work. Worked a week and want to demand my pay as I work for living depend on what little I make. Mrs. McKeown then wouldn't give me relief if I asked fairly. Well, when I asked for my pay he said, go, collect your pay from Mrs. Garnet, he said he didn't hire me, I said you did.\n\nWhatever were the Councilors, Mrs. Garnet was there only to demand help for the poor Annie Layton.\n\nSo when will I get my $30?

J. F. Pratt\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nLionel Chevrier, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\n\nRAH\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Complaint - Mrs. Mary Mitchell\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 27th., with enclosure, a complaint against the teacher Miss Billings, of the Junior room, St. Regis Village Indian Day School.\n\nMrs. Mitchell visited at this office on the morning of Feb. 18/41, advising me of trouble between her daughter Annabelle and the teacher. She showed me her daughter's face, which was bruised on the cheek. I took the girl to the light of a large window. The bruise did not appear to be of a serious nature. Mrs. Mitchell would not visit the dispensary, saying, she would see her own doctor. She complained that the teacher had used her daughter too rough and that it was no way to whip a child, leaving bruises. I told her that I had a note from Miss Billings advising me that she had had trouble with one of her pupils, and, that I would investigate and learn just what the trouble was and the cause.\n\nI visited the school in the company of the local R.C.M.P. Police officer, and learned of the happenings from the teacher and some of the children.\n\nThe teacher informed me that Annabelle Mitchell had taken her seat at 1:30 P.M. with her outdoor garments, coat, hat, etc., still on. She was asked to remove them, which she would not do. The teacher went to the girl's seat in an endeavour to have them removed, telling the girl she would receive a whipping if she did not obey. The girl still refused and would not hold her hand for the whipping. The teacher tried to whip her on the legs but the girl fought her. The teacher told me that the girl hit her in the face and kicked her on the legs. She tried to push the girl by standing her in the corner but the girl fought back and would not go. In the scuffle the girl pulled away from the teacher and the force threw her against the chalk trough of the black board.\n\nI then turned to the class room and asked if any of the pupils who saw the trouble between the teacher and the Mitchell girl would tell me just what they saw, advising them not to be afraid and tell me the truth. Miss Billings made the remark to the effect that if I doubted her, I thought it best to hear what any of the children had to say.\n\nThree children, Doris Standfield, Mabel Thomas and Cecelia Swamp, raised their hands and in turn corroborated the teacher's statement of what had happened. What I learned showed that the trouble was primarily the girl's fault, through disobedience, refusing to take punishment, fighting the teacher, and that the injury was not through a blow direct from the teacher.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\nLater I followed up my investigation by a visit to the home of Mrs. Mitchell, who had refused to let her children attend school. I told her what I had learned and endeavored to show her that discipline in the school had to be maintained; that unruly children allowed to carry on unpunished would soon disrupt the whole class.\n\nMrs. Mitchell appeared to concur in the views I expressed and when I left she agreed that her children would return to school. She seemed satisfied with my investigation, and the matter appeared to be settled. The trouble did not seem to me serious enough for a special report to the Department.\n\nI have not had any complaints by other parents about the teacher. Her class work has been very good and discipline, with the exception of this instance and one previously with the same girl, has been excellent. The other instance referred to happened, as near as I can recollect, during October 1939. In my absence, Mr. Harris, who was constable here then, went after this girl who ran away from her class. Advising me about it he said the girl had fought him all the way back to the school. He advised the teacher that she was a bad girl and deserved a good whipping.\n\nI did not have one complaint while Miss Billings was teaching at the Chenaill school. Of course, the children of the village school contain some who are more or less unruly. Probably this is natural as they are more congregated. But I would not say there is undue trouble in this way.\n\nI would sum this affair up as just an incident that might happen to any teacher in the correction of any unruly pupil. It is too bad that such things happen, but they have a way of cropping up.\n\nYou ask if it would be necessary for an official of the Department to investigate the conduct of Miss Billings and conditions generally in connection with the village school.\n\nThe conditions in connection with the village school have been very good, they have been under good management. I would not think there is any such condition that warrants an investigation by an official of the Department.\n\nAs regards the conduct of Miss Billings, on and off the Reserve. The conduct of Miss Billings on the reserve has been all that one would expect from any lady. As to her conduct off the Reserve, I have heard, neither do I know of anything detrimental to her character. Naturally one would expect a person so situated on an Indian Reserve, to find some association and recreation off the reserve, but as long as such does not affect the prestige of a teacher or the proper performance of her duties, they should be considered as personal and private. I have suggested that Miss Billings take this angle up with your office herself.\n\nI note that Mrs. Mitchell says that the teacher was absent for three continuous days.\n\nMrs. Mitchell...........\nMrs. Mitchell is absolutely in error. Our records do not show such to be the case. Attendance report shows Miss Billing absent 14 days during the last quarter. We have no copy of the teacher's quarterly report but your copy could be checked for verification. If such were the case, it could not pass unnoticed as I have one child attending the Sr. room and the local R.C.M.P. officer has one child attending the Jr. room, of the village school.\n\nIn passing I notice that you refer to a statement signed by Claude Hall M.D. which as advised, was not enclosed with your letter.\n\nI hope that this report covers the matter as fully as you require and that it serves your purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 15, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI desire to refer to Mr. Pratt's memorandum of March 21 with reference to Miss U. Billings, teacher of the St. Regis Village Indian Day School.\n\nFor your information I attach a copy of a letter which has just been received from Indian Agent McNaughton.\n\nMiss Billings visited the Department on April 10 and the incident was fully discussed with her. She stated very definitely that she did not strike the girl but that in reaching for her the Mitchell girl turned quickly and hit her face against the blackboard.\n\nThis incident occurred on February 17, 1941, and the girl returned to the school on February 24, 1941, and has been attending regularly since that time. The teacher has had no further trouble with her. Miss Billings stated very definitely that the Mitchell family was the only one with which she has had any trouble during the six years in which she has been teaching at St. Regis.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\nOttawa,\nApril 4, 1941.\n\nDear Miss Billings:\n\nCertain complaints have reached us recently with regard to your treatment of one child at least at the St. Regis School and it is very important that I should have an opportunity of discussing the matter with you at an early date.

For origin of this case please refer to reports re above dated 22-10-42 and 10-11-42. On this particular occasion accused was absent from School from November 24th, to December 10th, 1942. About 3 PM November 24th, last while the Teacher Miss Rita CAZA of the Primary Room St. Regis Village Mission Day School was punishing his younger Brother accused called the Teacher a son-of-a-bitch then jumped through the School window to the ground and ran away. Efforts were made by both the Father Angus BONAPARTE Sr. and the undersigned to have the boy returned to School without avail as he left home and would spend the nights with one or another Indian Family finally resorting to sleeping in the barns and Haylofts. Finally the Father Angus BONAPARTE Sr. found him about 6:30 AM 11-12-42 sleeping in the hay loft of Angus OAKE (Indian) St. Regis P.Q. 2. The Father stating that he wished to have the Boy brought before the Juvenile Court at Valleyfield P.Q. This was done the same AM, the trip being made via undersigned's Pte Car as Cornwall Det Car not available. Troop taken to Valleyfield being Angus BONAPARTE Sr. Complainant, Homer BONAPARTE accused, Miss Rita CAZA School Teacher and undersigned as witnesses in the case.

Angus BONAPARTE Sr., testifying as to the boy's conduct around the house, his returning to the village, his tendency to try to work to steal articles from the home and beat up the other younger children there also as to the boy going to the store and obtaining goods there on the Father's charge account without his permission. Further to the boy's general conduct in staying away from home and of the Father's efforts to have the boy stay at home.\n\nThe undersigned testified as to the boy's general conduct around the village and how he evaded efforts to have him returned to school by various means including crossing over the International Line. Also as to statement given by him to the New York State Police in this Det. Office wherein he admitted theft of a sum of money from Andrew SMOKE who operates a Poolroom close to but on the American side of the Line. Please refer to report dated 22-10-42 for full statement. At this time the case was adjourned to 10 AM, 18-12-42. Juvenile Court Judge Andre REGNEIR stating that he would pass sentence that date at the same time remarking that it would not be necessary for Mr. BONAPARTE and the undersigned to be present on that date, at that time it appeared that it was only a matter of decision which institution the boy should be committed to. Accused being remanded in the custody of Mr O. AUMAIS of Valleyfield P.Q. We returned to St.Regis Det at 4.40 PM.\n\nLate PM, of the 16th Inst I was advised that Mr Ostiguy Sheriff of Valleyfield had called while I was out regarding the case. I called Mr OSTIGUY by Long Distance Phone and he informed me that the Juvenile Judge had requested him to advise Angus BONAPARTE Sr. and the undersigned to attend Court 10 AM 18-12-42.\n\n7.15 AM, Mr BONAPARTE and the undersigned patrolled to Valleyfield P.Q. Via the undersigned's Pte Car as the Cornwall Det Car was not available. On Juvenile Court being opened Mr O. Aumais of Valleyfield P.Q. gave evidence for the boy's defence giving the boy a very good name basing his observations on the one weeks knowledge of the boy. The Juvenile Judge stated that he had talked to the boy on a number of occasions during the week and that he did not consider the boy had also that the Teacher should be patient with him. He then Suspended Sentence and when asked what his \"sentence\" was, Judge REGNEIR stated for any time if he at anytime comes back and is convicted he will then be sentenced for both that offence and this one. Angus and Homer BONAPARTE then returned to St.Regis with me arriving here at 1.30 PM.\n\nAngus BONAPARTE Sr. paid the Court Fees amounting to $12.00 also supplied meals for the undersigned and Miss CASA (Witness). Further he has paid me voluntarily the sum of $7.98 being mileage for one of the two trips to Valleyfield Det. House. For which amount Cash Receipt No. 3621/15 was issued and which will be forwarded in due course. This leaves an unspent expenditure of $7.98 representing 114 miles Pte Car Mileage @ 0.07 per mile, or one half of the Pte Car mileage incurred in this case. Expenses will be shown on Form 93 for the periods December 1st, to 15th, and December 16th, to 31st, 1942.\n\nCASE CONCLUDED - \"CONVICTION\".\n\nD.D. 7-1-42.\nSts Regis, P.Q.\n22-12-42.\n\nIndian Affairs.

REGIS AGENCY FOR MONTH OF JANUARY, 1943.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nSchools reopened on January 4th., throughout the Agency. Attendance during the month has been very good considering weather conditions. Difficulty was experienced in finding seating capacity for children attending some of the schools but this situation has been remedied towards the close of the month. By switching some double seats to some of the schools and making replacements with singles it has been found possible to make seating room available at all schools. At St. Regis Village Jr. room and Cornwall Island Wes., while seating in now available, there are really too many children attending for one teacher to handle and yet accomplish the work set out in the curriculum.\n\nD.P. McNaughton,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA, Can.\n\nOn January 5th., 1940 we wrote you concerning Miss Terrance, teacher, who is now employed at the Chenail School. In this letter we outlined the difficulties experienced by this teacher in getting to and from her work while at the village school since she was not apparently very welcome at the village teachers' residence.\n\nThe situation this winter for this particular teacher is, to say the least, many times worse than when she taught at the village school. This being due to the severe weather experienced throughout this region all during the winter to date. The results being that she has missed school on many occasions and will no doubt be unable to get to the Chenail school from her home quite often during the remaining term. The family car, which her sister used to drive her from home to St. Regis has been wrecked for some time now and many times this teacher has had to walk this distance which is approximately five miles one way. There is no place that Miss Terrance can live on the reserve and be nearer her school with the exceptions of the teachers' residence in the village. It is difficult to tell Miss Terrance that she is not wanted there but such is certainly the case and has been told me in no uncertain terms despite the information contained in yours of Jan.9/40 which has been conveyed to the present staff of the village school.\n\nAs Miss Terrance has asked me to find a place for her to stay in the village and I am unable to get Miss McDonald to even see the thing in a reasonable light, I would ask your immediate direction in the matter as I do not wish to place anyone in such an embarrassing position as Miss Terrance is bound to find herself should she sleep at the residence under the present circumstances. Miss Terrance intends to take her meals at a local Indian home.\nhomes, so it is not a question of eating at the residence. At least that is what I am given to understand.\n\nIncidentally I might mention that I have been advised by Miss McDonald that if Miss Terrance come to the residence I would have two teachers to find. On the other hand when I put the question to Miss Caza, the remaining teacher at the residence she replied \"Oh sure, Yes\" in reply to whether she would be agreeable to having Miss Terrance at the residence.\n\nUnder the circumstances I do not feel I should act in the matter until further direction from your office.\n\nD.P. McNaughton\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 22, 1943.\n\nMr. D.P. McNaughton, Indian Agent, St. Regis, Que.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to living accommodation for Miss Terrance, teacher of the Chenail Indian Day School.\n\nIt is difficult for the Department to understand the attitude that Miss McDonald has adopted. You might point out to her that she is not the owner of the teachers' residence in St. Regis Village. This building is owned by the Department and consequently it is our privilege to specify who shall use the accommodation that is provided. This building was erected for a residence for the teachers of certain Indian schools on the St. Regis Reserve and, as Miss Terrance is one of these teachers, she is entitled to receive accommodation in the building. I note that in the event of Miss Terrance living in the residence she will obtain her meals at another house. I trust that the Department will not hear anything further regarding this matter other than a report from you to the effect that Miss Terrance has taken up residence in the teachers' residence.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nJuly 2, 1943.\n\nMr. D.F. McNaughton, Indian Agent, St. Regis, Que.\n\nI am anxious to know at once if the teachers at all the Indian day schools in the St. Regis Agency have signified their intention of returning to their duties for the academic year 1943-44. If any of the teachers intend to resign, please let me know their names immediately.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nRev. Mother M. Leopoldine\nSisters of Ste Anne\nMolten House\nLachute\nLachine\nQuebec\nOttawa,\nJuly 21, 1943.\n\nReverend and dear Mother:\n\nWe have been considering for some time past the possibility of having Sisters take charge of the St. Regis Village School. Two Sisters would be required. We also have a very comfortable residence located close to the school. This particular building was originally erected to provide accommodation for four teachers. Consequently, if we engaged two Sisters and if they took a housekeeper with them, there would be plenty of room for all three.\n\nYou are aware of the location of the St. Regis Reserve and the Indians from this reserve are in and out of the United States very frequently. As a result the only language of instruction necessary in this school is English.\n\nMr. Hoey is absent from the office at the present time on his holidays, but I have discussed the matter several times with him in the past few months and I know that he would also like to see Sisters in charge of this school. My purpose in writing to you is to ascertain if the Sisters of Ste. Anne would be interested in taking over this school. Salary for the teacher of the senior room would be at the rate of $105.00 a teaching month and for the teacher of the junior room $85.00 a teaching month -- at least these are the salaries we are paying at the present time. It would be appreciated if you would give the matter your careful consideration and let me hear from you as soon as convenient.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Mother M. Leopoldine,\nSisters of Ste. Anne,\nMother House,\nLachine, Que.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nJuly 31, 1943.\n\nMr. D.P. McNaughton, Indian Agent, St. Regis, Que.\n\nThe Department has decided to place the Sisters of Saint Anne in charge of the St. Regis Village School and I understand the Sisters will be in St. Regis on Monday, August 2, to look over the teachers' residence. You should give them the key and extend every possible assistance to them.\n\nI will write you next week regarding Miss Caza.

She will be assisted by a second teacher in the person of Sister Dorothy-Marie.\n\nBoth appointees have already had some experience in dealing with Indian children, the former having spent ten years of her teaching career with the Indians of Caughnawaga, and the latter having been in the same mission for the past two and one-half years.\n\nI visited the teachers' residence last week and found the house quite satisfactory. Some of the furnishings however cannot serve our purpose and would have to be replaced. This is especially true of the beds as I am most eager that the Sisters be made comfortable during their hours of rest.\n\nPlease inform us as to the correct procedure to follow in order to obtain provision of these necessities. Should we forward to you our requisition for the articles needed, or should we expect your authorization to make the necessary purchases ourselves.\n\nAn early reply from you would be greatly appreciated as it would favor the proper organization of school and residence before the opening of classes.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperior-General\nOttawa,\nAugust 9, 1943.\n\nReverend and dear Sister:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant and Mr. Hoey and I are pleased to note that the Sisters of Saint Ann are prepared to take charge of the St. Regis Village School.\n\nWith reference to the fourth paragraph of your letter, please let me know the additional furnishings that are needed and arrangements will be made to secure them through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nI enclose the necessary forms which Sister Mary Zita and Sister Dorothy Marie should complete and return.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

REGIS AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER, 1943.\n\nSchools;\n\nThe staff of the various schools in the Agency were on hand to open school on the appointed date. It was not possible however to open the village School on the 1st., due to workmen being engaged in painting. Considerable attention is given by the Truant Officer in the matter of children being absent from school. Such is necessary in order to keep attendance at a reasonable level. A great many children were absent during the month due to being engaged in harvesting vegetables on a large farm in nearby N.Y. State where the entire crop would have been lost by frost if help was not made available.\n\nD.P. McNaughton,\nIndian Agent.\nSt. Regis, Que.\nMarch 13th., 1944.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq. Supt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRe: Freeman Jacobs AND Lawrence Benedict\n\nThe above are children attending the Junior Room of the St. Regis Village School. Jacobs is 13 and Benedict is 12 years of age. Both should have been out of the Junior room long ago.\n\nDuring the past four years I have had to reprimand young Jacobs for various acts of misbehaviour. He is a ring-leader in everything that pertains to deviltry at school and away from school. So far, with this exception, Benedict has kept out of trouble.\n\nLast week at the village school, while the Principal and Cat. Meagher RCMP, left the Junior room, these young boys exposed their person to the entire class of small children numbering about 30 pupils. It is our understanding that Freeman Jacobs did the act first and prompted Benedict to follow him. Peter Jacobs, the father, has whipped this boy on many occasions but he never appears to profit any. This boy's mother has left the household some months ago and the father is left with small children. To earn a living he is away from the reserve mostly the entire day.\n\nAs this sort of behaviour cannot be tolerated at school I would recommend that the R.C.M.P. Police be authorized to take Jacobs before the Juvenile Court at Valleyfield and that a recommendation be made to the court to place this boy in a corrective institution for at least one year. For the benefit of the Court it should be mentioned that the Department will defray expenses of this boy's maintenance in the institution confined. In the course of a few days you will receive a detailed report from the R.C.M.P. on this case.\n\nT.L. Bohman\nClerk in charge.\nOttawa,\nMarch 20, 1944.\n\nMr. T.L. Bonnah, In Charge Indian Agency, St. Regis, Que.\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to Freeman Jacobs and Lawrence Benedict.\n\nThe Department feels that another effort should be made to control these boys and we would be prepared to consider placing them in the Spanish Residential School some time in August. I am inclined to feel that if they were placed in any other institution little improvement would be effected in their conduct.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, April 18, 1944.\n\nMr. T. L. Bonnah, In Charge, Indian Agency,\nSt. Regis, Que.\n\nI desire to refer you to official letter of March 20, with reference to Freeman Jacobs and Lawrence Benedict. The Department has just received the report of the R.C.M.P., dated March 18. Evidently, the Jacobs boy is the worse of the two. Has there been any improvement in his conduct since I communicated with you in the letter mentioned above? Is he going to school?\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSt. Regis, Que.\nApril 20th., 1944.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq. Chief, Training Division.\n\nReceipt is hereby acknowledged of your letter of the 18th, dealing with the above file.\n\nI might advise there is an improvement in Freeman Jacobs since the incident under consideration took place. This, of course, could be reasonably expected. I cannot say, however, if the improvement will continue but I am hopeful that another incident of this nature will not occur. The boy in question is attending the village school. During the past week his attendance has been pretty good but previous to that was bad.\n\nI cannot say as yet whether or not the latest development in the boy's home life has been a help or not but the mother has returned from Syracuse and the father moved out of the house with Freeman (the boy he claims parental responsibility for) and the mother is left with the remaining children whom are now living in a house left the mother from an estate.\n\nAgent\n\nIndian Affairs.

REGIS INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OCTOBER, 1944.\n\n3.\n\nThe attendance in the Junior Room of the Village School shows a small increase over the previous month. The attendance in the Senior Room, however, has not been so good, this being due to the fact that in previous years many of the children from the Senior Room were in the habit of going to Malone to work during the vegetable harvest. While this office is definitely not in favor of such a practice in any of our schools, I have found it very difficult to effect a reversal of previous policy in this matter. Conditions with this respect in regard to the Chenail schools is especially bad. Due to the organizational work being instituted for the children of the village, we expect an improvement in the attendance record for this school in the near future.\n\nW.L.

May there be any exceptions to this rule?\n\nThere are at the present, in St. Regis Village School pupils who are not fit to be with the others, pupils of very bad conduct who seem to take no interest in anything whatever. They are a continual disturbance to the others. They do all in their power to distract the others from their work. If they are reprehended they are exceedingly bold, they use very bad language, they are a source of bad example to the smaller pupils who are tempted to follow their example.\n\nThese boys are:\n\n| Age | Day of Birth | Father's name |\n|-----|--------------|---------------|\n| 13  | Jan. 24 1932 | Angus         |\n| 14  | May 2 1931  | David         |\n| 11  | Sept. 20 1933 | Isaiah       |\n| 14  | Nov. 11 1930 | Angue         |\n| 14  | Jan. 22 1931 |              |\n\nThere is hope that if these pupils are allowed to stay away from school there will be a big improvement among the Others.

Theresa  \nTeacher\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nYou will find enclosed a letter from Sister Mary Theresa, teacher at the Senior room of the St. Regis Village School, which she has asked me to forward to your office.\n\nYou will note the names of five boys who have been causing disturbances in this school. You will see that the ages given demonstrate that these boys should be attending school, both under the Indian Act and under the Family Allowance Act. We have repeatedly ordered these boys to go to school, only to have the teacher, in turn, order them out of the classroom for misconduct. The first three boys have expressed a desire to go to school, and their fathers also want them to go, but they seem incapable of settling down to study when they are in school.\n\nWe are in need of a definite ruling from your office as to whether, in cases of seemingly intractable youngsters, they should be suspended from school because of misconduct, or compelled to go to school under the above-mentioned regulations.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

Bonnah, Indian Agent, St. Regis, Quebec.\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant with reference to five boys in the St. Regis Village School.\n\nOne of the boys mentioned in Sister's letter is only 11 years of age and the others are 14 or younger. It is difficult for the Department to understand why they cannot be properly disciplined. If children are to be sent home every time discipline cannot be maintained, I am inclined to feel that an impossible situation might arise.\n\nIt might help to bring the parents of these boys to the school after school hours and have a frank discussion between them, the Principal of the school and yourself. The Staff at St. Regis School should exercise their authority and should not simply send any pupil home.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa\n\nWe have received your letter of August 30 together with staff questionnaire form for Sister Mary Theresa of the village school.\n\nThe form was given to Sr. Theresa to fill out and she has returned it to your office directly.\n\n[Signature]\nT.

McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\nQuarterly Report\nSt. Regis Indian Agency\n\nSchools:\n\nBelow is the percentage of attendance of our schools during the quarter under review:\n\n| School                  | December | November | October |\n|-------------------------|----------|----------|---------|\n| Cornwall Ild. E. School | 58.7     | 61.6     | 77.8    |\n| Cornwall W.             | 61       | 88       | 88      |\n| Village School - Senior | 71.6     | 88.1     | 87.8    |\n| \" - Junior              | 67.3     | 94.2     | 91      |\n| Chenail School          | 60       | 94       | 90.9    |\n| Chenail                 | 93       | 94.2     | 91      |\n| St. Regis Island        | 76.6     | 67.5     | 77.09   |\n\nIt will be noted in some cases very low average for December. This is due to the flu epidemic mostly. In general it can be said that attendance at the various schools has maintained a high level. Such a high percentage is particularly noteworthy at the Chenail school where it was difficult to get the boys to school. The reverse is now the case as far as the boys are concerned. With the exception of the Cornwall Island East school no manual training is carried on. The village boys get the benefit of some training along this line when such is possible with the time at the disposal of the local constable. With only one man now stationed here less time can be devoted to such work among the boys. Due to the poor freezing of the St. Lawrence this winter it has not been possible during December to get to St. Regis Island School. Ice conditions are such that it is not safe to walk nor can a boat be used. Only emergency trips are made by the Indian residents of the island.\n\nIn general the children on the whole appear to be well-behaved and industrious. There is very little incentive for those children in our Quebec schools to devote much energy to studies after they reach the age of 15 as the prospect of being able to attend a high school is no better than in most years. The hard period to keep those children at school is between the age of 15 and 16. The boys in particular just wont exert themselves too much after 15. This situation is most unfortunate as they have just reached a point in life when they should be capable of absorbing some knowledge. I feel though that if we could give them the kind of training they would like at this period we would be well repaid and would not have any attendance problem on our hands to contend with.\n\nT.L. Bonnah,\nIndian Agent.\nSt. Regis Village,\n33-6-1\n\nSt. Ann's Convent,\nSt. Regis Box 1045,\nCornwall, May 28, 1946.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nThis letter is to inform you that I have asked the Mother in Lachine to give us another Sister for the coming year. As you have seen by our Acquisition we have to teach Domestic Science, Needlework, Home Economics, etc., etc., as these subjects are required by Grades 7th and 8th. It is also an absolute necessity to have Music and Singing for our pupils. So far, we have no musical instrument.\n\nWith the increase that we expect in Sept. and so many Grades in each class, no two Teachers can possibly do the work alone. When the little ones\ncome in, for the first time, they do not understand a word of English. They require special attention, and the other children suffer for the time being.\n\nNow dear Mr. Phelan, I promise you that I shall have the teacher, if you back me up by paying her a salary. I feel confident that you will do your utmost in this time of need, and comply with my request. It is all for the betterment of the children.\n\nAn immediate answer will be greatly appreciated by the Mothers in Lachine, who are now placing the Sisters in the different Missions for 1946-1947. St. Regis must not be left out.\n\nThanking you beforehand,\n\nI remain,\n\nGratefully yours,\nSister Mary Zita, S.S.A.\nOttawa, June 11th, 1946.\n\nSister Mary Zeta, S.S.A.,\nSt. Regis, Box 1045,\nCornwall, Ontario.\n\nDear Sister Zeta:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to employing a third teacher to St. Regis Village Indian Day School.\n\nI would appreciate very much if you would discuss the whole matter with Indian Agent, Bonnah.\n\nMr. Doucet and I have considered your proposal, but your letter is not sufficiently explanatory. There are only two class rooms at St. Regis Village Day School, and it is not feasible to consider erecting another class room this year.\n\nNo doubt, you have some plan for handling the school, if a third teacher were appointed. For that reason, I would like you to discuss the matter with Mr. Bonnah, to whom a copy of this letter is being sent.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, June 11th, 1946.\n\nMr. T.L. Bonnah, Indian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Quebec.\n\nI enclose for your information a copy of the letter sent to the Principal of the St. Regis Village Indian Day School. It is a reply to a letter from Sister Zeta pointing out that the teaching of Domestic Science, sewing, and Home Economics, etc., require the services of a third teacher.\n\nI wish you would discuss the whole matter with her and let me have your reply as soon as possible so that if it is decided to allow a third teacher, we would be in a position to notify the Mother General of the Sisters of St. Ann's.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of June 11th concerning teaching of Domestic Science, etc., at the St. Regis Village Day School. There is no doubt but that the teaching of the subject under consideration by Sister Zita would be most beneficial to the children of the Village School. As you know, a limited amount of work was done along these lines up to 3 or 4 years ago. I note, however, that the subject under consideration would appear to apply only to the girls of the Village School and that consideration has not been given to Manual Training exercises for the boys. Concerning the latter, I might advise you that Constable Gillis is no longer with us and I am unable, myself, to devote any attention to the young boys going to school.\n\nI do not think that any question has been raised regarding the building of an additional class-room. Personally, I would not even make a suggestion along these lines without giving the matter much thought as I am not in favour of the present school location whatever. You are probably aware that the band has purchased a building near our office and that I have it equipped to serve the needs of our Homemakers' Clubs as well as some of the activities of the children. If arrangements could be made with the Welfare officials to use the equipment for cooking I have no objection to the Sister's using this building for Home Economics or any other classes. Insofar as a music teacher is concerned, there certainly is plenty of room for one here and music should form a very important part of the curriculum of Indian Education.\n\nIt is possible that with the arrangement outlined above the services of an additional teacher at the Village School could be utilized and while I would like to see a little more attention given to the boys, it is very difficult under such an arrangement.\n\nI have discussed the above very thoroughly with Sister Zita and she advises that with the services of an additional teacher, who also knows music, she would not object to taking over as far as she is able Manual Training classes with the boys. In this respect, it might be possible for them to follow the course outlined some time ago by Mr. Doucet.\nIt must be remembered, however, that the object of trying to find such a location such as is used by our Homemakers' Clubs was to create a community centre and not to take the place of a class-room. I do not think any objection could be raised to use this building 2 half-days per week or one full day for school purposes.\n\nAs for teaching Domestic Science, Sewing and Home Economics, etc., at St. Regis, the need is great but as to the employment of suitable personnel for such a task, I will leave it to your discretion.\n\nT. L. Donnah,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 11, 1946.\n\nMr. T. L. Bonnah, Indian Agent,\nP.O. Box 987, Cornwall, Ontario.\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo with reference to the St. Regis Village Indian Day School.\n\nIf the Band is willing to allow the teacher and pupils to use the building provided for the Homemakers' Club, we are prepared to authorize salary for a third teacher. Please let me know if the use of the building can be arranged.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of July 11th please be advised that no difficulty is anticipated in using the Band building for Home Economics and Domestic Science classes.

Since the opening of Marianopolis College, three years ago, the English Section of the Institute of Pedagogy has been called \"Teachers' Training School, Marianopolis College, Montreal,\" and still enjoys the privilege of being recognized by the Department of Education, Quebec.\n\nThe Certificate and Diploma in Primary Pedagogy issued by the University of Montreal for Courses attended at the Institute of Pedagogy are accepted as partial requirements by the Department of Education, Province of Quebec, as leading to the First Class License of the Province of Quebec.\n\nHoping the above explanation will prove satisfactory, I remain\n\nVery devotedly yours,\n\nSister M. Louise Ade, S.S.A.\nDirectress of Studies.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of June 26th, File 33-6-1 (W T) concerning Reverend Sister Mary Zita at the St. Regis Village School.\n\nIn the above connection, I am enclosing herewith a letter received from the Directress of Studies of this Order. I am also returning the Application for Classification concerning the above.\n\nT. L. Bonnah,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclos.

In this schedule we classify our teachers as holding either\n\n(a) Second Class teaching certificates,\n(b) First Class teaching Certificates,\n(c) High School teachers' Certificates.\n\nNaturally, the salaries vary in accordance with the qualifications.\n\nWe have had considerable difficulty in assessing qualifications of some of our teachers. We require, for a second class certificate, at least three years of high school plus a year at a teacher training establishment. For a first class certificate we require at least four years of high school (or one year university plus one year at a teacher training establishment). In the Province of Quebec, we would appreciate hearing from you as to the correlation between your Normal Schools and the various Universities. The attached letter has been received from the Directress of Studies of the Sisters of St. Ann. The point at issue is whether the Sisters concerned hold a teaching certificate or license from your province.

In doing so I trust it will be possible to give consideration to the years of service this teacher has to her credit and especially so her service in Indian schools. I might add that this Sister is one of the most capable teachers I have met and it is not difficult to pick out any pupils that have passed through under her guiding hand.\n\nT. L.

Taillon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the St. Regis Village Indian Day School, inspected February 15th. Original on File 151938-6\n\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\nI am sorry to report poor lumber in the floor and wainscoting. It is too bad to spoil a job by putting in unseasoned lumber in the finishings. All the joints have opened and much cold is admitted on this account. The contractor who built the buildings should be charged for putting in green and unseasoned lumber where it is so important to have kiln dried ceiling and flooring. I would not accept such work if I were the architect.\n\nSgd. A. Luther Gilman, B.A.\nOttawa, February 28, 1912.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nThe Department regrets to have to call your attention to the fact that the lumber supplied by you last summer for repairs to the school on St. Regis Island was not up to the standard. It was not properly seasoned and the Public School Inspector reports that as a result the joints are parted to the extent of from one-half to one inch in some places.\n\nI may also say that a similar complaint in regard to the interior woodwork in the new school in the village of St. Regis has been received.\n\nThe Department has no doubt that you were not aware of the fact that the lumber furnished was not properly seasoned and has no doubt that you will be willing to make the necessary reparation. I shall be glad to hear from you in regard to these matters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMessrs. Ross & Co.,\nCornwall, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Thompson a Canadian Indian and a member of the St.Regis Band living at St.Regis Quebec, has against Angus Lalonde a Building Contractor here.\n\nMr. Lalonde has a contract with your Department for building a side-walk and a fence at the Indian School House at St.Regis, and also for building a fence at the Indian School House on St.Regis Island. He employed this John L. Thompson to furnish him with the sand and do the work and pay the men, all as set out in the enclosed. But, he is either refusing or neglecting to pay Thompson this money and Thompson called on me last Saturday afternoon - 19th instant - and asked me to present the account to you so that he may be protected, if possible, by you. The various services are all under separate items.\n\nThompson is poor and actually needs this money for himself and his little family.\n\nI concluded it would be a saving of money for Thompson to send this claim direct to you rather than to take proceedings. If there are any suggestions you could make me in this regard, I would be obliged.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nEngl-2.\nL.R.C.\nMR.

This claim is based on work and material said to have been furnished by Thompson to Lalonde in connection with the contract. It is desired that you will look into the matter, and if you find that the claim is just that you will endeavour to have Mr. Lalonde settle with Mr. Thompson at once.

Gillion\nAgent\nSir:\u2014\n\nOn March 20th ultimo, I wrote you regarding an account of J.L.Thompson against you, but as yet have not received a reply.\n\nThompson wishes to take action against you, but I am adverse to him taking this course; but he informs me that unless you settle with him today, he shall feel obliged to compel you to make a settlement.\n\nAs a friend, I would suggest you make the necessary adjustment with him as he needs the cash very badly.\n\nWhy did you not reply to my letter of the 20th?\n\nHe is determined to go ahead with it unless you satisfy him today.\n\nYours,\n\n(Sgd) F.E.Tailon,\nI. Agent.\n\nA. Lalonde,\nCornwall, Ontario.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\u2014 Your No.151,938-5 A \u2014\n\u2014John L.Thompson claim against Angus Lalonde\u2014\n\nI would like to remind you that I have not heard from you since you wrote March 15th last.\n\nMr. Thompson is in the office now. He is sorely in need of ready money, and he would like your Department, if you can, to assist him in collecting from your Contractor Mr. Angus Lalonde.\n\nThompson not only did work for your Contractor, but at the latter's request advanced his own money to pay wages.\n\nMr. Thompson brought with him today a letter of this date \u2014 of which I enclose copy \u2014 from your Indian Agent to Lalonde that he might hand it to Lalonde. But this will not do a bid of good.\n\nUnfortunately for Mr. Thompson, Mr. Lalonde has no goods available under execution. The only chance for getting this claim will be through you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEncl.-1.\nL.R.C.\nOttawa, April 6th., 1916.\n\nSir,-\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, in further reference to the claim made by John Thompson, a St. Regis Indian against Mr. Angus Lalonde, and in reply I beg to say that the Department cannot collect any money from Mr. Lalonde, who is a White man, on behalf of Thompson. I may also say that the Indian Agent, Mr. Taillon of St. Regis, has endeavoured to have Mr. Lalonde make settlement with Thompson. Mr. Lalonde has undertaken some work for this Department but no account has been received from him since information was received with regard to his indebtedness to Thompson. When an account is rendered the Department will withhold payment until settlement is made with Thompson, provided Mr. Lalonde has not already paid the Indian. I may say that this is all the Department can do in the matter, other than to again write to Mr. Taillon and urge him to do what he can to effect a settlement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. A. Chisholm Esq.,\nBarrister & Co.,\nCornwall, Ont.\nOttawa, April 6th., 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to previous correspondence relative to the claim made by John Thompson a St. Regis Indian against Mr. Angus Lalonde, I beg to say that it is desired that you will do all that is possible to effect an amicable settlement at in the matter/the earliest possible date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. E. Tailon Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, P. Q.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your of April 6th enclosed #151938-5A in account of J. L. Thompson against A. Lord, herewith enclosed an order from Lord for $500 which I enclose for your approval and charges against the school fund as the greater percentage of work was performed there.\n\nThe material for the fence is on the ground, so that the feet are in position and the fence will be necessary when it is there, so you need not hesitate making the advance.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Sec.\nAttorney General\n\nF. C. Harlow,\nAgent\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\u2014\n\n151,938-5A\u2014John L. Thompson (St. Regis Indian)\nvs Angus Lalonde\n\nI thank you for yours of 6th instant, which I have this morning.\n\nI recognize at once that your Department cannot undertake to act as a collecting agency; it was never in my mind that I, on Mr. Thompson's behalf, should suggest that, and I am therefore pleased to note that you say that when Mr. Lalonde renders his account, you will withhold payment until Thompson's claim is settled.\n\nIf Lalonde should learn that your Department contemplated protecting this Indian in this way, there is a danger that he might assign the account to someone else. I am writing Thompson this morning, so that he may know that your good offices are being exercised in every way in his behalf.\n\nYours truly,\n\nS.A.B.\nOttawa, April 13th., 1916.\n\nSir,-\n\nReferring to your letter of the 5th instant, and previous correspondence, I beg to say that the Department has succeeded in securing an order from Mr. Angue Lalonde for the payment to John L. Thompson of the St. Regis Band, of the sum of $25.00 on account of Mr. Lalonde's contract with the Department. A cheque for the amount in question in favour of Thompson is going forward to Mr. Taillon, Indian Agent at St. Regis.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. A. Chisholm Esq.,\nBarrister &c.,\nCornwall, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour No.151,938-5A - John L.Thompson vs. Angus Lalonde -\n\nThanks for your letter of 13th inst. that $25.00 on account is being sent to Mr. Thompson in care of the Indian Agent at St.Regis, an Order having been obtained from Angus Lalonde for that purpose.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLRC.\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have to ask you with all the energy I possess to enlarge during the present vacation, the St. Regis village school.\n\nI might write several pages explaining the necessity of such a move but I know full well that the deficiency is one of the excellent attendance at this school for some time and that for the number of pupils attending it has become altogether too small.\n\nTake for the last year our average had never fallen lower than 38 and has been as high as 51 and, for very good reasons we fully expect to surpass that average.\n\nThe only manner by which the Indians can be made an important factor able to compete with the white man and to take his place alongside of his white brother is by education; there is not any...\nSir,\n\nThe system whereby the Indians can be improved is also among the provisions to 1910. The attendance for the schools was very good and by all appearances I do not think the attendance will lessen in the future but on the contrary, should increase.\n\nThe cost of running this school would be insignificant amount when weighed with the great amount of good that it does for these people.\n\nAgain, with two rooms a teacher covered how much time she devotes to her field as she moved naturally from a smaller class and this moved into her more efficient and most certainly a smaller class should progress more rapidly than a larger one.\n\nHoping you will take immediate action and not delay action one of my aspirations for the improvement of our Indians.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Original on 151938/6.\n\nI consider this school well managed and in a progressive condition. But as I pointed out in my previous report, the school house should be enlarged to contain under the same roof the other school now situated in another part of the village and in a miserable old house - not suited for school children. It is much too small for the number of children attending it.\n\nSomething should be done this summer.\nSir,\n\nHerewith, under separate cover, please find plans and specifications for the addition to the St. Regis Indian Day School.\n\nIt is proposed to purchase the materials by tender and have the work carried out by day labour, under your supervision, providing you are prepared to give the work the necessary attention. The assistance of a competent, practical man, as working foreman, would be provided that the work would be under constant supervision and carried on with diligence at all times. The necessary supervision from the Department will be given when this is considered necessary.\n\nIt is proposed to utilize competent Indian labour from the reserve to as large an extent as possible, providing this is available at current wages there, and other labour necessary at the lowest price current in the locality.\n\nA bill of quantities for the lumber, etc., will be forwarded to you within a few days, on which tenders should be taken from dealers in that vicinity and forwarded to the Department for consideration before action is taken.

There are enrolled there 68 pupils with an average attendance of 50, accommodation for the excess being provided by the use of an old building which does not afford the necessary accommodation and is now unfit for school purposes.\n\nPlans have been prepared enlarging the existing school, providing an additional room which will fully meet their requirements.\n\nAs it is a difficult matter to procure tenders at this time for the erection of a building at a reasonable price, it is proposed to purchase the material and erect the building by day labour, the labour being available on the reserve and in that vicinity.\n\nTenders for the materials have been requested through Mr. F.E. Taillon, Indian Agent, there, bills of quantities having been submitted to the dealers in the vicinity.\nThe following tenders have been received:\n\nJohn D. Campbell, Cornwall, $1923.00\nAtchison & Company, $1644.36\nSt. Lawrence Lumber & Box Co., South Lancaster,\n$35.00 per M for green lumber.\n\nThe tender of Atchison & Company is considerably the lower, and is a fair and reasonable price for the materials to be supplied.\n\nThe estimated cost of the materials as shown on the enclosed list, July 15, 1915, was $1576.00.\n\nArchitect.\n**LIST OF MATERIALS REQUIRED FOR ST.

The witness in this, as in every other case, should have been a third disinterested person. The receipt, as well as the pay-list, is unsatisfactory, for the reason that you signed as witness. If a third person was present when the payments were made you should have that person sign the pay-list as witness, and also the receipt as witness, as Andrew White affixed his name thereto by mark, and when this a signature by mark is made a third person should always act as witness.\n\nYou should make out a voucher in favour of Andrew White for the amount due him for work done, and attach the receipt to it.\n\nWith regard to the voucher for $40.00, I beg to say that you\n\nF.E. Taillon Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt Regis, P.Q.\nshould attach thereto the agreement referred to therein.

During the past, the Department has allowed a grant for the purpose of providing the children with a treat either at Christmas or midsummer. We are allowing a grant in the present instance for the schools in your Agency as follows, viz:\n\nSt. Regis Village School... $12.00,\nSt. Regis Island \"... 5.00,\nChetlain School........... 5.00,\nChenail \"... ............ 5.00,\nCornwall Island School.... 5.00.\n\nYou should consult the teachers as to the supplies they require, and either you or the teachers themselves can arrange for the purchase. The above authorized amount in each case is not to be exceeded.\n\nAccounts, in duplicate, should be obtained from the merchant from whom the supplies are purchased. These you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and send to the Department for payment. If possible, vouchers covering the expenditure for each of the schools separately should be forwarded.\n\nWe have many calls at this season of the year for grants to provide treats to the children at our Indian schools, and the above authorized amounts are all that we can provide for the schools in the St. Regis Agency. Please advise the teachers accordingly and assist them in every way you can in making their Christmas tree and concert a success.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

(RG 10, Volume 6108, file 331-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 27th, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nA blackboard for the use of one of the Indian Schools conducted by this Department on the St. Regis Reserve, Province of Quebec, was recently shipped from L. Leblanc, Montreal, Que., addressed to E. Casa, Nyando, N.Y.\n\nNyando, N.Y., is the closest point to our Day School and it is much more convenient for supplies to be delivered to the school from this point than from any point in Canada.\n\nThe blackboard in question, although addressed to Nyando, N.Y., apparently entered the United States at Malone, N.Y., and the American Customs Officer there assessed a charge of $9.50 duty. Our consignee, Mr. Casa, was obliged to pay this amount at Nyando before he could secure the blackboard. The receipt number is as follows:\n\nNyando, N.Y. 40-02-189-372 (SS1) November 18, 1926.\n\nYou will note that this blackboard was intended for an Indian School in Canada and was simply passing through the United States. I believe, therefore, that no duty should have been charged. Would it be possible to arrange a refund to this Department?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Both are required the same size, and please include frames in the order.\n\nThe girls wish me to ask if they can have their cheques as early in December as possible.\n\nWe are contemplating a Xmas entertainment and will require a piano, also a stage to be erected. Are you in favour of paying for this extra expense? The piano, of course, will be rented from about Dec 1st on.\n\nThanking you,\n\nSincerely,\n\nMargaret MacPully.\nOttawa, November 29th, 1926.\n\nMadam:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 26th instant, I beg to say that two pieces of lithoplate blackboard, each 5 ft. by 3\u00bd ft., with necessary chalk trough and moulding, are being ordered from the Government Stationery Office for the Chemail Indian Day School.\n\nUnder separate cover, you will be forwarded an accountable cheque for $27.00, being a grant for the purchase of prizes as follows:\n\n- St. Regis Village School - $12.00\n- Chemail School - $5.00\n- Chetlain School - $5.00\n- St. Regis Island School - $5.00\n\nPlease have this cheque cashed and the proceeds handed to the various teachers. You should request them, when making purchases, to obtain itemized accounts in duplicate, which should be receipted by the merchant from whom the purchases are made. These accounts they should then hand to you and you should forward them to the Department.\n\nRegarding your request for payment of expenses incurred in connection with the Christmas entertainment, I find that last year, at the request of Miss Robillard, the Department allowed the sum of $5.00 to John Thompson for his services in building a stage and renting a piano. We are willing to allow the same, or a slightly larger amount, this year and payment of this will be made on receipt from you of a certified account in duplicate.\n\nSalary cheques for all the teachers will be forwarded about December 15.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Casa, Nyamio, N.Y., and covered by Malone entry No. B-307 of October 2, 1926.\n\nIt appears that the blackboard in question was shipped from Montreal and was intended for the use of one of the Indian schools of the Department of Indian Affairs of Canada on the St. Regis Reserve in the province of Quebec. It was, however, sent to Nyamio for the reason that this was the closest point to this day school and that it was much more convenient for supplies to be delivered to the school from Nyamio than from any point in Canada.\n\nIt, therefore, appears that the article in question was in fact in transit from a point in Canada through the United States to another point in Canada; that it was sent to this country as a matter of shipping convenience only, and that, had the United States customs regulations governing in transit goods been complied with, it would not have been considered an importation into this country and no entry would have been required.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, you are hereby authorized to cancel the consumption entry made in this case, to treat the goods in question as having been in transit and to make refund accordingly of the duty paid.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n(Signed) L.C.

W. ASHWORTH,\nChief of Section,\nAssistant Director of Questions.\n\n(inclosure)\nOttawa, January 27th, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nYou will remember that, about November 26th last, the Department issued a cheque in your favour for $12.50. This included a charge of $9.50 for duty paid by you on a blackboard intended for the St. Regis Indian Day School.\n\nAs this blackboard was only in transit from one point in Canada to another, we considered that no duty should have been charged and we, therefore, communicated with the Secretary of the Treasury Department, United States Customs Service, Washington, D.C., with regard to securing a refund. A letter has just been received from the above official, with which he encloses a copy of a letter, dated January 20th, which he has written to the Collector of Customs at Ogdensburg, N.Y., instructing him to refund to you the amount of duty paid, namely, $9.50. This payment was covered by Malone entry No. B-307 of October 2, 1926. I should be pleased if you would get in touch with the Collector of Customs at Ogdensburg and secure this refund, which you should hand over to our Agent, Mr. MacGibbon, in order that he may forward it to this Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. Caza, Esq.,\nCustoms Officer,\nSt. Regis, Que.\nFebruary 1, 1927.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nWhen I visited St. Regis on Saturday, I examined the school in the village. This building must be painted on the outside and the interior decorated this coming summer. New seats are badly needed for the senior room. The best ones in this room at present can be used to replace broken ones in the junior room.\n\nThe lighting of the senior room is very bad, as there are no windows in the back of the classroom and inadequate ones on the left side. It may be possible to turn the seats around, put the blackboard on the interior wall and cut a hole on the East side. This would mean that light would come from the rear and right - not correct, but much better than the present arrangement.\n\nThe basement at this school is a mudhole, and, in view of extreme difficulty of proper drainage (as the school is in a low spot) I believe it advisable to continue heating by stoves and to fill up the basement with gravel or some other filling.\n\nI will write to the Indian Agent, telling him to move scribblers and other school supplies from the agency to the senior room.\nOttawa, February 1st, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nIt is intended to place an order for the supplying of single school desks to accommodate 18 pupils in the senior room at the St. Regis Village School. Please inform the Department as soon as possible as to where these desks should be shipped. If sent to Nyando, we would have difficulty in having them cross the Border without duty being collected. Would you recommend that they be sent to Cornwall, and, if so, could you arrange to have them taken from that point to the school?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

I would say to ship them to Cornwall, Ont., if shipped shortly, and I will see in having them transferred to St. Regis.\n\nI am\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. C.

These have to be shipped to Cornwall, Ont., and taken to the school over the ice on the River St. Lawrence, and it is, therefore, necessary that the order be placed as soon as possible - before travelling conditions on the ice become dangerous.\n\nThe two firms supplying desks at the lowest prices are the Globe Furniture Co., Waterloo, and Oliver & Sons, Ottawa. The first named are large manufacturers and could make immediate shipment. The last named have recently had a fire and might not be able to make shipment for a few weeks. Would it be satisfactory to place the order with the Globe Furniture Co. without obtaining competitive prices from other firms?\nOttawa, February 11, 1927.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to ship as soon as possible, freight charges prepaid, addressed to W. A. MacGibbon, Esq., Indian Agent, Cornwall, Ont., the following school desks:\n\n- 10 No. 3 New Globe Automatic Single Desks,\n- 2 Front and 2 Rear Seats for same,\n- 5 No. 4 New Globe Automatic Single Desks,\n- 1 Front and 1 Rear Seat for same.\n\nThese desks should be supplied at the lowest possible price. They should be shipped knocked down; all parts complete.\n\nPlease forward your account, in duplicate, to Mr. MacGibbon, whose post office address is St. Regis, Que. Freight charges should be included in your account for the desks. Mr. MacGibbon is being informed that the order has been placed with you, and requested, upon receipt of the desks, if in good condition, to certify the account and send it to the Department, when payment will be made.\n\nAs these desks are urgently required, I shall be pleased if you will make early shipment. Please acknowledge this order, and state date when shipment will go forward.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. H. Paget,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent.\n\nGlobe Furniture Co.

They should be placed in three rows of five desks each, with a front and rear seat for each row. The Department will pay the cost of transporting the desks from Cornwall to the school and having them assembled and set up in the classroom, upon receipt of accounts from you, properly certified, covering the expense.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mac Gibbon\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI beg to say regarding voucher No. 60, amounting to $75.00 in favour of John Day, for painting the exterior of St. Regis Village School. John Day and Peter Johnson took this job of painting, price $70.00. They both worked about a week, when Peter Johnson fell ill on account of illness. In the meantime John Day hired Peter Thomas to help him until Johnson returned. They finished putting on the first coat, which took a great deal longer than they expected. John Day came to me and said that they were not going to make fair wages at that price. I knew myself that $70.00 was a low price for putting on two coats on a large building like this one, so I told Mr. Day to go ahead and put on the second coat that I would raise the price to $75.00. I was anxious to get this painting done, so they started the second. I may say that the first coat on this building took a tremendous lot of paint, as this building had not been painted for some years. The arrangement on the start was that John Day was to receive the cheque, and he pay his men, which I am sure Mr. Day will do.\n\nMr. John Day is nearly finished the painting of the interior of this building.

This shed is very strongly built, having a two inch plank floor, a bin petitioned off for coal, room for wood, and room for storing desks. I had Angus Oak remove the coal which was left over from the previous year, also wood, to the new shed, which he charged $2.00. I sold the old shed which was pretty well twisted and done, to Angus Oak, for the sum of $10.00 which I am enclosing.\n\nThe two closets and new shed should be painted. Mr. John Day will paint the shed, two coats and closets one coat, for the sum of $8.00. Please give me authority to have this done and make a complete job of these buildings.\n\nI Am,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nW.C.

The basement of this school has been filled in according to your instructions. There are seven basement windows, a lot of these windows are broken, that is the glass in them, and have been broken for some time. As these windows are even with the ground, they are very easily broken by the children playing, unless there are heavy wire screens put on to protect them. As the basement of this school will not be used for any purpose anymore, I would suggest to have these windows cemented in even with the foundation of the school wall, leaving one window for air when needed.\n\nJohn L. Thompson, of St. Regis Village would do this job, six windows $24.00. $4.00 per window.\n\nIf this was done it would be far easier to keep the class-rooms heated in cold weather.

Thompson to do this work, and you may also arrange to have a wire screen placed over the window which is left open in order to air the basement. Please arrange to have this work completed at an early date. When the work has been completed, you should forward a properly certified voucher, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nI have also your letter of the 15th instant, in which you recommend that the two closets and the new shed be painted. You may arrange with John Day to give the shed two coats of paint and the closets one coat of paint. We note that he will do this work for the sum of $5.

Miss MacLulity, teacher of this room, informed me that these shades were not required until Spring. The placing of these shades is being done at present. Also the teacher of this room requests that shades be placed on the windows, at the north-west of this room also, as the sun interferes with the class work, in afternoons. Please authorize me in having this work done, 2 large and 2 small shades are required.\n\nTeachers Residence, St. Regis Village.\n\nThe teachers who reside in this building have been annoyed considerably this last while back, with cattle in this yard around the house. The teachers request that a fence be placed around this yard, for protection against cattle and other animals.\n\nThe approximate material and cost for construction of this fence would be:\n- 5 rods page wire, 4 ft. high, 73\u00a2 per rd. $5.11\n- 14 posts @ 25\u00a2 per. 3.50\n- Fence braces, 5. 5.00\n- Steeples. .70\n- 10 foot gate 12.00\n- Labour 15.00\n\nThe above is for 18 strand, steel, page wire.

It would be quite useless to attempt the garden at all, unless you would. When I returned this Sept., the grounds were in the most unsightly condition \u2014 the yard had been used for pastureage all summer. Our present plans re. the produce, are to sell it and donate the money to the Red Cross Crippled Children's Fund.\n\nAnother item \u2014 I understand that a couple of years ago, an order came to have Christmas and other entertainments for the children. This is a fine idea but impossible without the wherewithal to do it. For two years now, I have been asking for a piano for the school. A used will do nicely. Could I not have\none? If we are to have a Xmas entertainments, we would need to start practice very soon.\n\nKindly let me have an answer as soon as possible re both the above. Thanking you\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSec'y\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to approve of the payment of someone to look after this garden during the holidays. Further, it is not the policy of the Department to allow any produce, grown in school gardens, to be used for any other purposes than for the use of the teachers or of the Indian pupils who assist in the work. If you conduct a garden next spring, it may be that you could arrange with the agent to have the oversight of same during the vacation.\n\nThe Department regrets that there are no funds available for the purpose of supplying a piano for the use of the school. We will allow any small expense required in the putting on of a Christmas entertainment for the pupils and will also allow a small grant to purchase gifts or other supplies for the purpose. Your request for this should be forwarded through the office of your local Indian agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nMiss M. MacNulty,\nSt. Regis,\nP. Q.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.
