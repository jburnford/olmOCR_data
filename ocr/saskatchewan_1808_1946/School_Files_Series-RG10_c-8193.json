W. Hinds of Manitowaning from whom I got the estimates. The lumber for repairs to entrance platform and steps would in all probability be purchased from L. A. Buck of Little Current.\n\nIt is proposed to use Indian labour, which is estimated at $75.00 and I would be pleased to receive an advance cheque for this amount to pay labour, if it is possible to procure the material.\n\nIf the staining of the roof of Wikwemikong and West Bay Schools is dispensed with, this would add considerable to the funds.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nCRJ/\n**REQUISITION FOR CHEQUE**\n\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\nDEPARTMENT: MINES & RESOURCES\nBRANCH: INDIAN AFFAIRS\nDATE: July 17, 1942\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE NO. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | Manitoulin Island Indian Agency Trust Account | $75.00 |\n\nSend cheque to:\nMr. C.R.

It is noted that the total cost of the material will be $55.78. An accountable cheque for $75.00 for labour will be sent under separate cover. It is noted that Indians will be employed.\n\nAs previously advised, the staining of the roof at the Wikwemikong and West Bay Schools is considered unnecessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. C.R. Johnston,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nI am informed by the Bishop of Algoma that the building used by the Church of England for religious services at Birch Island on the Whitefish River Reserve, is the property of the Indian Affairs Branch. I was entirely unaware of this, but the chief of the reserve also advises me the building was erected a number of years ago by the Indian Department for school and church purposes.\n\nI would judge it is some time since it was used for school purposes, and there are at the present time only two or three families in Birch Island, who are not of Roman Catholic faith.\n\nThe Bishop reports that the roof is leaking badly, and that some other repairs are badly needed, but at the present time, I have no personal knowledge of the extent of the repairs required. He also reports that the student Missionary, Mr. E. N. Clark, of Whitefish Falls, and some of the Indians are willing to help with the work at least, up to the point of keeping the rain out.\n\nBefore going into further details, I would appreciate advice, as to whether the Department would consider assuming any responsibility whatever for repairs to this building, and if not, would there be any objection to the Missionary and the Indians making any repairs they may care to make voluntarily.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nORJ / JH\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to a building used by the Church of England at Birch Island on the Whitefish River Reserve.\n\nWe have reviewed our files but we are unable to locate this particular building. I presume you do not refer to the present Birch Island School. Possibly it is some old building that has not been used for several years.

The teacher has asked for 1 studio couch with back and arms, complete as there is very little furniture in the residence of this school. Last year, the teacher raised funds locally to buy a dining room suite, and I think the couch should be supplied to make her more comfortable. The chalk asked for was omitted from the school material requisition, and I would prefer that it be shipped to Mrs. Henry Fox, teacher, Birch Island School, Whitefish Falls, Ontario.\n\nI would recommend these supplies be all furnished at an early date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nORJ / JH\nOttawa,\nAugust 10, 1944.\n\nMr. C.R. Johnston, Indian Agent, Manitowaning,\nOnt.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant, the Department approves purchase of the articles shown on the attached list, with the exception of the manual training supplies and the studio couch. This will involve an expenditure of $82. Regarding the studio couch, you might let me know the name and address of the firm from whom you secured the quotation of $57.50.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nI acknowledge receipt of departmental letter dated August 10th, File No.19-13-5, pertaining to requisition for supplies for Birch Island School.\n\nThe quotation of $57.50 for studio couch was received from C. W. Hinds, Hardware Merchant, Manitowaning, for a Simmons Couch which he has in stock, and of a quality which is not obtainable from the manufacturer at the present time. It can be converted into a double bed, and has a compartment in the bottom for clothing. A cheaper article could no doubt be obtained from Eaton's or Simpo's, if considered advisable.\n\nIn regard to the manual training supplies for this school, it was proposed to get all sewing and knitting material for girls, and the teacher, Mrs. Rose Fox, is competent in teaching this work.\n\nIt would require quite an outlay for tools to carry out any woodwork for boys, as up to the present time, there has been no manual training for boys carried out at this school.\n\nC.

I had made several previous attempts to have it repaired but none of the people contacted ever got around to attend to it.\n\nWhile Mrs. Rose Fox was teacher, her husband attempted to do it himself but had no tools to lift the pipes which had come apart leaving a great length in the well.\n\nLast October, Stewart and Joly, contractors of Little Current, undertook to remove the piping and were finally successful in doing so.

The one I have listed on the requisition is a Findlay Oval with copper reservoir, similar to the one purchased for Kaboni School last year, except that due to war restrictions it is not possible now to get the warming closet.\n\nC. W. Hinds of Manitowaning has this one in stock and the price quoted covers delivery charges. These ranges have an excellent reputation, and I can strongly recommend it. The cistern pump head has been broken and out of commission for some time. I have tried to make some repairs, but so far have been unsuccessful. As the cost is only $5.00, I would recommend getting a new pump.\n\nThe linoleum on the kitchen and living room floor is worn out in several places. It is all the same pattern, and it is proposed to get a new rug for the kitchen floor, and use the best parts of the old one to replace worn places in the living room.\n\nThere is no axe, saw or hammer at the school; and several of the door locks are out of commission.\n\nI would recommend these articles be purchased locally.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES File No. 19-15-8\n\nNovember 21, 1948\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Birch Island Indian Day School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 12-415\n\nSHIP TO Mr. G.R.

Johnston, Indian Agent, Manitowaning, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant, you may purchase the supplies shown on the attached list, with the exception of the dinette suite. This will mean a total expenditure of $39.50, of which amount $15.00 will cover the cost of sewing materials.\n\nA dinette suite at $65.00 is more expensive equipment than we usually supply. Could you not secure something at a cheaper price?\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n## Statement\n\n**MANITOWANING**\n\n*Feb 15th 1944*\n\n**Dept. of Mines & Resources**\n\n**Manitowaning Branch**\n\n**Reg.

J.R. Richard, at Mississauga, Serpent River (Cutler), and White Fish Lake. Upon me falls the very difficult task of finding suitable teachers for these schools. I can but seldom secure competent persons, and they do not stay a sufficient length of time to improve the pupils, because the salary paid is too small, and most of these places too much isolated. I have often expressed my opinion to your Department and to the Inspectors, that if the salary of teachers in those schools would be raised to the sum of $300 all around, at least as a trial, I could secure the services of certificated teachers, and these schools might rise to a proper efficiency.\n\nOn the 21st of April last I was advised by your Department that \"The whole question of school management would be dealt with by the Superintendent General at the earliest possible date\". Now is the proper time for hiring teachers. There is a vacancy at West Bay, Sheeshewaning, and White Fish Lake. The Indians at South Bay complain that their teacher Mrs. C.S. Ainscough does not do justice to her work, and ask for a competent male teacher, who cannot be found for $300. I am offered the services of young men and ladies who might do creditable work, but they have no special preparation for teaching school and have no certificate. If the salaries paid heretofore remain the same, I will have to propose them to your approval for want of more competent persons.\n\nPlease advise me as soon as possible of the course to follow.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nRev. J. Pequin, S.J.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nThe undersigned begs to submit the accompanying letter from the Rev. Father Paquin, Principal of the Wikwemikong Industrial School and Superintendent of Missions.\n\nThere is a great deal in what Father Paquin says in regard to the unsatisfactory results at the Day Schools on Manitoulin Island and the north shore of the Georgian Bay, caused by the frequent change of teachers, and there is no doubt but that the salaries offered are too small to induce good teachers to accept them, or remain at such isolated places.\n\nThe following list shows the schools in charge of the Rev. Father Paquin, with the salary attached to each school, and the fund from which it is paid.\n\n| Name of School     | Salary | From What Fund Paid |\n|--------------------|--------|---------------------|\n| Burwah             | 200.00 | Band                |\n| Sheshegwaning      | 200.00 | \"                   |\n| Mississauga        | 250.00 | Voted               |\n| Sagamock           | 250.00 | \"                   |\n| Sipepnet River     | 250.00 | \"                   |\n| Wikwemikongising   | 200.00 | \"                   |\n| White Fish Lake    | 200.00 | \"                   |\n| Theessalon         | 300.00 | \"                   |\n| South Bay          | 200.00 | Band                |\n| West Bay           | 250.00 | \"                   |\n\nFather Paquin has been authorized to fill any vacancy.\nvacancy temporarily.

Some of the schools are wholly paid for by the Indians themselves, and it would not be fair to tax them to any greater extent, and the Parliamentary vote is about all that can be asked for.\n\nI might mention that the schools conducted by the different Protestant denominations in Ontario and Quebec are in receipt of assistance from different charitable societies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

I am advised by the Rev J Paquin that it is very difficult to secure the services of a competent teacher for this School and he makes the suggestion that the salary heretofore paid the teacher of the Buzwah School be paid to the Wikwemikong Industrial School at the rate of $50.00 per capita, for the pupils from Buzwah, above the actual grant, thus providing for the education of five pupils at a time. If it is possible to make this kind of an arrangement I am satisfied that it will be to the interests of the Indians and give far better results than the present arrangement.\n\nThe attendance at the Buzwah has been very small and irregular, last quarters report shows an average of only 4.25, whereas, by the Rev Paquin's suggestion five or six pupils could be educated at one time with the same amount of money already expended besides they would have to attend regularly.\n\nWill you be good enough to inform me as to what answer shall be made to the above suggestion.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOTTAWA, 9th September, 1904:\n\nThe Acting Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMr Agent Agent Sims has reported the resignation of Father Kehmstedt, teacher of the Buzwah school and states that Father Paquin wishes the salary allowed for this school to be used for the tuition of five pupils from the Buzwah settlement at the Wikwemikong, paying at the usual per capita rate of $60.00.\n\nI may state that the average attendance at the Buzwah school for the past year was exactly five and that it has never exceeded that number for a good many years. It would therefore be to the advantage of the children of that section to give them the benefit of the industrial school training at Wikwemikong and it would be an actual saving to the Department as it would not be called upon to provide fuel and other contingencies.\n\nThe Accountant informs me that there would be no objection to making this change and the Wikwemikong school has ample accommodation for the extra pupils. I would therefore recommend that you approve of Father Paquin's suggestion.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6120, File 382-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOTTAWA, 9th September, 1904:\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that the Department will agree to transfer the grant for the salary of a teacher for the Ruzwah school, which is to be closed for the present, to the Wikwemikong Industrial school for the maintenance of five pupils from Ruzwah at $60.00 a year each. Be good enough to advise Rev. Father Paquin accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nC.E.D.

There are sixteen families with about twenty-five children of school age, six to fifteen; even if twenty attended it would be a good school.\n\nIt is not right that so many children, which should be at school are deprived of the privilege of an education.\n\nI went and examined the old school building and I find that it would cost from $100.00 to $125.00 to repair the school.\n\nIt requires a new roof, shingled, gables repaired, new floor, ceiling repaired, plastered inside and out, whitewashed, with some other minor repairs including the closets. There would also be required the usual school furniture, ten desks, teachers desk, chairs, blackboard, maps, books &c., stove and pipes.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThere would also have to be arrangements made for accommodation for the teacher. Rev L. N. Dugas was in the Office yesterday and he is quite willing that the school should be reopened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nWitwenikong February 7th 1913\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Indians of Baswa near Manitowaning are making a petition to have their school reopen. They tell the agent that they have 40 children of school age that is a big congregation. I think that there is a little over 20 children of school age. The number is certainly sufficient to have a school open for them, and I would be very glad to see it reopen.\n\nBut I must tell you that the school building needs big repairs and moreover there is no house or room for the teacher to stay in. If the Dept. is willing to grant the request of the Indians, beside the reparations to the school building it will be necessary to build an addition for the dwelling place of a teacher.\n\nPlease let me know as soon as possible what will be done, and also what salary will be paid to a teacher there. I think it will be very hard to hire a teacher for less than four hundred dollars a year.\n\nYour humble servant,\nL.V. Dugan, Principal\nWitwenikong.\n\nTo the Secretary Dept. of Indian Affairs, Out.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 22, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant in reference to the re-opening of the Buzwah school.\n\nIn view of the removal of the industrial school from Wikwemikong it would appear necessary to re-open this school next summer. The Department would be glad if you would state in detail the repairs necessary to the building with an estimate of the cost so that the work can be undertaken when the spring season opens.\n\nRev. Father Dugas has written to the Department in regard to this matter and suggested building an addition to the school to be used as a dwelling for the teacher. The Department would like you to report on this. Would it not be possible for a teacher to find satisfactory lodging? If you consider that it would not you may also obtain an estimate of the cost of making an addition, giving the Department a description and stating how you consider the work should be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWm. McLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOttawa, February 22, 1913.\n\nRev.

Your suggestion with regard to the lodging accommodation for a teacher is noted.\n\nTo a teacher with a certificate the Department will allow an initial salary of $400.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAst.

May 19th 1913\n\nSir,\n\nWe have been informed that the Indian Department intends to reopen the Bessie Village Indian School, and we have been requested to find a suitable teacher for that school.\n\nMiss Kate Cameron of Ottawa, 280 Laurier Ave. West, three years a teacher in an Indian school will see Mr. Benson to propose for that Bessie School her sister Miss Margaret Cameron and give him her qualifications.\n\nThis Miss Margaret Cameron has just her second year in High School and has a few months experience assisting a well trained Normal teacher.\n\nI beg to be informed if this Miss Margaret Cameron received the approval of the department.\n\nThe old school building at Bessie Village needs considerable repairs and there are lodging for the teacher and no convenient boarding in the surroundings.\n\nTo give exact particulars about the school population of that Bessie Village, I enclose an exact list of school age children, birth date and approximate distance of children from the present school site.

I would gladly teach that holiday, to pay up for Sept. 1st.\n\nIf I should begin teaching Sept. 1st, I would have to be travelling Sunday Aug. 30th, which would be very inconvenient for me; so this is my reason for inquiring if you would allow me to open School Sept. 2nd.\n\nHoping to receive a reply by return mail.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nFlorence Kelly\nFort Coulonge\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6120, File 382-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, August 26th, 1925.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, and in reply beg to state that it would be satisfactory if you commence duties at the Buzwah Indian Day School on the 2nd prox.

I myself am surprised to see her have a school.\n\nWe had Miss F. Kelly last year. In two weeks the school children found out she was no good, so it was one year drawback for Kaboni school children after having Miss F. McFaul a qualified teacher.\n\nIn May I went to see the Inspector J.W. Bennett on his visit to\nKaboni School about Education, and to let him know that Miss F. Kelby was not doing satisfactory work in her teaching and that we should have teachers that have Ontario certificates.\n\nI also mentioned this to the Indian Agent Mr. R.J. Lewis, and they paid no attention.\n\nWhat are these two men for. Are they not to look after the school and Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nMrs Joe Osawomik\nKaboni\nManitowaning P.O.\nOnt.\nOttawa, November 3, 1925.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, relative to the services being performed by Miss Florence Kelly, teacher of the Buswah Indian Day School. In reply I have to say that, from reports received, it is stated that Miss Kelly is fairly satisfactory. It is thought that, if the Indian parents would assist her by seeing that there is a full and regular attendance of the Indian children, it would greatly assist the teacher in her efforts in the classroom.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

We had heard about that so when we knew that she had applied for Buzwah we told our chief to see about it also that we did not want her.\n\nHe brought the complaint to our agent (Mr. Robert Lewis). The agent told him that the school teacher who applied for Buzwah was a Montreal lady.\n\nIt is no use trying to complain at the office.\nOttawa, November 12th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe enclosed petition regarding the services of Miss Florence Kelly, teacher of the Indian day school, has been received from the Indians of the Buswah Reserve. I have to request that you will furnish a full report regarding the complaint made by the petitioners, and, at the same time, furnish your opinion as to whether you consider Miss Kelly's services are satisfactory, or whether you would recommend that a change in teacher be made at the beginning of the new year. Your early reply giving full information regarding the work that is being performed by Miss Kelly is desired.\n\nPlease return the enclosed communication with your report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

D. McLean,\nAasst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChief John Osawanimiki,\nManitowaning,\nOnt.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nNovember 17th, 1925.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nReferring to Official Letter No. 19-1-1 of the 13th instant, relating to the complaint of the Indians at Buswah regarding the work of Miss Florence Kelly, teacher of the Buswah Indian School, I have the honour to report that it was thought when she was removed from Kaboni School after the mid-summer holidays to the Buswah School, and all the pupils at Buswah are juniors with the exception of three, she would be more successful in her teaching, but it appears to me that she is too young in years and not ample experience in teaching to manage the senior pupils.\n\nMiss Kelly is a good girl and is making an effort to be a successful teacher, but I believe that it would be in the best interest of the school for her to resign at the end of the year, and if possible the services of an Ontario qualified teacher with some years of experience in teaching public schools be secured to take charge as the Indians are now of the opinion that their children should all graduate to the high schools and I would like to give them every encouragement.\n\nI re-enclose herewith the communication submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 23rd, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department recently received a petition from a number of the Buzwah Indians requesting us to dismiss the teacher, Miss Florence Kelly, as they stated she is not giving satisfaction. We forwarded the petition to Mr. Agent Lewis for his report, and, in reply, he stated that when she was transferred from Kaboni to Buzwah last summer it was thought that she would be more successful in the latter school owing to the fact that most of the pupils were juniors, but that it now appears to him that she is too young and has not had sufficient experience. He further states that in his opinion it would be in the best interests of the school for her to resign at the end of the present quarter.\n\nIn your report on the Buzwah School dated September 17th, it is noted that you stated regarding the teacher's success \"I am uncertain just how to rate this teacher. She appears satisfactory, however.\" The Department does not desire to dismiss her without careful consideration, especially in the middle of the academic year, and I would be pleased if you would give me your views about Miss Kelly's work and intimate whether or not you consider immediate steps should be taken to dispense with her services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In my report on this school teacher last September you can see that I didn't consider her at all as a story teacher. She wouldn't do me any good in my regular school, however, I gave her the benefit of the doubt since I felt that surely she could handle an Indian crowd of children. It would appear from your letter that the Indians wish her changed. You ask me about my views on her work. She appeared uncertain & indefinite in any teaching method. Besides, I doubt if she has qualities of disciplining children. Remember though, that my report in September showed my hesitancy of even saying the work satisfactory. I have always took it for granted that the Dept obtained the best they could.\n\nYou ask me to indicate whether or not to retain her services. Considering it is Indians she teaches and the year almost half gone I do not want to take the responsibility. A teacher's usefulness is usually gone under the present circumstances & when people protest against her. Consider how many of the Indians signed the petition?\n\nJ.M. Bennett, M.A.\nInspector of Separate Schools\n47 Bowning Avenue\nToronto\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6120, File 382-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nYou will have to make your own decision as to retaining or not. These Buryah Indians have had the King and Indian like themselves in the past, who after all did good work to a certain limit. Maybe they want some Indian in his place. I would not like to deliberately give a recommendation other than this since I am not in close touch with conditions. Mr. Lewis should know the circumstances best of all. Personally I would be governed by his recommendation knowing him as I do.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.M. Bennett\n\nP.S. I just received your letter today on returning from both authors. Consider sooner.\nOttawa, December 10, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge, with thanks, receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, relative to the services being performed by Miss Florence Kelly, teacher of the Buzwah Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, after fully considering the circumstances in her case, it has been decided to make no change in the teacher at this school for the present academic year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. M. Bennett, Esq., M.A.,\nInspector of Separate Schools,\n47 Browning Ave.,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, December 10, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 17th ultimo, relative to the request made by the Indians of the Buzwah Band for a change in teacher, I now beg to inform you that after making enquiry from the Separate School Inspector, and taking into consideration the hardship that might be occasioned Miss Kelly in dispensing with her services at the present time, it has been decided that she may remain and teach during the balance of the present academic year. It would appear that Miss Kelly is making every effort to perform the work satisfactorily, but that she is not sufficiently qualified in disciplining the children or in imparting instruction in the classroom work.\n\nPlease note, however, that it is the Department's intention to dispense with Miss Kelly's services at the end of June, next. You should treat this information as confidential, as it would be inadvisable to notify her or the Indians at the present time of our intention. Please bear the matter in mind, however, and give Miss Kelly official notice early in May, next, that her services will not be required after June 30th, 1926.\n\nYou may inform the Indians interested that Miss Kelly is to remain for the present academic year. I enclose herewith copy of a communication which we are sending to the Chief in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOttawa, December 10, 1925.\n\nDear Chief:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 4th instant, I beg to inform you that, after giving full consideration to the petition of the Indians, also after obtaining a report from the Separate School Inspector, it has been decided to continue the services of Miss Florence Kelly as teacher of the Buzwah Indian Day School during the present academic year. We understand that she is performing fair service in the classroom, and is using every effort to make a success in the work.\n\nIt is hoped that you will encourage the Indian parents to see that their children of school age attend regularly each day the school is open.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It is expected, however, that they will make up the time lost by teaching during the Easter holidays next. Both teachers should prepare their quarterly returns and hand them to you before leaving for their homes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J.

We are very sorry if you cannot favor us a better teacher. Our children will lose one year's advance in studies. Our two boys have been to school to Miss Florence Kelly soon as she opened school but in one month they began to complain the teacher tells them the work is wrong but does not show them where the mistake is. Our boys were ambitious to learn and go to school. They can and have sent them. We are discouraged. It is of no use to send them to school.\nwhen she cannot teach more than they know.

We think that the services of Miss Florence Kelly, teacher at Bugwah Day School, should be continued. We have good reason to complain about this teacher. We notice that from September to December our children made no progress. They are only getting stubborn and disobedient at home. Miss Kelly's discipline is\nis very very poor, she has no management\u2014no teacher! whatever.\n\nWe want education. We want our children advance every year at school so that finally they may be prepared for High School. But we will never improve if we are not more particular about what kind of teacher we get.\n\nWe look to the Department for our protection & encouragement towards improvements. But now we regret to say that we are rather surprised that a girl like Miss Kelly would be encouraged.\n\nAnd that\u2014We the majority of the Community's petition not be considered. Why should we not get a better teacher, when a\na resolution passed in the Grand Indian Council, to get qualified teachers. So Miss Kelly is qualified? (Mr. Not for Culture.) We know her qualifications. And furthermore her services are only (fairly) satisfactory according to the Separate School Inspector's report.\n\nThere has been a lot of money spent paying teachers and we get no results.

Her address is Tancredia, Que., and I advise that you write to her, telling her that you have been appointed and asking for advice as to what to take in, the living conditions, etc. You should, also, arrange to meet her for the journey to your school, as she is acquainted with the route, etc. In Little Current, the parish priest, Rev. E.A. Papineau, S.J., will give you any assistance you need in that town and, if you are unaccompanied, will see that you get out to your school. The parish priest at Wikwemikong is Rev. Father G.A.

The intrusion took place early Friday morning. The victim has been confined to bed under the doctor's care during the past week.\n\nJoe Mandamin, an Indian resident of the Wikwemikong Reserve, is being held pending trial. Evidence has shown he could not give a satisfactory account of his whereabouts that night and early the next morning sought to hire a car to take him out of the district at once.\n\nIt is not known how the intruder gained admission to the house, but the assault was planned beforehand and information obtained regarding the layout of the house. A woollen dress and a towel wrapped about the head of the intruder were used as a disguise and because of this identification has not been readily obtained. The girl was suddenly awakened by the touch of the intruder and by putting up a ferocious fight by clawing at his face freed herself. The open window provided the only means of escape at the moment to the terrified girl. The prisoner charged with the crime has served prison terms on two other occasions.\nHalfbreed Sentenced Five Years and Lashes\n\nConvicted of House-breaking and Assault.\n\nGORE BAY, Ont., July 9.\u2014Convinced of house-breaking and indecent assault, Joe Mindamin, halfbreed, was sentenced to five years in Port Arthur penitentiary and 20 lashes in police court here yesterday.\n\nIda Brown, Venosta, Que., who teaches school at Mani- toulin Island, is in hospital suffering from spine injuries as a result of the assault. She was sleeping in her room in the school building when she awoke to find a man in the room wearing a light coloured dress. When he attacked her, she stuck her fingers into his face and jumped 16 feet from a window to the ground.

I regret that I have not yet heard from Father Papineau or from Mr. Indian Agent Lewis. To be sure that I do hear from them, I am writing today. Dr. Harvie's detailed medical report is not yet on file, but, by the time you get this letter, you will likely have heard from your mother regarding your sister's present condition.\n\nThe enclosed newspaper clipping is the information we have, concerning the nature of the accident. This appeared in yesterday's papers. The nature of the charge suggests to me that the only injuries your sister has received are those of fright and the fall that she had from the window. I do not know why such bad luck should single her out for attention. Her trouble is, by all odds, the most unfortunate incident that has happened to a teacher in an Indian day school for many years, as far as the Department is aware. I have written Miss Brown a cheerful letter and I hope she makes a very rapid recovery. If she is moved to either an Ottawa hospital or to her home at Venosta, I know you will let me know if you find out that others have not informed the Department.

Dr. Gallie is one of the outstanding men on this continent for such type of cases.

Harvie.\n\nHHH/JM.\nManitowaning, July 13th, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report that an unfortunate event took place at the Buzwah Indian Day School on Saturday morning the 27th ultimo. Miss Brown, the teacher in charge, had closed the class room the evening before for the purpose of visiting Ottawa and her intention to leave for her home near Ottawa the following morning, but on the morning she proposed to leave, at an early hour, an Indian by means of a skeleton key entered her dwelling and during her excitement she jumped from the upstairs bedroom window a distance of 10 feet or more, and by so doing injured her back.\n\nAn X-Ray of the injury shows a fracture of a small bone in her back, and to assure complete recovery and be able to resume her duties by the first of September next, the Doctor in charge at Espanola hospital, where she is at present, has advised her to remain quietly in the hospital until that time; otherwise, she would have to be placed in a cast which she dreads.\n\nOn account of financial difficulty she cannot afford to stay in the hospital, as it would appear that her earnings in the past has gone towards the support of other members in the family, and has make request of me to take the matter up with the Department in order to ascertain whether, or not, the Department would be willing to give some assistance in the way of paying the hospital expense.\n\nAt present her mother is with her at Espanola and will remain there until an answer is received from the Department as to whether, or not, assistance will be granted in paying the hospital expense. If the Department will not assist the mother will be forced to make some arrangement for the removal of the girl to her home.\n\nThis matter would of been reported to the Department at an earlier date if I had known the condition of Miss Brown. I did not find out her exact condition until I made a trip to Espanola yesterday, Sunday, and found her in the above circumstances.\n\nUnder the above circumstances as to where and the way this accident took place, and taking into consideration the financial circumstances of this unfortunate girl I would most respectfully recommend that her hospital expenses be paid. The Department might wire Miss Brown direct to Espanola in order to save time in letting the mother know whether, or not, the girl will have to be taken home.\n\nI might also say for the information of the Department that the Indian implicated in this case was given a sentence of five years in Kingston penitentiary with twenty strokes of lash.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Indian Agent,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6120, File 382-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, July 15, 1931.\n\nDr. H.

Learning that Agent Lewis had already sent you a complete report, I did not think it of advantage to send you any details about this sad affair.\n\nAt 2:00 A.M. Saturday, June 27th, Miss Brown was suddenly awakened by a noise, and her first reaction was to see a tall man standing in the door of her sleeping room. The Indian had one of her towels...\nover his head and a sort of greyish gown over his shoulders to disguise himself. The next and almost instantaneous realization that Miss Brown experienced was that the Indian was on the top of her in bed, holding one of his hands on her mouth and the other hand on her privates. Half awoken she pushed him back (without his offering much resistance) raised the window blind, opened the window and jumped on the ground. She partially recognized the Indian by his shoes and trousers.\n\nAfter her fall she was able to drag herself to an Indian house and sent for Dr. Shaw. She asked to be brought to Little Current.\nExtremely shy, she refused at first to give any particulars nor evidence. It took me three days to obtain her good will in giving her evidence. She gave a splendid declaration and Jos. Mandamin her assistant was sentenced to five years and 20 lashes. Mr. Gurn has evidently told you her present condition.\n\nYours devotedly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPardon rush\nJuly 17, 1931.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nFather Papineau has replied, in a personal letter, to mine of the 11th instant, with reference to the attack on Miss Brown of the Buzwah School. The added information he gives is as follows: - About 2 A.M., Saturday, June 27th, the teacher was awakened by a noise and she saw a tall man standing at the door of her bedroom. He had one of her towels over his head and a greyish gown over his shoulders, evidently to disguise himself. He attacked Miss Brown and she was able to defend herself without her assailant offering much resistance. She raised the window blind, opened the window and jumped.\n\nHer assailant, whom Father Papineau speaks of as \"The Indian\", was partially recognized by the teacher, on account of his shoes and trousers. \"After her fall she was able to drag herself to an Indian house and sent for Dr. Shaw. She asked to be brought in to Little Current. Extremely shy, she refused at first to give any particulars or evidence. It took me 3 days to obtain her good will in giving her evidence. She gave a splendid declaration and Joe Mandamin, her assailant, was sentenced to 5 years and 20 lashes.\"\nManitowaning, July 17th, 1931\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of Departmental Letter No. I9-1/I of the 14th instant with further reference to the case of Miss Ida Brewm, teacher in the Buzwah Indian Day School, upon whom an unfortunate attack was made by an Indian, and in reply I have the honour to report that the Indian implicated is Joseph Mindamin, son of Mr. and Mrs. Michel Mindamin, of Wikwemikong, and is known on the Robinson Treaty Annuity pay-lists of the Manitoulin Island Unceded Band as number 77.\n\nThis Indian had a previous police record, having served terms at the Burwash Industrial Farm and Gore Bay District Gaol for forgery and theft of a horse.

It may be, and I hope that it will be so, but, after what happened, I believe that the second young woman would do better to take a school elsewhere.\n\nWhitefish Lake\u2014Without blaming her, people say that she had given encouragement to the man while at nights or at least on evenings walking out with him. They say that since the man had some kind of linen on his face, she could hardly be sure that it was he. There is apparently more compassion of the man, owing to the very severe sentence passed on him, than of the poor girl.\n\nAnd besides they remark that this summer at Goose Bay when 2 of our girls had been victims most evidently of a white man and of an Indian boy\u2014in each case the accused was discharged\u2014while they say now that it was question of a white girl it has been so different.\n\nYou may judge whether or not it is advisable for Mrs. Brown to come back.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6120, File 382-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, July 28, 1931.\n\nMadam:\n\nThe Department has been giving careful consideration to the best course to pursue in connection with the Buswah Indian Day School and your re-engagement. The conclusion reached is that it would be in your best interests and perhaps in the best interests of the community at Buswah if you transferred to another school. There is a vacancy at the Lower French River Indian Day School, near Pickerel, Ont., in the Parry Sound agency, and the Department desires to arrange for your incumbency there as from September first, next. Salary at the same rate, viz.: $650 for the 10 teaching months, would be allowed.\n\nThe Lower French River School is situated 1\u00bd miles from Pickerel Station and Post Office. One has to cross the river at Pickerel, by boat in the summer as there is no bridge at that point. The classroom is not as good a building as the one at Buswah, but the teacher's residence, which is a separate building, is a very nice little house. Both the school and the teacher's residence are heated by wood stoves. There is an average attendance of 9 or 10. The school may be reached from either Sudbury or Parry Sound, by Canadian National Railway.\n\nPlease let me know immediately if this transfer is acceptable, as the Department wishes to complete arrangements for its schools for the coming year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nMiss Ida Brown,\nEspanola Hospital,\nEspanola, Ont.\nJuly 28, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Gallagher:\n\nI wish to bring to your attention the case of Joe Mandamin, of Wikwemikong, Ont., 36 year old ward of this Department. On the 8th instant, this Indian was sentenced, in police court at Gore Bay, to 5 years in Portsmouth Penitentiary and 20 lashes. He had been convicted of housebreaking and indecent assault.\n\nIt appears that, about 2 A.M., of the 27th ultimo, Mandamin, using a skeleton key, entered the residence of Miss Ida Brown, teacher of the Buswah Indian Day School, which is situated between Wikwemikong and Manitowaning. A Canadian Press dispatch, printed in Ottawa papers of the 10th instant, reads in part as follows: \"She was sleeping in her room in the school building, when she awoke to find a man in the room, wearing a light coloured dress. When he attacked her, she stuck her fingers in his eyes and jumped 16 feet from a window to the ground.\" Miss Brown suffered an injury to her spine and is now resting in hospital at Espanola at departmental expense. She wishes to return to her school in September, and her medical attendant believes she will be recovered by that time.\n\nThis Department does not in any way condone the action of Joe Mandamin; but, recently, there has come to my attention information that, I believe, should be placed before your Branch. Joe's parents, when writing to the Department for advice and help, state: \"By reports, Joe and Miss Brown were out driving and went to dances together, and we don't think he would assault her\". Evidence that Joe was well known to Miss Brown has been given to the Superintendent of Indian Education by the\n\n- teacher of\n\nM. F. Gallagher, Esq.,\nChief of Clemency Branch,\nDept. of Justice,\nOttawa, Ont.\nteacher of the Kaboni Indian School, which is 4 miles from Buzwah. The parish priest at Wikwemikong has written in part as follows: \"Without blaming her (Miss Brown), people say that she had given encouragement to the man... at least on evenings walking out with him.\"\n\nIt has also been reported to the Department that Joe Mandamin was sub-normal and, in addition, had been drinking the night of the offence. Rev. Father E. A. Papineau, S. J., of Little Current, has written that Miss Brown gave him the declaration which was used at the trial after considerable persuasion. He writes that the teacher, when half awake, pushed Mandamin away without his offering much resistance, raised the window blind, opened the window and jumped to the ground.\n\nIt is probable that Miss Brown's injury and Mandamin's early record - convictions for theft and forgery - were partly responsible for the stiff sentence. The man's acquaintancehip for the teacher, his ridiculous efforts at disguise and his lack of violence - taken together - suggest an unusual attitude of mind.\n\nSome of the facts may not have been brought out at the trial, and I write to suggest that your Department give consideration to remission of the lashes.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nOttawa, July 28, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has given careful consideration to your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to the difficulty in which you state Joseph finds himself. I may say there has been considerable correspondence in this connection. The sentence given Joe is now receiving consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMr. Michel Mandamin,\nWikwemikong,\nOnt.\nOttawa, July 28, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to the unfortunate affair at the Buzwah Indian Day School. I wish to state that the advisability of transferring Miss Brown elsewhere is now receiving the attention of the Department. I may also say that the sentence imposed on the teacher's assailant is receiving consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nRev. G. A. Artus, S.

F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Ida Brown,\nEspanola Hospital,\nEspanola, Ont.\nOttawa, August 1, 1931.\n\nDear Miss Brown:\n\nYour sister has left with me your letter of the 27th ultimo, and I note you are doubtful if you will be able to commence teaching on the first of September. I believe you are just a little discouraged from your enforced stay in bed, and I am still hopeful that Dr. Harvie's first estimate of two months will be quite accurate.\n\nI have been in touch with a few teachers in the past, since receiving your letter, and I have secured the services of one who will take, for a few weeks or months, whatever position we hold for you. So, you do not need to worry about work. It will be ready for you as soon as you are ready for it.\n\nThe question now to be decided is what school would be the best in your case. The Secretary wrote you on the 26th ultimo, suggesting the Lower French River Indian Day School, near Pickerel, Ont. This was my first suggestion, but I am still looking for something still better from the standpoint of living conditions. At very few of our Catholic Indian day schools in the East do two or more teachers live together. Further, I know of no single roomed school where the teacher can board in a white home. Perhaps the nicest place for you would be at St. Regis, where four teachers live together. Your sister has taught there and you will know something of conditions. The difficulty will be to create a vacancy for you there,\n\nMiss Ida Brown,\nEspanola Hospital,\nEspanola, Ont.\nmaking enquiries to this end now.\n\nEven if you have written, accepting a transfer to the Lower French River School, you might write me again, letting me have your reaction to St. Regis. An early reply will be appreciated.\n\nAs I explained to Mrs. Morris, the Department cannot consider compensation if your disability proves temporary, but we will continue to pay your hospital and medical costs. Any proposal to move you to Ottawa or to Venesta must, of course, be settled by your family and yourself and Dr. Harvie. Dr. Harvie is your medical attendant and I strongly recommend that you take his advice.\n\nAgain expressing the earnest wish that your recovery is rapid and complete,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell V. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nHiwemikong, Ont.\nJuly 28, 1931.\n\nDepartment of Ind.

MacKenzie, Secretary - Ottawa\n\nI thank you for your letter No. 19-1-1.\n\nI have communicated to Miss Brown these reasons why I believe it to be better for her to be transferred to another school, in which case we desire very much to see Miss Stella King appointed for Patmar.\n\nAs for her assistant's case, though I was not present at the trial, I knew that there had been no other eye-witnesses than the young woman herself, that from her I learned (before the trial) that the man had a kind of a veil around his head... and that he put out the lamp as soon as he entered the room that then was in darkness... How then could this man be recognized with certainty? - Miss Brown, when I went to see her on the morning following the deed in question, she did not know who it was... Only when the name of the man arrested was suggested to her by Mr. P. Lewis, she said it must be he. I have no doubt that, while she said so, she believed it. But as a fact, could not her believing it be a mistake? It seems to me, that there was and there could be no doubt.\n\nAnd I remember very well, first of all, that at one of the similar cases where I had to be a short while before, the crown attorney told me that the woman's declaration is not accepted as evidence unless there is another witness,... and secondly, that I heard the magistrate in his speech to the\n...insisting that should there remain any doubt in their mind, the accused should be given the benefit of it and be discharged. And so it happened twice when the girls victims were Indian women.\n\nThis may help the Indian Department's officers in their efforts to have the case reconsidered.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6120, File 382-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, August 7, 1931.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 28th ultimo, applying for a position in an Indian school.

They direct, accordingly, that all accounts for medical and hospital expenses be submitted to the Department of Health to be taxed by officials of that department before payment is authorized.\n\n(Signed) Watson Sealar\n\nActing Secretary.\nOctober 23, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. SCOTT,\n\nI have to report concerning the latest developments in the case of Miss Ida Brown, formerly employed as teacher at the Buxah Indian Day School. You will remember that Miss Brown was injured when she jumped from the upstairs window of the residence at the school, on June 27th, when an Indian attacked her. With your concurrence, the Department promised to pay the hospital and medical expenses while she was recovering from a fractured spine.\n\nOn October 14th, after Miss Brown had been in Espanola Hospital for 3\u00bd months, the medical officer there reported that \"her progress was slower than hoped for last month and it was necessary to prolong her time in bed to three months. She has, however, been able to sit out of bed the last two days with a spine splint and is progressing well now. I expect she will be able to leave the hospital in the course of another one or two weeks and probably resume her duties some time next month\". Two days later, the authorities at the hospital telegraphed that Miss Brown had \"developed delusions of persecution and required restraint. She has fear of remaining in hospital, is now able to walk with back splint. Advise transferring her home under escort\". After getting in touch with her parents at Venosta, Que., the Department authorized an escort to her home.\n\nMiss Brown left Espanola on Saturday the 17th instant, in charge of Miss Paradis, senior nurse of the Espanola Hospital - a very competent person. There was quite a bit of difficulty on the train and when they arrived in Ottawa, early Sunday morning, the nurse thought it better to have the girl rest at Water Street Hospital for the day. Miss Brown is still suffering from delusions concerning persecution and it was necessary to telephone to her mother to come to Ottawa. The mother and brother had a rather good effect on the patient and the latter slept all night. I engaged a special nurse, Miss Quinn, for the day, to relieve Nurse Paradis, and for that night and the ensuing week, a Nurse Villeneuve, who was to accompany Miss Brown to her home at Venosta and was to receive $7.00 a day for her services. Monday morning, the condition of Miss Brown was such that it was considered advisable to send her home by car, and I engaged a Bank Street heated taxi, at a cost of $11.00, for the trip. The patient\nwas accompanied by her mother, Nurse Villeneuve, who was to stay at Venosta the week, and Nurse Paradis from Espanola. I saw that Miss Brown was examined by the general Hospital House Surgeons before discharge. It was felt by all that had been associated with the case, including Dr. Stone, our Director of Medical Services, with whom I had been in close touch in the matter, that a few days at home might make a wonderful difference in her mental condition. I advised the mother and Nurse Villeneuve to get in touch with the family physician - Dr. Desjardins, of Gracefield - if Miss Brown did not improve.\n\nIt appears that when the patient reached the home there was a marked improvement for the rest of the day. She walked around the house and yard and chatted freely with the members of the family also ate at the dining room table. From Tuesday until the present time, however, there was a serious setback, as the patient would no longer take nourishment of any kind and would not converse with even her own people. The brother drove to Ottawa with a letter from Nurse Villeneuve, asking for further advice and urging immediate attention. Dr. Desjardins recommended immediate removal to an institution, but the mother was insisting on an examination by a neurologist.\n\nDr. Stone made enquiries as to the provincial responsibility in case institutional care was needed and we were of the opinion that it might be advisable to have the matter decided in Quebec. With your concurrence, Dr. C. R. Graham, of this city, a psychiatrist of much experience and well known to Dr. Stone, was engaged, so that the Department would have a report on Miss Brown's condition. He, Dr. Stone and myself motored to Venosta last evening, and, after examining Miss Brown, he recommended immediate removal to a proper institution. Dr. Desjardins, the family physician, was also present, and today the family made arrangements to take her to the asylum at Longue Pointe, a few miles east of Montreal. With reference to the matters discussed in this case, I clearly explained to Mr. Brown, in the presence of Doctors Stone and Desjardins, that the Department could accept no further responsibility. We will have presented to us the account of the Espanola Hospital, which will include Nurse Paradis' expenses - a total of approximately $350.00; $4.00 or $5.00 for Special Nurse Quinn; a like amount from the Water Street Hospital: $11.00 from the Bank Street Taxi: Dr. Graham's fee and approximately $50.00 for the services and expenses of Nurse Villeneuve. Mr. Brown asked me this morning if we would pay all or part of the cost of sending the patient to Longue Pointe by car to Ottawa, as there was an unfortunate misunderstanding regarding the train service this morning, and they had to wait over 6 hours. I regretted that the Department could give no further help.\n\nI informed Mr. Brown that his sister had our cheque for $255 which, I understand, is not yet cashed.\nand that his sister, in her right mind, would want it expended freely in the effort for her recovery. I regret that he did not appear particularly satisfied with all we have done for Miss Brown. He remarked that there was approximately $55 in money and $35 worth of clothing lost while his sister was at Espanola Hospital. There may be a misunderstanding in this connection, however; but I promised to write to the hospital with a view to ascertaining if she had any property there.\n\nWhen the accounts in connection with Miss Brown's care are to hand, it will be necessary to have them taxed by the Department of Health, as directed by Treasury Board Minute of June 3, 1930, a copy of which is hereunder.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, October 24, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, enclosing an account for your services in connection with Miss Ida Brown. As the Department explained some time ago and repeated to Mr. Michael Brown at Venosta on the 22nd instant, no expenses in connection with her present condition can be met by us. It is considered that the Department's responsibility ended when she was sufficiently recovered from her spine injury to return to her home. I am returning the account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nArthur Desjardins, Esq., M. D.,\nGracefield, P. Q.\nOttawa, October 24, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nDuring recent conversations with members of the family of Miss Ida Brown, the Department has learned that they are under the impression approximately $65.00 in money and $35.00 worth of clothing were lost or mislaid while the patient was at Espanola. I promised to write to you, to learn if any of her property had been left there.\n\nI should be grateful if you would now present the account of the Espanola Hospital, which should include Nurse Paradis' expenses. I regret to inform you that it was found necessary to place Miss Brown, yesterday, in the asylum at Longue Pointe. For three previous days, it had been found impossible to get her to take nourishment of any kind at her home at Venosta, Que.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nH. H. Harvie, Esq., M.D.,\nEspanola Hospital,\nEspanola, Ont.\nDr. W. H. Harvie\nEspanola, Ont. October 20/31.\n\nR. A. F. Nelson\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI had prepared a report for you this morning but on speaking to Miss Paradis who returned at noon today, I will omit much of what I had intended to say since she and Mr. Ferrier have discussed the case and covered much of the ground. As far as what Miss Paradis reported to Mr. Ferrier I need only say that Miss Paradis has had very close contact with the patient throughout her stay here and her report is absolutely reliable.\n\nWhen Miss Brown came to us on July the second I noticed from the first that she was slightly \"odd\". Not having known her before, and since the experience she had just had was sufficient to shake anyone's nervous stability I expected that this would clear with rest and time. Since then she has taken little interest in the things which patients usually welcome to help occupy their minds when confined to bed. In view of the distance she was from home special efforts have been made to entertain her in the way of providing books magazines etc., supplying her room with flowers and a number of visitors have been arranged. To all this she showed only an extreme apathy. As the third month of her stay in bed came she showed no desire to get up and complained of much pain in her back, which, however, vanished in a few minutes on moving her to a different room. When I started getting her out of bed about the sixth of this month she was very disinclined to do so though her back appeared quite strong and certainly in\nDr. H. H. Harvie\nEsquimalt, Ont.\n\nthe past few days she has shown considerable strength. The X-Rays indicate the expected result in consolidation of the fracture. Miss Paradis has reported to Mr. Ferrier her sudden change mentally, starting on Oct. 14th with restlessness and lack of cooperation, on the 15th with marked apprehension for her safety, and on the 16th with violent refusal to be without at least two people with her at night, refusal to go to bed etcetera, and varying from refusal to attempts to resist restraint and escape form the hospital. On the afternoon of the 16 and on the 17th she was absolutely irrational.\n\nDr. Harvie, acting with the advice of Dr. Gallie of Toronto who examined her X-Ray films, considered the average time for a case of this sort before being able to walk should be about two months. She has had over three months in bed and her X-Ray films indicate good consolidation. I believe it is reasonably safe to allow her to be on her feet without support now. With her mental condition such as it is it is impossible to determine if she is having any pain or indication of strain or not.\n\nIt is extremely unfortunate that this mental condition should intervene at this point in her convalescence from her back condition. While it was noticeable that her apathy was not clearing as time went on, there was no warning of the onset of this sudden acute mental breakdown or I would have sent her home on a stretcher before it occurred. There has been nothing in her surroundings here to cause a mental change at this time. If her mental aberration had been due to the accident and its accompanying circumstances one would expect it to be decreasing rather than\nincreasing and to have been different from what it has been.\n\nI shall be glad to know of her final disposition and to be of any assistance to you possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. B.H. Berry.\n\nP.S. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to Dr. H.H. Harvie who is at present convalescing from an illness in Toronto.\n\nX-ray negatives placed in safe.\nOctober 23rd, 1931.\n\nDoctor Stone:\n\nIn accordance with your request I visited Miss Ida Brown at her home in Venosta, P.Q., in company with Dr. Desjardins, of Gracefield. The patient refused to co-operate in any way with the examination and actively resisted to such an extent that a proper complete neurological examination was impossible, but sufficient information was obtained to come to a fair estimate of her condition and to arrive at a definite diagnosis as to her mental disorder. I believe this young woman is suffering from Dementia Praecox of the catatonic type. As far as I could estimate I do not think she has any organic lesion of the spinal cord, and I do not believe that she is pregnant although time will tell in both these respects. My diagnosis of Dementia Praecox would of necessity exclude recent shock as a cause of the disease because to quote Dawson's extract from Hoeh \"like the poet Dementia Praecox is born, not made\". Also from the available information received from available sources, the patient would appear to have been naturally of a quiet, shy, retiring disposition, while possessing considerable intellectual ability; quite a usual type of pre-dementia praecox personality. I append herewith a summary of my examination of Miss Brown's mental condition:\n\nGeneral condition: The patient is lying quietly in bed, clad in night robe, her hair rather disordered, bed clothes thrown partially aside. She has a vacant staring expression, rolls her head from side to side and sucks and bites her lips. The legs are stretched out rigidly and the arms flexed on the chest. The patient appears to be a well nourished female about 20 years of age. She actively resists any attempt at examination.\n\nPhysical abnormalities: Knee jerks and pupillary reflexes about normal. Other reflexes could not be examined on account of patients resistance. No pigmentation of breasts, no distention of veins of the legs, bladder apparently contains some urine, and Dr. Desjardins could not feel any abnormal tumour in the abdomen, bowels have been confined for about six days inspite of enemata, tongue dry, glazed and cracked, lips covered with sordes.\n\nConsciousness: The patient refused to talk, which made it very .......\ndifficult to learn her mental processes. She took little or no interest in her surroundings, her attention was easily attracted by a touch, but was only retained long enough to fight off the examiner, the mind was dissociated to a marked degree from its environment and was occupied by a phantasy of some kind. This self isolation was the most conspicuous symptom in her condition.\n\nCognition: Sensations of touch, sight and hearing were not impaired but no hallucinations in either sphere were shown during examination. Somatic hallucinations may be present however and be related to her delusion. Her conversation is limited to a few short sentences, related to matters intimately connected with herself: \"Get away, don't touch me, Mother don't leave me, He is coming again\" being the sum total of her conversation for the greater part of the day. This suggests that there is a paucity of ideas.\n\nOrientation: She recognized her mother and brother and realized that the Doctors and Nurse are strangers. Also evidently knows their sex. Knowledge of time or place could not be estimated, but she knew she was at home when brought in from the hospital and for some hours was much brighter and talked.\n\nDelusions: She informed Miss Villeneuve, the Nurse, that she was going to have a baby and asked her to do something to get rid of it. She is constantly rubbing at her abdomen.\n\nConation: Her conduct showed negativism, her movements were purposeful, sudden, energetic and directed against the suggestion and actions of the examiner. She refused to speak, refused to eat or drink for 48 hours, resisted the actions of the bowels for about six days and the other calls of nature entirely until catheterized after which she yielded in that respect, she constantly stared at the ceiling and rolled her head from side to side, grimaced, and bit her lips, her conversation when she did speak was sharp, short and to the point \"Don't touch me, get away\".\n\nAffection: Her face was expressionless and emotional control was weak. An outburst of angry words and a blow were the immediate response to an attempt to feel her pulse. The only sign of affection was her request to her mother not to leave her.\nDr. W. Harvie\nEspanola, Ont.\nOctober 27/31.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of Oct. 24th to Dr. Harvie No 19-1-1 in regards to Miss Brown's money and clothing thought by her people to be mislaid or lost while her stay at Espanola. I wish to inform you that we haven't any knowledge of another money or clothing with the exception of four nightgowns which were in the wash when she left and have since been forwarded to her home in Venasta.\n\nAny money she owned was kept in her own possession at all times according to her own wishes and hasn't any knowledge as to how much she had until a couple of days previous to her departure when she asked me to put a cheque and a five dollar bill away in safe keeping. When I offered to do so she objected and said no; she would keep it with her. The same amount as far as my knowledge was taken from her at the Water St. Hospital and remitted to her mother on her departure from there.\n\nAt different times she mentioned of having to keep financially a sister Dorothy who is residing in Detroit and her people at home. She purchased a dress, a pair of shoes, stockings writing paper, talcum powder, stamps etc. I regret to say that other than this I cannot furnish you with any other information as to how she might...\nhave disposed of the $55.00 if the said amount is correct.\n\nEnclosed find a statement of my expenses in full which I prove will be satisfactory.

The Department now wishes to meet such costs in the case of Miss Ida Brown, teacher of the Buzwah Indian Day School, Manitoulin Island, who, on the night of June 25th, last, was assaulted by an Indian who broke into her residence on the reserve. To escape, Miss Brown jumped from the upstairs window and suffered a fracture of her spine. She was placed in hospital at Espanola where she remained from July 2nd to October 17th. About the middle of October, when her back was healing nicely, she developed delusions of persecution and it was decided to send her to her home at Venosta, Que., under escort. After considerable trouble, she was placed in her home on October 19th. On the 22nd of October, her mental condition having not improved as was hoped, it was necessary to give the family and the local doctor advice, as the patient was refusing to eat or drink. The services of a psychiatrist were engaged, and, upon his advice and the advice of the family physician, the family made arrangements to place Miss Brown in the asylum at Longue Pointe.\n\nThe accounts are as follows:\n\n| Description                                                                 | Amount   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Espanola Hospital                                                          | $351.00  |\n| Miss Margaret McMillan, Private Nurse at Espanola                          | 7.00     |\n| Miss Gertrude Paradis, Superintendent of Espanola Hospital, for services and expenses taking |          |\n| Miss Brown to her home                                                      | 74.75    |\n| Ottawa General Hospital, where it was found necessary to have patient and escort rest for one day |          |\n| Miss Agnes E.

Morris,\nBox 71,\nPorter St. Station\nDetroit,\nMich.\nOttawa, November 17, 1931.\n\nDear Mrs. Morris:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to your sister Ida, formerly teacher at the Buzwah Indian Day School, and I can quite understand that you are very much upset. I saw your sister when she was in Ottawa, on her way home, and, in reply to your question, I may say she recognized me, though she was certainly not in a normal condition.\n\nThe Department's information is as follows:\nOn October 16th, the medical officer of the Espanola Hospital reported that Ida was now sitting out of bed with a spine splint and was progressing well. Two days later, however, they telegraphed to us that she had developed delusions of persecution and required restraint. It appeared that Ida had fear of remaining in hospital, and, as she was able to walk with a back splint and the doctors so recommended the action, she was escorted to her home in Venosta. For three days, she rested on Monday, October 18th, and until Monday morning at the General Hospital, Water Street, Ottawa. I was called there and your sister chatted with me but was still suffering from her delusion. It was necessary to get your mother and your brother to come to Ottawa to try to reassure her. Your mother stayed over night and returned with Ida by taxi to Venosta on Monday morning, and for the rest of the day there was a marked improvement in her mental condition. However, on Tuesday, October 20th, there was a serious setback, as she would not take nourishment of any kind and would not talk to her mother or brother. Dr. Desjardins, of Gracefield, recommended immediate removal to an institution, where she could be properly cared for, but your mother wanted her examined by an expert on mental disorders. The Department secured the services of an experienced psychiatrist who saw your sister at Venosta and advised your brother to agree to the suggestion of Dr. Desjardins. Ida was then sent to an institution at Longue Pointe, just a few miles east of Montreal. I have not had any information direct from Longue Pointe concerning her present condition.\n\nSo that you will know that the Department has taken as much interest in your sister's case as possible.\n\nMrs. E. Morris,\nBox 71,\nPorter St. Station,\nDetroit, Mich.,\nU. S. A.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6120, File 382-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nis possible, I wish to mention the accounts which we are now sending to the Treasury Board, requesting authority for payment:\n\nEspanola Hospital - $351.00\nPrivate Nurse at Espanola for one day - 7.00\nServices and expenses of Nurse Paradis, Superintendent of Espanola Hospital, who escorted your sister to her home - 74.75\nWater Street Hospital - 6.50\nPrivate Nurse at Ottawa - 3.50\nTaxi to Venosta - 11.00\nPsychiatrist's fee - 25.00\nPrivate Nurse to assist the family for the first few days upon Ida's return to her home at Venosta - 47.70\n\nTotal - $526.45\n\nI believe there need be no further worry regarding Ida's back condition. Her real trouble now is her mental condition. In the opinion of the Doctor at the Espanola Hospital and of the Psychiatrist who examined Ida at her home in Venosta, this condition was not caused by her recent accident.\n\nI hope that, by now, your sister is on the road to recovery and that the next report from Montreal will be very favourable.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

Your department, we understand, also paid part of the transportation charges, when she was committed to this institution.\n\nWe would be interested to know who was the indian who frightened her, if he was tried and convicted, and if so, the length of his sentence. Also the date of his trial and the jail in which he is serving time, if sentenced.\n\nWe should be pleased to have any other detail your department might have, on the case.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nMedical Superintendent\nOttawa, December 3, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nRe Ida Brown - 22626.\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to Ida Brown, a former teacher of an Indian school, who was placed in your institution on the 16th ultimo.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Indian who entered Miss Brown's room and frightened her is Joe Mindamin, of the Wikwemikong Reserve, Manitoulin Island. He was tried by the police magistrate at Gore Bay on July 5th, last, for housebreaking and indecent assault, and sentenced to five years in Portsmouth Penitentiary and to receive twenty lashes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

General of Indian Affairs.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am at present in serious trouble which I do not altogether understand.\n\nI spent almost four months in Esplanade Hospital believing my spine was fractured and I was told that my expenses were paid by the Dept. of Indian Affairs. You know that I wrote to the Dept.\nmyself and that my letters showed that I really believed that my spine was injured.\n\nPlease let me know as soon as possible if my expenses at Esquimalt Hospital were really paid by the Department of Indian Affairs so ad I may be able to understand and try to right this before anything serious happens. I do not succeed in doing so in the meantime.\n\nPlease answer as soon as possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIda Brown\n\nP.S. I was teaching at Burywah, in Northern Ontario, near Manitowaning Ont.\nOttawa, December 30, 1931.\n\nDear Miss Brown:\n\nIn reply to your letter, I may say that the hospital and medical expenses which were incurred after your accident have been paid by the Department. It was decided to pay these expenses until such time as your back was sufficiently healed to permit of your return to your home at Venosta. Included in these expenses which have been paid were the services of the nurses and transportation to your home. You may, therefore, rest assured that there are no outstanding accounts for expenses in connection with your accident up to the time you reached your home.\n\nIt is hoped that, as a result of the rest and care which you are receiving, your health will be restored.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMiss Ida Brown,\nBourget Sanatorium,\nGatineau, P.Q.\nDear Father,\n\nI received your letter a while ago and was glad to hear from you again, and in good health. I have something to say to you in this letter, and I am sorry I didn't tell you last summer when I first got here, but I didn't know and now I do. You know now it's about my case. I was arrested on the 27th of June 1931 by Mr. Lewis Constable, and the constable who arrested me said, the Indian agent told me to arrest you. Well when I asked the Indian constable, Bob Lewis and Abe Stewart, the reason for my arrest they said, you went over at Bayview School last night and scared the teacher, and of course I told them where I was and that I was not near the school, and I told the third of them all the same story. I knew where I was all that night, and I was tried three times and the magistrate never even once asked me where I was whereby I could be proved to have been there and where I spent the night.\n\nWhen I got my first trial on the 27th of June the magistrate read out my charge saying, you broke the door window and tried to rape the teacher and he asked me if I pleaded guilty, and I said not guilty, my witnesses said all the same thing where and when I was at the time. I told my sister about my second trial at Little Current and ask Sophie for you to read that letter and you will see if I have not the space to write it down here, and ask Sophie if she ever asked Miss McQuar about that story. And what puzzles me is where is Miss Brown witness she had not any and she didn't even know who it was scared her, and when Chief Louis Manitowabi investigated the doors at the school nothing was broke and Miss Brown stated to the Chief and his wife and Benny Conaway that she didn't know who went and scared her. Well father call to the Chief Louis Manitowabi and Benny Conaway to visit you and ask him to make a statement of what the girl said at his first interview with his concerning her stating she could not recognize the person that scared her she stated first it was a woman then a tall man that she did not know, and that he went to the school right away and found the doors were not broken as stated in court you find this out for me and send it to me or have it forwarded to Ottawa Department Indians Affairs to the Minister of Justice. I was convicted on her statement alone they did not take my witness or my statement into consideration as you told me yet a just trial I could have got more witnesses if needed but doubt this it would be necessary.\n\nWell father telling you to wait for him Miss Isabella Better to write again to Ottawa and keep this letter please don't write to Ottawa before two months you can wait until I write to you next month again. I got a letter from my sister about three ago. But I am sorry he didn't send any pictures this is all for now So Good Bye I am your Son\n\nMr. Joseph Mandamin, Kingston Ontario Box 22\nW\u00f4kwemikong 3rd June 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nAs I am pretty ignorant of the business of politics, I thought of asking you a great favour. I enclose one letter that is perfectly correct, according to all the witnesses. That poor Indian has been condemned without the least proof, the least witness. The chap has been condemned to lash twice, and two years of penitentiary.\n\nAs you may be very busy, would you be kind enough to forward it this letter to the Minister of Justice. He may order a new trial.\n\nI thank you in advance for the great favour.\n\nWe had the visit of Mr. Inspector who seems to be pleased with our schools.\n\nIn union of prayers.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nC.

King.\nOttawa, July 25, 1932.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, applying for re-appointment as teacher of the Buswah Indian Day School for the coming school year.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will be pleased to approve of your re-engagement, with salary at the same rate as was previously paid you, viz., $50 per teaching month, less 10% for the current fiscal year. You should arrange to resume duties when the school reopens after the summer holidays, on September 1st, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

S. Williams, Esq.,\nActing Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSirs:\n\nRe: Ida Brown - your file\n\nWe are writing with reference to a conversation the writer had with you and other officers of the Department some considerable time ago on the above subject. Your file will no doubt familiarize you with the facts of the case which are, briefly, these -\n\nMiss Brown was a teacher in the employ of the Department at an Indian School at or near Espanola, Ontario. In the summer of 1931 (your file will no doubt acquaint you with the relevant dates) an Indian broke into Miss Brown's room in the evening, which so frightened our client that she jumped out of the second story window, a distance of twelve feet from the ground, suffering serious injuries. She was admitted to Espanola Hospital and all her expenses while she remained in that institution were borne by the Department of Indian Affairs, in addition to certain other incidental expenses.\n\nAs a result of her injuries and the shock, Miss Brown suffered a temporary mental derangement which necessitated constant care and medical attention, after she left Espanola, which culminated in her being sent to an institution in Montreal, the St. Jean-De-Dieu Hospital at St. Gemelin, Quebec.\nThe Department has not undertaken any further responsibility in the matter and the expenses incurred subsequent to Miss Brown's leaving Espanola have not been paid. The writer spoke to Dr. D.C. Scott about a year ago and the latter said that the Department did not consider itself to be liable in any way.\n\nI am writing at the present time to ascertain if the Department, in view of subsequent developments, would reconsider the case. When the officers of the Department were last interviewed, Miss Brown was still a patient in the asylum in Quebec. It did not appear at that time that she was making any progress, and the writer is of the opinion that the possibility and likelihood of her permanent insanity weighed considerably with the officials' refusal to render further aid; because had they done so at that juncture it might have been construed as an admission of legal liability.\n\nMiss Brown has since completely recovered and is now working in a Montreal Department store. The situation has thus become materially altered. She is of the opinion that as the total expenses are now known and as there will be no further or additional expenses, the danger of admitting liability for future expenses does not exist.\n\nThis is a particularly sad case and the Department cannot help but sympathize with our client in the serious injuries that she has suffered. Her expenses and disbursements are small and it is thought that it might be recommended that they be borne by the Department and that a release of all future claims be executed by our client in favour of the Crown. A statement of these expenses is attached hereto, for your consideration.\n\nWe wish to make it clear that we are not raising the question of any legal liability on the part of the Crown, but merely as extenuating circumstances to be considered we give you the following -\n\n1. The Department paid our client's hospital and medical bills at Espanola and our client has a statement to the Doctor at Espanola, signed by the Secretary, Mr. A.D. McKenzie, at the time, from which we quote the following:\n\"In view of your report and recommendation and letter from Miss Ida Brown, Department will be responsible for hospital and medical expenses in her case. Please inform her and state Department hopes she will be completely recovered in time to return to her school at Burwash in September.\"\n\n2. The late Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Education, in his letter to our client dated August 1st, 1931, says in part as follows -\n\n\"As I explained to Mrs. Morris the Department cannot consider compensation if your disability proves temporary, but we will continue to pay your hospital and medical costs.\"\n\n3. Though we have not seen Dr. Harvie's detailed report, we conclude from a communication that we have received from Dr. B. H. Berry, Dr. Harvie's assistant, that Miss Brown's mental derangement was due directly to the accident, and the result of other inquiries convince us that there was no insanity in the Brown family.\n\nWe would earnestly request, therefore, that this case be reconsidered and that the final expenses of this unfortunate girl be taken care of and that she provide the Crown with a complete release in return therefor. If you wish to discuss this matter further, the writer will be pleased to call at your office at any time that is convenient to you.\n\nWe have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servants,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnc.\nTo the\n\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nre - your letter of July 28th 1931\n\nHave you considered this case as promised, and is it possible that Joe's freedom be granted, or be given a shorter sentence. I am an old man, crippled with rheumatism for four years now, and this Joe of mine was my great help. Therefore I want to know if he has to serve four more years.\nI wish (if it can be done) that his sentence be cut shorter as perhaps he is not altogether to blame for what happened on the 27th of June.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. Michael Mandamin.\nOctober 7th, 1932.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th August on behalf of Miss Ida Brown, enclosing an account for hospital treatment, medical services and other incidental expenses in respect of an injury received while Miss Brown was engaged as teacher of an Indian school. The circumstances of Miss Brown's case are as set forth in your letter. It is noted that Miss Brown's request for the payment of this account is not based on any legal liability on the part of the Department but merely on extenuating circumstances as set forth in your letter.\n\nIn reply I have to say that in order that every consideration should be given to this claim, I referred the whole matter to the Honourable the Superintendent General who personally reviewed this case. I am now directed to advise you that, while the Department is very sympathetic towards Miss Brown, it is felt that in view of the fact that no legal liability is involved, and of the further fact that an Order in Council had been passed authorizing payment of $526.45, which was considered at the time to be extremely generous, the Department would not now be justified in a further recommendation to Council on behalf of Miss Brown.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMessrs.

I have the honor to report that I have carefully gone into this matter and find that the School needs the following repairs: The roof should be taken off and the walls raised at least ten inches and a new roof put on, a new belfry put on, new ceiling, new door, new window, new floor, plastered inside and out, porch repaired, chimney built, whitewashed inside and out, and the closets repaired. I have had a contractor, Mr Neil McMarten, look over this work and he has agreed to do all the above repairs for $192.50.\n\nIn regard to the teacher I beg to say that there is no suitable lodging place nor house that they could get and it will be necessary to build a house for them. I have had Mr McMarten make an estimate on a building 16 x 22 feet two story with an addition 16 x 18 feet one story. He has agreed to build this complete, with cellar under kitchen for $1250.00.\n\nThere could be a smaller building erected say 16 x 22 feet, one story, with stone foundation, no cellar, which would give two rooms for about the cost of $500.00.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont..\nIf the School was repaired and a teachers dwelling erected separate, the cost of those would go a long way in paying for a new School with teachers residence attached. On examination of the old school since the snow went away I find it is only built on posts, and will only do, if repaired, five or six years at the outside.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 29, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant in reference to the provision of school accommodation at Nuzwah.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the contents of your letter have been noted. The Department is not prepared at the present time to expend an amount such as suggested for the erection of a teacher's residence. If a new building is necessary the Department wishes to have your opinion as to whether it would not be preferable to erect a school-house and remodel the existing building for a teacher's residence, such as was done at Wikwemikongising. The Department has made no special provision for new buildings at this point this year, but at a later date might be able to find funds if decided to build, and has at present a plan of a school-house for twenty-five pupils that would meet the requirements here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

He also suggests that a new building be erected on a more central site.\n\nThe Department has no funds to erect a new building at the present time, but, while desiring to make the present building as comfortable as possible during the coming winter, cannot undertake any undue expenditure for the purpose. You should furnish a report as to what you consider should be done to fit this building up satisfactorily for the coming winter. Only the repairs absolutely necessary for the purpose will be approved. You should furnish an estimate of the cost of having these repairs made. Kindly give this matter your early attention, in order that any minor repairs can be made before the cold weather sets in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\nFor Asst.

These repairs are being made at the present time.\n\nThe teacher's residence is in need of repairs as some of the plaster on the walls is dropping off, the windows are in bad condition and the floor is broken; also the house needs banking with earth.\n\nThe cost of the above repairs I would estimate at approximately, $25.00, to place the buildings in a fit condition for the coming winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary:\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 12, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant with reference to the repairs required to the Buswah Day School and teacher's residence.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is noted that you are having the repairs made to the windows and plaster in the school building.\n\nWith reference to the teacher's residence I beg to say that you should arrange to have the repairs made to the plaster on the walls, the windows repaired, the floor repaired and the house banked with earth and the cost of the work should not exceed your estimate of $25.00. You should arrange to have these repairs carried out as soon as possible, in order that the house can be made comfortable before the cold weather sets in. When the work is completed you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.

King\nTeacher\nOTTAWA, February 27th, 1922.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, regarding the necessity for a new school building and teacher's residence at Buswah.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is aware of the condition of the present building and the desirability for a new school. We have, however, no funds available for the purpose. This matter is being referred to Mr. Agent Lewis to place before the band the question of providing the funds necessary to build a combined school and teacher's residence from the trust funds to the credit of their capital account held by the Department. It will depend upon what action the Indians themselves take in the matter as to whether a new school building will be erected this coming summer or not.\n\nYou may consult Mr. Agent Lewis in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Clara A. King,\nTeacher, Buswah Indian Day School,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOTTAWA, February 27th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Miss Clara A. King, teacher of the Buswah Indian day school, drawing attention to the condition of the present school building, and requesting that steps be taken as soon as possible to erect a new building with accommodation for the teacher. She states that the Indians are anxious to have their children attend school and are interested in their progress, but that the present building is in such a dilapidated condition that it is not fit to be used for school purposes.\n\nIn this connection I may say that the Department will not have any funds available out of the appropriation for the new school year to erect a building at this point. The Manitoulin Island Unceded Band has over $40,000 in its trust funds to the credit of its capital account, and it may be that the Indians would agree by resolution of the Band in council to provide sufficient funds to erect a new building. It would require at least $5,000 for the purpose of erecting a combined school and teacher's living quarters.\n\nI will be pleased if you will take this matter up with the Band, impress upon them the necessity for a new school building and endeavour to have them pass a resolution setting aside the money necessary from their capital account to erect this building. You inform the Band that the Department is quite unable to assist them in providing any grant of money towards putting up a suitable building, and that, if they desire that the work of putting up the building should be undertaken this coming summer, they will have to provide the necessary funds.\n\nYou should give this matter your early attention, and have the matter placed before the council at the next meeting, and inform the Department as to the decision arrived at.\n\nMiss King is being informed that the matter of erecting a new building has been referred to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The site for the new building should be central in order to meet the requirements of all the children. It should also permit of good drainage, and you should state the situation of the building and the direction which it will face, in order that consideration will be given to proper lighting of the classroom when the plans are being prepared.\n\nIt is intended, if the new building is erected, to provide accommodation in the building for a teacher.\n\nIf it is necessary to obtain a new site, a sufficient amount of land should be acquired to provide a playground and a school garden.\n\nYou will be good enough to furnish, as soon as possible, the information asked for, and the plans will then be prepared for the erection of the building. You should also state the number of children for whom accommodation should be provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nApril 24th, 1923.\n\nSir:-\n\nIn reply to Official Letter No. I9-I-5 of the\n27th ultimo, in regard to a site for the erection of\na new school building at Buswah, I have the honour to\nreport that a new site has been chosen where there is\ngood drainage and the building will be central in order\nto meet the requirements of all the children. The site\nis on the north side of the road from Manitowaning to\nWikwemikong, and the entrance to the building will be\nfrom the south, as the road leads east and west.\n\nOne acre of ground has been measured for the\nnew site, but it will have to be cleared as it is all\nwooded. I consider that it will cost $30.00 to clear\nand stump the land.\n\nA building to accommodate about thirty pupils\nshould be provided as there are not more than thirty\npupils in the vicinity of this school.\n\nI would most respectfully recommend to the\nDepartment that a building, which is not too expensive be\nerected, and it be heated with stoves instead of a\nfurnace.\n\nI enclose herewith a plan of the new site,\nmade by the chief and council of the Manitoulin\nIsland Unceded Band.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, April 29th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, with reference to the site chosen for the erection of the new day school building which it is proposed to erect at Buzwah, and furnishing particulars regarding the same.\n\nIn reply I have to request that you will be good enough to state who is the present owner of this site, and whether it will be necessary to pay any compensation for the acre of land chosen.\n\nIt is noted that it will be necessary to have this site cleared, as it is all wooded, and that you estimate the cost of having this work done at approximately $30.00. I have, therefore, to request that, if you are satisfied the site chosen is a central one and satisfactory in all respects, you will arrange for the labour in having this land cleared. The total cost of this work should not exceed your estimate of approximately $30.00.\n\nWe will have plans prepared for the school building to accommodate 30 children, and living quarters for the teacher will also be provided in the building.\n\nYou will be good enough to give these matters your prompt attention so that arrangements regarding the site can be completed before building operations commence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It is the opinion of the contractor, Mr. Strian, that he has done better work on some portions of the building than the specifications call for while some things are not just up to the mark, but before any further payments are made by the Department I would most respectfully recommend that some Architect or Supervisor be sent and make a thorough inspection of the building and adjust this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 27, 1923.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your official letter of the 20th inst., I beg to inform you that I will make an inspection of the Bugwah school on the arrival of the train at Little Current, on Wednesday of next week.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(R.

Kindly give this matter your immediate attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J. D. McLean)\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGeorge Strain, Esq.,\nContractor,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nI beg to report that on the 4th inst., I made an inspection of the new Buzwah combined day school and teachers' residence which has just been completed by Mr. George Strain of Gore Bay, Ont.\n\nIn general, the outside of the building presents a good appearance and the materials and workmanship are in accordance with the plans and specifications, with a few exceptions. The interior of the building in many cases is not finished according to the plans and specifications and a great deal of the workmanship was very carelessly performed. After discussing the question of the unsatisfactory work with Mr. Strain, he agreed to do what was necessary to finish the building in a proper manner, and remedy the faulty work. I am of the opinion that the faulty work was done by Mr. Strain through ignorance of good construction on his part and not from a desire to evade the plans and specifications.\n\nIf the work as enumerated below is carried out to the satisfaction of Agent Lewis, I would recommend that Mr. Strain be paid the balance due him on his contract. I may say that the building is well located and no trouble should be experienced in keeping the same perfectly dry.\n\nThe following is a list of the matters that will have to be attended to in order to remedy the faulty work, and Mr. Strain promised to have these items attended to. These items were indicated in the plans and specifications, but were not carried out as they should have been by the Contractor.\n\n- Basement walls to be beam filled,\n- Herring-boned bridging to be provided in floor joist in basement.\n- Hardwood flooring to be laid on the first floor.\n- Faulty material in wainscoting of class room to be removed and good material installed in its place.\n- Storm windows to be properly fitted.\n- Lifts and fasts to be put on all windows.\nOutside steps and porches to be rebuilt in accordance with the specifications.\nThe interior wood work is exceedingly rough. The same shall have to be sand-papered and varnished as specified.\n\nCEILING OF CLASS ROOM. The shiplap that was specified to be laid under the V joint finish was omitted. It will therefore be necessary to lay over the top of the existing V joint, another thickness of V joint at right angles to that already in place.\n\nI am today writing a letter confirming these instructions, for the Secretary's signature.\n\nARCHITECT.\nJ. D. McLean,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter to hands of Oct 6th. I wish to make one or two suggestions to you regarding the ceiling in the classroom.\n\nI presume all you want is for it to be warmer. Now would it not be alright for us to put one coat of wood fibre put on pretty dry on top of floor between the collar beams. This would certainly make it warmer & a tighter job & I am satisfied would not damage the woodwork any. I did not understand that their ceiling was to be ship lapped until after the inspector came up looking over it carefully. I seen where I had made the mistake. We could not take the ceiling off that is there now without damaging it too much as it is put on with three inch finishing nails. I have just lately found out that my varnish that I had was of a poor quality & have now got the varnish specified in the specification.\nand will carry out the rest of the work.\n\nIf any suggestion does not meet with your approval, may I use Douglas fir as I understand that I can get it from Owen Sound, how but cannot get ash.\n\nPlease wire a reply to Gore Bay as I am anxious to finish up the school.\n\nYour Sincerely,\n\nGeo Strain\nOttawa, October 12, 1922.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWith reference to the ceiling of the class-room at the Buzwah School, Mr. Strain has asked to be allowed to place best quality fibre board over ceiling sheeting between ceiling joist, in lieu of the additional \"V\" joint sheeting asked for. His request has been granted and I am quoting below the telegram which has been sent him today, to that effect.\n\n\"You are authorized to place best quality dry wood fibre over ceiling between ceiling joist of class room, in lieu of extra \"V\" joint sheeting.

The school is so situated on a hill that it could be very easily drained.\n\n(3)- Cistern froze up in winter. It appears that no vegetables can be kept in the cellar during the winter. Potatoes, onions and carrots which the teacher had stored for use froze in the cellar.\n\n(4)- There is no well for drinking water. At present it is obtained from a farmer near by. All water for cooking, etc., has to be brought in this way.\n\n(5)- For some reason or other the one stove in the teacher's rooms heated only the kitchen.\n\n// Provision should be made for next winter's wood.\n\nJ. M. Bennet,\nInsp.\nOttawa, June 1, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Buswah Indian Day School, states that while the school building is in very good condition, water entered the cellar. He says that drainage could be very easily carried out. He further states that frost entered the cellar and it was impossible to store vegetables during last winter. He also reports that a well should be dug, to provide water for drinking and cooking purposes.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will furnish a report regarding the above and state what you would advise having done in each case, as well as the probable cost of any work recommended by you.\n\nThe Inspector further recommends that provision be made in due time for the supplying of next winter's wood, in order that it will be delivered and be thoroughly dry when required. You should make arrangements for the supplying of the quantities of wood needed for next winter at each of the Indian schools in your agency. In this regard, please furnish an estimate of the quantities required, in order that you can receive the necessary authority to make the purchase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6120, File 382-5, Part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of Official Letter No. 19-1-5 of the 1st instant, in regard to the report made to the Department by the Separate School Inspector on his recent inspection of the Suswah Indian Day School, and in reply I have the honour to report that with regard to water being in the cellar there may have been a very small amount soaked through the foundation during the time of the heavy flood in the spring but there was so very little that it could hardly be noticed and it all disappeared in a very short time. With regard to frost entering the cellar it is on account of the foundation not being banked with earth last fall. If it were banked around with earth I believe that it would prevent both water and frost entering. The cost of the work would be approximately $25.00.\n\nIn regard to a well being dug, I beg to report that on account of the building being on very high ground the cost of a well would be very high, but there is a spring within 500 feet of the school building where the teacher has been getting her supply for drinking and cooking which could be put in good condition at very little expense.\n\nArrangement has been made for a supply of wood for next winter's use, but it is not to be delivered at the school until it is needed as there is still about four double cords of wood in the yard at the school. On account of there being too much old wood left in the school yard last fall to deteriorate I thought it wise not to have any more put there until the old supply was burned. Some of the old wood has been lying around the yard for three years.\n\nFor next winter's use I consider that about fifteen cords of mixed wood, poplar and birch, will be sufficient for the school and residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6120, File 382-5, Part 2)\nOttawa, June 19th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, informing the Department regarding the condition of the cellar at the Buzah Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that only a very small quantity of water soaked through the foundation, due to the flood conditions in the spring. In order to prevent frost from entering the cellar, you may arrange later on in the season to have the foundation banked with earth. We note that the cost of having this done would be approximately $25. You should bear this matter in mind and have the necessary banking of the foundation attended to before the frost sets in next fall. Properly certified vouchers should be forwarded when the work has been completed, and you should refer to this letter as your authority for having the work done.\n\nOwing to the cost, and also in view of the fact that water can be obtained from a spring, we are not prepared to authorize the digging of a well. You may, however, incur a small expenditure in having the spring which is located within 250 feet of the school building placed in good condition, in order that an adequate supply of water can be obtained for drinking and cooking purposes. This matter should be attended to during the coming summer. Properly certified vouchers should be rendered covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nWe note that you have arranged for the quantity of wood required for next winter's use, and that it will be delivered when the stock on hand has been used. We note that about 15 cords of mixed wood, poplar and birch, will be sufficient for the school and residence for next winter. You should arrange to have this wood delivered in due time to meet the requirements, and properly certified vouchers should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The stumps have been cut low but are still quite green and it would be too costly a proposition to try to remove them at the present time. In a short period they will deteriorate and can be removed by a team and plow, then the yard can be cleaned, levelled and fenced at a reasonable cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 4th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, in which you recommend that the walls of the classroom in the Ruzwah Indian Day School be renovated and the floor oiled.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange to have this work done during the coming summer holidays.

It will scarcely hold sufficient wood for the kitchen stove for a winter, and the wood for the class room stove has to be piled outside.\n\nIn order to provide woodshed space to contain sufficient wood for a winter at this school I estimate it will cost $125 to enlarge the one in use now, and it will have to be built out of second grade material to be erected at that price.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 24, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, relative to the enlarging of the woodshed at the Buswah Indian Day School and giving an estimate of the cost of building an addition of a size large enough to provide storage facilities for the winter supply of fuel.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of you arranging to have an addition built to the present woodshed. If possible, this work should be carried out before the extreme cold weather sets in. Please arrange for the purchase of the material required and for the labour and endeavour to rush the work to completion. The total cost should not exceed your estimate of $125. The Department will rely on you to see that this addition is satisfactorily erected and at the lowest possible cost.

The kitchen sink\nhas no outlet and is very unsatisfactory. A small\npiece of pipe would solve the difficulty. A\nSanitary Closet for the teacher should be installed.\n\nThe policy of having the teachers in the\nIndian Schools serve hot lunches to the pupils is\nexcellent. I would suggest that the material be sent\nto this school as soon as possible.\nOttawa, November 29, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Buswah Indian Day School, states that the kitchen sink has no outlet and is very unsatisfactory. He states that if a pipe leading from the sink were installed this would solve the difficulty. Please arrange to have a proper outlet installed, in order that the sink can be placed in a serviceable condition.\n\nThe Inspector further recommends that a sanitary closet be supplied for the teacher. Please furnish your recommendation regarding this suggestion. If you recommend the installation of the closet, you should furnish particulars as to the type, cost, etc.\n\nPlease also report as to whether you would recommend the serving of a hot lunch to the pupils at midday, and, if so, state whether the teacher would prepare and serve same and if there are utensils on hand for the purpose.

It is quite difficult to have work of this kind done as there is not a plumber closer than Gore Bay which is a distance of 60 miles from the school.\n\nWith regard to the serving of a hot lunch to the pupils at midday, the teacher is willing to prepare and serve the same providing she is allowed an additional half hour at noon. As the parents of the pupils prepare very good lunches for the children to take with them to school I believe that a cup of hot cocoa for each pupil would be all that is necessary. In order to serve the cocoa only a few cups would be all that is necessary.\n\nWith regard to the installation of a sanitary closet, as there are two good warm toilets in connection with this building quite convenient, I would not recommend erecting a sanitary closet at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 10, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, relative to the recent report of the Separate School Inspector on his visit to the Buswah Indian Day School. It is noted that you will arrange to have the drain pipe from the kitchen sink installed at an early date.\n\nRelative to the serving of a hot lunch to the pupils at midday, the Department agrees with you that it would be sufficient, in view of the fact that the parents prepare good lunches for the pupils to take with them to school, to augment this lunch by serving cocoa or tea. You may, therefore, arrange for the quantity of cocoa, tea and Drimilk powder, if the latter is required, and also for the purchase and delivery of the cups and any other utensils required in preparing and serving same. In the preparation and serving of this drink the teacher should obtain the help of the older girls. Please forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the supplies required for the serving of the hot drink.\n\nYour remarks relative to the installation of a sanitary closet have been noted and no further action need be taken by you in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Please let me know what schools require the above supplies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning,\nOnt.\nManitowaning, October 16th, 1931.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nReferring to Departmental Letter No.19-1-5 of the 10th instant, with reference to the report of Miss Inga, Travelling Nurse, in which she recommends that soap and towels be supplied for the use of the pupils at the day schools in the Manitowaning Agency, I have the honour to report that all the day schools in this agency are supplied with wash basins, benches, soap and towels for the use of the pupils.\n\nSince the receipt of the above letter I have been in touch with Wikwemikong, Kaboni, Buswah, Sheguinandah A.C., Sheguinandah R.C., and Birch Island Schools and found all these schools equipped with the above articles, with the exception of Birch Island school, as there are not any towels in use at present. There is a wash basin and a first class wash stand, but the teacher, Miss Lavallee, does not approve of towels for the pupils in the class room as she claims her policy is to teach the pupils to come from their homes to school in a clean condition, but I would recommend that a supply be furnished to this school as they are a necessity.\n\nIt might be well to furnish the Sheguinandah R.C. School with a few towels as the supply is almost exhausted.\n\nWhen I visit Sucker Creek and Whitefish Lake reserves, making distribution of fall interest which should be in the near future, the two schools will be visited and a report made to the Department as to the above requirements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Agent,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In this connection it is noted that a number of the schools have been already supplied with this equipment.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of a quantity of towelling and toilet soap for the Birch Island and Sheguianadah R. C. Indian Day Schools and have these delivered to the teachers. Accounts, in duplicate, properly certified by you, should be forwarded, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the towelling and soap for each of these schools, separately. Please give the purchase of these supplies your early attention.\n\nIt is noted that you will report later regarding the need of this equipment at Sucker Creek and Whitefish Lake Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nEXTRACT from Report of Mr. Indian Agent R. J. Lewis, for the month of October, 1931, in connection with the BUZWAH INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 19-1-7.\n\nThe attendance has increased to such an extent that the seating capacity is crowded. At present, the number of seats in the classroom will accommodate twenty-three, and there are now twenty-nine on the roll. There are five rows of seats in the classroom so by installing five fronts and one back seat there would be sufficient accommodation for the number of pupils enrolled.\n\nAs a number of the pupils have a long distance to walk in the morning and evening, I believe that it would be advisable to serve hot cocoa with their midday meal in the classroom. The teacher is quite willing to prepare the hot drink if the Department will supply cocoa, milk and sugar.\nOttawa, October 31, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nRelative to that portion of your report on your inspection of the Buswah Indian Day School during the present month, regarding the need of further seating accommodation, I have to say that if you will inform the Department of the sizes and number of each size of front and rear seats required, consideration would be given to placing an order for same. For your information I may say that the desks at present in use in the school were obtained from the Globe Furniture Co., Ltd., Waterloo, Ont., in November, 1922. At that time the following desks were supplied:\n\n- 6 No. 3 Automatic Single Desks,\n- 6 No. 4 \" \"\n- 5 No. 5 \" \"\n- 4 No. 3 \" Single Rears.\"\n\nThe size will, no doubt, be stamped on the metal parts of the desks, and you should ascertain the sizes and inform the Department, as requested above. Please also furnish full shipping directions.\n\nRegarding the providing of hot cocoa to the children with their midday meal, I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase and delivery to the school of the quantity of cocoa, milk and sugar required to serve the pupils with a hot drink at midday during the period from November 15th last, to the middle of April, following. You shall obtain itemized accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred for the purpose. It is noted that the teacher is willing to prepare the hot drink and arrange for the serving of same. Should any utensils be required for the purpose, you may arrange for the purchase of same. Please keep all costs as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nEXTRACT from Report of Separate School Inspector Greening, dated September 30th, 1931, regarding his inspection of the BUZWAH INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 19-1-6.\n\nAs Miss King has twenty-seven on her roll and the school has only twenty-four seats, it would be well to provide her with, say, half a dozen additional desks.\n\nShe would also like an alarm clock.\n\nA thermometer is also desired so that the heat of the classroom may be regulated more satisfactorily.\n\nMiss King tells me that the cistern in the basement which is used to store rain water, freezes in the winter, with the result that water for washing purposes has to be carried to the school from quite a distance. She suggests that this might be overcome by setting up in the basement one of the stoves from the ground floor. I suppose the Indian Agent could say whether the suggestion is practicable.\nOttawa, November 6, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his inspection of the Buzwah Indian Day School in September, last, states that the teacher requires an alarm clock and thermometer. In this connection I have to say that you may purchase and have delivered an alarm clock of the Big Ben type, also an inexpensive thermometer. After these purchases have been made, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nThe Inspector has also drawn attention to the need of extra seating accommodation. In this connection I would refer you to official letter of the 31st ultimo. When your reply is received, the order for the front and rear seats required will be placed here.\n\nThe Inspector also draws attention to the condition of the cistern in the basement, which is used to store rain water. He states that this cistern freezes in the winter, with the result that water for washing purposes has to be carried for quite a distance.

Lewis, Esq., Indian Agent, Manitowaning, Ont. We have entered your order as per copy of our office order attached, which we hope you will find entirely satisfactory.\n\nUpon looking up the previous order of desks we supplied to the Buzwah Indian Day School, we find that we furnished our style No. 1B, and as we still had a small quantity of this style in stock in the sizes you now require, you will note that we have entered your order for style No. 1B. These will therefore match up with the desks now in the School. The wood parts will be finished all cherry color, as previously.\n\nHoping the desks turn out entirely satisfactory on arrival, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE GLOBE FURNITURE COMPANY LIMITED\n\nSales Department.\nSir,\n\nWith regard to a hot lunch being served to the pupils in each school would say that hot cocoa should be served in each classroom during the cold weather. Condensed milk would have to be furnished as milk cannot be secured locally during the winter months. The children take lunches with them for their midday meal, but if any of them have not sufficient food at noon the teacher should serve each child in need with a small ration of food as the cost will not come high and it will be helpful to the pupils. The cost of this project should not exceed $5.00 a month for each classroom, and some months it should not reach this amount. This method was carried out during the last winter past, quite successfully.\n\nIf the Department can see its way clear to allow each classroom an expenditure of $5.00 monthly in cocoa, milk, sugar and a small amount of food, if required, it will be sufficient.\n\nThere are nine classrooms in this agency which will require these supplies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) R.J.

It would be well for the Department to again supply cocoa, sugar and milk, or such ingredients, as has been done in past winters, to enable the teachers to prepare a hot drink to serve with the mid-day lunch to pupils in attendance from a distance from the schools. This, during the past winters, has been healthful to the children and did encourage better attendance.\n\nI would recommend that the Department approve of the following amounts being allowed to the day schools of this agency, from December 1st 1936 to March the 31st 1937, monthly:\n\n| School                  | Amount |\n|-------------------------|--------|\n| Buzwah                  | $4     |\n| Kaboni                  | 4      |\n| Sheguian dah C.E.       | 3      |\n| Sheguian dah R.C.       | 3      |\n| Sucker Creek            | 3      |\n| Whitefish Lake          | 4      |\n| Wikwemikong senior and junior classrooms | 10 |\n\nThe amount of $6 a month was allowed the Wikwemikong school during the last winter past. As there are two classrooms in this school and a large attendance of children the amount of $6 is not sufficient to provide a hot drink to all the pupils so I would recommend that the allowance be increased to $10.00 monthly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Agent,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

A new lock is required on the outside entrance to kitchen, which is situated on north side of building, and should also be fitted with storm door. A combination door would be most satisfactory as it will also serve as a screen door in summer. The kitchen stove is in very poor condition, and is fit only for an Indian camp stove. The fire back is burnt out, which could probably be replaced, but there is also a break through to the oven, which allows ashes to sift through and makes it very difficult to bake.\n\nThe stove quoted on is exactly the same as the one supplied for Birch Island School last year, a Findlay Oval Range with copper reservoir, but no warming closet. These are an excellent stove, and the local hardware dealer has one in stock at the present time. A few pipes and elbows are also required.\n\nAs these items are all very urgently required, I would recommend their purchase locally at an early date. A small additional cost will be required to set up the stove, fit the storm door and lock.\n\nC. R. Johnston,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nOctober 22, 1943.\n\nMr. C.R.

When you are advised that this stove is purchased, you may secure the pipes and elbows required. The Department also approves the purchase, for use at this school, of one alarm clock, one lock for kitchen door and one combination storm door. The cost of these should not exceed the price quoted in your letter.\n\nR.A.

The fire back has been burnt out and there is a break through to the oven which allows ashes to sift through. The Agent states that we supply a stove similar to the one purchased last year for the Birch Island Indian Day School. This was purchased on purchase order No. 15505 of November 24, 1942. The stove was purchased from C.W. Hinds, Manitowaning, Ont., at a cost of $77.50. The Agent states that Mr. Hinds has one of these stoves in stock at the present time.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

Therefore, I would recommend the expenditure of the following amounts monthly, for a period, beginning December 1st 1946 to March 31st 1947:\n\n- Wikwemikong School............. $12.00 - 10.\n- \" additional class room 7.00 - 5.\n- Burwash School.................. 7.00 - 5.\n- Kaboni \".......................... 7.00 - 5.\n- Rabbit Island School............ 7.00 - 5.\n- Sucker Creek .................... 7.00 - 5.\n- Birch Island School.............. 10.00 - 7.\n- Sheshegwaning School............ 7.00 - 5.\n- West Bay Village School........ 10.00 - 8.\n- \" additional class room....... 6.00 - 4.\n\nThe amounts specified above are a little greater than last year, but I am asking this due to increase in prices.\n\nC.

Peltier who holds a Quebec Elementary Certificate. She has had nine years experience in Indian schools and two years in Provincial schools. Her discipline is fairly good and her children tested fairly well. Three entrance pupils went from this school last year to Spanish. The work is presented to them in an interesting manner. The assignments are given in a rather slip shod way. Their knowledge of English is fair. It would probably benefit the Grade Seven pupils if they were sent to Spanish next year.\n\nThis teacher needs to attend Summer School and to improve her teaching methods. In Grade 1 reading there is too much word calling at the present time. When they speed up in their reading, the result is a sing song rhythm with no expression. I advised the teacher that she must place more emphasis on oral English. At the present time, she seems to be depending upon reading to give oral English practice.\n\nBUILDING AND TEACHERAGE -\n\nThis is an older type of school with fair lighting. There are five windows on one side with none on the other. The windows are too high and the room is not too bright. The room is fairly clean and the space is adequate. It is heated from a box stove with a pipe across the room. The building was erected in 1922. The teacher's quarters consist of the usual living room, kitchen and two bedrooms. Mrs. Peltier lives there with her husband who is a general timber contractor. She is attempting to plan to\nattend the University of Ottawa Summer School next year.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS -\n\n(1) This building is badly in need of a new roof. Arrangements should be made to order shingles. I understand that Mr. Peltier will submit a tender to replace the present roof.\n\n(2) A new stove should be provided.\n\n(3) A new fence is required but I think a hedge would suffice.\n\nBFN/HM.\n\nBernard F.

R. Johnston,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency.\n14th April, 1949.\n\nMr. C.R. Johnston,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nManitowaning, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 7th instant suggesting that an amount of $155.00 be expended for general house cleaning at the schools in your Agency. We have reviewed our file, but we have not been able to find where such an expenditure was allowed in previous years.\n\nAs a matter of fact, we allow a reasonable amount for janitor services and make no deduction for holiday periods. It is felt that the cleaning of the building is the duty of the regular janitor.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6121, File 382-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario:\n\nRe: Inspection Report\nManitoulin Island Schools\n\nDuring my recent visit to Manitoulin Island Agency I was able to visit the following schools and make the following notes concerning them.\n\nBUZWAH\nThe building is in fair condition outside, a few general repairs being needed. The classroom requires painting and should be done during the summer. The pump in the residence is broken and should be repaired or replaced and a hot water reservoir is needed for the kitchen stove. The stove is a Findlay Oval 99-18X.\n\nThe class was in session and appeared to be orderly and interested. It being near the end of the school year possibly helped in this respect.\n\nKABONI\nThis School was closed, the teacher having taken the pupils on a picnic. Apparently, they had kept school open June 6th to make up for this. Possibly a good idea but one that should have been sanctioned by the local Superintendent.\n\nA walk consisting of large flat stones had been laid from the gate to the entrance. It was very rough and I would consider it dangerous. It would be preferrable to raise the walk out of the surrounding clay with either crushed stone or cement.\n\nA number of minor repairs and painting is required. This will be covered by Mr. Johnston.\n\nMURRAY HILL\nThis new school is well built and the class was in session during my visit. The room was filled to capacity and everyone seemed to take pride in the new building.\nThere are several odd jobs to be done yet. The installation of the furnace pipes is not complete. Several jobs around the windows, which also have to be painted.\n\nThe temporary building used as a warehouse when building was in progress is something of an eye sore. I would recommend that it be sold to some Indian for removal. There is adequate storage in the school basement.\n\nA well to provide drinking water is needed in this locality.\n\n**WICKWIMEKONG-Jr. Room**\n\nThis building needs a considerable number of minor repairs. Ceilings in the classroom and residence need to be patched. The classroom floor is warped and should be levelled.\n\nScreens are needed for some of the classroom windows. These could be made up if screen moulding and wire were supplied.\n\nThe Delco plant is at the factory being repaired. This could be traced to ensure its return before school opens again.\n\nAn outside door at the entrance to the residence is in very poor shape and should be replaced. The size is 2'6\" x 6'6\" with hardware. Some painting needs to be done and some other small items all of which should be covered by Mr. Johnston.\n\n**WICKWIMEKONG-Sr. Room**\n\nPainting inside is the main requirement here. The teacher complained about not having enough blackboard space. At present there is 18 feet. An extra set of blackboards is available at Murray Hill school. These were duplicated and could be transferred.\n\n**SHEGUINDAH**\n\nThis old school is reported to me as having been closed for about 12 years. The Band desire to take it over and repair it for use as a Council Hall. Mr. Johnston is of the opinion that it was built from Band Funds. You might ascertain if this is so and possibly release it to the Band. There does not appear to be much hope of it being used as a school.\n\n**SUCKER CREEK**\n\nThis building needs to be painted, also required is a new outside door. Mr. Johnston advised me he had authority to get this door. Any other minor repairs should be included in Mr. Johnston's report.\n\n**WEST BAY VILLAGE SCHOOL**\n\nThere are 52 pupils in this two room school. It was closed and one of the teachers had left before I arrived. The ceiling of the Junior room should be painted white. At present it looks nice.\nIt is very dark with no light reflection. Patches of plaster and the floor in the Senior room need attention.\n\nA new pump is on hand and should be installed. The old one is not working at all. One electric light outlet in the store-room is not working.\n\nFor use during the hot weather, I would recommend that a two burner electric grill be supplied. It would be cheaper to use than wood in the cookstove and much more comfortable for the teachers.\n\nLAKEVIEW\n\nWEST BAY - NEW SCHOOL\n\nI could not get inside this building. It is the best looking Day School I have seen anywhere. It could have been raised up a little higher whilst being built as there was a little water around.\n\nBIRCH ISLAND\n\nJudged from the outside, this school appeared to be in pretty good condition. According to Mr. Johnston and Chief McGregor, it was very much overcrowded and another room is required. It would be possible to extend the building by the addition of another room without spoiling the appearance and I would recommend that this be given consideration when the next estimates are being prepared.\n\nThe above report covers only the most important points in connection with the schools. Paint appears to be the greatest need in most cases. It is expected that Mr. Johnston will be forwarding the necessary requisitions etc. to have as much work as possible done during the holidays.\n\nF.

In regard to these applications I have to say for the information of the Department that so far as Miss Louise Gazeir is concerned she is a very young and fitted girl with no experience as a Teacher. So far besides the majority of the Indians interested are against this girl being employed. They say that they have had enough of the Gazeirs in the last two Teachers and that this girl is too young and not suitable for the position and that it is time for a change as this family have had a good fair chance. The two Miss Gazeirs who have held this position in succession were of more mature years and had experience in teaching before. I think they were alright and the only fault that I could find was that each of them took notions to get married during their time and were not so attentive during their last few months at the end of their term. They went too many holidays and were continually sending me word in a second handed way how much sick time they could take during the year and visiting days according to law.\n\nI do not like the way they acted in trying to get this young girl with no experience forced\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6121, File 383-1, part 1)\nforced into the Indians and endeavoring to induce me to commit myself before the Reservation was landed in to me. Thus we received Miss Louise O'Leary's application on the 22nd and I knew informed Miss O'Leary and her Foster that I felt sure the Dept. would not feel like considering the matter until they had the opportunity of the former Teachers. They immediately went and wrote out the Reservation dated it away back.\n\nI am of the same opinion as the Indians that it is not wise to engage Miss Louise O'Leary when we have an application from a well qualified young lady of more mature years and at least one year experience in teaching. I am informed by the Trustees of S.S. No. 7 in Albermarle Co. that Miss Jennie Overlook who is the teacher there during the past year has given the best of satisfaction and that the School has made rapid progress. That they are anxious to retain her services during the next year if she will consent to stay.\n\nI have reason to know that this is true as this school where she is now engaged is near by the Indian Reserve.\n\nMiss Overlook is favorably impressed with the scenery at Cape Croker, she spoke to me some time ago that if the school become vacant here she would like to apply for it but that she did not wish to interfere with the present Teacher until she had resigned.

A little more than half of them are Methodists, and the rest are Catholics.\n\nThere are three schools, and these are public schools, or more correctly, they are in fact Protestant schools, as they are taught by Protestant teachers.\n\nThe Indian Act directs that in each Reserve there must be one teacher of the denomination to which belongs the majority; although the minority may have also their own school if they have a sufficient number of children. Consequently, the Catholics of this place have the right to have a separate school. However, as they wish to give no unnecessary cause of discontent (even unreasonable) to their brethren of the Methodist denomination who live in the vicinity of the school building now in use near the Catholic church, they wish, for the present time, be satisfied that it remains a public school, where no religion shall be taught in the class-room during the regular hours; but they want to have a Catholic teacher recommended by their residing priest, in order that before and after hours, and on Saturdays and Sundays, religious teaching and education may be given to their children.\nAccording to the spirit of their faith.\n\nAnd now, dear sir, not to praise myself, but to encourage you to listen to my request, I beg to call your attention to the fact that same the same Father Oshie who may have been a little troublesome to your Department in the past, but always with the only intention of obtaining for our Indians what proved to be very advantageous to them. It may be remembered that ten years ago I found at Garden River a miserable school with an altogether insufficient teacher and an average of 15 or 16 children, and when I left four years later we had there a nice school building, two teachers, and the average was running between 50 and 55. Later on, having been in charge of the missions of the Manitoulin island, I found the day schools in the worst condition, and after a while, to use the expression of Mr. Inspector White, I found the solution of the Indian schools' problem, in engaging as teachers ladies of a certain society who have brought an extraordinary change for the better in the five reserves where I placed them. Now, I have been sent here to establish a new center of Catholic missions, and wish to do the same good as elsewhere. I dare say that I am sure of the result if you grant me what I ask today for the Catholic Indians of Cape Croker, namely: that the school (of one of those in operation)\nnow taught by a Protestant lady near the Catholic Church, and in the portion of the reserve where Catholics are in majority, should be given to my care. It will remain, as I said already, a public school, but I would have to teach a Catholic lady as those that give so great satisfaction in the Manitoulin island. She will come with an assistant and keep as boarders the few Catholic children that live too far to come as day scholars. The school building is large enough for that; only two or three partitions ought to be made to separate rooms, and the necessary articles of furniture ought to be purchased for the teacher.\n\nThis plan has been exposed to the Chief and some of the principal men of the Catholic congregation, and they all are very desirous to see it accepted and realised as soon as possible.\n\nWhen you answer me favorably, I will take measures to have an excellent teacher ready for after the summer holidays.\n\nI remain, dear sir,\n\nYour servant in the Lord.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You may know what I have done already and the satisfactory result\nof my endeavours. But the principal means of ascertaining for ever\na great advance both intellectual and moral, and also material as a\nconsequence, is not now in my hands; and to obtain it is the purpose of\nthis letter.\n\nThe population of this reserve is unfortunately divided by the difference\nof their religion: a little more than half being Methodists, and the rest\nCatholics. \u2014 According to the Indian Act, besides the Public School for the\nMajority, there ought to be a separate one for the Minority. \u2014 I wish\nsome of the chief men of this minority have thought that as long as the\nCatholic children are living scattered as they are on the three portions of\nthe reserve, and the conditions remain what they are, it would be\nhardly worth while asking for it and raising perhaps some discontent\namong opponents.\n\nNow, dear Sir, I remember what you told me once when speaking\nof the three schools of this reserve and of the $900.00 dollars spent for the\nteaching of only a relatively scarce number of children .... saying nothing of\nthe amount spent for separation of each school and for beating the Bible\nHorse. \u2014 Your opinion seems to be that there ought to be only one school in\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6121, File 383-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nthe center of the reserve, where children from afar could be brought by wagons or sleighs. This plan is surely very good in many respects, and it is evident that it would be very economical, as for its execution, the band would have to pay only $300.00 for one teacher and say $150 into two teamsters $75.00 each. Besides, if heating costs 20.00 dollars a year for one school, and the average cost of operation 20.00 dollars also, the economy would be $30.00, dollars a year. \u2014 But this plan cannot be accepted by the Catholics except if the teacher is appointed upon recommendation of the priest; although we would agree to have this school operated according to the rules of Public Schools, no religion being taught during hours of class, ---- and with that condition the Methodist may not be satisfied.\n\nAnother plan would be to have two schools, one Public and one Separate with the two teamsters as in the first plan. Then the economy would be only of $90.00, which is yet great in itself. \u2014 The separate school would be the one near the Catholic Church and the other one ought to be (I do not suggest) in the lower story of the Town-Hall, as the two have to be near one to the other in order that the teamsters may in one trip take the children for both schools.\n\nPlease, dear Sir, consider seriously the two plans and compare them to you, and as soon as you can let me know what you think, and whether\nYou are ready to recommend one of them to the Government. After you answer me, I will write to Ottawa asking you to forward my letter with your recommendation.\n\nI have preferred writing rather than talking about it, as it is so much clearer. But if you wish, we may also meet and talk it over whenever you like.\n\nRemain dear Sir,\n\nYour servant in the Lord.\n\nG. R. Arthur\nSir,\n\nI enclose two communications from the Rev. Father Acton, the Catholic Missionary at this place. The first dates 26th Jan., and the latter 29th between letters I had a conversation with the Rev. Buttenweiser. He has gone into the matter pretty fully and I submit all his communications to the Dept. and I beg to inform the Department that this matter has not been submitted to the Division Council as I only received by messenger his letter dated 29th last evening after the Council had adjourned, and when I was conversing with the Priest a few days ago. He thought it better to submit the matter to the Department first and submit the Department's decision after words to the Indians.\n\nNow even before this question came up by the Roman Catholic Missionaries there was a feeling of unrest among all the Indians about their schools. Their three settlements being so much scattered, it is a difficult matter to get any attendance at any of the schools especially in bad weather.\n\nNow\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have made inquiries from the teachers and find the most at Cape Croker School, about five in number, only about three at Port Elgin and about three at Sydney Bay School, a good many of the Catholic children being away at the institutions as well as some Protestants at Protestant schools. Now I scarcely know what to recommend, it is very evident that there will be trouble and difference of opinion about these schools no matter what is done.\n\nI do not wish to be prejudice against any party or religious denomination. I would like to see justice done but how to accomplish so the point in question, I simply submit the question and matter to the Department and hope that in account of their experience in such matters it can send us advice.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Artus, Roman Catholic missionary at that place with reference to the existing schools on the reserve, claiming that as there are a number of Roman Catholic children they are entitled to a school of their own faith. He says, however, in order not to cause unnecessary discontent to their Methodist brethren, they would be satisfied with an undenominational school where no religion would be taught in the class-room during school hours, upon condition that the teacher of the school be a Roman Catholic who should have the privilege of giving religious instruction before and after hours and on Saturdays and Sundays to the Roman Catholic children attending the school.\n\nThere are three day schools on this reserve, Cape Croker, Sidney Bay and Port Elgin, which are, or should all be undenominational. The whole expense of these schools is borne by the Band, who have passed rules and regulations for their management under Section 76 of the Indian Act, which were confirmed by His Excellency, the Governor General in Council on the 11th April, 1891. See file 114636.\n\nThe Cape Croker Band numbers 369, of whom 124 are Roman Catholics, 230 Methodists and 15 Anglicans. The children of school age number 59, about\n20 of whom would be Roman Catholics.\n\nI find that 11 boys and 2 girls from this reserve are at the Roman Catholic Industrial school at Wikwemikong, which would leave a small number of children of that faith on the reserve.\n\nUp to the present time the Roman Catholics on the reserve have made no complaint and I do not see that there is any necessity for establishing a purely Roman Catholic school there. They have a resident missionary who would be free to give religious instruction to children of his faith, but as the Roman Catholic Church adjoins the Cape Croker school, as you will see from the accompanying photograph, I do not why it should not be used for religious exercises and training of the children. The fact that the present teacher is a Methodist is purely accidental, as when she was appointed no mention was made or question asked in regard to her religious belief. I think that if the Agent is instructed to give orders that no religious teaching shall be given during school hours, Father Artus would have no ground of complaint, especially as he is not opposed to an undenominational school.\n\nIn any event the request for a separate Roman Catholic school would have to come from the Indians as they would have to bear the expense.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I had written to obtain of your Department that one of the three schools of this reserve should be taught by Catholic teachers. Answering, you seem to have misunderstood me, as you say that it appears to you the best to keep the three schools undenominational. Although I believe that the Catholics being a fair minority are entitled by the Indian Act to have a separate school of their own, I think that in the present condition of the Reserve, it may be sufficient for them that the school built near their church should be taught by certain Catholic teachers, although remaining in the same time an undenominational school.\n\nIt will be an undenominational school taught by Catholic teachers, as well as the two other ones although taught by Protestants. No religious teaching shall be given during class hours, but before and after and on Saturdays and Sundays, if the teachers are the proper ones, and those lack for the privilege of appointing myself (as used to be doing at Garden River and Witowemikong), the sufficient teaching will be given to satisfy Catholic parents.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It cannot be fairly objected that the Protestants have a great repugnance to see one denominational school taught by Catholics, as the Catholics must have much more repugnance yet to see the three schools, although undenominational taught by Protestants. Twins is to be kept for all minority as well as majority.\n\nThat the Indians of this reserve neglected the organization of their schools years ago, ought not to be an objection. How often does it not happen that regulations and even laws had to be improved? Now, here the Catholic parents have seen the sad result of these regulations and wish to see them ameliorated. And besides what they want and what I ask in their name is no infraction of the regulations existing. The schools will remain undenominational as they are, but in one of them the teacher will be Catholic; and, in order to be sure that this teacher will be able and willing to render services after hours of class as required and overpaid, this teacher ought to be selected and presented by the priest for appointment.\nHonourable Sir,\n\nRegarding the subject I raised in my first letter, you are aware of what extraordinary improvement among the children has been brought in the five Indian reserves of the Manitoulin island under a period of certain classes of teachers. \"It is the salvation of the Indians' schools,\" as Mr. Inspector O'Brien told me after a year of experience.\n\nHe is a teacher of the same kind, and one of the very best that I have ever seen for this reserve.

He tells me that the cost would not be more for the two than what the present teacher gets as it they do it as a work of love, but I am aware the present lot of the Priest is a very small one and they would need to be a lot of changes and additions built before he could accomplish what he talks about, this would incur a good deal of outlay and he has not said from what source he would expect this to come.

Father Artus, Roman Catholic missionary on the Cape Croker reserve, for a school for the Indians of his church Father Artus has been urging his point with the Department and the Indians. His first proposition was that one of the schools on the reserve (the one at Cape Croker preferably) should be placed in charge of a Roman Catholic teacher to be conducted as an undenominational school. His second recommendation is that he be allowed to appoint two Sisters to take charge of this school and he attended a meeting of the council lately held by the Cape Croker Band and addressed the Indians in favor of his latter suggestion.\n\nMr Agent McIver forwards a Resolution of the Council postponing the consideration of the question until the next meeting.\n\nAs I pointed out in my previous memorandum the Cape Croker Band pays for the maintenance of their schools and have passed regulations under the Act for their management. The schools are all undenominational and the Department has lately given orders that no religious instruction shall be imparted during...\nschool hours at any of the schools attended by Roman Catholic children.\n\nI can see no objection to the employment of a Roman Catholic teacher at one of the Cape Croker schools if possessed of the necessary qualifications and the fact that one is not so employed is simply because none have ever applied.\n\nThe Regulations above referred to passed by the Band do not provide for the appointment of teachers of any denomination, and unless the Band in Council passes a Resolution favoring the establishment of a denominational school, the Department would not be called upon to interfere.\n\nWith regard to Father Artus' second recommendation as to the employment of two Sisters to take charge of the school, I do not think that this should be entertained as Father Artus wishes to have them on the reserve for the purpose of starting a boarding school. These Sisters, though a teaching order, are not possessed of the necessary Provincial certificates. They do very well for outlying reserves where it is difficult to get qualified teachers, but in case it is decided to employ a Roman Catholic teacher, either of the Separate School Inspectors would be in a position to recommend a suitable person for the position.\n\nI would call your attention to the concluding paragraph of Agent McIver's letter of the 1st instant in which states that Father Artus seems to think that he as Agent, and all the Indians belonging to his Church should just obey his commands and that he is very severe on some of his own people.\n\nIndian Affairs.

They have their missionary as well as the Methodists resident on the reserve and if religious teaching is given during the week, it might well be given in the Church, or at the school after school hours on certain days set apart for the purpose by each denomination.\n\nIt costs the Cape Croker Indians over $1000.00 a year for education and I do not think they would be disposed to entrench further upon their funds for the support of an additional school.\n\n[Signature]\n\n10.6.03\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, June 15th, 1903\n\nTo Mr. Benson\u2014\n\nThe Agent should be advised that the Department prefers a regularly qualified teacher\u2014and is not willing to form the appointment of ladies as suggested\u2014further action awaits the result of next meeting.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6121, File 383-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nA while ago I asked your Lordship to try and obtain from the Secretary General of the Indian Department that a certain resolution passed here in council as well by Protestants as by Catholics for paying to their priest a certain sum to be retained by the Agent or by the Secretary himself out of their quarterly payments... Should be approved... This has a real importance to secure means for the support of the mission.\n\nBut now I have to ask your assistance in a much more important question.\n\nThere are in this reserve three public schools taught by these Protestant teachers. The Catholics are a nice minority being about the 25% of the land, and in accordance with the Indian Act C.48, 30-31 we have a right to claim a school of our own. However, because the families are too scattered and Catholics and Protestants are all mixed, there would be little advantage to get a Cath. Dep. School, and it could not be obtained without creating great trouble in the reserve. But I have thought that we ought to have at least a Catholic teacher in one of the schools (this school remaining a public one). The religion would be taught during class, but before and after, and besides the few Cath. children that live too far away would be taken as boarders by the teacher and her companions. The school building can be accommodated, and I know already teaching sisters who will come for the...\nwork as I understand it as soon as I see them. They are of the same\nSociety as ten others whom I established the last year in five\ndifferent missions of the Diocese of Peterborough. Everywhere they\nhave given more yet satisfaction to all than was expected. Agents\nand inspectors are unanimous in praising them; and one of\nthe inspectors after visiting the missions told me that by\nappointing these ladies I had \"solved the problem of the\nIndian schools question.\" They are the ladies of the immediate\nheart of Mary.\n\nThe two words which lack is:\n\n1) that one of the schools (the three remaining public schools) should\nbe taught by a Catholic teacher;\n2) that the appointment of this teacher should be given to me\n(as it was at Wikwemikong) in order that I may call capable\nsubjects ready to undertake the work and to keep boarders as\nmany as the parents may desire.\n\nI have written to Ottawa myself, and got\nthe answer that they would considerate my request; but I\nam sure that Your Lordship insisting also will be of great\nhelp. Besides the favor has to be granted soon in\n\nIndian Affairs.

They are the men over 20 years of age, the widows, and a few married women in the names of their husbands who are now absent. About 7 or 8 are absent who would undoubtedly have added their names.\n\nWhat we ask in this: First, that one of the three schools of this reserve, remaining a public school (in order that Protestant children living in the vicinity of this school could attend), should however be taught by a Catholic teacher (so that our children may receive at further times religious teaching). And secondly, that the priest in charge at the Cape, should have the privilege to select the teacher in the same manner as the superior of Wikwemikong for the Manitoulin island and the North Shore.\n\nThe government may be informed that if this privilege is granted, my intention is to have here the same kind of teacher that I appointed while in charge at Wikwemikong in 5 different schools, where all inspectors, agents and parents, are unanimous to praise them for the great amelioration that they brought in by their application and affection for the children.\n\nTo be ready for the end of August, a prompt decision is\n\nIndian Affairs.

He is not opposed to our plan, but I think\nhe would not openly give his recommendation to it, for fear\nof displeasing the Methodist minority. He has already written\nseveral times to Ottawa on the Subject and they know his opinion.\n\nNow, if we can obtain the object of this petition, if I can\nhave here the ladies that are now nearly in all our missions of the\nDiocese of Peterborough, there is a great hope that the Catholics will\nincrease by and by in influence and also in number. But any\nother teachers could not do consequently if the second point is not\nobtained, the first is none.\n\nV. Remain. Waited,\n\nThe humble servant of your Lordship,\n\nP. A. Carter\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 21st July, 1903\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith reference to the two letters hereunder from Father Artus, Roman Catholic missionary at Cape Croker, apparently addressed to Rt. Rev. Thomas J. Dowling, B.C., Bishop of Hamilton, and the petition from the Roman Catholic portion of the Nawash Band asking that one of the three teachers employed on the Cape Croker reserve be of that persuasion and that Rev. Father Artus have the selection of such teacher, I beg to say that this matter has been before the Department since February last and has received the consideration of the Cape Croker Band in Council, who asked that the discussion of this question be postponed until the next Council meeting. The Department, in replying to Mr. Agent McIver's letter enclosing this resolution, informed him that it would await the result of the deliberations of the Band, but that it was not inclined to favor the appointment of Sisters as suggested, as it preferred to have regularly qualified teachers. This was on the 17th June last and since that date no further communication on this subject has been received from our Agent.\n\nIn my previous memoranda of the 10th Feb. and 10th June last, I pointed out that any change in the personnel of the school would have to be\ninitiated by the Band in Council, as they pay for the maintenance of their schools and have passed regulations under the Act for their management.\n\nThe schools are all non-denominational and the Department has lately given orders that no religious instruction shall be imparted during school hours at any of the schools attended by Roman Catholic children.\n\nI see can see no objection to the employment of a Roman Catholic teacher at one of the Cape Croker schools if possessed of the necessary qualifications and the fact that one is not so employed is due to the fact that none have ever applied.\n\nFather Artus over-estimates the percentage of Roman Catholics in the Band when he places them at two-fifths; they number about one-third and could not have 27 children of school age, as claimed by him, especially as there are about 13 Roman Catholic children attending the Industrial school at Wikwemikong.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Indians are scattered over the Reserve like the others, and it would be impossible for all their children to attend one school as day pupils, but to overcome this difficulty Father Artus states that the Sisters placed in charge of one of the schools would take the children who live too far away as boarders, thus inserting the thin edge of the wedge for the establishment of a boarding school which is not needed on the reserve.\n\nNotwithstanding Father Artus' desire for a speedy decision, the matter should remain in abeyance until the decision of the Cape Croker Council.\nis reached, and even if it is in accordance with Father Artus' wishes it is doubtful whether the Department would be justified in acceding to all his demands. The appointment of a Roman Catholic teacher, as I have before stated, might be conceded if asked for, but he should not have the appointment. Even on Manitoulin Island, to which he refers, the Roman Catholic missionary has only the nomination of teachers.\n\nIn my previous memoranda I pointed out that the spiritual welfare of the Indians of this Band can be well looked after by the missionaries who are resident on the reserve and have churches conveniently situated.\n\nMartin Benson\nOTTAWA, 22nd July, 1903\n\nSir,\n\nIn connection with previous correspondence relative to the application made by Rev. Father Artus for the appointment of a Roman Catholic teacher for one of the Cape Croker schools, I have to request that you will report what further action the Cape Croker Band in Council have taken on this application.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nJohn McIver, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nCape Croker,\nOnt.:-\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Indians Council and Band in Council at the last Council meeting discussed this matter for nearly half an hour very hotly with a good deal of feeling for and against our Lord Jesus. The Protestant portion who are pretty largely in majority do not want an arrangement of this kind and are bitterly opposed to it; there was no vote taken or recorded in the minutes. The Secretary and Interpreter seeing that these were in a strong vote of the Protestant element again it evaded this. It has been kept secret by the Catholics from the Protestants and myself.\n\nJuly 28, 1943\n\nIndian Affairs.

Working in the lumber woods etc. for $30 and $50 per month. They have no patience to wait for a crop to grow, then the seasons of camp meetings lasts nearly a month which causes many of them to neglect their harvesting.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have been looking for him for the past two weeks, and will do so requested in the matter of getting him to connect with the Separate School Inspector as to securing the services of a duly qualified teacher to take charge of the school after that date, but it is not a separate school that the Rev Father Arturo and the Roman Catholic Indians want. I saw the file no and date of this letter to the Rev Gentleman yesterday morning when on his way to Paqpuan Reserve. So that he comes write from himself as to what the Catholic portion of the Band requires.\n\nI am willing to work with him and the Catholic portion of the Band so far as may be right in the interests of education for the children of the section without prejudice to any minority. I understand that the teacher who has been written to is of English speaking origin, has had past experiences in teaching and past qualifications, but they are very limited.\nSir,\n\nShe having taught in that Country, hence she has not had a chance to take out certificates in Ontario. What the Rev. Father Artus wants is to have the full charge of recommending the teacher. I along with the inspectors may have for a short time to rely upon his judgment until there was time to see results. He informs me that schools of the same kind of the same class of teachers of which the Department is aware have been doing the best kind of work for the past three or four years in certain portions of Northern Ontario. He tells me that Mr. White an Inspector of Schools of the North of here was in the first start opposed but after seeing the great improvement in the education of the children their comfort and happiness, he was well pleased at the work done and Father Artus says he can get recommendations from him and get him to write the school inspectors here so that the common good of the charge made at those other places. With regard to the repairs of the school house needs to provide accommodation for the teachers to live therein, if I do not hear further I will proceed with these suggested changes.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6121, File 383-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI am endeavoring to keep the costs at the $44.65 Estimates, or as close as possible.\n\nThe Rev. Father Arnaud says that before he would have any further arguments with the Protestant portion of the Band who are somewhat prejudiced against anything Catholic they will endeavor to procure these articles of furniture themselves.\n\nHe declares that any reasonable minded man when he sees the good change should be agreeable here as they were at other places where the experiment was tried. It might as well however for the Department and the several fees & let him know that the Inspector and Agent of the Department wants be expected to have some control if necessary and if he cannot show some thing superior to the fact it would not be necessary to continue in his way of wishing to run the school. I know that there is quite a strong feeling here among the Protestant Indians fires up by a few white people who have nothing else to take about and it should not be any of their business as it costs them nothing.\n\nIt is mostly prejudice as I believe the intentions of the Catholics is good.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian agent\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6121, File 383-1, part 1)\nThe Secretary General of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Agent Mr. Iver of Cape Croker communicated to me this morning your letter No. 152521 of the 7th inst., in reference to the Catholic teacher to be appointed for the school No. 1 of this reserve. He, not less than I, is surprised to see the manner how the matter is understood, viz.: altogether differently from what was intended and asked for.\n\nI had the honour to write to you myself some time last spring. Later on I presented again the request of the Catholics to Mr. Mr. Iver, who, as I think, sent it to you. Then in the town-hall of the band, in presence of the Agent, and the Indians being assembled in council, I expressed in English and in French what we were wishing for. Besides this lordship, the Bishop of Hamilton has sent one of his priests to Ottawa, to recommend this affair to the Department. In each of these many occasions, what was asked is:\n\n1) That the teacher in one (No. 1) of the three schools of this reserve should be always a Catholic One .... and ...\n\n2) As I understand that some Protestant children having to come to that school, no Religion should be taught at-class hours, we insisted upon obtaining also that the said teacher should be...\ndetected by the missionary among the members of that association of teaching ladies that I have already placed in the catholic schools of the Manitoulin island. Any other teacher, said I, even a catholic one, could not give satisfaction as we could not expect him to teach before and after class, and on Saturdays and Sundays, without an extra salary. I added also that my intention is that the teacher being assisted by one or two friends, should take care to be among the children living far away, ...with no expenses to the band or to the Department. Now it is evident that an ordinary teacher could not do it.\n\nAll this has been proposed to your Department by myself and by the Bishop's Delegate. I said it clearly to the Indians in council, and they gave a vote favorable to it. I consequently hope that we will be allowed taking charge of that school, on the aforesaid conditions and under the responsibility of the Missionary.\n\nI am not unknown to the Department of Indian Affairs. I may have given occasion to some trouble to its officers, but I believe they must recognize that I always had in view the best interests of the Indians and that so far I have been successful. \u2014 Coming to Garden River ten years ago I found a miserable school with\nan average of nearly 20 irregular pupils; and after 4 years I left in the place a large school with two teachers and an average between 45 and 50. Then I have been in charge four years of the missions in the Manitoulin island. No? While, now principal of the normal school, was then inspector and he used to complain with me of the unfitness of all the day schools. Then, after much difficulty I introduced the ladies of the society already mentioned, and the same Mr. Inspector. While I am often visiting again, \"Father, you have found the solution of the Indian schools' problem. Place these excellent teachers everywhere.\" So I did, and the change for the better is incredible not only in the schools, but even in the families of the pupils. \u2014 How I have been appointed in a new field, with residence at Cape Croker, with the expectation that my efforts must be blessed here as elsewhere.\n\nAt the Cape Indians have money enough to pay qualified teachers, and they have them (3 of them) since many years. And however (they say it themselves) they know nothing, they have very little education, the school is a failure, as it was formerly in the Manitoulin. \u2014 Let me have the teacher I want with her assistant so that will cost nothing to the band, and in a little while you will be surprised of the improvement. I have secured for the Cape a first class teacher.\nwith years of experience and the best of recommendations which is better than certificates. She will be ready to start teaching on the 1st of January.\n\nOne more day, apologizing for this long letter; this is what has been asked of the Indians in council and accepted by them.\n\nPlease dear Sir, for the sake of the true civilization of the Indians, answer favorable as soon as possible.\n\nRemain dear Sir,\n\nYour servant in the Lord,\n\nJ. A. Curtis\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6121, File 383-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOTTAWA, 23rd October, 1903\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General\n\nWith reference to the contemplated placing of No.1 school on the Cape Croker reserve in charge of a Roman Catholic teacher after 1st January next, I beg to say that a communication has been received from Rev. Father Artus, Roman Catholic missionary on this reserve in which he presses his claim for the nomination and appointment of a teacher. A letter has also been received from Mr Agent McIver practically approving of Father Artus' proposals.\n\nThe proposition of Father Artus is, that he be allowed to place a nun belonging to an American teaching order in charge of this school, who will have a companion to take up residence with her on the reserve, and take eight or ten Indians children as boarders. This is practically the establishment of a boarding school on the reserve in charge of the Sisters. Father Artus claims that the Department will not be called upon to pay anything for the maintenance of the Sisters or the children taken in beyond the payment of the teacher's salary. This arrangement might last for a short time, but we know that it would not be long before the Department would be called upon to recognize it as a boarding school.\n\nThe original claim of Father Artus was\nthat as there were a number of Roman Catholic Indians on the Cape Croker reserve, they were entitled to have a teacher of their faith in one of the three schools. The Department agreed that if the Indians were desirous of having such a teacher it would meet their wishes by appointing a Roman Catholic teacher with the Ontario provincial qualifications on the understanding that no religious instruction be given during school hours, as Protestants and well as Catholics would have to attend the school. Father Artus is not satisfied with this arrangement and calls attention to the good work done by some of the Sisters on the North Shore and Manitoulin Island. The conditions are entirely different on the Cape Croker reserve.\n\nIn the section referred to by Father Artus, all the Indians are Roman Catholics, and it was next to impossible to get a white teacher to take charge of the schools there. The Indians in Cape Croker are more advanced and white teachers can readily be found who are willing to live amongst them. The Roman Catholics at Cape Croker are in the minority.\n\nI think that, instead of trying the experiment proposed by Father Artus and letting it have a fair trial, as suggested by the Agent, it would be well to let the arrangement made by the Department be tried first, although I feel sure under the existing circumstances, that it would never satisfy Father Artus, who will never rest content until he attains his end. It is for the Department to decide whether it will give away to Father Artus now or advise the Agent to carry out its previous instructions regarding the appointment of a teacher.\nEven with a Roman Catholic lay teacher the school may be considered undenominational, but it would be difficult to imagine a school taught by a nun as meeting this requirement. There is no doubt about the success of the Sisters in their work but their efforts should be confined to Bands who are all Roman Catholics.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Artus, S.J.\nCape Croker,\nOnt.\nDear Mr. Mr. [illegible],\n\nIn further reference to the school question, I beg to inform you that Mr. White, principal of the Normal School, Ottawa, answered my letter. He went to see the authorities of the Indian Department, and found that they are not ready to approve of the appointment of the ladies I have in view for fear that the Methodists would be too much displeased. Besides they object to my intention of taking a few boarders, because they think that likely I would afterwards ask for assistance from the Department.\n\nKindly let the Secretary General know that I am aware of the staunch Methodism of some at the Cape, and that this is one of the chief motives why it is necessary to have more than a common teacher at the very beginning. I never attempt giving any trouble to any body even for his own good, neither undertake any serious affair without a moral certificate of the success. Now, with the ladies in question, and more yet with the one expected to come, I am as sure as it is possible that all reasonable persons will be satisfied after a few months of experience;... while with a pay teacher especially not dependent on me because appointed by some body else, I have so little hope of doing any better than the present teachers, that I do not wish to try it. I believe it would do us more harm than good (as long as Peace is here above is not to be a separate School.) Besides it is good to repeat here\nHere what we already said in other letters viz., that the Methodist Indians know that the teachers required by the Catholics are the said ladies, and that they knew it when the favorable vote was passed in Council. Consequently the time is opportune to grant the request.\n\nAs for the ladies I wish to take, you may assure the Department that I never thought of asking from the band or from the Government any assistance; it will be altogether a private affair under my own responsibility, to accommodate some parents who live too far and want to give their children the benefit of the education as given by our ladies.\n\nNow, if after a serious trial the ladies do not give the satisfaction expected, it will be equally easy to change them as to change any other teacher.\n\nThe Department may be sure that I went to do not only well, but very well, the more so because the Methodists also have to be contented with the result.\n\nPlease send to Ottawa this my answer to the questions, and if you like this very letter.\n\nYour servant in the Lord\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He tells me that if he does not get the kind of teachers he wants, that the ordinary Catholic teacher duly qualified will be no better to him or his pupils than the present well qualified teacher.\n\nAnd if he cannot have the kind he wants, better have no change at present. However, his letter states the case.\n\nI beg to say that as requested in previous correspondence I interviewed the Public School Inspector & rendering and he thought it only right for the Catholic minority to be treated fairly, and he would write Mr. White as he was refused to, on the separate school Inspector, with a view to getting a qualified Catholic teacher, he thought one suitable might be hard to get.\n\nHe thought it well for Inspector and agent to have some control.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary Department of Indian Affairs\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Ives\n\nCapt. Croker\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen in the name of our Catholic Indians I have asked that the teacher of school No. 21 should be a Catholic selected from among a certain society of teaching ladies, I have told you that in the case of a favorable answer I would look after the separation of the building, have proper accommodation made for the lodging of the ladies, and pay for it all myself. If this has to be done, I ought to find already a contractor to have the work surely finished by the first of August. But if I wait any longer to make arrangements, likely all the contractors shall have their time engaged, and we shall not yet be ready for the beginning of the next school-year.\n\nNow, as I told you, I do not intend to spend any money for nothing; and knowing by the experience of many years and many places, the kind of instruction and education given to Indian children by common (although so-called qualified teachers) Catholics as well as others, I will not contribute anything to the school, but on the condition that the right be given me to select the teachers from among the overseas society of teaching ladies, whether they are British subject or not, and whether they have or not the Canadian certificates. I ask for nothing else than the extension to me of the right conceded by the Government to the Superior of Wikwemikong (Moonibin Island) for the Indian schools of the island and of the North Shore of Lake Huron. They may remember at Ottawa that for five years I have myself made use of that privilege, and they know also what extraordinary change for the better has been and is yet brought by these ladies whom I have placed in five different missions besides Wikwemikong.\n\nNow, although the officers of the Department seem not to understand me, that I am not the appointment of a Catholic teacher in\ngeneral) has been always what I have asked from the beginning by myself, by His Lordship the Bishop of Hamilton, and by yourself, dear Sir. It is what I represented to Mr. Campbell, the eldest candidate of Hopewell, and what this gentleman after consideration of the case, told me I could not but obtain from a government really wishing the good of the people. In long letters sent to Ottawa by you, dear Sir, or by Mr. Campbell or by myself, I have exposed the case as clearly as possible, answering to all objections. You, yourself, dear Sir, who are the best man in a position to judge of the opportunity of my request, and the said Mr. Campbell, told me that satisfaction ought surely to be given to me. I hope it will be so. Now, if after a reasonable time of trial, the teachers chosen by me do not do the good prospect of them, if the Inspector finds fault with their teaching, I invite give up and surrender to the Department any claims I could have on the considerable improvements I have made to the buildings.\n\n1) If the Government grants me the favor of selecting the teacher on my own responsibility, you may tell them that I select Miss Mary Stafford whom I know to be an excellent teacher; and then invite at once the steps to have the school rebuilt in good shape for the summer.\n\n2) If they insist upon the teacher to be British subject and to have Canadian recommendation, the same Miss Mary Stafford, because she will be a citizen before next summer by naturalization, and she will have passed examinations that one may be allowed passing in one year, and therefore invite for any higher examination the Government should not consider any for the necessary.\n\n3) The condition of that school will be such that it should be obliged by others to\nI may have no other British subject to recommend, outside of whom\u2014except others who are not British subjects and would be equally fit and favored.\n\nPlease, dear Sir, ask the Deputy Superintendent General to consider the matter once more, referring him to my precedent letters and those he may have received from Mr. Campbell, and to answer clearly whether he will agree to the first or to the second of the above propositions.\n\nYours, dear Sir,\n\nYour servant in the Lord.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6121, File 383-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMr Agent McIver forwards a letter from Rev. Father Artus in further reference to the proposed placing of Cape Croker No.1 school under a Roman Catholic teacher.\n\nSome months ago Father Artus recommended the appointment of a Miss Moffatt, who is a member of a teaching order of Sisters in the United States. He was told that if she possessed the required qualifications and was a British Subject, the Department would approve of her temporary appointment. As she could not fill the Department's requirements, the services of the present teacher were retained until the close of the current fiscal year.\n\nFather Artus wishes to be in a position to take over the school after the summer holidays and is willing to expend money in making repairs to the building, provided that he be given the right to \"select the teacher from among the over-said Society of teaching ladies, whether they are British subjects or not, or whether they have or not Canadian certificates\". He asks the right to select a teacher upon his own responsibility and he says that if the Department insists upon the Roman Catholic teacher being a British subject with a Canadian certificate, he will recommend Miss Moffatt, who is prepared to become a Canadian citizen and obtain the required certificate.\nIf, however, he is not given a free choice and any restrictions are placed on him, he will not contribute anything towards the necessary repairs to the building.\n\nAs the building is the property of the Band I do not see that Father Artus is called upon to spend any of his money upon it, as they can well afford to make any necessary repairs.\n\nHe claims that he had a free hand when he was at Wikwemikong in selecting teachers, and perhaps he had, but the question of nationality had never arisen in that connection, nor were the other conditions similar. The Indians of Cape Croker are more advanced in civilization and there is a better prospect of obtaining qualified white teachers there than there was on Manitoulin Island and the North Shore.\n\nThe whole question amounts to this\u2014that Father Artus wishes to control the situation and Agent McIver says that the Roman Catholic Indians and Father Artus will not rest until the proposed scheme is tried. I see no reason from receding from the stand already taken by the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Artus in further reference to the placing of the No.1 school, Cape Croker, in charge of a Roman Catholic teacher after the summer holidays; and in reply I beg to say that, as you have already been informed, the Department is prepared to accept the nominee of Rev. Father Artus, provided such person meets its requirements, but it cannot waive its right to make the appointment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nJohn McIver, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMcIver, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Agent Mr. Ever informed me that the Department is prepared to accept as teacher of school No. 1 my nominee, provided this person meets its requirements. But that it cannot waive its right to make the appointment.\n\nThen I have to inform you that Miss Mary Moffitt will be a British subject by naturalization and that besides she must have passed the Parts I and II junior leaving. Mr. Inspector W.J. Sanderson writes to me that to get a first class certificate, a candidate must besides attend a review at any county model school. But he adds, it is the Indian Department which decides what certificate a person must hold in order to teach in an Indian School, and judging by the past, if Miss Moffitt passed the Junior Leaving examination, she should be permitted to teach at Cape Croker.\n\nNow Miss Moffitt is a lady that has been teaching in the United States for years with a very great success, and if she was allowed passing at once the highest examination so as to get at once a first-class Canadian certificate, she would do so. By the Department of Instruction she has been notified that she ought to write for the Junior Leaving. Now she will do so at the next examination in July. Consequently there is very little doubt that she will be a fit subject to be appointed for after the summer holidays. However, examinations are always more or less hazardous, and it happens that the best candidates sometimes fail. So that should happen to Miss Moffitt, I ask you allow her to start teaching however after the holidays, and she will write again at the next examination. If you grant me this...\nI will be sure to have here a very good teacher and attend to the repairing of the school house.\n\nIn asking for the privilege of having the teacher appointed upon my recommendation with no obligation of showing any Canadian certificate, I ask only what has been granted years ago to the Superior of Winnebago for the 9 or 10 schools of the Hamilton island and of the North Shore. Experience had proved that ordinary teachers would not remain in the mission, or despising the Indians, would do no good to their children, and it was expected that the priests could more easily than any body else find competent and devoted teachers. In fact it is so difficult to find such persons that for several years even the priests could not but very seldom meet with any. Only five years ago, while I was in charge, I found a society of teaching ladies that accepted very generously to come to our missions. They did so, and there is only one opinion of all about them. They succeed better than was ever expected. Now of these ladies some are British subjects; some are not; some have Canadian certificates; some have none, and in selecting the ones who should come and teach our schools I would like to be able to pick up always the very best in all respects, those who could teach the children both music and different kinds of housework, knitting, sewing etc., even if they happen to have no Canadian Certificate. The appointment must of course be made by the Department, but the exclusive guarantee of my recommendation and of the primary inspections of Agents and Inspectors.\n\nI remain Your Son\n\nYour servant in the Lord,\n\nG.

At the time I thought there might have been some...\nI have met the other teachers July last, with the enclosed results not satisfactory. I have impressed with the idea that I ought much more to make a mistake in stating that no qualifications would be accepted in place of the examinations, so I resolved to communicate directly with you.\n\nAs you are aware I have had 22 years experience as teacher, I hold a diploma from the Normal Department of the Army's Academy, Royalty.

Mr Nelson's concluding remarks in his letter to Dr Sutherland regarding Indian matters on Cape Croker reserve, and especially relating to schools there, I beg to say Mr Nelson is not quite seized of the facts regarding the appointment of a Roman Catholic teacher at Cape Croker. Now Father Artus, who was missionary there, claimed that as there were 131 Roman Catholics in that Band, out of a total population of 386; 240 of whom are Methodists and the remaining 15 Anglicans, the Roman Catholics were entitled to have a teacher of their own faith in one of the three schools on the reserve.\n\nAfter considerable correspondence, the Department decided that his contention was just and agreed to the appointment of a teacher who was a Roman Catholic. The school, however, was to be conducted as an undenominational school with no religious instruction during school hours.\n\nThe teacher recommended by Father Artus was employed and Mr Inspector Clendinning in his report on this school made in November last, says that he thinks \"she will do well and be valuable among the Indians. Teaching first class\".\n\nWith regard to the closing of the Port Elgin and Sidney Bay schools, this was done at the recommendation of the Agent, who reported that owing to\ntheir being no accommodation near the wheel for the teachers, and the unsatisfactory attendance during the winter months, it was a matter of economy to close the schools. The teacher at Port Elgin had resigned, but at the request of the Indians, who forwarded a resolution asking to put this school in charge of an Indian named Thomas Jones, he was allowed to continue it during the winter months and is still in charge. After the 30th instant he will have to qualify if he wishes to be retained.\n\nNo similar request was made for the appointment of a substitute for the Sidney Bay school and it was closed from the 1st Jan. to the 31st March.\n\nThe Indians of Cape Croker pay for their schools out of their own funds. These schools are all denominational and have always been supported by the Band.\nCape Croker, 16th Oct. 1805.\n\nFew notes concerning a Separate School at Cape Croker, Ont., prepared for Mr J.A. Macrae, T.S. & R., by the Roman Catholic Missionary.\n\nThe population here is about 371 souls; there are about only 50 Protestants more than Catholics. There are 3 schools, and all are public schools, while the Catholics should have a separate school, according to the Indian Act Chap. 43, page 25 (a). At the school not there are 32 children, and on that number 22 are Catholic. It is true that the teacher is a Catholic, but there is one step more to be made, that is to say, not school should be a separate school.\n\nTo the honor of the Catholic population I beg to add that though the Catholics are in minority, here they have more children going to school, so Catholic children \u2014 see over.\nWould it not be just and wise to reward the Catholics by granting them a separate school, to which they are entitled?\n\nIt would not be necessary to build another school, because the Catholics are willing to continue to accept the Ojibwa children at their school.\n\nRelying on your well-known spirit of justice as well as on that of the Indian Department, I hope that the Catholics will soon have their separate school.\n\nI remain,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

I beg to say these two schools have been all painted and whitewashed both inside and out, also all the furniture and windows repaired and painted, as well as all the buildings thoroughly repaired and whitewashed, and the floors and sills repaired. It was necessary to put a new roof on the Cape Croker school, the old roof having been on for fully 25 years, so leaking badly but allowing the building a good covered area now has been set up, and both these schools are now in a first class condition in every respect.

Carried.\n\nA true Copy. John McLean\nIndian Agent\nSir,\n\nI enclose a resolution of Council, recommending that No. 2 School, at Sidney Bay be raised to $400 per year as proposed in Nos. 1 and 3 Schools. I may say that no application has been received to the advertisement for a teacher for Port Elgin School, No. 3. And I would like to know if I will advertise for a qualified teacher holding a certificate and offering $400 per year. I may say that I do not like to keep my daughter there, and she needs her at home, although she is well qualified to teach any children who attend that school. She never tried to take out papers for teaching, but the school Inspector has always said she did well. I was talking to Mr. School Inspector Mr. Cool, with reference to getting a teacher, and he thought, if we could secure a male teacher there, and give him some inducements in the shape of a house and some land, to work, the same as is done on the Saugeen Reserve, that it might work well as it does there.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6121, File 383-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nSir,\n\nThe teacher acts as warrant officer, and is anxious to keep his school up, as he has a comfortable home for his wife and family. But I know it will be hard to get a suitable teacher for this school, on account of there being no boarding place, and everything being out-of-the-way. The Inspector thought if we could get a teacher of that kind, that the school might hold its own with Cape Croker school, that has every advantage, as they keep half a dozen or more children around there from the other schools, with free board.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDep Ind. Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 14, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of September 30, last, which deals with salaries of teachers, I beg to say that the resolution therein mentioned was similar to the one passed by the council on the 1st ult., providing an increase of $100 in the salaries of the teachers of Nos. 1 and 3 schools, and that you were asked on the 16th ult. for information as to why such a large increase in the salaries should be made and why no provision was made for a similar increase in the salary of the teacher at No. 2 school.\n\nIn connection with the above I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to authorize the increase of $100 in the salaries of the teachers of these schools unless such teachers are holders of certificates from the Ontario Department of Education, which none of the present teachers are.\n\nIt is of opinion that an increase of $50 for this year would be a very liberal addition to their present salaries and will sanction an increase to this extent. In the case of No. 3 school, to which you refer in your letter of the 6th inst., I would say that you may offer a salary of $400, providing you can secure the services of a teacher holding a certificate as above.\n\nJohn Holzer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHolzer, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

With regard to this recommendation the Department would require to know if there is a suitable house available for a teacher's residence, and, if not, whether the Indians would be willing to grant sufficient funds from their capital to build such a residence.\n\nOn receipt of such information the matter will receive further consideration, and in the meantime the Department hopes that your daughter will be allowed to remain in charge of this school temporarily.\n\nCheques in favour of the teachers will be sent for the difference between $300 and $350 per annum from July 1, last.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, April 19, 1907.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of the returns for the March quarter, last, from the three Cape Croker schools, in which it is noticed that salaries at the rate of $400 per annum are asked for all the teachers of these schools.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer you to official letter of November 14, last, in which you were advised that the Department considered a $50 increase sufficient in the case of unqualified teachers, and $350 was the salary paid at these schools for the September and December quarters, last. In the case of No. 3 school you were authorized to advertise for a qualified teacher at a salary of $400, and as Mr. McCorkindale has the necessary certificates he will be paid at that rate; but as the teachers of the other two schools do not hold professional certificates, they can only be paid at the rate of $350.00.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nJohn MoIver, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMoIver, Ont.\nand the expenses of living here are such that\njustice required they should increase my salary.\n\nWhen I received my check, I saw that the\nDepartment did not consent to this arrangement\nof the Indians. The Agent said the objection\nis that I am not considered a qualified teacher.\nMay I ask why not?\n\nI know I have not an Ontario Certificate, but\nbefore coming here I took the first steps to obtain\none. Sent the result of the examination to\nthe Department together with the information that\nI am a Normal School Graduate and hold a\nTeacher's First Class Certificate from New York State;\nin reply I received from the Department a letter\nstating that they would require no further\nexaminations from me. Hence instead of\nreviewing the higher studies I devoted my evenings\nto giving lessons gratis to the men who wished to\nimprove.\n\nNow from what I have heard of you, I concluded\nyou did not recall these facts concerning my\nqualifications, so you could not after giving your\nword not to require further examinations from\nme, refuse that salary which even the Indians\nunasked, saw that I ought to have, and are\nwilling to give.\n\nAs to my qualifications as teacher I think\nI do not fail in modesty when I believe that\nany Inspector who has visited my school will\npronounce them in keeping with my First\nClass Certificate.\n\nI did not write to you at an earlier date\nOttawa, May 11, 1907.\n\nMadam\u2014\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 2nd inst.

I hereby attach a letter from Rev. Father Cadott and his Catholic friends, which speaks for itself. I could not recommend the breaking of close hours and the Rev. Father Cadott knows very well my views on separate schools and the costs relating thereto at Cape Croker, some time ago, but I would like to be fair in the matter of them having their Catholic children taught their Catholic and prayers just as I would have a Protestant minority have reasonable privileges. I also remember my instructions from the Dept when it was decided to have a R.C. teacher for that school, which were to see that no religious instructions were taught during school hours where both denominations are represented and in attendance. I had the privilege of having a conversation lately with Mr. School Inspector Hobbs.\n\nIndian Affairs.

During that time the other children will be given something else to do, in order not to loose their time. Or else, if you prefer, they could have a little recess outside.\n\nThe reason why we\nask this is that our priest cannot attend to their religious instruc-\ntion regularly, being often absent or being often too busy while at home.\n\nYou are aware that, being the minority here, we are enti-\ntled to a separate school (Indian act chap. 43 sect. 76.)\n\nBut we do not ask for a separate school, because the Band would have to build another School House.

(RG 10, Volume 6121, File 383-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFor your further information concerning this school I may state that on June 29, 1905, the predecessor of Father Cadot wrote the Department, claiming that, as there were a number of Roman Catholic children on the reserve, they were entitled to a school of their faith, but, in order not to cause any unnecessary discontent to their Methodist brethren, they would be satisfied with an undenominational school where no religion would be taught in the class-room during school hours, upon condition that the teacher of the school be a Roman Catholic, who should have the privilege of giving religious instruction before and after hours and on Saturdays and Sundays to the Roman Catholic children attending the school.\n\nAfter a good deal of correspondence with those interested the proposal was acceded to and a Roman Catholic teacher was placed in charge of the school after the summer holidays in 1894, and the\nschool has since been conducted on these lines, and\nthe Department is not disposed to depart from this\narrangement, which was made after due consideration.\n\nFather Cadot's letter is returned herewith.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo.\n\nReferring to Cape Breton School No. 1 in a matter of a garden plot to teach the Indian children a little of the rudiments of agriculture in the way of a small garden plot in connection with the school I beg to say that I am favorably impressed with those steps in educating the Indian children and I think it a good idea for all rural schools. I enclose the request of Miss Mary Moffatt the teacher at School No. 1 Cape Breton for the Department's attention.

J.C. Cadet, S.J., Roman Catholic Missionary on the Cape Croker reserve, regarding a previous application for permission to give religious instruction during school hours in the Cape Croker school, I beg to say that the Department informed its Agent that it could not approve of any arrangement for religious teaching which would interfere with the work of the classes in school hours, as it considered that any instruction of this nature in an undenominational school should be given only after the regular school hours.\n\nFor\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6121, File 383-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFor your further information concerning this school I may state that on June 29, 1903, the predecessor of Father Cadot wrote the Department, claiming that, as there were a number of Roman Catholic children on the reserve, they were entitled to a school of their faith, but, in order not to cause any unnecessary discontent to their Methodist brethren, they would be satisfied with an undenominational school where no religion would be taught in the class-room during school hours, upon condition that the teacher of the school be a Roman Catholic, who should have the privilege of giving religious instruction before and after hours and on Saturdays and Sundays to the Roman Catholic children attending the school.\n\nAfter a good deal of correspondence with those interested the proposal was acceded to and a Roman Catholic teacher was placed in charge of the school after the summer holidays in 1894, and the\nschool has since been conducted on these lines, and\nthe Department is not disposed to depart from this\narrangement, which was made after due consideration.\nFather Cadot's letter is returned herewith.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, May 8th., 1909.\n\nDear Mr. Tolinie,-\n\nI cannot think that the Rev. Mr. Cadot's letter has added much additional information to that already at the disposal of the Department in the matter to which he refers; and I therefore regret that it will not be possible to alter the decision. I can only say again that there will be no objection to any religious teaching considered necessary after school hours, but it is thought inadvisable to interrupt the working time of the School. I beg to point out that the actual text of the Resolution to which the Reverend gentleman refers is as follows: \"That it is resolved that we grant request to the Roman Catholics that religious instructions be taught during recess, or that School Teacher to arrange when they are to be taught without interfering school hours.\"\n\nI return Father Cadot's letter herewith.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJohn Tolinie, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nCape Croker, Ont., 1st June 1909\n\nMr. Frank Redden, Dept.

There is a good fall all the way down from the spring. It can be done for less money than it will take to dig wells.

Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nThe Public School Inspector for Bruce County has, on more than one occasion, very strongly recommended the establishment of libraries in the schools on the Cape Croker reserve. The matter has been given consideration by the Department and we have received a copy of a circular issued by Mr. Inspector McCool to the teachers in his Inspectorate. This circular contains a list of books approved by the Educational Department of Ontario for school libraries. We have had a number of requisitions for libraries in our schools and I think it would be well to try the experiment in the case of the No. 1 Cape Croker school, which is not only a model Indian school, but compares most favourably with the Public Schools in the County of Bruce.\n\nYou will note that this circular contains two lists of books, B and C, selected by the Rev. Mr. Briggs,\nwhich can be purchased for $10.00 each. I would recommend that Library No. 2 (C) be supplied the Cape Croker school.\n\nShould this experiment prove successful the Department might consider the extension of the system. An exchange of libraries among the schools supplied might be arranged for at a later date, so that it would not be necessary in all cases to supply a new list of books.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\nMEMORANDUM:\nAsst. Deputy Superintendent General\n\nIn reply to your inquiry I beg to say that the cost of a library for the Cape Croker school might be charged against the interest fund of the Band, but I think it would be preferable to charge it to the general school vote, which will bear the expenditure. No special provision, however, has been made. Of course, should the Department decide to establish libraries to any extent in Indian schools, special provision will have to be made, but this will probably be the only one put in this year.\n\nIf the Department pays for the library it will be privileged to transfer it to another school at any time it may see fit.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

When these men as private individuals thus attacked us we suffered it for peace sake and moreover our former chiefs always wisely discouraged any attempt to stir up religious strife. As I said at the Council I regretted very much to hear a chief thus speak so unjustly as well as untruthfully against a part of his Band especially since as chief his words had greater weight and many of our Indians not being well instructed will get a wrong idea in their minds which it is next to impossible ever to get out or that the progress that we should make is hindered by our want of unity and good feeling.

They gave two practical talks at the concert in the evening besides making themselves generally useful all day\u2014quite. I felt like asking Mr. MacKay & Co. for impressions but had not the courage to impress any more tasks on the people of the Department. Has Mr. McIlwain recovered from all we made him do while he was here? Mr. McCork, the Inspector, visited me yesterday\u2014\n\nNow I will come to business. You may recall the piece of land adjoining the School yard\u2014Mr. Duncan spoke to Paul Redgiraffe and he is still willing to sell it and remove the house\u2014price $100.\n\nAll the visitors think it a splendid chance to enlarge the grounds so as to be able to do more in agricultural lines.\n\nMy plan would be to lay out the field in plots of the best prairie, especially fall wheat, oats, barley\u2014have the older boys tend the plots\u2014hand thresh the grain and use the grain as seed\u2014thus training them to have good seed.\n\nMr. MacKay said he would help\u2014I know he could get some first class seed from the C.A.C. and I think it would be practical for the Dept.\u2014Arrange with Experimental Farm at Elora for some seed or we could purchase some seeds from good dealers.\n\nWould also suggest a plot as a nursery for currants, gooseberries, apples and pears to be tended by the boys and later div...\namong the worthy. The remainder to be used at boys' play ground\u2014invite all who think the officials may see that the money expended would be a good investment and if they decide to purchase the land, trust they will do so as soon as possible so it can be ploughed this fall\u2014plans made during winter and spring find everything ready to work early in the season.\n\nPoveshell and other kindred regards from all Cape Roberts especially\n\nYours with respect,\n\nMary Moffitt.\nMr. Duff, the Markdale District representative in the Department of Agriculture, gave the Owen Sound Sun some interesting facts of the work on the Cape Croker Reservation. In its interview with him the paper said:\n\n\"The last fair in this Northern section of Mr. Duff's district was held on Tuesday on the Cape Croker Indian reserve on the Georgian Bay. Mr. Duff was greatly pleased with what he saw up there and the interest taken in the fair by the Indians. \"The progress of the Indians was a surprise,\" he said, \"and I would never have believed there are such splendid specimens of manhood amongst the fine big, strapping fellows. Intelligent and many of them well educated. They took up the school fair idea enthusiastically and we had a splendid fair. The president, secretary and director were all Indians and at the little concert they had on fair night, the president took the chair and presided over the meeting as well as anyone could do. Some of them are excellent speakers, especially one of them, Paul Jones, who made a splendid speech. Then they sing and play different instruments most willingly was heard.\n\nMr. Duff paid tribute to the school teacher there, a white woman. \"She is a wonder,\" said he. \"She teaches the school, trains the children from which the members of the 125th Regiment Indian Band are selected, teaches them singing and music, domestic science, sewing and manual training. She spends her summer months taking a course at Guelph, in order to fit her better for her work. As the priest, Father Caroli, says, \"She knows everything she does and was doing new to me,\" concluded Mr. Duff, \"and if you want some good news for your paper, you had better come with me to the next school fair. You will see plenty to write about, for it is an interesting place and is well worth a trip there to see it.\"\n\nIndian Affairs.

So far nothing has been done by the Contractor & I find the work everything as it was when Mr. Ogilvie visited here. Hope the Department will be able & hurry Mr. Gilpin & Co. so everything will be in order by vacation.\n\nOn Arbor Day the men had a \"Bee\" & plant trees and level one side of the school grounds. They worked till 6.30 but could not finish & I hired two men and a team for another day. We have certainly improved the surroundings.\n\nIn regard to the farm, if present interest continues I think it will be productive of much good. Six young men from 17-24 years age, have plowed oats and corn. The object is to raise first class seed. And there are no cultivators in the vicinity that we can borrow or invite & the agent requesting him & ask the Department to authorize him to purchase me as he sometimes forgets.

Drainage is one of the chief factors & success at the Cape.\n\nThose over the field should have a good coming to get the soil in better working condition. If we have three or four men continue the work for 3 or 4 years, in order to illustrate \"Crop rotation,\" which the Indians pay little attention. If the drainage is attended to this fall, we will put oats in the large plots next year. Don't know before hand in order & plan.\n\nPart of the field we intend to use next year, need to have the stone removed. That will require several days' work from two men with team.\n\nAbout the only way to get men to do these jobs, for the present is to hire & pay them, get a receipt and have the Department refund us. Have been doing so in the school garden. Since we are going to have a \"Model Farm\" we will have to make it true and while I know the Agent approves and I have no doubt the Department of Indian Affairs will approve that I go ahead and have the necessary work done.\n\nI would ask the Department to notify either the Agent myself of their wishes.

In this connection it will be necessary to make a drain along end wall in the stone work conducting the water to the lowest portion and carrying from there to drainage system, then to lay a concrete floor over the balance of the basement. These should also be either brick or concrete piers erected to support the beams and the posts removed, as well as the rebuilding of the walls torn down during the excavating. This work should be done during the Summer holidays, and I have to request that you will inform me if you are able to have the work successfully done by the Indians there under your supervision, also state if you can have erected a small concrete building providing this should be required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Class-room.\n\nOn Monday morning in each class, during a period when the children are at work from the blackboard, those who wish to make deposits are called up in the order of their names in the Cash Book. One at a time, each child presents his Pass Book and his money\u2014the latter going into a special tray. After the child has seen the teacher enter the amount of his deposit opposite his name in the Cash Book as well as in his Pass Book and date and initial the latter, he passes on to his desk and to his work.\n\nWhen the last child has sat down again the teacher counts the cash and puts it in her class money bag, entering the amount upon the tag and sending bag and Cash Book to the Principal's office.\n\nNEW DEPOSITS.\n\nWhen a child makes his first deposit, the teacher sends to the Principal for an index card and a Pass Book bearing the same number. It is essential that the index card which identifies the child should be numbered to agree with his own Pass Book.\n\nNOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL.\n\nNotice must be given by any depositor wishing to withdraw more than a dollar. The proper form will be supplied and initialled by the teacher.\n\nLOST PASS BOOKS.\n\nLost Pass Books must be reported at once to the teacher who will fill out the proper form and give the counterfoil to the child. Index cards for new accounts, withdrawal notices and lost pass book forms should all go with the Cash Book and money bag to the Principal's office.\n\nOn the last banking day of each month every child should produce his Pass Book so that the teacher may enter the balance in the Cash Book under the heading \"Balance as it appears in Pass Book.\" Teachers should also make and enter in the Cash Book the cross additions of the individual deposits shewn therein and see that the total for the month agrees with the sum of the weekly totals, in order to discover errors which might otherwise get into the Ledger.\n\nThe Principal's Office.\n\nBefore the first banking Monday of a school term, the Principal may select two boys or two girls, who volunteer to act, and who in his judgment can afford to give up a lesson period each Monday for the sake of acquiring skill in handling cash and obtaining a little practice in business methods. These two pupils, under the Principal's supervision, can do the following work:\n\nAfter all the returns from the various class-rooms have reached the Principal's office, count the cash in each bag and verify the total as entered upon the tag and in the corresponding Cash Book\u2014any error being reported to the teacher concerned before the classes have dispersed. Prepare the Principal's Summary in duplicate. Place the index cards, the withdrawal notices, the lost pass book forms, and the transfer forms (see below) in an envelope with one copy of the Principal's Summary. This package goes with the money to the Bank.\n\nTRANSFERS.\n\nA child who has come from another school in the same town and who had a banking account in that other school should make application to his new Principal for a transfer form and should give up his old Pass Book. The Principal will make out a new index card, give the child the corresponding new Pass Book into which he has transferred the old balance and attach both the old Pass Book and the new index card to the transfer form.\n\nOLD PASS BOOKS AND INDEX CARDS.\n\nWhen these are returned by the Bank, it means that the child has drawn out all his money and that the account is closed. The old Pass Books should be kept in numerical order and the old index cards in alphabetical order for use in the event of the child wishing to re-open his account. They may be destroyed one year after the child has left school.\n\nINTEREST.\n\nThe children should be told that interest will be added only to those accounts which show any balance on the 30th June. Sometimes children lose interest which might have been secured by leaving five cents to keep the account open.\n\nOn the last banking day of each month the Cash Books, instead of being returned to the teachers, are sent to the Bank in order that the total monthly deposits of each child may be posted to his account in the Ledger, and that account compared with the Pass Book Balance as it is shown in the Cash Book.\n3. The Bank.\n\nWhen the Bank receives a new index card, the particulars thereon are entered upon a new page in the school Ledger, which page must bear the same number as that upon the card, while the card itself is placed in the cabinet at the Bank as an index to the Ledger.\n\nThe withdrawal notices for the week should be upon the paying teller's desk before the hour set apart for withdrawals. Notices not acted upon within a month of their issue will be destroyed. These notices are not cheques and must never be treated as such. Withdrawals take place once a week during a stated hour. The Pass Book must be presented and compared with the Ledger. In doubtful cases the child should know the date of his birth as given on his page in the Ledger. The debit entry must be made at once on both the Pass Book and Ledger and the child must sign the withdrawal sheet. If the child draws out all his money, the Pass Book is retained by the Bank while the corresponding index card is removed from the cabinet and both returned to the school that issued them.\n\nWhen the Bank has received a lost pass book form a dated entry consisting of the words \"Lost Pass Book\" is at once made upon the child's page in the Ledger. When a child has presented the counterfoil, the Bank will issue a duplicate pass book, charge the child two cents and write the words \"Duplicate Pass Book\" upon his page in the Ledger.\n\nOn receipt of a transfer form, the child's page should be procured from the Ledger of the old school, the pass book number and address changed thereon, a statement of the transfer written on the margin, and the page inserted in its proper place in the Ledger of the new school. If that place is occupied by a blank page bearing the same number, the blank must be destroyed. Also the old index card must be taken out of the cabinet of the old school and the new index card put in the cabinet of the new school. The old Pass Books should be cancelled and sent with the corresponding old index cards to the school that issued them.\n\nAt the end of each month the Ledgers should be posted from the Cash Books, posting only the monthly total of deposits for each child as in the Cash Book Column headed \"Total for Month.\" At the same time the ledger balance should be compared with the figures in the Cash Book Column headed \"Balance as it appears in Pass Book\" and all discrepancies investigated. A return should be made to the Head Office of the Penny Bank, in Toronto, on the printed form supplied for such reports.\n\nDuring the summer holidays the Ledgers should be sent to Head Office for a period not exceeding a fortnight, previously arranged for, in order that the interest may be computed and added to all accounts that were open on the 30th June last. This interest will be entered in each child's Pass Book the next time he presents it at the Bank.\nMiss Mary Meffitt,\nNo. 1 School,\nCape Croker, Ont.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 21st inst. we are sending you under separate cover particulars in regard to The Penny Bank, and samples of the stationery in use.\n\nThe cost to the School Board for stationery would amount to about $13.00 the first year and Two or Three dollars for subsequent years. This would, of course, be greatly reduced if two or more other Rural schools were to combine with you and share the one ledger in the Bank at Wiarton. The cooperation of a chartered bank is essential, and we presume that Wiarton would be most convenient for you.\n\nAll depositors are treated as regular bank depositors and receive 3% interest added however only once a year.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nTHE PENNY BANK OF TORONTO\n\nM A MacKenzie\nManager\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to submit the following matter to you for consideration and approval.\n\nI think the people of this place have reached that stage of prosperity which make it advisable to introduce the Penny Bank in connection with my work here. The time is most opportune as all the available men, married and single have enlisted. Feeling now more than ever that they are...\nan insignificant part of the vast British Empire, the need of thrift that they read about returning home & them... Receiving their monthly pay regularly they have ready money for which the children have a goodly share. So when I spoke to them about starting the Penny Bank in the School they welcomed the idea and are already discussing about who will have the greatest amount & his name.\n\nWrite to the Penny Bank of Toronto as directed in a circular issued by the Ontario Department of Education, for information. Enclose the reply.\n\nI must not assure you that the work shall have not only my sympathy and cooperation but the hearty support and influence of Fr. Cadot, S.J.\n\nLooking forward to an early and favorable reply.\n\nYours with respect,\n\nMary Moffitt\nOttawa, April 19, 1916.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo suggesting the introduction of the Penny Bank in connection with the Cape Croker School and enclosing a communication from the Manager of the Penny Bank of Toronto in reference thereto.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your suggestion and you may make the necessary arrangements for the introduction and carrying on of a Penny Bank in connection with your school. The Department will pay for the necessary stationery. The teachers of the Sidney Bay and Port Elgin schools are being written to and asked if they would like to co-operate with you in the bank.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nMcLEAN\nAsst.

McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nM.A. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nManager,\nThe Penny Bank of Toronto,\nCor. York and Richmond Sts.,\nToronto, Ont.\nToronto, Ont., June 29th, 1916.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Superintendent, Indian Department,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFollowing up the recent conversation with you in regard to Indian School No. 1 on the Cape Coker Reserve, I wish to lay before you the following facts.\n\nI find that the teacher in charge is an efficient instructor and has her school well in hand, but take exception to the following conditions:\n\n(1) In connection with her residence in a room situate in the building, she has an oratory, wherein an altar is erected, and mass is celebrated. I am creditably informed that in cold days in the winter, the mass is celebrated, outsiders being admitted, and take exception to any public building, much less an undenominational school building conducted under the Department being put to such uses. We freely concede the right of the teacher to use, for her private devotions, any room in her residential portion of the school, but must make strenuous protest against any portion of the school building being used for the public celebration of the mass.\n\n(2) The pupils of the school are about equally divided, but in the Manual Training Department, the material used was put to the use of constructing this altar by the pupils of the school. This much, the teacher\nherself, conceded in a conversation with myself.\n\n(3) The teacher has been in the habit of receiving long visits occasionally from her friends, all of which, of course, is quite unobjectionable. But exception must be taken, when such visitors are nuns in the garb. To us, the ostensible object of such visits from these religious ladies, is the familiarizing of the Protestant pupils attending the school with the presence of these religious ladies, and the influence of such visits, upon the Protestant Indian children, with a view of inclining them to the Church of Rome. We consider, that in an undenominational school, this is most objectionable, and has given rise, in this present instance, to no small amount of discontent. Complaints have also been made that the teacher has frequently chided Protestant children attending the school, with the remark \"is that all your Protestant training does for you - soulless little things that you are\".\n\nWe regret that Miss Moffatt's fervor for her church, has betrayed her into showing, on many occasions her excessive zeal, and leading her to forget, that she is a teacher of an undenominational school where religious fervor, along denominational lines cannot be tolerated.\n\n(4) This school also, while it is opened with the Lord's Prayer, yet before repeating it, the Roman Catholic pupils have been instructed to cross themselves. The reading of the Scriptures also, according to the school requirements, have been omitted. Fast days, and feast days, in the Roman Calendar, are also observed in this school, ignoring the fact, that the Protestant children, attending the same, have been deprived of instruction on those days, and the teacher has received her salary for the same, notwithstanding the non-performance of her duties towards her Protestant pupils.\n\nWhile we wish to make it clear that we are not desirous of disturbing Miss Moffatt, in her position as teacher, and ungrudgingly\nadmit her high qualifications as an educationalist, still we must emphasize and urge the discontinuance of these conditions that are complained of.\n\nWe feel assured that if these matters are called to Miss Moffatt's attention, and the law in the matter clearly explained to her, that our grievances will come to an end.\n\nAwaiting your reply, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOwen Sound, Ont.\nThis motion is recommending Percy Redonquott as Caretaker for the No. 1 Cape Croker School. Barney Keech, the present Caretaker, enlisted last winter and is now training at London. So that the teacher, Miss Moffatt has had to do part of the work herself. As Percy Redonquott lives close to the school I would recommend that he be appointed.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\nAgincourt Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nTo the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sirs:\u2014 I am spending\nthe holidays here, with Miss Moffitt,\nteacher of No. 1 school, Cape Croker.\nHer health is somewhat impaired, and\nit is thought that a change of school\nmight benefit her. As we are both\nwell known to the Department, she\nhaving been in the service twelve,\nand I fourteen years, I did not hesi-\ntate to offer to change school with\nher, with, of course, the consent of the\nDepartment, which, I do not doubt,\nwill be granted.\n\nI shall do my best to continue\nMiss Moffitt's good work among the\npeople of Cape Croker; and I know she\nwill amply fill my place in Wikwemikong\nif this is agreeable to the Department.\n\nKindly let me know at your earliest convenience.\n\nMost respectfully yours,\n\nAd\u00e8le Dubuc.\nyou personally as you are so familiar with both the schools and the teachers.\n\nI have noticed that there is a tendency for teachers who remain too long in one Reserve to get into a rut. Now I have been 12 years at the Cape so even if my health did not suggest the change no doubt it will do me good to rub up against other people and compare notes.\n\nI have no doubt but the answer will lie in the reforms etc., so thanking you most sincerely for your kind interest.\n\nYours with respect,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The teacher can get the sum of the school and work of the Entrance class which would be easier than to change later.\n\nSuch the transfer & Mikaminong chiefly because it is a two-room school so I do not think the work would be as hard as in a one-room school even if it is true or more large boys and girls therefore more can be accomplished for knowledge & learning.\n\nMr. Carter & Mr. Beaudet & I have been consulted and do not object to the change.\n\nMiss Dubarne will write also to the Department. I prefer addressing...\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nApplications have been received from Miss Duhamel, senior teacher of the Wikwemikong Day School, and from Miss Moffitt, teacher of the Cape Croker No. 1 School, for an exchange of duties. Miss Moffitt states that she is run down and thinks that a change of scene would benefit her health.\n\nBoth these teachers have been a number of years in the service of the Department and I have no hesitation in recommending that their applications be granted. There are other reasons which I mentioned to you which would make it advisable that a change should take place. The school at Cape Croker is undenominational and, should you approve of the change, full directions can be given Miss Duhamel for the conduct of the school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department, therefore, does not approve of the resolution to appoint Percy Fedonequott caretaker.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. Angus Elliot,\nSecretary,\nCape Croker Council,\nCape Croker, Ont.\nOttawa, July 26, 1916.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith further reference to the applications of Miss Moffitt, teacher of the Cape Croker No. 1 School, and Miss Duhamel, teacher at Wikwemikong, to be allowed to exchange schools I beg to say that both these ladies have expressed the wish to be allowed to make the change. Miss Moffitt is of opinion that her health would be better for doing so. Both these ladies are Roman Catholics and belong to a teaching sisterhood and have been in the employ of the Department for a number of years.\n\nOf the two teachers Miss Moffitt has the highest qualifications and her services could be utilized to great advantage at Wikwemikong, where there are more children and better opportunities for advancement, as they all live in the village and the attendance is more regular. It is a two roomed school and Miss Moffitt could devote her energies to the senior pupils. All the Indians in Wikwemikong are Roman Catholics.\n\nThe school at Cape Croker is undenominational and supported.\nsupported by the band, but, as there are three undenominational schools on the reserve, two of which are in charge of Protestant teachers, it was decided that a Roman Catholic teacher should be employed in the other school, the No.1, and a resolution to that effect was passed by the Cape Croker Band on the 17th of August, 1903. This resolution was approved of by the Department, which agreed to the appointment of a duly qualified Roman Catholic teacher, it to be distinctly understood that no religious instructions were to be given during school hours at this or any other school where Roman Catholics and Protestants both attend. Miss Moffitt's name was suggested by Father Artus, who was then the Roman Catholic Missionary at Cape Croker. He was informed that if she possessed the required qualifications for the position and was a British subject the Department would approve of her appointment. Miss Moffitt took steps to meet these requirements and took out naturalization papers and obtained a certificate from the registrar of the Educational Department, Ontario.\n\nMiss Duhamel has always taught in Roman Catholic schools and was not required to undergo the same test as Miss Moffitt as to qualifications and naturalization and I doubt if the Department would be justified in placing her\nher in charge of the Cape Croker School.\n\nIf Miss Moffitt is anxious to go to Wikwemikong for the sake of her health there is an excellent opportunity for her to do so now, as Miss Kelly, the assistant teacher there, has sent in her resignation, which took effect on the 30th of June, last. This vacancy has not been filled and she could go there without any exchange. Should she be transferred to Wikwemikong this would leave a vacancy at the No. 1 Cape Croker School which could be filled by a Catholic lay teacher.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

As there is a vacancy there now owing to the resignation of Miss Kelly, there will be no need of an exchange of positions between yourself and Miss Duhamel, as suggested, and the arrangement of the classes will be left to yourselves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

As there is a vacancy there now owing to the resignation of Miss Kelly there will be no need for an exchange of positions between yourself and Miss Moffitt. You can both remain at this school and the arranging of the classes will be left to yourselves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Adele Duhamel,\nTeacher,\nWikwemikong Day School.\nSpanish, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 152521. I thank you for the very kind manner with which you grant my transfer.\n\nBut, I fear I was not explicit enough in my application. So I take the liberty to submit to you a few points which may more clearly show why I ask for an exchange of positions between Miss Duhamel and myself.\n\nFirst, it seems you have not yet been notified that Miss Burke, formerly teaching the Indian school at Caughnawaga, had applied some time ago for the position held by Miss Kelly, and her name was to be sent in early in July.\n\nHer acceptance by the Department was looked upon as a certainty since she is reported as having done successful work. So I understand she has been almost sure of the position for which she has especially prepared. You can\nreadily understand I could not thus disappoint her by taking her place.\n\nSecondly, what really aided me to decide back for a transfer was the hope that Miss Ducharme would succeed me at Cape Croker, for she is a splendid teacher of domestic sciences and has done fine work in Ed. Agriculture\u2014similar to my work at the Cape, so she would be right at home there as I would be in her school and there would be not set back as too often happens when there is a change of teachers.\n\nYou know I could not possibly be as selfish as to leave the good people at the Cape in the lurch, even if they are Indians, after their willing correspondence to all my efforts for so many years. Indeed, while I appreciate most fully your very kind consideration which grants my transfer to another school at the same salary, I know receive I would rather continue my work at the Cape until it is well established than run the risk of seeing it neglected and the consequent bad effect on the Indians.\n\nMiss Ducharme and I are spending our vacation together, so we talked the matter over and though we know these communications are generally made through the Agent or respective Missionaries decided in order to avoid delay to address you again. While we do not want to be too persistent we respectfully ask you reconsider the exchange.\nin the light of their fair remarks.\n\nThanking you again for your interest in\nthe affair and trusting that you will see\nfit to approve of the exchange.\n\nYours with respect,\n\nMary Muffett\nTo the Secretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\n\nImmediate Attention\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to inform the Department of the different changes of teachers in the schools directed by the Daughters of the Heart of Mary.\n\nMiss Ad\u00e8le Duchesne will go to Cape Croker at the place of Miss Mary Moffit who will take the Wikwemikong School with Miss Ad\u00e8le Burke.\n\nMiss Mary Burke will take the West Bay School at the place of Miss Lapierre.\n\nMiss Marcella Hickey will take Miss Rogers' place at South Bay.\n\nAll these teachers belong to the Society of the Daughters of the Heart of Mary, and are well qualified to take charge of those schools. I hope that the Dept. will be satisfied with those teachers. The changes were judge necessary by the Superiors of the Daughters of Mary, and I hope that the Dept. will approve them all.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJuly 31st\nOttawa, August 3, 1916.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo in reference to your transfer from the Cape Croker No. 1 School to the Wikwemikong School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department's offer in this matter still holds good and you may either go to Wikwemikong or remain in charge of the Cape Croker School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Mary Moffitt,\nTeacher,\nSpanish, Ont.\nOttawa, August 3, 1916.\n\nRev.

Miss Moffitt, the present teacher of the Cape Croker School, applied for an exchange and was told that she might go to Wikwemikong to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Miss Kelly.\n\nMiss Sadie Burke was formerly in the employ of the Department and if she wished for re-engagement she should have made her application through the local Agent or direct to the Department and if she applied to you the Department should have been consulted.\n\nRev.

There must be some misunderstanding somewhere; if I am guilty I am very willing to apologize for what I have written. I had been told by my predecessors that since the Daughters of Mary took charge of the schools in the different missions, whenever a change was judge necessary amongst them, the only thing we had to do was to notify the Department of the change and ask for an approval of it, and that is exactly what I meant to do in my letter of the 31st ult. I never intended to assume the right of nominating any teacher for any school of the Dept. without the approval of the Dept. I acted in good faith this time as I did three years ago for the change of Miss E. Stanley and Miss R. Ryan for the South Bay school and also for the change of Miss Duhamel and Miss Leitch when Miss Duhamel was transferred from South Bay to Wikwemikong, and Miss Leitch from South Bay.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Which application I now renew in their name.\n\nThe two Misses Burke are known to the Dept., also Miss M. Hickey she is an experienced teacher of twenty years teaching in the United States she taught all grades from the lowest to the highest even in the High School for many years, she is certainly well qualified to take charge of the South Bay School.\n\nBoth Miss Duhamelet and Josephine well known to the Dept. As for Miss Lapierre she is gone to the United States to teach a French class in one of their schools so she resigns her position at West Bay. This is the reason why I made the application for Miss May Burke well known here to the Dept. to take her place at West Bay.\nNow I hope that this letter will give you satisfactory explanations, and that you will be kind enough to let me know whether the Dept. approved or not of the applications made by me in the name of the different teachers. In the case the Dept. could not admit those new teachers, it will be impossible for the daughters of Mary to keep those Indian schools, and you know very well by your own experience that no lay teachers could do as much good as these did during the many years they had charge of the schools.\n\nHoping to receive a favorable answer,\n\nI remain yours very truly,\n\nL.M.

Dugan\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, August 18, 1916.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 5th and 13th instant in further reference to the change of teachers in the Indian schools conducted under the auspices of your church.\n\nThe Department has noted that it has been decided to continue Miss Moffitt at Cape Croker.\n\nWith regard to the other changes recommended by you I beg to say that the Misses Burke, whose engagement you recommend for the West Bay and Wikwemikong Schools, were both previously in the service of the Department and should have known that it was necessary for them to make their applications to the Department. It is a question, had they done so, whether they would have been employed, as the Department is in receipt of a number of applications from experienced Roman Catholic teachers who are possessed of higher qualifications. As you are practically committed to their employment, Miss Mary Burke may be placed in charge of the West Bay School at a salary of $500.00 per annum and Miss Sadie Burke may act as assistant teacher at Wikwemikong at a salary of $450.00 per annum.\n\nWith regard to the employment of Miss Hickey I may say that the Department does not approve of the employment of aliens, but, as you are again committed in her case,\n\nRev. L. N. Dugas, S.J.,\nPrincipal,\nSpanish River Industrial School,\nSpanish, Ont.\nshe may take charge of the South Bay School on the same conditions as were applied to Miss Moffitt's engagement at Cape Croker in 1903, which were that she be possessed of the required qualifications and be a British subject. The Department will require Miss Hickey at the first available opportunity to take out her naturalization papers and secure a provincial certificate, as was done by Miss Moffitt. Miss Hickey will be paid at the rate of $500.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst.

I thought her equal to the best, if not superior to all of them.\n\nHer many years service in the Indian schools led me to think the new exchange would meet your approval, otherwise certainly would not have asked it.\n\nI have benefited by a complete rest, and the doctor while nothing could change thinks there no risk in returning to the Cape, neither do I, though I am sorry to miss the chance of getting acquainted with the Indians at Mikemenkong.\n\nAs it is nearing September any communication will but reach me at Cape Croker.\n\nThanking you for your courteous and considerate kindness in this transaction,\n\nYours with respect,\n\nMary Moffatt.\nMotion by Stephen Elliott & Edgar Jones\nto alter this Council and the Dep\nto change the System and have\nTrustees appointed for each School\nthe same as it used to be\nunder the Supervision of the agent\n\nCarried\n\nAngus Elliott\nSealy\nI think they would have more interest in the schools this way but of course you know why the change was made.\n\nI.

Judging from the conditions of farms and buildings the Indians need a stirring up. Noxious weeds are appearing on every farm, barns are falling to pieces for lack of timely repair. Even the planks of McGregor's Harbour Dock have all been carried away, I am told, by the people for firewood. I am not aware of any attempt being made to stop the abuse. Hopes are centred on the returned soldiers, but unless they are taken in hand by a man who will take a personal interest in the work of each, they will fall back into old habits.

Garland\n\nIndian Agent\n\nCape Croker\n\nPOOR COPY\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen you receive this letter from me you may be sure there is something amiss or in need of your assistance. So the object of this letter is to call your attention to the careless manner in which school material is purchased by the Agent.\n\nI do not wish to complain but show no reason why this state of affairs should continue other than...\nof the school. This is the usual route by which school supplies purchased by the Agent reaches No. 1.\n\nSend the application. Not hearing anything about the matter for a month or more, I asked the Agent if the Department had authorized him to purchase the articles. Generally, he is not certain, thinks he got a little, but should make out another list as he is going to town and will get the articles. Another month passes and I am fortunate if another list is not required. At last the articles arrive, and frequently are not just what was asked for. But to accept them means not to get them at all or another wait of several months. Two examples will make this clear.\n\nIn Sept. 1923, the Department wrote me they had authorized the Agent to purchase supplies for a noon lunch and instructed him to consult me. I waited some weeks and not hearing from him sent him a list, noting especially that eggs and flour ought to be purchased in bulk. After waiting several weeks longer, I heard the articles were in the store and as the Agent did not bring them I got a man to do so. The eggs and flour were in half pound tins, so the Department paid for a lot of empty and useless tins.\n\nIn April I asked where the lunch money disappeared. The Agent took it to town. Some time in May I informed...\nme it was ready and he would bring it out. June came but no lawn mower. Finally seeing how the porch of his house exposed to wind and weather (I had been as careful not even let it get wet), and wishing to leave the yard in good condition for the holidays, sent a man with a rig to bring it over, but the Agent would not let him have it claiming, as the man states, that he was charged by the Department with these things and would deliver it when he was ready.\n\nA few days later I met the Agent and he informed me he would bring the mower over the next day. When I left it had not been brought to the school.\n\nNow, think this extra work which I have been doing gratuitously for years.\nsimply for the uplift of the Indians is more than enough without this continual annoyance attending the obtaining of the necessary tools, implements or material.\n\nAny article, after the purchase has been authorized, could be in the school within two weeks. If the merchants in Wainwright are out of the goods, they would send for them if requested to do so.\n\nReceived a package of Quarterly School Report Blanks last week. I do not know if that means my report for the June quarter has not yet reached the Department or that the officials are beginning to realize that even such little things as blank forms are not always obtained without delay.\nI have not heard the result of the Entrance Examination. I sent two girls, one Indian and the other white. Mrs. Kelchel's daughter. If the Indian girl passes there will be the question of higher education to be decided.\n\nI shall return to the Cape at the end of August\u2014the last heard from since things were as usual.\n\nI trust you will be able to see that there is some improvement in the manner in which school supplies are purchased and delivered. The present method is a losing game.\n\nThanking you for your interest in my work.\n\nYours with respect,\n\nMary Moffitt\nOTTAWA, July 28th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has received several complaints regarding the lack of attention given by you to matters in connection with the Indian schools on the Cape Croker Agency. There has been unnecessary delay on your part in obtaining and delivering supplies which you received authority from the Department to purchase, and also delay in forwarding requests of the teachers for articles required by them.\n\nIt is desired that prompt attention on your part be given to requests from the teachers, and that they be forwarded to the Department, and when authority is given you for the purchase of any supplies that you attend to the matter without delay. If these matters are not attended to on your part more promptly in future other arrangements will have to be made in the obtaining of small supplies required by the teachers from time to time.\n\nIt is hoped that it will not be necessary to again have to draw your attention to your carelessness in these matters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

We desire that the teachers will have every support and encouragement in their work, and that any reasonable requests for supplies shall receive the prompt attention of the Indian Agent. If, in future, there is unnecessary delay in obtaining the articles required, I will be pleased if you will draw the matter to my attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

As in former epidemics, the \"ounce of prevention worth a pound of cure\" seems to have been forgotten, but having written so often on this topic I do not intend to inflict more remarks about it on you.\n\nThe Fall Fair, Sept 28th, was good. Although it was a wet, cold day, many visitors were here. However, gate receipts were low as the weather did not permit outdoor sports, contests and games.\n\nThe children's exhibits were better than last year. The boys' bird houses and most of the traps were sold to the visitors to the delight of the boys.\n\nMr. Abraham was able to be here & the joy and satisfaction of the children and the managers of the Fair.

The Department is endeavouring, however, to secure the permission of His Excellency in Council to pay Indian day school teachers at a flat rate of $15 per month for the 10 teaching months. This proposed arrangement is for the present fiscal year only.\n\nFor the last fiscal year, ended March 31st, you were paid a bonus at the rate of $159 per annum, payable in quarterly payments. This year, if authority is received for the proposed arrangement, you will receive a bonus of $15 per teaching month, as follows: June quarter, $45; September quarter, $15; December quarter, $45; and March quarter $45. For the June quarter you were overpaid $2.25, and this amount will be deducted from your salary for the quarter ending 30th September.\n\nI am pleased to inform you that the Deputy Superintendent General has directed that your salary be increased to $800 per month as from the first of July, 1922. There is, therefore, a balance due on account of salary for the past quarter of $12.50, less the $2.25 mentioned above, or $10.25. This amount will be added to your December quarter cheque, making a total of $210.25.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Although the \"flu\" that is at present prevailing in this neighborhood is of a mild type, it generally takes a week to ten days for it to run its course and if it became severe on the Reserve it may go harder with the Indians than the whites as the Indians have not the proper means of combating it or take the proper means of keeping it from spreading.\n\nI shall advise the Department of any serious conditions that arise from this cause.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind.

I regret that I shall not be in a position because the provisions for the School Room meet this year.\n\nI had intended to write to the Secretary but will profit by the need of answering your letter & transact business with you.\n\nMy health not being quite up to par, the doctor whom I consulted since coming here, advises me due to the proverbial ounce of prevention and for\n\n[Signature]\nMontreal or Toronto for special treatment, as he is. Doubtful if it would be wise to resume work in September. I concluded the most practical thing to do is back for leave of absence till January. If my substitute does well, I would prefer not to disturb the school, but extend the leave for the year.\n\nI recommend Miss Violet Redjiron, the Indian girl at Cape Croker, invite H.S. Cadet and he approves the plan. She has her II Class Certificate, knows the run of the school and is the making of a good teacher. Being an Indian she cannot easily get a school so if she replaces me and succeeds it will encourage her and be a lift.\n\nTo the upward march of the Indians. I had hoped a teacher from Spanish might replace me but owing to taking up the work at Garden River no one is free to do so, which I regret. Any change at Cape Croker bring the furnishing of the teacher's residence & the fare. When I took up the work the Department did not furnish the house. In recent years you have begun to replace my worn out articles. So the following belong to the Indian Department: Cooking stove, 6 chairs, sleeping rocker, 1 kitchen table, 1 rug for living room, 1 mantle lamp, 4 cupboards, 1 large size bed, 1 small size bed, 2 pair white blankets.

On every occasion I visit the school, I find the discipline extremely poor, and altogether the school appears to be going down, the pupils making little progress. To speak personally, I have two children of my own attending, and they are going back in their studies.\n\nIf it is impossible for Miss Meffitt to return, I would strongly recommend that a new teacher be engaged for this school.\n\nSecretary,\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6121, File 383-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 25, 1929.\n\nMadam:\n\nThe Department would appreciate your advising, at your convenience, if Miss Moffitt intends to return to the Cape Croker Indian Day School on January 1st, next. My purpose in making this enquiry is because we are informed by the Indian Agent that the services of the present temporary teacher are not very satisfactory and, if Miss Moffitt does not intend to return on the date stated, the Department will probably be obliged to secure a teacher to replace Miss Nadjiwon.\n\nIn view of Miss Moffitt's long service at the Cape Croker School, the Department is arranging to allow her one month's sick leave with pay, and a cheque for the amount will be forwarded under separate cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

The Department is making enquiries with a view to ascertaining if Miss Moffitt will return to Cape Croker on January 1st, next. As soon as definite information is received you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. G. Poste, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCape Croker,\nOnt.\nDear Mr. [Last Name],\n\nYour kind letter received,\nand am forwarding it to Miss Moffett\nwho has been in Montreal, under Doctor's\ncare, since holidays.\n\nI wish to thank you for favor\nbeing granted to Miss Moffett through\nyour kindness.\n\nYours with respect,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6121, File 383-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nI must thank you for granting me one month's salary\u2014a kindness I greatly appreciate and which will be most useful when I pay the doctor's bills.\n\nI am Yours with respect,\n\nMary Moffitt\n\nP.S. I find I have not destroyed Miss Hadjivan's last letter to include it in your periodical, after which it can be considered for the waste basket.\n\n---\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMiss Bonnet of Spanish forwarded your letter No. 8-1-1 to me. I was surprised to learn that Miss Hadjivan is not giving satisfaction at Mr. McKeal, the Inspector, and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9t had written generally of her during October.\n\nFrom past experience, I am inclined to take Mr. Pette's views with some discount, especially as he is new at Indian work and there has been some friction between him and Miss Hadjivan when she would...\nnot consent to his taking a man-\nual training desk from Cape Croker\nto Port Elgin School in doing which\nshe thought as the desk could not\nbe spared.\n\nLast spring Miss Hadjiwan helped\nSr. Cadot with the classes in Christian\nDoctrine after school and the\nchildren all liked her. She also\nhad great influence over the larger\ngirls so thought if given a fair\nchance she would develop into\na good teacher.\n\nThe Doctor says he cannot give\na definite answer at this early\ndate, but would advise me not\nto return to Cape Croker in January\nI shall follow his advice as I\nask three weeks' leave of absence ex-\ntended to July when I shall either\nnotify you of my return to Cape\nCroker or send my resignation.\n\nPerhaps you are not aware that\nyears ago when the Indian Council\nat Cape Croker voted to have NOT\nSchool a Separate School, the\nIndian Department did not con-\nsent but instead said the selection\nof the teacher would be subject\nto the Catholic Missionary. So\nin case you decide to replace\nMiss Hadjiwan, Sr. Cadot should\nbe notified and requested to\nsecure the services of a com-\npetent teacher.\n\nAs the people get to know freely\nwith all their complaints he\nmay be able to give you some\ninformation concerning present\naffairs.\n\nAs I have been as long at Cape\nCroker no teacher will give satisfa-\nction & everyone until parents\nand pupils are accustomed\n& change which will take time.\nOttawa, November 8, 1929.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, relative to the services of Miss Nadjiwan, who was appointed as substitute teacher at the Cape Croker Indian Day School during your illness.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of Miss Nadjiwan continuing as teacher during your absence, which may be for the balance of the present school year, ending June 30th, next. When she becomes more familiar with the work her services and influence with the Indian pupils will doubtless improve. We are advising Mr. Agent Poste that Miss Nadjiwan is to remain during your absence.\n\nIt is noted that you are unable to state when your health will have sufficiently recovered for you to resume duties, but that it will be at least the end of January, next, and probably not before the end of the present school year. Leave of absence will be continued, and, as stated, Miss Nadjiwan can carry on the work until the end of the present school year should you not be able to resume duties before that time. I hope, however, to learn that your health is gradually improving and that you will be able to resume duties earlier than you at present anticipate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Mary Moffitt,\n1074 St. Hubert St.,\nMontreal, P.Q.\nOttawa, November 5, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe department has received a communication from Miss Mary Moffitt, teacher of the Cape Croker Indian Day School, in which she states that it may not be possible for her to resume duties before the end of January, next, and probably not before the end of the present school year. The Department is extending her leave of absence until her health has recovered and she is able to resume duties. In the meantime, Miss Hadjiwan is to continue as teacher. It is hoped that as she becomes familiar with the work her services as substitute teacher at this school will be satisfactory. I have to request that you will give her any assistance you can in her work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. C. Poste, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCape Croker, Ont.\nMr. R.J. Ferrier\nDept. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI must thank you for your letters R-1-1 and 8-3-1 of Nov. 8th.\n\nI think it a wise plan to approve of Miss Hadjiwan continuing as teacher in Cape Croker School. She will have a fair trial and I will be surprised if she does not succeed as well as any white girl would under the same conditions.\n\nThere is a good No. 1 or Entrance Class; but owing to the broken families during the war time there only\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6121, File 383-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\none class between Jr. D and Sr. D, and it consists of the most un-\npromising set of boys I ever came across. It looks as if some of them\nnever obeyed anyone outside of school. Motherless homes of some and the\nirresponsible character of all have not helped their improvement so\nmuch should not be expected of their teacher. The first and second\ngrades, however, are up to normal and should do well.\n\nThe information about the working bench you give me in\nletter 8-3-5 does not agree with what Mr. Hadjivan wrote which\ngave me the impression that Mr.\nPaste had first proposed the trans-\nfer of the desk to which she\nobjected and that her suggestion that\nthe Department be asked to supply\nworking desks for Port Elgin was\nsupported by Mr. Couley & Mr. Grace who\nwere present at the time. The only\nway I can explain this discrepancy\nis that perhaps Mr. Couley asked her\nif they were using the desks at\nthe time. Her answer could only\nbe \"no\" as I did not teach manual\nwork of this kind during the season\nfor garden work and the first\ntwo months of school. After\nexperimenting I found it more\nadvantageous to give extra time\nto this work during the winter\nmonths when the little ones\nare absent.\n\nTo you the question of three new\nteachers in Port School and not in\nthe other two schools may be new,\nbut not done. It has been taken up\nby our new teacher at Port Elgin school\nfor some past years. When they be-\ncame too personal in their comments\nI found the only way to quiet them\nwas to tell them to qualify them-\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6121, File 383-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nas there are only three iron plates in No. School. There are four wooden plates, not more than nothing because as long as we have them we cannot ask for others. Had I known the business methods of the Agents then as well as I do now I would not have accepted them when they were sent to the school as they were not the kind I had asked for. I learned too late from the Agent who purchased them that they were not the kind the Department had authorized but he thought they would do. This is a depression but it may help to explain matters in view of the exception of Mr. Moore. Have found Agents as a rule were not careful in studying the interests of the schools.\nSaler thank you for extending my leave of absence, the length of which I cannot foresee at present though I must admit it is rather perplexing to think that the cause of the absence could have been prevented had I not placed too much confidence in the wisdom of doctors.\n\nWith respect I remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMary Moffitt.\nOttawa, March 31st, 1930.\n\nMadam:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector McCool's report on his visit to the Cape Croker Indian Day School on the 5th inst., and I regret to note that the Inspector refers to a lack of thorough work and that he also mentions that the discipline in the school is not satisfactory.\n\nThe Cape Croker Indian Day School has always been one of our best Indian Day Schools and the Department will expect that you put forth every effort to maintain its standing.\n\nThe course of studies for Ontario schools should be closely followed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Violet Nadjiwan,\nTeacher--Indian Day School,\nCape Croker, Ontario.\nDr. Duncan Campbell Scott,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nMrs. Margaret Warder, who has been teaching on the Cape Croker Indian Reserve, has been asked to resign and vacate her residence by the Agent, Mr. Poste. Mrs. Warder has written me regarding what she considers to be very unfair treatment in being turned, with her Mother and her children, out of the house in the dead of winter, and claims that during the year in which she has been teaching at the Sidney Bay School, on the Cape Croker Reserve, that Mr. Moore, the former Inspector, had been well pleased with her work.\n\nAt the time of Mr. Moore's transfer to the Muncey Reserve he wrote Mrs. Warder a letter expressing his satisfaction with her teaching, which letter she prizes very highly.\n\nNo doubt Mr. Poste will make a report to you giving his reasons for the dismissal of Mrs. Warder, and it probably will be found that he had ample justification for his action. Personally, I have a feeling that she has been very indiscreet in allowing her name to become associated with that of a very clever Indian by the name of Lawrence Keeshig. Keeshig came to see me on her behalf and told me that Mrs. Warder, who was ill, had asked him to take her school for her during her illness, and had suggested that he stay at her house with her.\nDr. Duncan Campbell Scott,\n\nfamily during the time he was relieving. I gave Keeshig a good scolding for being a party to such an idiotic course of action, and told him that he was practically responsible for any trouble which Mrs. Warder had gotten into.\n\nI also wrote Mrs. Warder and suggested to her if she wanted a substitute she should have discussed the matter with the Agent.\n\nIn writing Mrs. Warder, I also stated that I would write you and ask you to have someone investigate the occurrence, and it were found, on investigation, that the Agent had acted hastily, I was quite satisfied that you would be only too glad to make amends.\n\nThis is all I can say regarding the matter. They are altogether a queer lot, and I am not inclined to either confirm or criticize the action of the Agent, but as Mrs. Warder is the sole support of her Mother and either two or three children one must consider the humanitarian side of the question.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6121, File 383-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nJanuary 10th, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Malcolm,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of January 8th, with reference to Mrs. Margaret Warder and affairs on the Cape Croker Indian reserve.\n\nI wished to be satisfied that no injustice was being done to this teacher and I ordered a special investigation on January 4th. My officer left on the 7th, and was to conduct an investigation on Wednesday of this week and following days if necessary. I will have pleasure in sending you a report as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHon.

The Department has since received her resignation and has accepted it to take effect on the 31st instant.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHonourable James Malcolm,\nMinister of Trade and Commerce,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 12, 1930.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on my recent visit of inspection to the Cape Croker Agency.\n\nCAPE CROKER INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nMiss Violet Nadjiwon, an enfranchised Indian girl holding a second class certificate, is supplying for Miss Moffat at this school. Her services are apparently not very satisfactory. Attendance is poor, the roll has decreased since Miss Nadjiwon assumed duty. Several families complain that their children were not making any progress, rather that they were going back and have taken them from this school and are sending them to the other two schools. Miss Nadjiwon does not appear to be deeply interested in her work; discipline in the class room is poor. Her attitude of indifference and superiority to the pupils' parents has alienated their respect for her. It is stated that she smokes before the pupils in the school grounds and this is not appreciated by the parents. I was unable to see Father Cadot he had gone to Christian Island, but I am informed that he is very much disappointed in Miss Nadjiwon's work as a teacher. From the attitude of the Indians towards her, I believe it would be unwise to retain the services of Miss Nadjiwon after the closing of the school for summer holidays.\n\nThos, McGookin.\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, June 6th, 1930.\n\nMadam,\n\nI shall be pleased if you will inform the Department at an early date whether you will be able to resume duties as teacher of the Cape Croker Indian Day School when this school reopens after the coming summer holidays, on or about September first, next. I regret that it will be necessary to dispense with the services of Miss Violet Ma\u00e2jiwan, who has been acting as substitute teacher during your absence, at the end of the present school year as her work has been unsatisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

He states that the attendance is poor and that the enrolment has decreased since Miss Nadjiwan assumed duties, also that the discipline in the classroom is poor. In view of the reports received from Mr. Inspector McGookin and the Public School Inspector regarding the work performed by Miss Nadjiwan, the Department is not prepared to retain her services after the coming summer holidays and I have to request that you will inform her accordingly.\n\nThe Department is communicating with Miss Moffitt to ascertain if she will be able to resume duties when the school reopens after the coming summer holidays and, if not, you will be further advised regarding the obtaining of the services of a teacher to commence duties at the beginning of the next school year.\n\nPlease have Miss Nadjiwan prepare her quarterly report for the current quarter showing the attendance, days taught, etc., and forward same to the Department at the end of the present month in order that payment of the salary due her can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The doctor thinks I should be under his surveillance for some time and Cape Croker is too far away to take an occasional trip to Montreal.\n\nI had intended to resign, but believe it will be better for the present, if you approve, to have my leave of absence extended owing to the fact that most of the household furnishings is mine.

If she does not do so, the Department will be obliged to dispense with her services.\n\nMrs. Poste has, no doubt, showed you the official letter of the 18th instant with reference to tooth brush drill and it is hoped that the difficulty that occurred regarding this will be overcome.\n\nI may add that Miss Fex has the necessary qualifications and has successfully taught in several other Indian day schools.

Father Cadot stating that on my last visit to the Indian School at Cape Croker I told Mr. Thomas Jones that Miss Fex had no qualifications for teaching. On my last visit to Cape Croker School, I drove through the Village both to and from the school without speaking to any person, and I have no recollection whatever of speaking to Mr. Jones about Miss Fex. Chief Charles Jones wrote a letter to me asking for the qualifications of Miss Fex and I replied to him that she had a Lower School certificate from High School, but that would not allow her to teach in a Public School. I did not state that she was not qualified to teach in an Indian School. As a matter of fact, she has better qualifications than two of the Indian teachers on the Saugeen Reserve. I do not mind if my letter to Chief Jones be shown to Miss Fex, as there is nothing in it not in accordance with facts. There is this to be said in favor of Miss Fex, that she takes great interest in the school and the children, much more than many teachers in the public schools.\n\nThe situation appears to me that some are not satisfied with Miss Fex and wish to weaken her position and work through the inspector.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6121, File 383-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nWalkerton, Ont.\nDecember 31st, 1931.\n\nThomas Jones, Esq.,\nCape Croker, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have seen a letter written to Rev.

During that season, her father Louis Lamorandiere, was here on a visit, and expressed himself as very dissatisfied with his daughter's progress. Before he left in the New Year, quite apart from myself, he made arrangements with Miss Edington to have his daughter enrolled as a pupil at No. 2, Sidney Bay School, where she is still studying. Irene is in the entrance class, and on enquiry from Miss Edington, she reports that the girl is progressing favourably with her studies, and has a good chance of passing her entrance examinations next June, providing she continues to apply herself as she is doing at present.\n\nIf, after this report, the Department considers that Irene should return to Depot Harbour, where her father is residing, please advise me, and I will make the necessary arrangements for her return.\n\nSecretary,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6121, File 383-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, February 16th, 1933.\n\nSir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the daughter of Louis Lamorandiere.\n\nIt is noted that this girl is now attending the Sidney Bay Indian Day School.

In this connection it is noted that arrangements can be made for the transfer of Miss Burke from her present position at Lake Helen to take charge of the Cape Croker Indian Day School for the coming academic year.\n\nThe Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Burke at Cape Croker; to begin duties when the school re-opens after the present summer holidays on September 5th next. The salary allowed her at Cape Croker will be at the same rate as was paid Miss Fox viz.: $26 per teaching month, less 10% during the present fiscal year. This is the rate of salary provided in our Estimates for this school. I would request that you arrange with Miss Burke to take up duties on the date mentioned.\n\nWe are informing the local Indian Agent, Mr. A. C. Poste, of the approval granted for the appointment of Miss Burke and requesting him to give her every assistance possible in her duties at this school. It is hoped that she will have the same success in her work at Cape Croker as she has met with at the other Indian schools where she taught.\n\nAs Miss Burke will be retiring from the work at Lake Helen, I would request that you nominate at an early date, a teacher to succeed her at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Jermyn for the position as teacher at the No. 1 School on the Cape Croker reserve, I have to say that, in the past, the nomination of a teacher for this school has been in the hands of the Hardene Sisters, a Teaching Order of the Roman Catholic Church. During the past 20 years or more, this Order have furnished teachers, members of the Order, for this school.\n\nMiss Fox, who taught this school last year, has retired, and the Sisters nominated Miss Sadie Burke to succeed her. The appointment of Miss Burke has been approved. She is a member of the above named Order. Therefore, there will be no vacancy in the No. 1 School on the Cape Croker reserve to which Mr. Jermyn could be appointed.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\nR.R.3, Owen Sound, Ont.\nAugust 3, 1933.\n\nSuperintendent Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 31st ultimo with regard to school teacher vacancy at Cape Crocker Reserve I may say that I have been informed that there is at present a vacancy there.

The change in teacher for the next school year consisted of the transfer of one of the members of the Order, Miss Sadie Burke.

The Public School Inspectors who have inspected these schools report the services of the teachers to be satisfactory. The only school where a change in teacher for the academic year beginning September first, next, might be considered is Scotch Settlement, on the Saugeen reserve. The certificate of the present teacher at this school, Malcolm McIvor, has expired. However, the Inspector states that his services have been satisfactory.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report to you motion No. 2, passed by the Cape Croker council, at their regular meeting held here July 2nd, Chief Johnston and three councillors present.\n\nMoved by S.

Carried.\n\nNote - I beg to report to the Department, that during the recent visit of Mr. Inspector McGookin to this Reserve, the matter of an assistant teacher for the Cape Croker Day School, was talked over with him, Chief Johnston and myself. The school is a very heavy one, about 45 on the roll, with probably additional pupils after the holidays, and it is felt that the hall known as St. Mary's Hall, near the present school, would accommodate the kindergarten pupils, in the event of the Department granting an assistant teacher. Should this plan be carried out, it would be necessary to supply seats, desks, etc., and other equipment.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDept. of Ind.

Our council has been promised to use the hall along side of the school to accommodate the extra pupils.\n\nAll the parents whose children are attending this school would be most grateful if assistance was given so that their children may have a chance to forge right ahead which is not possible under present conditions.\nIf you could convince the Educational Authorities the necessity of our request, it would relieve the anxiety, not only the parents, but of the teacher as well.\n\nSince the teacher (Miss Burke) has been pleading for an assistant,\n\nNo doubt you will wonder why our Indian Agent does not look after this matter. Well in our experience here they don't seem to pay any attention to him down at Ottawa otherwise I would not be appealing for assistance elsewhere.\n\nHoping to be enlightened on this matter I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohnston\n(Chief)\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nOTTAWA\nJune 17, 1936.\n\nDr. H.

The Department is endeavouring, however, to secure the permission of His Excellency in Council to pay Indian day school teachers at a flat rate of $15 per month for the 10 teaching months. This proposed arrangement is for the present fiscal year only.\n\nFor the last fiscal year, ended March 31st, you were paid a bonus at the rate of $189 per annum, payable in quarterly payments. This year, if authority is received for the proposed arrangement, you will receive a bonus of $15 per teaching month, as follows: June quarter, $45; September quarter, $15; December quarter, $45; and March quarter $45. For the June quarter you were overpaid $2.25, and this amount will be deducted from your salary for the quarter ending 30th September.\n\nI am pleased to inform you that the Deputy Superintendent General has directed that your salary be increased to $800 per annum as from the first of July, 1922.

She will begin duties on or about September 5th and will be allowed salary at the rate of $95 per teaching month, less 10% during the present fiscal year. I have to request that, when she takes up duties, you will give her every possible help and also continue to assist her in the work during the period she is at this school.\n\nThe Department has also received an application from Mr. Jermyn, and he is being informed that we will be unable to utilize his services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Owing to a ruling of the Treasury Board and the Auditor General, this Department has no option in granting an increase over the rate provided. I might point out that this was the salary allowed Miss Fox. I regret not being in a position to increase your salary to the same rate as you received at Lake Helen; but, owing to the regulations mentioned above, it will not be possible to do so.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

I have searched everywhere and can find no trace of it. I have also phoned the neighbouring banks and have been assured that it has not been presented for payment, and if it should be, it will not be cashed. Would it be possible for the Department to issue another cheque for the same amount? Perhaps this request seems ridiculous but I shall be grateful if you will kindly write and let me know.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSadie J. Burke.\nOttawa, May 23, 1934.\n\nDear Madam,-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 20th instant reporting that your salary cheque for the month of April had been destroyed, I am inclosing a bond form.

I have been wondering if it could have been forged. Will you kindly let me know if the blank cheque was returned to the Department. In this case, of course, enclosing a document would be null.\n\nIf it is OK, would you kindly have cheque sent to Spanish as I shall be leaving here.\non or about July 2nd, and might not receive it before I go.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSadie J.
