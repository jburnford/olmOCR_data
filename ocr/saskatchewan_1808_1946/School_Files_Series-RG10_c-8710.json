Palmer\nAgent\nOffice of the Hobema Indian Agency,\nHobema, Alta., Dec. 29th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 1064, amounting to $118.30 in favour of E.N. Moyer Company Ltd., Edmonton, Alta., for School desks purchased for the Ermineskin's Res. School, Hobema, Alta.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 112-1-5, dated Nov. 21st, 1932.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to report on an inspection of the Hobbema Residential School, which was made a few days ago while inspecting the Agency there. At the time of my inspection the children in residence there were just getting over an epidemic of influenza, practically everyone in the school, including the sisters had been sick in bed. During my visit at the School I looked over the building, visited the classroom, and enquired into the general management of this institution. There were 146 children in residence, there are four class rooms in the school, and the work performed in the class rooms seemed to be very satisfactory, but as this school has just been recently inspected by Mr. Scoffield, of the Provincial Department of Education, I shall not deal with the class room work.\n\nThe girls attending this school get a very good training in the way of cooking, sewing, making butter etc. Practically all the clothing used in the school is made by the girls under the supervision of the sisters, and I was well impressed with this part of the work. The boys however, get very little training in the way of outside work, as there is practically no farming carried on by this institution. This is regrettable, as this Agency is situated where the Indians must make their living by farming and stock raising.\nThe school raises a good garden, with 220 bushels of potatoes, 30 bushels of carrots, and an abundance of turnips, cabbages, beans, peas and corn. They have 16 milk cows, 14 of which are milking, 3 calves, 1 bull and 2 horses. The calves are evidently traded off to Indians for work etc. 866 pounds of butter was made during the summer holidays, and milk, cream and butter are fed to the children, as nothing is sold off the place. They have 125 chickens and about 20,000 eggs were purchased besides. They didn't thrash any grain on the farm but they got about 25 tons of green feed. The children are well looked after at this institution. Well fed, well clothed, and in going over the stock of clothing on hand I noted that there were several changes for each child.\n\nThe school building has been described on several occasions. Two additions have been put on the original building. Floors, stairways etc., in the old part are getting badly worn and will have to be replaced. The sisters of course brought this to my attention and wanted to know if the Department would assist them to buy the material to put in new steps in the stairway, and do some repairing to the flooring, and I informed them that at the present time the department had no funds. Everything inside the school was in first class condition spotlessly clean.\n\nAnytime I visit this institution it always comes to my mind what a terrible thing it would be if a fire was to start in this building, as it would certainly go up in flames in a very short time. However, every precaution has been taken in the way of fire escapes, and a night watchman is employed.\nIn conclusion I wish to point out that as far as it is possible under present conditions the school is doing splendid work, and is satisfactory in every way, with the exception of the outside work for the boys who are attending the school. Under present arrangements however, I do not expect that this can be changed, as the school has very little land and no farming equipment whatever. The school authorities are hoping however, that the Department will take steps soon to replace this institution with a new school. I pointed out to the principal that this was doubtful for a few years under present circumstances.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nM. Christianson\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, January 4, 1937.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nMr. Inspector Christianson has forwarded his report on his recent inspection of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. The Department is pleased to note that conditions generally at this school are satisfactory and that the work in the classrooms is progressing, also that the girls, especially, are receiving good training in the way of cooking, sewing and making garments.\n\nThe Inspector states, however, that the boys receive little training in the way of outside work, as there is practically no farming carried on at the school other than gardening operations. The Department will be pleased if you will arrange that during the spring and summer months the boys may get every opportunity to assist in the work of gardening and in the care of the stock. As much instruction as possible should be given the boys in gardening and general farm work, in order that, when they leave school, they will have a knowledge of the work.\n\nThe Inspector also states that, owing to the construction of the buildings, there is a certain danger of fire. He states that every precaution is being taken and that the services of a night watchman are employed. Please inform the Department if the night watchman is supplied with a watchman's clock and if he makes regular rounds of the building during the nights. It is hoped you will see that every precaution is taken and that no rubbish is allowed to accumulate near the furnaces.\n\nI shall be pleased to have a full report at your convenience regarding the outside work you are able to arrange to have the boys perform, and also with respect to the precautions taken to prevent fire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. P. Moulin, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nErmineskin Indian Res. School,\nHobbema, Alta.\nOttawa, January 4, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 404-11 of the 25th ultimo, reporting on your recent inspection of the Ermine-skin Indian Residential School. The Department is pleased to note that insofar as possible, under present conditions, the school is doing splendid work.\n\nWe are communicating with the Principal with the request that he give the boys every opportunity to receive training in outside work, such as gardening, care of stock and general farm work. We are also taking up with him the question of doing everything in his power to overcome any danger of fire occurring, and to use every precaution he can to overcome any fire hazard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\nSir:-\n\nIn connection with my report on the Hobbema school, I would like to know if the Department would consider spending say about $200.00 for repairs on this building next summer. As I pointed out in my report some of the stairs and floors need repairing, also whether the Department would furnish a Sulky Plow. This has been asked for before.\n\nThe principal informed me he did not have the funds to put out on repairs for the building at the present time, or to buy any farming equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, January 10, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, requesting to be informed if the Department would provide an expenditure of approximately $200 to carry out repairs to the stairs and floors of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School during the coming summer, also to supply a sulky plow.\n\nFor your information, I may say that certain provision is being made in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year for repairs to this building, but, at the present time, I am not in a position to state whether same will be finally approved or not. I would suggest that this matter be drawn to the attention of the Department early next spring, when full particulars should be given as to the repairs required to be undertaken and the approximate cost of any material and labour required.\n\nRegarding the supplying of a sulky plow, I may say that we have no funds for this purpose at the present time. A request for this equipment should be forwarded in due time next spring, after our Appropriation for the next fiscal year is available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Palmer,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nErmineskin's Residential School,\nHobbema, Alberta. Jan.19th. 1933.\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have received your letter on the report of Inspector Mr. Christianson.\n\nWe know very well the danger of fire and we take as far as we can all precautions to prevent a fire; that is: 1st. to have the children proud of their school and to be very friendly with the staff.\n\nWe have Mr. George Rogier as our night watchman. He is on his 3rd. year at this work. He has been supplied from the office at Regina with a clock and we bought a supply of paper dials. Every night he makes at least four rounds through all the parts of the school building; from the basement to the top floor and outside the building. He goes especially to the furnace department where he attends to the fire, and in the kitchen.\n\nHis hours are at 10 o'clock, it is about 1/2 an hour after the retirement of the staff; then at about midnight, finishing at half past twelve. Before 2 o'clock he is on the walk, and then again at about 4 o'clock. At five, the Rev. Sisters are up and take up the watch of the building. Mr. Rogier goes outside before retiring to bed. He takes only 3 or 4 days a year to visit his family, but then he is replaced by another person.\nThe older boys in winter are sawing wood and piling it. They help to store the coal.\n\nEvery day 5 boys go to the stable, to milk the cows, clean the stable and spray the manure on the field. They are shown the way to feed the cows and other cattle and the horses.\n\nIn Spring time, again the oldest work in the garden, prepare the ground. We have all the vegetables and generally a very nice garden taking the admiration of our visitors. We have a few acres about 3 or 4 for potatoes and there again we have the help of the boys for all the work. They help also in our field, where we raise greenfeed or a little grain, about 40 acres in cultivation.\n\nI would like very much to have a new school, fire proof; and a larger patch of land for more grain and more cattle. But I know it is not quite the time to ask the Indian Department for it. If we had it I think we could in a very short time have from 175 to 200 hundred pupils.\n\nI remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nReceived from Rev. P.P.

Then hook one end of the spring into the clip and one end into the hole in the idler arm and put on the belt. The lower side of the belt should be on the lower pulley.\n\nThe belt as received is the proper length; the slack is taken up by the spring idler pulley; this is necessary in order to allow the machine to gradually attain its proper speed, which should take approximately three minutes.\n\nIf, for any reason, the power is shut off before the operation is completed, the machine can be run by hand with the crank, which may remain on the machine for immediate use.\n\nThe tight and loose pulleys are 4 inches in diameter and should turn 565 revolutions per minute.\n\n**Figure No. 31**\n\n**Universal Drive with direct engine connection**\n\nThe electric motor drive is the most convenient wherever electric power is available. The current required is so small that it may be obtained from any electric light socket.\n\nAs shown in figure No. 32, this outfit comprises an electric motor (specially built for this work), a drip shelf with extension to support the motor, a pinion shaft pulley and an idler arm, spring and pulley similar to the ones used in the universal drive.\n\nThe action of the belt tightening idler pulley is the same in starting this outfit as when starting with a universal drive. It allows the motor to reach full speed in a few seconds, but the separator cannot fail until only after about 3 minutes, thus preventing excessive strain on either the motor or the separator. With this outfit the hand crank may remain on the machine and the separation carried on if the power fails.\n\nIn ordering an electric motor outfit always give the information as directed on page 16.\n\n**ATTACHING ELECTRIC MOTOR EQUIPMENT**\n\nTo attach the electric motor outfit, remove the pinion shaft protecting cap and replace the drip shelf with the new one. Place the idler arm on the frame hub and then put on the pulley, fastening it with the set screw. Put on the motor and belt, connect the wires and the machine is then ready for operation.\n\n**Figure No. 32**\n\n**HOW TO FIGURE PULLEYS**\n\nThe tight and loose pulleys on the universal drive attachment are 4 inches in diameter and should run 565 revolutions per minute to give the correct speed to the separator. The driving pulley should not be less than 3 inches wide and its diameter should be determined as follows:\n\nTo determine the correct size pulley when driving from an engine or shaft direct to the universal drive, multiply the size of pulley on the universal drive (4 inches) by its speed (565) and divide it by the speed of the engine or driving shaft.\n\nFor Example:\n\nAssuming that the engine or driving shaft runs 300 revolutions per minute, then\u2014\n\n\\[\n\\frac{565 \\text{ Revolutions per minute of pulley on machine}}{4 \\text{ inch diameter of pulley on machine}} = \\frac{1}{1.3} \\text{ inch diameter of pulley required to drive separator}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2100}{1500} = \\frac{100}{100}\n\\]\n\nIf it is desired to drive the universal drive from a counter-shaft which is driven from an engine, then, by multiplying the engine pulley diameter by its speed and dividing by the required speed of the counter-shaft will give the diameter of the pulley driving the counter-shaft.\nFor Example:\n\nAssuming that the counter-shaft should run 300 revolutions per minute, driven by an engine having a 6 inch pulley running 300 revolutions per minute, then\u2014\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{6} = \\text{Revolutions per minute of pulley on engine}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1800.0}{6.0} = \\text{inch diameter of pulley required to drive counter-shaft}\n\\]\n\nCommercial pulley sizes are all even inches, so in case, an odd size pulley develops from formula given above, the next larger size pulley, (for first formula) and next smaller size pulley (for second formula) should be used, as it is better to drive the separator a little too fast than a little too slow.\n\nWe do not manufacture or handle commercial pulleys or hangers. These are usually obtained from the local hardware dealer.\n\nHOW TO ORDER POWER DRIVE EQUIPMENT\n\nThe user must decide which equipment best suits his condition and in ordering, give all information possible as to kind of power, engine, speed, etc. If you are in doubt we will gladly answer any questions.\n\nThese attachments are sold as an extra and each one is packed complete with all parts necessary to make the change. No allowance is made for return of parts replaced.\n\nINFORMATION NEEDED WHEN ORDERING MOTOR EQUIPMENT\n\n1.\u2014Is the current direct or alternating?\n2.\u2014If direct give voltage.\n3.\u2014If alternating, give the number of cycles, phases and voltage.\n4.\u2014If you have a Farm Light and Power outfit simply state the name of outfit.\nThe Indian Agency,\nHOBEMA, Alta.,\nNov. 2, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter 112-1-5, of the 17th ultimo, regarding a new cream separator, for the Erminskin residential school,\n\nThis matter was delayed owing to the fact that the agent was to give me a letter with details of the separator required. This has not yet come to hand, but the Rev. Mother gave me the figure quoted to her. No. 16 De Laval separator, figure no. 33 (thirty-two) in the enclosed catalog.\n\nThe price of the separator is $126.00 and the electric motor attachment is $55.25, totalling $181.25. On this there is a discount of $18.10, also an allowance on their old separator of $18.15, bringing the cost of the separator to $145.00 exactly.\n\nThe school authorities are most anxious to get this separator and the attachment, and I would recommend the same.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCol. R. H. Palmer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRHP:BP\nOttawa, November 10, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, regarding the request of the Principal of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School to be supplied with a cream separator and enclosing a catalogue giving particulars as to the type required and the price. In reply I regret that, as our Appropriation this year was extremely limited and has now been practically assigned, we will have no funds to provide the cost of supplying a cream separator at this time.\n\nWith reference to the request of the Rev. Sister Superior, which she handed to Mr. Sutherland during his visit to the school at the end of September last, that a number of school desks, front and rear seats, also a teacher's desk and chair be supplied, I regret that in this connection, also, there will be no funds to pay the cost of the equipment.

The school authorities advised me that they did not have funds to replace the floors, &c., and I was wondering whether the Department would have any funds for this purpose.\n\nThe size of the boys' dormitory is 38' X 20' and the dining room 42' X 25'. If the Department did not have funds to replace both these floors the dining room needs it more than the dormitory. The two floors will take approximately 2260 feet. I did not measure the steps of the two stairs, but this would not take very much as there is quite a low ceiling in the basement. These repairs are not, of course, necessary until the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

The class rooms are well accommodated with these new materials.\n\nSister Superior is really proud of her desk.\n\nOur most sincere thanks for the favors granted,\n\nGratefully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE.\n\nPB CALGARY, ALTA... February 27th, 1934.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to report on an inspection of the Hobbema Indian Residential School made during the time I was at the Agency recently. I visited all classrooms, but as the Provincial School Inspector reports on this work I shall not dwell on this phase of the matter. There were 149 children on the roll, but only 139 present at the time of my visit; 64 boys and 75 girls.\n\nThe children all looked exceptionally well and there was no sickness in the school. They are well dressed and have a good supply of clothing. I checked this up very closely and found that the boys have four changes of clothing and two pairs of shoes. They wear fleece-lined underwear in the winter and those who do outside work are supplied with woollen underwear. The girls each have six dresses, two coats \u2014 one for Sunday and one for every-day \u2014 and three pairs of shoes. Their underwear is made out of flannellette. In winter time both boys and girls wear heavy shoes and woollen stockings that are knit at the school.\n\nI also went into the matter of the food supplied to\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOTTAWA.\nthe children and came to the conclusion that they were well fed. They have a lunch at 4 o'clock when school is dismissed. The bread at the school is mostly purchased from Wetaskiwin and delivered right at the school. I do not think this is as satisfactory as if it were made at the school, but they informed me that a certain amount of baking is always done at the school as well.\n\nBUILDING:\nThe building, as the Department know, is not very satisfactory and requires a lot of repairing, but I must say that the staff do everything possible to keep it in good shape. It is kept clean and tidy throughout, and the furnishings are in good condition and seem to be well cared for. The boys' dormitory needs new flooring; also the boys' dining room. Both floors are badly worn and very difficult to keep clean as in many cases they are worn right through to the rough flooring. The steps on the stairs leading down to the basement are also badly worn. I have taken the matter of repairing these floors up with the Department in a special letter.\n\nFARMING:\nThe live stock at this school consists of 15 cows, 2 horses and 2 calves. Thirteen cows were milking at the time of my visit, supplying 24 gallons of milk per day, which is all given to the children.\n\nThe school did not thresh any grain but raised 45 loads of green feed, 250 bushels of potatoes and a lot of other garden truck.\n\nTRAINING OF PUPILS OUTSIDE OF CLASSROOM:\nThe girls milk the cows in the summer but this is done by the boys in winter time. They\ndo all the ironing in the school, and the scrubbing, &c. They make their own clothing and do a lot of fancy-work. I also questioned the sisters regarding the instructions the girls received in cooking, &c., and they assured me that every girl attending the school received a good training in household science, as all of them spent so many days each month in the kitchen and were taught to make bread, cakes, pies, &c., as well as do plain cooking. They pointed out that some of the girls were better than others, and quite a number of them were good cooks. They spend an hour daily in the sewing room until they are 15; after that they generally spend two or three hours there each day until they are 17, and the Sister Superior informed me that the last year the girls were in the school she always endeavoured to give them as much time as possible in the kitchen and sewing room. The girls also help with the garden in the summer time.\n\nThe boys look after the stable and wood, &c., but the training they receive in outside work is very limited as the farming operations at this school are so small. With only 22 head of stock to look after there is not very much activity in this line. In discussing this matter with the Rev. Father Moulin, the Principal, he informed me that the Oblate Fathers intend to take over the school next summer from the Sisters, and as soon as they did the matter of outside training for the boys would receive attention. As the Department know, Father Moulin is simply in charge of the spiritual end of the work, as the Sisters are running the institution.\nSTAFF:\n\nThere are 14 Sisters at the school, two maids and the Rev. Father Moulin; also two men; one who acts as night-watchman and shoemaker; the other as engineer and farming instructor.\n\nI trust this report will be of interest to you.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 112-1-5 of the 26th ult., in connection with the flooring for the Bruneckin's Residential School in the Hobbema Agency, and in reply would say that 2150 feet of edged fir flooring would cost $120.40; 5 rolls plain paper at $1.60 would cost $8.00 and 100 pounds flooring nails $6.65; a total of $135.05.\n\nFather Moulin states that his staff may be able to lay the flooring if supplied, but he would like to have a good carpenter do this work, which would cost approximately $40.00 extra.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

You should, therefore, notify the Principal of the Ermineskins Indian Residential School that the Department will not allow any grant towards the salary of the night watchman after April 30, 1935. Payment of the grant at the same rate as formerly, viz., $40 a month, will be resumed from October 1, 1935, and will be continued until April 30, 1936.\n\nIf the Principal so desires, you may forward a voucher at the end of each month during the period for which this letter authorizes the employment of a night watchman.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

At the time of my inspection there were 147 children in residence, and I must say they all looked real well and seemed healthy and happy.\n\nCLOTHING:\n\nI checked over the supply of clothing and found that both boys and girls had ample clothing and were better provided for than if they were living at home. All were furnished with four and five changes, and everything in that line that could be desired, is looked after.\n\nTRAINING OF CHILDREN:\n\nThe girls at this institution all get an excellent training in domestic science, which fits them very well for the home life on the reserve after they leave school. The only improvement I might suggest is that they bake their bread at the school instead of purchasing it from a bakery as they do now. They informed me, however, that the girls are taught how to bake bread, buns, &c.\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nTraining, (Continued),-\n\nThe Department will recall that in practically all my reports on this school I have mentioned that the boys were getting very little training in outside work in the way of farming and looking after stock, &c. This has been changed during the last year, since the Oblate Fathers took over the management of the school. Father Moulin, the Principal, now has an assistant -- the Rev. Father Boyer -- who looks after all the outside work, and they are endeavouring to extend their farming operations. I was quite pleased to note that a repair shop has been fixed up by Father Boyer -- a make-shift shop which Father Boyer rigged up out of an old building -- but which answers the purpose very nicely, and here the boys are instructed in blacksmithing, repair-work and carpenter work. I was amazed at some of the work they had turned out with such poor equipment. Father Boyer made some requests to provide some extra equipment for the shop, and this is being submitted to the Department in a separate letter, and I trust it will receive the consideration of the Department. The training received by the boys in this shop should be valuable to them after they leave school.\n\nLIVE STOCK & FARMING OPERATIONS:-\n\nThe School have 21 head of cattle, 4 horses (2 of which are very small), some pigs and chickens.\n\nTheir crop last year did not amount\nLive Stock & Farming, (Continued),-\n\nto very much, and their potato crop was also very poor. Father Boyer informed me that he intended to extend their gardening operations, and also farming as much as he possible could this year, and the School authorities asked for some additional assistance in the way of live stock and farm machinery, which I have taken up in a separate letter, and if this cannot be supplied this year, I hope it will be given consideration for next year's estimates, because nothing has been asked for that is not actually required. The Indians now living in the Hobbema Agency have to depend entirely on the products of their reserves for their livelihood, and I am sure the Department will realize how necessary it is for the boys to get a good training in all branches of outside work.\n\nBUILDING:-\n\nI do not think it is necessary for me to go into detail to any extent in this connection, as the Department are well aware that the present building is old and dilapidated, and is one of the worst fire traps that I know of. I must say that it is kept in as good a state of repair as possible, and every precaution is being taken to meet the fire hazard. The Department furnish a night-watchman and fire drill is maintained for the children; The Agent looks after this part of it. The night-watchman carries a clock and the different stations are punched every hour during the night and this is checked up every morning by the Principal and once a month by the Agent.\nBuilding (Continued),\u2014\n\nThe Principal asked for 6 large fire-extinguishers: There are only 3 in the building now. Whether or not this would be of any use I cannot say. As I mentioned to Father Moulin, if there was a fire the main thing would be to get the children out, because if a fire ever got started, fire extinguishers would be of little use. They might be of some use in keeping down the fire while the children were gotten out of the building. I am leaving the matter of supplying these entirely in the hands of the Department.\n\nGENERAL:\u2014\n\nAs the Department are aware, this has always been a fairly good school, that is as far as the educational work carried on. The children are well cared for in every way, and they are well-fed, as I checked up on the food supplies, &c. Father Moulin, the Principal, has been there for a great many years, and is a wonderful missionary amongst the Indians. He is also a man who is very fond of the children and has the respect of the Indians.\n\nThere is a staff of 14 Sisters, the Principal, his Assistance and two lay brothers.\n\nI might bring to the attention of the Department that some of the beds are in very bad shape: They are old and have been repaired many times, and it is practically impossible to do anything with them. The rest of the equipment in the school is in very good shape and certainly properly cared for. I noticed that the furniture in the school and even in the classrooms all looked\nGeneral, (Continued),\u2014\n\nas if it was brand-new, as the Sisters are continually polishing and varnishing the classroom furnishings.\n\nThere is the best of feeling between the school and the agency, and therefore everything is going along fairly satisfactorily.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

I regret, therefore, that it will not be possible to supply the team of horses, a set of harness, four milch cows and a shorthorn bull. When next year's Estimates are being prepared, consideration will be given to including an amount to cover the cost of the above named live stock.\n\nIf the Principal and yourself consider the seed drill, at an approximate cost of $225, and the paint, varnish, etc., for interior decorating, as well as the blacksmith and carpenter shop equipment, are more needful than spending the entire appropriation in the purchase of the above mentioned equipment, etc., the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of the seed drill, the paint and varnish for interior decorating, an anvil, rip saw and hand forge. Purchase of the paint, varnish and blacksmith shop equipment should be made from firms on the approved list. Prices for the seed drill should be obtained from the local agents of manufacturers of farm equipment who are on the approved list, and purchase should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price. Please obtain accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the above authorized supplies, which should be certified in the usual manner and forwarded for payment.\n\nYour report on your inspection of this school has been noted with interest. The Department is pleased that good progress is being made under all circumstances in this old school building. We note that the children are in good health and also that the school authorities intend, this year, to extend their gardening and farming operations. The Department has also noted your remarks regarding the prevention of fire hazard in the building. An order is being placed here for three additional fire extinguishers.\n\nConcerning the condition of the beds in the dormitories, certain funds are available for new equipment. If you will obtain from the Principal and forward a list, stating the number of beds required, as well as their length and width, we might be prepared to supply a reasonable number. It is presumed that new mattresses would be required with any beds supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM.

Nothing has been asked for that is not actually required.\n\nOver and above what is included in the list, they have asked for $50.00 to purchase two cows: This was authorized last summer, but having had hard luck with horses, this money was used to buy more horses, and the cows were not purchased.\n\nI am submitting this requisition for the decision of the Department. I might say the prices quoted on Father Boyer's list are from Gault's, Ltd., Ashdown Hardware, and the Edmonton Paint and Glass, all of which are on the list of wholesale houses in Edmonton.\n\nMy report on this school will go forward in a few days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, May 1st, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your 404-11A of the 25th ultimo regarding repairs required at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School, provision has been made in the current year's appropriation for an amount of $300 for repairs and improvements at this school. You may, therefore, arrange to purchase the equipment mentioned in your letter, the total cost of which, it is noted, is $300.57.\n\nI regret that it will not be possible, this year, to allow the amount of $80 for the purchase of two cows.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

McGill,\nSuperintendent G\u00e9n\u00e9ral,\nAffaires Indiennes, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nCher Dr. McGill,\n\nJ'aime \u00e0 croire que vous avez re\u00e7u mes trois lettres pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes et que j'aurai t\u00f4t ou tard une r\u00e9ponse.\n\nPermettez-moi de revenir \u00e0 la charge au sujet d'un projet dont nous nous sommes plusieurs fois entretenus mais pour lequel je ne vous ai jamais fait de demande officielle par \u00e9crit : il s'agit de la construction d'une \u00e9cole-pensionnat moderne \u00e0 Hobema, Alta., qui remplacerait l'\u00e9difice actuel insuffisant et dangereux.\n\nTout d'abord vous \u00eates parfaitement au courant de la situation puisque vous l'avez souvent d\u00e9plor\u00e9e. Votre pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur, l'hon. Duncan C. Scott, devait y rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re occasion. Il reconnaissait les services inappr\u00e9ciables rendus au D\u00e9partement par cette \u00e9cole qui n'avait pas co\u00fbt\u00e9 un sou au Dominion et qui fonctionnait \u00e0 plein rendement depuis 1859. Malgr\u00e9 deux r\u00e9novations qui furent faites \u00e0 la b\u00e2tisse primitive en 1927 et 1929, elle ne r\u00e9pondait plus au besoin. En 1925 il avait envoy\u00e9 M. Graham, Commissaire des Affaires \u00e0 l'\u00e9ducation, \u00e9tudier l'\u00e9tat des b\u00e2tisses et voir s'il convenait de recommander l'achat au D\u00e9partement. M. Graham avait conclu \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 urgente d'une \u00e9cole moderne \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve du feu.\n\nEn effet d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque l'\u00e9cole \u00e9tait trop petite. Aujourd'hui il y a une bonne quarantaine d'enfants d'\u00e2ge scolaire et en bonne sant\u00e9 qui devraient \u00eatre admis et ne le sont pas faute de place.\n\nMalgr\u00e9 toutes les pr\u00e9cautions que nous pouvons prendre et les services d'un gardien de nuit pendant 4 mois de l'ann\u00e9e, l'\u00e9cole actuelle est un nid \u00e0 feu : elle est toute de bois, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 peintur\u00e9e et repeintur\u00e9e, le moindre commencement d'incendie se changerait vite en conflagration. Sans doute jusqu'ici, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des soins inou\u00efs et une vigilance constante, il n'y a pas eu d'accident ; mais combien de temps encore \u00e9chapperons-nous \u00e0 la menace perp\u00e9tuelle du feu ?\n\nCette \u00e9cole construite il y a 40 ans n'offre pas n\u00e9cessairement toutes les garanties hygi\u00e9niques des constructions modernes ; les sanit\u00e9s y sont moins \u00e0 l'abri de la contagion et des \u00e9pid\u00e9mies. Sans la propret\u00e9 m\u00e9ticuleuse et la pr\u00e9voyance toujours en \u00e9veil des religieuses, l'\u00e9cole serait facilement un danger pour la sant\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 si affaiblie de nos enfants.\n\nCe sont ces raisons, et bien d'autres encore qu'il serait trop long d'\u00e9num\u00e9rer, qui rendent \u00e9vidente la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 \u00e0 Hobema de la construction imm\u00e9diate d'une \u00e9cole moderne \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve du feu. Cette \u00e9cole devrait \u00eatre de dimensions suffisantes pour h\u00e9berger au moins 175 enfants en plus du personnel, si l'on veut que la population indienne catholique des r\u00e9serves environnantes puisse \u00eatre admise \u00e0 recevoir l'\u00e9ducation \u00e0 laquelle elle a droit.\nMay 3rd., 1936.\n\nDr. H. McGill,\nGeneral Superintendent,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill,\n\nI am under the impression that you have received my three previous letters and that sooner or later I shall get an answer.\n\nPlease allow me to make new efforts with regard to a project we talked about several times and for which I have never sent you officially a written request; it is about the construction of a modern boarding school at Hobbema, Alberta, to replace the present building which is inadequate and dangerous.\n\nFirst, you perfectly know the situation as you have often deplored it. Your predecessor, the Honourable Duncan C. Scott, was to remedy to it at the first opportunity. He was aware of the inestimable services rendered to the Department by this school which had cost nothing to the Dominion and which was operating at full capacity since 1896. In spite of two additions made to the first school in 1922 and in 1929, it did not satisfy the need; in 1925, Mr. Scott asked Mr. Graham, Indian Commissioner at Regina, to investigate the state of the buildings, and to see if he could recommend its purchase to the Department. Mr. Graham had come to the conclusion that a modern fireproof school was an urgent necessity.\n\nIn fact at that time the school was too small. To-day about forty school aged children in good health are denied\nadmittance for want of place.\n\nIn spite of all precautions we are taking and the services of a night watchman during seven months of the year, the present school is a fire trap; it is a wooden structure, painted and repainted several times, the least beginning of fire would soon become a conflagration. Undoubtedly up to the present, owing to incessant cares and continuous vigilance, there was not accident; but how long will we still be preserved from the perpetual fire menace?\n\nThis school, built some forty years ago, does not necessarily offer all the hygiene guarantees of modern structures; health is less protected from contagion and epidemic diseases. Without the scrupulous cleanliness and the cautious measures of the nuns, the school would easily be a menace to the health, already impaired of our children.\n\nFor these reasons, and many others which would be too long to enumerate in this letter, it is evidently urgent to build immediately a modern fireproof school at Hobson.

McGill,\nGeneral Superintendent,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill,\n\nI am under the impression that you have received my three previous letters and that sooner or later I shall get an answer.\n\nPlease allow me to make new efforts with regard to a project we talked about several times and for which I have never sent you officially a written request; it is about the construction of a modern boarding school at Hobbema, Alberta, to replace the present building which is inadequate and dangerous.\n\nFirst, you perfectly know the situation as you have often deplored it. Your predecessor, the Honourable Duncan G. Scott, was to remedy to it at the first opportunity. He was aware of the inestimable services rendered to the Department by this school which had cost nothing to the Dominion and which was operating at full capacity since 1896. In spite of two additions made to the first school in 1922 and in 1929, it did not satisfy the need; in 1925, Mr. Scott sent Mr. Graham, Indian Commissioner at Regina, to investigate the state of the buildings, and to see if he could recommend its purchase to the Department. Mr. Graham had come to the conclusion that a modern fireproof school was an urgent necessity.\n\nIn fact at that time the school was too small. To-day about forty school aged children in good health are denied\nadmittance for want of place.\n\nIn spite of all precautions we are taking and the services of a night watchman during seven months of the year, the present school is a fire trap! It is a wooden structure, painted and repainted several times, the least beginning of fire would soon become a conflagration. Undoubtedly up to the present, owing to incessant cares and continuous vigilance, there was not accident; but how long will we still be preserved from the perpetual fire menace?\n\nThis school, built some forty years ago, does not necessarily offer all the hygienic guarantees of modern structures; health is less protected from contagion and epidemic diseases. Without the scrupulous cleanliness and the cautious measures of the nuns, the school would easily be a menace to the health, already impaired of our children.\n\nFor these reasons, and many others which would be too long to enumerate in this letter, it is evidently urgent to build immediately a modern fireproof school at Hobbema. This school should be sufficiently large to accommodate at least 175 children besides the staff, if we want the catholic Indians of the surrounding reserves to receive the education to which they are entitled to.\n\nFurthermore, the new school built on the present school site, a short distance from the Canadian Pacific Railway, on the national highway from Edmonton to Calgary, and to the International boundary, would be to the canadian population, as well as to the numerous tourists, a magnificent evidence of the work done by the Department of Indian Affairs for the Indian children, whose guardian it is on behalf of the Government of Canada.\n\nFinally such a construction in this time of crisis and unemployment would provide a large number of men with work and bread and at a considerable saving to the public treasury on account of the comparatively low cost of manual labour.\n\nMay I add that the nine hundred Indian families who patronize this school unanimously demand for their children a modern structure where health would progress in more hygienic conditions and where lives would be better protected from fire menace.\n\nHoping that you will do your utmost to hasten the realize-\ntion of our wishes and to lessen the anxieties of our heavy responsibilities on account of the circumstances in which our work is done at Hebbema, I beg to remain.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) U.Langlois, O.M.I.\nMay 12, 1936.\n\nDear Father Langlois:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, stressing the need of a new building, to provide accommodation for 175 children and staff, to replace the present old Ermineaskin Indian Residential School building.\n\nI concur in the opinion expressed by you, regarding the condition of the present building, viz.: that it constitutes a fire hazard, is unsanitary and does not provide facilities for pupils and staff.\n\nWhen our Estimates for Indian Education for the current fiscal year were in course of preparation, definite instructions were received to cancel all appropriations for new school buildings. There are no funds available, in either the Appropriation for Indian Education or the Public Works Construction programme, to provide the amount that would be required in the erection of a new and modern fire-proof building. The needs at this point will not be lost sight of, but I am unable, at present, to give any promise when funds will be provided to erect a new school. Mr. Christianson, in a report on his inspection of the present school on the 17th ultimo, states that the building and equipment is kept in good condition by the Reverend Sisters and that he considers, under the circumstances, the school is doing very good work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev.

Father P.P.

For this I am very grateful and offer my most sincere thanks to those who granted it and are still supporting it.\n\nBut I have to say:\n\nIt is a very old building, an inadequate old building. We heard that in other Reserves, such were burnt, and children were lost in the fire. We now wish to have a school like those we have seen on Blood and Blackfoot Reserves or at St. Paul. The Reverend Priest [illegible] Principal, has, for the last ten years told us it was coming soon. But the years are long....\n\nInadequate: the actual capacity of the school is not sufficient. There could be more children at school and we do not like to see them go far away from us.\n\nIn my name and in the name of all the Hobbema Catholic Indians, I ask to hasten the building of a new and modern school on our Reserve, at Hobbema.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\nPB CALGARY, ALTA., June 9th, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to attach hereto 2 resolutions sent to this office by Col. R. H. Palmer, Indian Agent, Hobbema, on behalf of Pany Ermineeskin, chief of that band.\n\nThe first resolution deals with pensions, and that is a matter that is very frequently brought to my attention at all agencies; The Indians are fully aware of what is taking place in White settlements, that all White people over the age of 70 who are indigent are placed on a pension of $20.00 per month, whereas the Indians are only placed on the ration list and very often when they are much older than 70. The ordinary ration is probably worth about $2.00 per month, and where special rations are given these come to a little more. Personally I have always thought the Indians had a fairly good argument, although I have not admitted this to them, and I feel that in a great many cases the old people are not given the consideration they should get and I hope that sometime in the near future the Government of Canada will go into this matter and see what can be done. I might say this is one of the matters that Pany Ermineeskin wanted to take up with the Department at Ottawa personally when he was trying to get down there last winter, and several other Chiefs also had this in mind when they wanted to go to Ottawa; in fact this was to be one of their main requests.\n\nThe second resolution deals with the matter of a new school at Hobbema: The Department are fully aware that the present Ermineeskin School is a bad fire hazard as the Chief states; also it is a very old building, and for a great many years now representations have been made to the Government that a new building is required at this Agency. I can only add that the policy of the Government is to continue boarding schools for the Indians, this is one place where a new school is certainly required. I trust these matters will receive the full consideration of the Department, and that I be advised in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nM.

McMillan,\nSuperintendent General,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nCher Dr. McMillan,\n\nJ'arrive d'un voyage d'inspection \u00e0 l'Ecole Indienne Crowfoot \u00e0 Edmonton, Alta. Vous me permettrez \u00e0 la suite de ce voyage et des constatations p\u00e9nibles que j'y ai faites - constatations dont je vous ai \u00e0 plusieurs reprises entretenus ainsi que votre honorable pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur - d'insister encore une fois sur la pressante n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de la construction d'un local plus moderne, plus commode, plus hygi\u00e9nique et plus s\u00fbr pour la vie des enfants confi\u00e9s par le Canada \u00e0 la sollicitude de votre D\u00e9partement.\n\nLe personnel que j'y ai vu \u00e0 l'Ecole est admirable de d\u00e9vouement, de vigilance, de savoir-faire et d'int\u00e9r\u00eat dans sa t\u00e2che de rel\u00e8vement de la nation indienne jusqu'\u00e0 la hauteur de notre civilisation. Il travaille cependant dans des conditions plut\u00f4t adveres, comme vous ne l'ignorez pas.\n\nIl y a bien des ann\u00e9es qu'une \u00e9cole neuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 promise pour Edmonton, mais j'ai entendu cette promesse sur les l\u00e8vres de M. le Commissaire Graham de Regina, d\u00e8s 1938; l'honorable Macdonald ne l'a renouvel\u00e9e \u00e0 moi-m\u00eame plus d'une fois, et depuis janvier 1939 on n'a cess\u00e9 de me raider que cette \u00e9cole \u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re sur la liste.\n\nJe suis dans le meilleur sens de mon provincialat et le v\u00e9ritable oblige \u00e0 admettre que je n'ai jusqu'\u00e0 rien obtenu qui vaille pour les Indiens sous ma juridiction. J'avais cependant entendu l'espoir de servir avant la fin de mon terme, de faire commencer les travaux d'agrandissement de Chilcotin et de construction d'\u00e9coles dont l'urgence s'attache aux yeux de tout le monde. Il se peut que je n'insiste pas assez, mais je ne vous force pas suffisamment le main-pieds. J'avoue qu'il me r\u00e9jouit d'employer certains proc\u00e9d\u00e9s et de faire jouer certaines influences. Je ne peux pas pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer respecter la libert\u00e9 d'action des officiers sup\u00e9rieurs du D\u00e9partement et leur faire confiance. D'autres ont \u00e9t\u00e9 moins r\u00e9serv\u00e9s que moi et s'en sont mieux trouv\u00e9s.\n\nLoin de moi la pens\u00e9e d'en rejeter le bl\u00e2me sur vous et sur vos aides; les circonstances y sont sans doute pour beaucoup. Toutefois il me semble que notre tour d'\u00eatre aid\u00e9s et secourus devrait \u00eatre ou tard venir.\n\nVeuillez croire \u00e0 mes meilleurs sentiments,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Ben it,\n\nfor Translation,\n\nThree copies please,\n\nIndian Affairs.\nEdmonton, Alta., Feb. 16, 1937.\n\nDr. H. McGill, Esq.,\nSuperintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, etc...\n\nDear Mr. McGill,\n\nI have just returned from an inspection trip to the Ermineskin Indian school at Hobbema, Alta. May I insist that I was once again made aware of the very difficult situation existing there\u2014a situation concerning which I have often written you and your honourable predecessor\u2014and that it has become more than ever necessary to build a more modern, comfortable, hygienic and safer school for the children whose lives are placed in care of your Department by the Dominion of Canada.\n\nThe teachers at this school whom I had occasion to see at work, are wonderfully devoted, watchful and well-educated, and take great interest in their task of rehabilitating the Indians. Nevertheless, as you undoubtedly know, they are working under rather adverse conditions. It is many years ago that a new school was promised for Hobbema; I myself heard Commissioner Graham of Regina promise this as far back as 1926; the honourable Mr. Scott more than once renewed this promise to me personally and since January 1930, I have been told time and again that the school was the first on the list. I have now been Provincial officer in charge for the last 8 years and I must admit that I have yet obtained very little for the Indians under my care. I had hoped, nevertheless, that before the end of my term I might see the work of enlarging the school at Cluny begin and also the construction of a school at Hobbema, the urgent need of which...\nevery one will admit. It may be that I did not insist strongly enough and that I did not sufficiently force your hand in the matter; but I will admit that it is repugnant to me to make use of certain means and to bring certain influences to bear. I have always preferred to respect the freedom of action of the higher officials of the Department and to have confidence in them. Others, less circumspect than I, were better off in the end.\n\nI do not wish you to think for a moment that I am putting the whole blame on you and your assistants; existing circumstances undoubtedly had much to do with it. Nevertheless, it seems to me that our turn to be helped should be about due sooner or later.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) U. Langlois, O.M.I.\nEdmonton, Alta., Feb. 16, 1937.\n\nDr. H.

Gamble,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith further reference to our conversation of the 14th instant, I would ask you to take into consideration and to present to the Honourable Minister the request I made to you the other day, viz.: to build immediately a residence for the Principal and the teachers of the Erminskin Indian boarding-school at Hobbema, Alta.\n\nThe house they now occupy was built of logs about fifty years ago. At different times it was improved and that has made it more or less habitable until this day. We hoped it would stand up until a modern school could be built and which would provide living quarters for the Principal and his staff. But the Government finances compel the Department which you have the honour of serving, to defer until a later date a building proposition which has been promised us and which is so needed, so we are now obliged to ask the Honourable Mr. Gr\u00e9gar not to delay much longer at least the building of a residence for the Principal of Erminskin school and his staff.\n\nTheir dwelling quarters are now falling to pieces. The centre part has no solid foundation and the logs used for the walls are rotten. This house has no modern convenience whatever; no running water, sewer, toilet or furnace; six stoves, heated all winter long, does not prevent water from freezing in the basins during the night. Such lack of comfort and unhygienic conditions are not only hard on the school staff, but they have affected their health, to such an extent that I cannot ask them to spend another winter in a house which is coming apart.\nMr. Christianson, General Inspector of Indian Agencies and Mr. Schmidt, Inspector for Alberta, have found out for themselves all the inconveniences one can experience during the hard winter months in a house such as that and they can confirm my statements.\n\nTo repair this house in order to put it into shape again, would mean an expenditure of many hundred dollars, almost the price of a new one, and it would soon be in the same state again. So that it seems that money spent on repairs would be of no avail.\n\nThere remains the alternative of building a new home for the Principal and his staff; this is what has seemed to be the best solution and that is why I solicit your help as well as I plead your Honourable Minister to be kind enough to grant me this favour. A house could easily be built to fit in with the others which will subsequently be the future residential school of Erminskin. For this reason, Inspector Schmidt may have to be asked to choose a site to correspond with the general plan of the future buildings.\n\nI am told that the financial standing of the Department of Indian Affairs is the great obstacle in the way of this project which would entail an expenditure of from $5,000 to $10,000. We are anxious to prove to you that we understand your difficulties and to convince you of our willingness to come to a favourable solution; I would suggest the following arrangement: The Oblate Fathers would borrow the necessary amount and build this residence under the understanding that the Department of Indian Affairs would reimburse this loan as well as the interest thereon to the Oblate Fathers, either by paying the whole amount next year, or by yearly instalments, according to the agreement.\n\nYou can be assured that I bring this matter to your knowledge only because it is practically impossible for me to ask my missionaries to live much longer in this old house which has not cost a cent to the Department and which we have been happy to put at the disposal of the teachers of the Erminskin school at Hobbema for a period of 50 years.\nI sincerely hope that the Honourable Mr. Gr\u00e9gar, the worthy Minister of Mines and Resources, will give a favourable hearing to my pressing request and that he will make haste to come to the rescue of the Oblate missionaries always willing to cooperate fully with the Department of Indian Affairs in helping the progress of civilization amidst the Indian population of Canada.\n\nPlease accept, dear Mr. Gamsell, my best regard.\n\n(Signed) U. Langlois, O.M.I.,\nProvincial.\nOFFICE OF THE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nThe attached is sent to you for memorandum of recommendation.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, June 30, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER -\n\nRe: Ermineskin Residential School.\n\nI am returning herewith letter, dated Ottawa, June 18, 1937, received by you from Reverend U. Langlois, O.M.I.\n\nI may state that the Ermineskin Residential School is situated on the Ermineskin reserve, approximately 45 miles south of the city of Edmonton, close to the Calgary-Edmonton highway. This school building is one of the oldest residential schools in the country. It is not owned by the government but was built approximately 50 years ago, by the Oblate Order. It has not been purchased by the government. It has, at the present time, a pupilage of 140 and receives from the Department per capita grant of $170. The last report indicates that there are at the school 153 pupils. The staff consists of the principal - Reverend Father Loulin; the Assistant principal - Reverend Father J. B. Boyer; two brothers; one Engineer; and 16 sisters.\n\nThe building to which Rev. Father Langlois refers is a separate building, detached from the educational unit, and has been used as a residence for the principal and the brothers associated with him on the staff. The sisters are provided with accommodation in the main building.\n\nThe departmental records indicate that, for a number of years prior to 1930, it was the policy of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs to either build or purchase from the church authorities at least one residential school.\nschool each year. This policy was abandoned, in the interest of economy. If the policy had been continued, however, the Brineskin School would have been purchased with the object of building a new residential school on the Brineskin reserve during the year 1931. The claims of this school were very carefully reviewed in 1930 and an inspection of the buildings made, with the object of instituting a building programme the next year.\n\nThe pupils in attendance at this school come from the following reserves:\n\n**Hobbema Agency**\n\n| Reserve          | Boys | Girls |\n|------------------|------|-------|\n| Brineskin Reserve| 27   | 33    |\n| Amson            | 33   | 34    |\n| Louis Bulla      | 8    | 11    |\n| Pontana          | 3    | 2     |\n\n**Edmonton Agency**\n\n| Reserve          | Boys | Girls |\n|------------------|------|-------|\n| Enoch Reserve    | --   | 2     |\n\nTotal - 71 boys 82 girls\n\nThese figures suggest that a residential school is necessary at this reserve. In view of the distances and other factors, the ordinary day school or even an improved day school could scarcely be operated successfully in this district. Father Langlois intimates that the Oblate Fathers are willing to borrow the amount of money necessary (approximately $10,000) to build a residence for the Principal and Brothers, on the understanding that he would be reimbursed next year or over a period of years by instalments. He was, no doubt, prompted to make this offer owing to the uninhabitable character of the present residence, which, according to our reports, is in a very unsanitary and dilapidated condition. It should be pointed out, also, that the school itself, owing to its age, has become a real fire hazard.\n\nIt should be pointed out, however, that the\n\n- Government\nGovernment, in its construction of residential schools operated under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church, has never in any case made provision for a principal's residence by the erection of a separate building. In these schools, without exception, an office and living quarters are provided for the principal and the members of the staff in the main building. Such a unit lends itself to more economical operation. It has been considered wise to have the principal in the main building and on hand in case of an emergency. It is important that this fact be kept in mind, in view of the request before us for consideration.\n\nIn view of all the circumstances, I submit for consideration the following recommendations:\n\n1. That a residential school be built on the Ermineskin reserve at the earliest possible date and that an item to cover the cost be included in next year's estimates.\n\n2. That this residential school consist of one unit, equipped for vocational instruction and academic courses, with living accommodation for the principal and all the members of the staff, and that the building be of fireproof construction.\n\n3. That the small appropriation of $550.00, included in this year's estimates be used in an attempt to render the present principal's residence as comfortable as it is possible to make it until the new building is constructed. This may appear to be a waste of money, but I can think of no alternative.\n\nActing Director.\nThe Department records indicate that, for a number of years prior to 1936, it was the policy of the Superintendent General of Indians Affairs to either build or purchase from the church authorities at least one residential school.\nschool each year. This policy was to be based in the interest of economy. If the policy had been continued, however, the building in school would have been purchased. In the object of building a new residence school on the Lincoln reserve during the year 1921. The claims of this school were very strongly reviewed in 1920 and an inspection of the building's name, with the object of instituting a similar program the next year.\n\nThe pupils in attendance at this school are:\n\n| Name       | Age |\n|------------|-----|\n| Mr. Lincoln Reserve | 37   |\n| Mrs. Lincoln Reserve | 38   |\n| Mr. Lincoln Reserve | 40   |\n| Mrs. Lincoln Reserve | 41   |\n| Total      | 126  |\n\nThese figures suggest that a residential school is necessary to this reserve. In view of the distance and other factors, the building has not been used as intended by the school board. The school has been operated successfully in this manner; however, I am unable to state what the Lincoln Fathers are willing to borrow the amount of money necessary (approximately $500) to build a residence for the principal and teachers of the institution which they will be reimbursed for over a period of years by rent fees. We were, however, promised to take his offer only to the unlikelihood of the school being the present residence, which, according to our reports, is in a very unsatisfactory and dilapidated condition. It should be pointed out, also, that the school itself, owing to its age, has become a real fire hazard.\n\nIt should be pointed out, however, that the\nGovernment, in its construction of residential schools operated under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church, has never in any case made provision for a principal's residence or the erection of a separate building.

The claims of this school were very carefully reviewed in 1930 and an inspection of the buildings made, with the object of instituting a building programme the next year.\n\nThe pupils in attendance at this school come from the following reserves:\n\n**Hobbema Agency**\n\n| Reserve          | Boys | Girls |\n|------------------|------|-------|\n| Ermineskin Reserve | 27   | 33    |\n| Samson           | 33   | 34    |\n| Louis Bulls      | 8    | 11    |\n| Montana          | 3    | 2     |\n\n**Edmonton Agency**\n\n| Reserve          | Boys | Girls |\n|------------------|------|-------|\n| Enoch Reserve    | 2    |       |\n\nTotal - 71 boys 82 girls\n\nThese figures suggest that a residential school is necessary at this reserve. In view of the distances and other factors, the ordinary day school or even an improved day school could scarcely be operated successfully in this district. Father Langleis intimates that the Oblate Fathers are willing to borrow the amount of money they may (approximately $10,000) to build a residence for the Principal and Brothers, on the understanding that he would be reimbursed next year or over a period of years by instalments. He was, no doubt, prompted to make this offer owing to the uninhabitable character of the present residence, which, according to our reports, is in a very unsanitary and dilapidated condition. It should be pointed out, also, that the school itself, owing to its age, has become a real fire hazard.\n\nIt should be pointed out, however, that the\n\n- Government\nGovernment, in its construction of residential schools operated under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church, has never in any case made provision for a Principal's residence by the erection of a separate building. In these schools, without exception, an office and living quarters are provided for the Principal and the members of the staff in the main building. Such a unit lends itself to more economical operation. It has been considered wise to have the Principal in the main building and on hand in case of an emergency. It is important that this fact be kept in mind, in view of the request before us for consideration.\n\nIn view of all the circumstances, I submit for consideration the following recommendations:\n\n1. That a residential school be built on the Ermineaskin reserve at the earliest possible date and that an item to cover the cost be included in next year's Estimates.\n\n2. That this residential school consist of one unit, equipped for vocational instruction and academic courses, with living accommodation for the Principal and all the members of the staff, and that the building be of fireproof construction.\n\n3. That the small appropriation of $550.00, included in this year's Estimates be used in an attempt to render the present Principal's residence as comfortable as it is possible to make it until the new building is constructed. This may appear to be a waste of money, but I can think of no alternative.\n\nActing Director.\nMemorandum to: Dr. McGill  \n(Attention of Mr. MacInnes)\n\nI am sending herewith a communication dated June 18 from Bishop Langlois, 9916 - 110th St., Edmonton, Alta.\n\nSubject: Ermineskin Residential School,\n\nThe attached is sent to you for the preparation of a draft reply to Bishop Langlois, as per telephone conversation with Mr. Minnes, for the signature of the Deputy Minister. Please return the correspondence to this office.\n\nIf the information desired is not available within the next 5 days, will you be good enough to advise me when it may be expected.\n\nAugust 5...19...37\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, August 9, 1937.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI have, for acknowledgment, your letter of June 18th and also memorandum containing certain proposals with respect to the construction of a residence for the Principal and members of the male teaching staff at the Kaminaski Residential School, Hobbema, Alberta.\n\nI may state that the subject matter of this communication has been given very careful consideration by the Minister. The Minister was aware, of course, that there was no item in the Estimates for the present fiscal year sufficient to undertake the construction of this building.\n\nIn view of the fact that the log house now occupied by the staff was built fifty years ago and is now in a dilapidated condition, special consideration was given to the proposal submitted by you in the seventh paragraph of your memorandum, in which you state that the Oblate Fathers would be prepared to borrow the sum of $6,000.00 or $10,000.00 and proceed with the erection of the building, on the understanding that the Government would repay this amount either next year or by instalments over a period of years.\n\nThe Minister hesitates to commit the Government to financial obligations that extend into the future. It is felt that the practice of committing the Government to financial obligations without reference to Parliament is constitutionally unsound and exceedingly difficult to justify, even in an emergency. In view of all the circumstances, therefore, we feel that the small appropriation\n\nof \u00a3550.00\n\nVery Rev. U. Langlois, O.M.I.,\n9916 - 110th Street,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nof $550.00 contained in the Estimates of this year for the repair of the Principal's residence should be expended for this purpose, and we have already communicated with the Indian Agent, asking him to proceed with these repairs. It is our hope that the expenditure of this amount will render the residence reasonably comfortable for the coming winter months.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that your request for a new residence at Erinaskin will be given careful consideration when the Estimates for the coming year are under consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister.\nTRANSLATION\n\nERMINESKIN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nHobbema, Alta., July 24, 1937.\n\nMr. P.

This makes a total of $8,000, but, as you understand, authority cannot be given to expend this amount until our appropriation has been approved by Parliament.\n\nIn providing the above amount, it was understood that the primary requirement was a new residence for the staff. However, it appears from the Principal's letter that accommodation for other purposes is more desired.\n\nThe amount of money available will not permit the erection of the buildings suggested by the Principal. The Department would like to see erected a building with full basement and two classrooms; the basement could be fitted up for vocational training for both boys and girls. The erection of such a building would considerably relieve the congestion in the present school. You might consult the Principal and, if he agrees with our decision, a sketch plan will be forwarded for further consideration.\n\nIn the event of the construction of this building,\n\nA.G.B.

The Rev. principal is to send\nin a report and this will be forwarded to the department when\nreceived, with a recommendation. I again visited the school\non the 31st, found everything in good order, I inspected\nthe children in fire drill in the Dormitories and found it\nvery sketchy. I spent about two hours instructing them in\n\"Fire Drill\", which will be continued by the principal and the\nSisters. Recommended a change being made of a trap door in the\nGirls Dormitory on the Third floor. This was an old antiquated\naffair, and in my opinion, would be dangerous in a fire. It\ntook about three minutes to open and in case of a panic, would\nnever be opened. I would also recommend that a few rope fire\nescapes be used on the upper floors in case of congestion.\n\nAlfred G.B.

In my letter of January 22 last I advised you regarding the amount we were including in our appropriation for the current fiscal year for repairs and improvements at the Ermineskin School. Later the Principal forwarded a sketch of the addition which he considered necessary. This was discussed with the Surveys & Engineering Branch but the plan was not sufficiently definite for them to decide if the addition could be erected in the manner apparently desired by the Principal and for the amount that we provided in our current year's appropriation.\n\nIn view of the fact that we may have to spend some money in making the repairs mentioned in your letter of April 16 we have taken no further action regarding the addition. However, you should keep this in mind and when the officer of the Surveys & Engineering Branch visits the school you might discuss the matter with him with a view to having his advice on what could be done with the amount of money that is available.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

On enquiring why this had not been done, I was informed by the Rev. Brother who looks after these boilers that the Rev. Father Moulin, who at that time was Principal, had quite a row with the Inspector and ordered him out of the school, informing him that when the boilers needed inspection that a Federal Government Inspector would do the work and not a Provincial Government Inspector.\n\nI consider it very dangerous to allow steam boilers to go for this length of time without inspection in an institution such as this, and would ask if the Department is aware of this, if not, may I be authorized to have the Provincial Boiler Inspector make an inspection immediately and thereafter, annually during his itinerary, please.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlfred G.B.

Your letter did not arrive here until the 14th, so was too late to take up the matter of the addition with him. When you get his report you will be in a better position to decide whether it would be advisable to spend money on an addition or spend it in repairing the present building.\n\nRev. Father Poularde, O.M.I., was here last week and suggested that the Rev. Father Pratt, Acting Principal, be allowed to build his own addition and he was positive he could put up a larger addition with the amount appropriated than was suggested in Rev. Father Moulin's sketch.\n\nRegarding the sketch of the proposed addition sent in by the Rev. Father Moulin. This was sent by him personally, before he was transferred, no one else has seen it, and there is no copy here, consequently none of us know just what was asked for.\n\nIt is also suggested that a pole fire escape be erected at the South end of the building to take the place of the wooden outside staircase as present used by the girls, which may be dangerous in case of fire, as they may burn away before the children were evacuated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlfred G.B.

I would much appreciate if through your recommendation the Department will grant us the permission to continue his duties as Night Watchman during 10 months of the year, in consideration of the state of our present school.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nActing Principal\nSir:-\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter from the Rev. Father Pratt, O.M.I., certifying the services of the night-watchman at the Ermineskin School for the month of April.\n\nHe has also asked that the services of a night-watchman be authorized by the Department for 10 months of the year, or all of the time that the children are in residence, instead of from Sept. 1st to April 30th, as allowed at present.\n\nAs I consider the present Ermineskin School building to be more or less of a fire-trap in its present condition, I would strongly recommend that the Department authorize the payment of a nightwatchman for 10 months of the year.\n\nI might say that when the Rev. Father Poularde, O. M.I., was visiting the school, he strongly recommended the appointment of a nightwatchman for 10 months of the year, and promised the Rev. Father Pratt that he would take this matter up personally with the Department when he returned to Ottawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlfred G.B.

All the money provided in our appropriation for grants for night watchmen's services has been assigned. I may add that at no school do we allow a grant for night watchman's services for a period longer than 7 months.

McKinnon, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nPP\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI am in receipt of Mr. Pratt's memorandum of June 17 enclosing letter written by Very Reverend U. Langlois, O.M.I., to Mr. J. A. MacInnis, M. P., in connection with the Ermineskin Indian Residential School at Hobbema, Alberta.\n\nThis school is owned by the Oblate Order. It was built several years ago and at the present time is not in good condition. For several years past the Church authorities have been urging the Department to replace the old school by a modern building. Up to the present it has not been found possible to secure funds for this purpose. I am not aware from what source Father Langlois obtained the information that it had been suggested that this Residential School be replaced by Day Schools. No such official decision has been made or even considered.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation an amount of $7500.00 was provided for making necessary improvements to the Ermineskin School. On April 25 the Surveys & Engineering Branch was requested to have one of their engineers inspect this school and report on the repairs most urgently required. We have not yet received this information but when it comes to hand you will be further advised.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Ermineskin Indian Residential School, Robbena, Alberta.\n\nI desire to refer you to my memorandum of April 25 requesting that you arrange for a competent person to visit this school and advise what action should be taken to improve conditions.\n\nA report received from our Indian Agent for the month of May stated that Mr. Garrett had inspected the Ermineskin School on May 12.\n\nAs yet we have not received Mr. Garrett's report and as the Church authorities are urging us to take immediate action to remedy some of the defects in the building I would appreciate having a copy of Mr. Garrett's report at the earliest possible date in order that a decision may be made regarding what can be done.\n\nDirector.\nDear Mr. McKinnon:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant enclosing letter received by you from Very Reverend U.

G.P.M. from tank.\n\nPressure on fire hose on 3rd floor from tank\n= 10 x .45 = 4 lbs. per square inch, which against\nthe friction in hose and nozzle would be totally inadequate for a fire protection stream.\nThe outside dimensions of the building are 40'5\" by 136' and the building may be divided into three sections. On the south end is the original building with no basement, this being added to by the major portion of the building with full basement. These two sections were built upward of fifty years ago. The north portion of classrooms with sleeping quarters above was built some twenty years ago; the basement being extended at that time to take in this newest addition.\n\n**BASEMENT**\n\nThis was inspected from south to north.\n\n**Sleeping Quarter**, 10' x 14'\n\nThis room is occupied by one sister. The ceiling is 5'11\" in height and is in very poor condition. The floor is of uncovered cement and is very damp. No windows or ventilation of any kind. Wall is of uncovered cement.\n\n**Sleeping Quarter & Storeroom**, 10' x 16'\n\nThis room is occupied by one sister and is also used as a storeroom for clothing. The ceiling is 5'11\" and is supported by 2\" x 10\" joists in fair condition. Floor is cement and very damp. Walls are of uncovered cement with one small window for light and ventilation.\n\n**Children's Sleeping Quarter**, 14' x 58' (See Photo No.1)\n\nThis room is occupied by thirteen children ranging in age from 7 to 10 years of age. The room is divided roughly into two parts: the west portion of 14' x 16' being in the poorest shape and described as follows. Seven feet in height from floor to stringers with one uncovered cement wall and the other two of rough boards. The floor above is supported by 7 - 8\" round logs running lengthwise of the room, at the one end they are nailed into a 12\" hewn timber plate which rests on top of the concrete outside wall. The stringers are supported here and there by 3\" poplar posts and 2\" x 6\", shimmied up with common box boards.\n\nThe 12\" x 12\" plate and the seven (7) stringers are almost wholly destroyed by dry rot and crumble easily to the touch, thus rendering the room unsafe for occupancy. This section has no windows or ventilation and with the odor of dry rot being prominent it is unhealthy.\n\nThe east portion of this room is 14' x 21'. The joists are 7' above the floor with no ceiling. The 7 - 2\" x 10\" joists which support this section are imbedded in the concrete wall on the one end, and rest on 2 - 6\" x 7\" beams running crosswise, one in the middle and one on the opposite end. Beams are supported by 3 - 2\" x 6\" planks nailed together and by 2 - 8\" round posts. Two walls are of concrete while the other is rough boards. Two sets of steam pipes cross this room 5' from the floor.\nStateroom. 8' x 10'\nThis room is dark and damp, with one small window set at ground level. The ceiling of 1\" boards is plased and patched, while 3\" poplar posts are used to support the joists above.\n\nBakery.\nOne beam runs lengthwise of the ceiling and this has sagged some 2\" in the middle. The ceiling is of V joint which is badly buckled and which springs under pressure. The chimney in the corner is brick covered with cement, and a large area of brick is exposed, as the cement is falling away.\n\nDining & Recreation Hall. 30' x 30'\nThis room has an 8' ceiling and two beams run across it as support. These beams have sagged badly and the V joint ceiling gives easily when pressed. Seven 6\" x 6\" badly checked, rough sawn posts support the beams.\n\nPantry. 14' x 20'\nA piece of the V joint ceiling was taken out in this room, and this exposed round log beams almost wholly destroyed by dry rot, they crumbling to the touch. This room has two small windows.\n\nRecreation & Dining Hall. (See Photo No.2)\nThis basement room is in the portion built some twenty years ago. Fifteen, 2\" x 10\", fairly sound, exposed joists, support the floor above. The walls of this room are uncovered cement. The hot water tank to service the whole building is located in the corner of this room; this being heated by means of a jacket heater which is located in the boiler room. Narrow stairs in fair condition lead from the corner of this room to the classroom above.\n\nBoiler Room.\nThe boiler appears to be in fair condition, and has been recently inspected and pronounced serviceable.\n\nTHIRD FLOOR\n\nThis floor was inspected from north to south.\n\nGirls Dormitory. 26 beds.\nThis is the newest portion of the building. The floor has dropped toward the centre and has sunk 1\" on the north end and is approximately 5\" lower in the centre of the room than along the walls. As in the boys dormitory the quarters are cramped. The roof leaks on the North end.\n\nGirls Dormitory. 41 beds.\nThis large room is in the oldest portion of the building. Lengthwise through the centre of the room the floor is roughly 4\" lower than along the outside walls. This room is overcrowded.\n\nGirls Dormitory. 22 beds. (See Photo No.6)\nThis room is also in the oldest portion of the building. The floor slopes toward the middle, it being some 4\" lower than the outside. This room is also crowded.\n\nFor the above ninety-one (91) girls there are two lavatories available.\nThere is a sheet metal bathtub at the south end of the centre dormitory which is almost destroyed by rust, and although it is not in use, it should be taken out as soon as possible, and replaced with a new one.\n\nFOURTH FLOOR\n\nThis floor is in the roof peak and is unfinished, being used for storage only. The stairs leading to this floor slope badly toward the centre of the building and should be trued up. The floor is of common boards and it sags badly through the centre.\n\nThe chimney on the North end is cement and appears to be in good condition.\n\nThe ventilation pipe runs through the centre of the room, and this pipe was separated some 2\" at one joint, rendering it useless. It was told that it was impossible to keep the joints of this pipe together as the sway of the building jars the joints, during a wind. This pipe should be fixed permanently as soon as possible.\n\nWATER SYSTEM\n\nA single action pump driven by an electric motor is used; the water being pumped through a 1\" pipe from a well. The motor is located in an annex to the west of the main building (See photo No.5). The water is pumped into a galvanized lined wooden tank located on the fourth floor of the main building, and from there gravity feeds it through the house system.\n\nThe capacity of the tank is approximately 800 gallons and the filling of it is a slow process.\n\nBy test, a 3/4\" pipe in the kitchen delivered 2.4 gallons per minute.\n\nTwo wells are in use, one being used with the motor and the other by a hand pump in the kitchen. This latter is hard water.\n\nApparently the water has not been tested for some time and this should be done as soon as possible.\n\nFIRE PROTECTION\n\nThere are four 50-foot lengths of 1 1/2\" hose with racks near the west end of the building, one on each floor.\n\nThe fire escapes are the old fashioned pole type, with one set of steps on the west side.\n\nThe second floor has three outlets: a pole escape in the centre on the north end, a drop ladder on the west side on the north end, and a pole escape on the west side on the south end.\n\nThe third floor has three escapes: a pole from the centre on the north end, steps from the centre on the west side and a pole escape on the west side on the south end.\nVERANDA.\n\nThe veranda is on the front of the building and runs for almost the full length of the building on the second floor being entered from the inside only. This veranda has been constructed in inferior condition and not safe for any heavy loading. At the present time, it is not in use and I suggested to Father Pratt, the principal of the school, that it should be closed off and not used until it has been repaired.\n\nANNEX\n\nThe annex is west of the main building and the electric water pump and laundry is located on the ground floor. The laundry equipment is fairly modern, although the boiler shows signs of leaking and should be checked over.\n\nThe second floor was intended for the infirmary and nurses' quarters, but is not being used as such. The reason given is that it cannot be heated efficiently in the winter time. At the present time, it is being used as a drying and ironing room.\n\nAt the time of inspection, the building housed the following:\n\n155 Boys and girls ranging in age from 7 to 16 years.\n17 Sisters of the Catholic Church.\n1 Brother acting as fireman and janitor.\n\nThe above children are all Cree Indian and the principal informed me that there are some 50 more applications on file for entrance to the school but not sufficient accommodation is available.\nBanff, Alberta,\nJune 10th, 1936.\n\nTo G.M. Walker, Esq.,\nSupervising Engineer.\n\nRe: Eymineskin Residential School, Hobbema, Alberta.\n\nI inspected the above school on June 2nd, accompanied by Father J.E. Pratt, principal of the school, C.D. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Affairs Branch, Calgary, and the Mother Superior of the school.\n\nThe attached memorandum, pages 1 to 4 inclusive, describes quite accurately the condition of the various rooms as to sag in floors and condition of floor beams and supports in the basement.\n\nThis in general is the condition of the school:\n\n(1) The floor beams and supporting columns, holding up the floor over the basement, weakened with age and rot, have let the centre of the building sag. This sag is of course transmitted to, and shows in the floors of the rooms above. A new layout of joists, beams, columns and plates will be required over all the first floor above basement, except the northern part of building which was erected some twenty years ago.\n\n(2) The floor joist construction as originally built, is much too light and while much of the upper floors is still sound and serviceable, there is an unavoidable deflection in the floor joists. For example, the main floor is carried on 2\" x 6\" joists 24\" centers on an 18 foot span. For a little floor live load of say 50 pounds per square foot the span should not be over ten (10) feet for 2\" x 6\" joists on 24\" centers. Or, for an 18 foot span 2\" x 6\" joists on 18\" centers should have been used.\n\nSimilarly, the floors under some of the dormitories are carried by 2\" x 6\" joists on 24\" centers for a 16 foot span. For a 40 pound live load of 40 pounds, on a 16 ft. span, 2\" x 6\" floor joists should not have been used, but 2 x 10 joists 12\" centers. Carrying a 40 pound live load on 2 x 8 joists 24\" centers, and 16 foot span, reduces the factor of safety to about three instead of six and gives a theoretical deflection of approximately 2 1/4 inches. As a matter of fact the actual live floor load in one of these dormitories would average about as follows:\n\nBed, bedding and one person, 300 lbs., distributed over an area of approximately 25 sq. ft. = 12 pounds per sq. ft.\nLive load plus 13 pounds dead load = 25 pounds total load which would give a deflection of around 1 1/2 inches and a safety factor of approximately 5. The floor construction although too light, will carry the light dormitory floor load, but there is of necessity the extra deflection in the floor joists. Where possible and necessary these long spans are to be halved and supported by an extra beam and posts.\n\n(Signed)...........\n(3) Along the center line of the building, the floor joists rest on a central beam. This beam is supported either by partitions or by wooden posts or columns. In places these supporting posts are too far apart and permit a deflection in the beam. Additional posts are to be added and the spacing of the posts is to be changed as required.\n\n(4) The floors of the building should be jacked up into shape as much as possible after the new beams, joists and posts have been placed in the basement.\n\n(5) Floors, doors, windows, and V joint wall and ceiling covering. While this material is old and worn and in places the V joint has warped away from the joists, it is considered that a 10 or 20% replacement will be sufficient and all that the general condition of the building warrants.\n\n(6) The building should be painted outside and some slight repairs made to the verandahs and fire escape stairways.\n\n(7) At present the water supply and distribution system is totally inadequate. There is not sufficient for domestic purposes and in case of a fire the protection from the fire hose, which is located on the north end of the building, would be totally inadequate. I would recommend, therefore, the drilling of a new well and the installation of an electric pump, pressure tanks and additional piping, all as described in the Bill of Material attached hereto.\n\nIn my opinion the building as a whole, although of too light construction and old, is still serviceable enough to warrant the repairs herein described. Care will have to be exercised always to not overload the dormitory and attic floors.\n\nI give below a summary of the costs estimated -\n\n**SUMMARY OF COSTS:**\n\n| Description                                      | Cost   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Repairs to inside of building                    | $2,000.00 |\n| Repairs to outside of building                  | 500.00 |\n| Addition to water system                        | 2,234.15 |\n| Miscellaneous supplies, freight, cartage, contingencies | 365.85 |\n|                                                  | **$5,100.00** |\n\nI would recommend that these repairs be made during the summer vacation period of July and August when the school is not occupied.\n\nI enclose self-explanatory photographs, and attach hereto various descriptive notes.\n\n(sgd.) W.H. Snelson,\nAssistant Engineer.\n25th June, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nI have your memorandum of the 25th April in which you quote from the Indian Agent at Hobbema, Alberta, a report on the conditions existing at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School and in which you request that we arrange to have one of our Engineers visit this school and report on these conditions.\n\nAdvice has now been received from our Chief Engineer that the conditions of the above school were inspected by Mr. W.H. Snelson, Assistant Engineer, and a copy of Mr. Snelson's report to Mr. Walker, Supervising Engineer at Banff, is attached. From this report it would appear -\n\n1. That although the building is old and of light construction repairs are warranted;\n\n2. That sanitary and fire protection conditions are far from good;\n\n3.

However, as Mr. Snelson later made a complete inspection and submitted a report, a copy of which was sent you with my memorandum of the 25th ultimo, no report is expected from Mr. Garrett.\n\nDirector.\nExtract from letter dated July 6, 1938, received from Dr. J. J. WALL.\n\nIt is with respect to the fire hazard at night in four of our schools. They are Sandy Bay, Man., Round Lake and Cowessess of Broadview, Sask., and lastly and especially Hobbema, Alta. In any of these institutions, should I sleep there, I always have the flash-light, overcoat, socks and gloves available and prepared for a sudden dive into the winter night. This fear in these four places certainly has not become an obsession but it has started to bother my conscience.\n\nI know how foolish it would be in these hard times to imagine that funds are available for proper reconstruction. But is it not possible to get proper escape apparatus installed. Every second for evacuation time must be conserved. I am not frightened so much of the flames at night but I am fearful of the superheated gases developing and flooding the halls. One partial lung-full of this and a person is out. All the fire fighting equipment possible will not avail such a case. That was my experience years ago at the Royal Victoria in Montreal when we had that terrible movie fire which took so many children. It was not the flames, as I recollect, none were even scorched.\n\nMy belief is that this problem can be solved in preparing proper escapes. Iced poles of iron, narrow snow or ice filled metal stairs on the outside possibly open to a wall of flames from some window it passes will only add to the panic at night. Poor lighting over these meager affairs will not assist.\n\nThe panic in the children when a real fire does break will be stupendous. The stoical Indian in such case is a figment on the part of certain popular authors.\n\nDon't be sore at me, Phil., as I am prepared to lay a two to one bet up to $100 bucks that in case of such an eventuality in any of the four, happening in winter between ten at night and four in the morning, the mortality will exceed...\nthirty per cent.\n\nThe ideal thing would be an inspection of each by an officer, like the Chief of the Montreal brigade, who has had plenty of experience dealing with such institutional hazards. His first consideration would be to figure the route the fire and gases would take so that adequate methods and routes of escape can be instituted. Steel fire doors would undoubtedly be installed on each floor above the first. Steel tower-like escapes as on the Kent Street School at Ottawa would replace at strategic points the old precarious poles and narrow stairs. Lists of pupils to utilize each escape would be posted at all times and each child's name checked from list as it passes by a responsible guardian. Many of the children otherwise, in the event of a genuine alarm will, if not watched, take refuge in a clothes closet or under its bed.\n\nNight watchman was a step in the right direction but much can happen in the winter when he is punching in the outbuildings and barn and the time he returns to the school.\n\nMuch as I hate to bring your attention to this whole question in these four places, please understand it is not done so with any sense of butting in. It is for these poor kiddies sake, many of whom one becomes attached in his duties. In case also, should any catastrophe arise, we all shall be charged properly at any investigation especially at the hands of politically conscious lawyers who cynically will give little credit to those who really and truly have the fullest interests of these tots at heart.\nSir:\u2014\n\nOur Voucher No. 697 in favour of Stanley Brock Limited, Calgary, Alberta, amounting to $55.24 was forwarded for Payment on the 16th March last. This was for repairs to the washing machine at Ermineskin Residential School.\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from Stanley Brock Limited informing me that they have not yet received payment.\n\nMay I be advised, please, what disposition has been made of this voucher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlfred G. B.

C. B. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alberta.\nEdmonton 13 July 1938.\n\nTo Mr. H.W. McGill;\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to you on behalf of Rev. Father Routhier, our new Provincial, who replaced Father Langlois. Having been Provincial Procurator for the past two years, I have been in touch with our Indian Schools and more than ever in condition to know their needs, for the present at least.\n\nThe Department, I understand, has voted a certain sum for repairs and another sum for additions to the Eriniskin School at Hobbema. We thought that if you would kindly let us have the sums voted, we would take upon ourselves to make the repairs and additions with more advantages than by giving a Government contract. We have a few Lay Brothers who are competent carpenters and we would employ them for the work. No doubt; we would like the work to be supervised by a man appointed by the Department.\n\nWe have another proposal to make to you. The School at Brocket needs to be enlarged. Well we have at McLeod a school that has been abandoned by the Sep. S.D. This is a brick building 65x65 feet. We had a contractor from Lethbridge to look at the building. This contractor estimated that, after allowing for breakage, 100,000 bricks could be salvaged. He estimated the cut stone at 80 cubic feet. The windows, sashes, doors, and lumber were in good condition. This building belongs to the Oblate Fathers and we offer it free to the Department to be used for the addition at Brocket. You would have only the cost of salvaging the material and hauling them at Brocket which is only twenty two miles from McLeod.\n\nHoping these proposals will be taken into consideration by your Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibraries and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\n112-1-5.\n\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, July 22, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the Ermineskin Indian Residential School.\n\nI regret that it is not possible to favourably consider your suggestion, in view of the fact that the Surveys and Engineering Branch have already been instructed to proceed with the following improvements to the Ermineskin School:\u2014\n\n1. Repairs to inside of building.\n2. Repairs to outside of building.\n3. Addition to water system.\n\nWhen they have completed their work, you might let me know if there are other improvements that you consider might be made, and your suggestions will receive very careful consideration.\n\nYou have been written previously regarding the last paragraph of your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend L. LaRose, O.M.I.,\n9916 - 110th Street,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n19th July, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Ermineskin Indian Residential School, Hobbema, Alta.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 6th instant regarding the above, I am advised by our Chief Engineer that arrangements have been made for Mr. Snelson of his Service to supervise the above work and that as soon as the sum of $5,100 has been transferred to that Service from your Branch the necessary instructions will be issued to commence the work immediately.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nJuly 28, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nPlease arrange for the immediate transfer of $5,100 from Vote 166 to the Surveys and Engineering Branch. This amount is required for repairs and improvements that are being made to the Ermineskin Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Ermineskin school is an old building and one of the engineers of the Surveys and Engineering Branch recently inspected it and recommended repairs to the amount stated above.\n\nFunds for the purpose are provided in the appropriation for the current fiscal year.\n\nActing Director.\nJuly 26, 1938.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nThe Director,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch\nRe: Brinenkin Residential School,\nHobbs, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of July 19, I am requesting the Representative of the Treasury to transfer to you immediately the sum of $5,100 in connection with repairs to the above school.\n\nThis Branch would appreciate it if the necessary work is commenced immediately.\n\nT. R. L. MacKinnon\nActing Director\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa,\nJuly 28, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFollowing his inspection of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School Mr. W. H. Snelson, Assistant Engineer, submitted a report in which he stated that although the building is of too light construction and old it is still serviceable enough to warrant certain repairs and he suggested the expenditure of the following amount:\n\nRepairs to inside of building ..... $2,000.00\nRepairs to outside of building ..... 500.00\nAddition to water system .......... 2,234.15\nMiscellaneous supplies, freight, cartage, contingencies ........... 365.85\n\n$5,100.00\n\nAuthority has been given to have the work suggested by the engineer proceed at once.\n\nFor the information of the Principal and yourself I may say that in the current year's appropriation an amount of $7500.00 was provided for repairs and improvements at the Ermineskin School. From the figures given above you will note that when these repairs are completed there will still be approximately $2400.00 available. Consequently, if the Principal and yourself consider that this amount could be expanded to advantage you should consult the engineer who will be supervising the repairs and have him make a recommendation to the Surveys & Engineering Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G.B.

Made by the largest manufacturers of food chopping machines in the world, we know there is nothing finer can be procured.\n\nWe recommend for your use the 1/3 H.P. chopper, with a capacity of five to six pounds meat per minute. We include three plates and knives with each machine.\n\nIt is hard work putting meat through a hand grinder, when you have a hundred and sixty-five to feed, and takes much time and a back breaking job.\n\nThe cylinder is rifled, and the worm matches the same. The parts take off easily and we carry extra parts on hand all the time.\n\nOur price is $215.00, less 7.4% returned duty, but we quote you a special low price of $180.00 nett.

LEWIS \" INDIAN AGENT\nHOBEMA ALTA.\n\nDEAR SIR:\n\nWill you be kind enough to request the Indian Dept. Ottawa to allow me to use the rest of the money voted last Session in favour of this school \"$2400.00 for the proposed addition of this school. By doing such an addition to our present school we will relieve in certain extent the exiguity of the space allowed to the children.\n\nThe proposed addition will be 40 X 60\nBasement-Boys Recreation Room\nFirst Floor : 2 Class Rooms 20 X 30\nSecond Floor-Full space for a boys' Dormitory.\n\nIf this permission is granted, the Engineer from Banff who is now supervising the present work at the school will be willing to supervise this new addition.\n\nIt would be a very good thing if the Dept. could answer by wire as the Season is getting short. If we save time we will be able to do the concrete work before freezing.\n\nHoping that you will use your authority to obtain the said permission as the situation in our school is well known to you.\n\nWith sincere thanks\nYours very truly\nJ.E. Pratt\nActing Principal\nSir:-\n\nRef. your file No.112-1-5, July 28/38.\n\nI attach herewith a letter from the Rev. Principal of the Ermineskin Residential School, asking that authority be given to expend the balance of approximately $2400.00 allowed for repairs and improvements to the School, to build an addition as described therein.\n\nMr. Snelson, the Engineer from Banff, who is in charge of the present work being done, is of the opinion that this addition will cost considerably more than $2400.00, but Father Pratt is willing to supplement this amount from his own funds up to $2000.00 if necessary.\n\nThe Rev. Principal would like to use local labour for this work, which is much cheaper than that charged by contractors who tender for the same, and would prefer not to have this work done by tender, but under the supervision of Mr. Snelson, with local labour and materials.\n\nIf the Department can arrange to have Mr. Snelson supervise this work, I would ask that authority be granted to proceed with same, please.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlfred G.B. Lewis,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle,\n\nFrom a letter received from Mr. Walker the following is quoted:\n\n\"Mr. Snelson reports that while at Hobbs last week, the Indian Agent at that point informed him (on Sept.10th) that the said school had $2,400.00. The Indian Affairs Branch had granted them toward building an addition to the school and that they would be permitted to use this sum, provided the work was done under the supervision of one of our engineers.\n\n\"Father Pratt, the Father in charge, wishes to construct a basement 40 x 60 and to finish the floor immediately above into four class rooms. Above this, another floor would be built but unfinished. In the opinion of Mr. Snelson and myself this sum - $2,400.00 - will not go very far toward the completion of the above mentioned structure. In fact, it would appear that this sum would only pay for the construction of the basement and an unfinished first floor. Father Pratt, however, stated that he had planned to use some other school funds for the completion of this addition.\n\n\"I have advised Mr. Snelson to take no action with regard to this particular addition until authority has been received from Head Office.\"\n\nUnder the circumstances it would seem that Mr. Walker's instructions to Mr. Snelson to take no action with regard to the matter dealt with in the above quotation are in order. We have no information with regard to this proposal in this office, and would be glad to be advised what, if any, further action should be taken.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.M.

It would appear from this letter that Father Pratt wishes to construct a basement 40' x 60', finish the floor immediately above into four classrooms, and build another unfinished floor above for the $2,400 provided by your Branch. It will be noted also that, in Mr. Snelson's opinion, concurred in by the Chief Engineer, the $2,400 would only be sufficient for the construction of the basement and an unfinished first floor.\n\nWill you kindly advise what instructions have been forwarded from your office as it is noted that the work was to be supervised by one of our Engineers and we have no information.\n\nDirector.\nAGENT'S REPORT ON HOBREMA AGENCY FOR MONTH OF SEPT. 1938.\n\nWork started on repairing Ermineskin Indian Residential school under the supervision of Mr. Snelson of Banff and the painting of the exterior is nearly completed.

This Branch does not, however, look favourably upon erecting any addition to the present building. Please advise me at once whether the proposed building is a new one or an addition and the matter will then be taken up with the Surveys & Engineering Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

When I have definite information on this point I will advise you further.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nCalgary, October 25th, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that when at the Hobbema Agency on the 21st instant, I called at the Ermineskin Residential School, where certain repairs are being done to the main building, a new well is being sunk, and a pressure tank installed.\n\nWork on the repairs is advancing nicely; this, together with the painting of the exterior, will make a big improvement to the main building. This, however, does not alter the fact that the building is too small, there being no infirmary; also, a number of the pupils and some of the staff have to sleep in the basement, which is not a proper or suitable place; also, as the Department are aware, there are a large number of R.C. children of school age in this Agency, who are not attending school, there being no room for them.\n\nAt the time of my visit, drilling of the new well had reached a depth of 345 feet; they were then going through a layer of shale. I have this day phoned Agent Lewis, making inquiries, and he informs me that water was found at 400 feet, and that the level of this comes up to 200 feet. A test shows the well to supply four (4) gallons per second. The pressure tank, when filled, will operate two ordinary fire hose for a period of fifteen minutes. I have asked Agent Lewis to obtain a log of the well; also to have the water analysed and both records filed at his office and copies sent here.\n\nWhen on the reserve, threshing was proceeding nicely. Agent Lewis informed me today that this will be completed on Monday, the 31st instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

Father Pratt wishes to erect a 2 story building 40' x 60', erected approximately 40 feet north of the main building. The basement to be used as a boys' recreation room, the ground floor to contain 4 class rooms and the first floor to contain a dormitory and an infirmary. The attic to be unfinished.\n\nFather Pratt wishes to arrange for his own labour and to get his lumber from B.C. in car load lots and to have an engineer from the Surveys and Engineering Branch to supervise the work. He is hopeful that his Superior will authorize a further expenditure to complete the building.\n\nI hope that something can be done to enlarge this building, as at present there are 2 Sisters and about 20 small children sleeping in the basement, which is not healthy; there are also 34 children sick in bed in the dormitories. 31 have mumps, 2 with chicken-pox and 1 with pneumonia. These children should be in an infirmary. There are also about 60 children who should be in school, but cannot be taken in as there is not room for them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAlfred G.B. Lewis,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nNovember 16, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant with reference to the new building that the Principal of the Ermineskin Residential School wishes to erect.\n\nFrom the information given in your letter I am inclined to feel that the proposed new building would cost in the vicinity of $20,000.00. As you are aware only $5,400.00 is available and I am unable to hold out any promise that additional funds will be available in the appropriation for the next fiscal year to complete the building proposed by the Reverend Principal nor to provide per capita grant over and above the number which is allowed at present.\n\nUnless the Reverend Principal is definitely assured that his superior will provide the funds without making any further demand on this Branch I believe he would be well advised to consider the matter further before taking any definite steps. This Branch would prefer a building with class rooms on the ground floor and the basement used for vocational training. Buildings such as this would cost considerably less than the one suggested by the Reverend Principal and at the same time the removal of the class rooms to such a building would permit of the present class rooms being used for dormitory accommodation.\n\nYou should, therefore, discuss the matter again with the Reverend Principal and let me have your views.\n\nA.G.B. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nIn any event owing to present regulations it will not be possible to allow the Principal to purchase the lumber. He can, however, give us full details regarding the lumber he would like to have supplied and state the name of the firm from whom he considers it could be secured at the most reasonable cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, Nov. 26, 1938.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI just received a letter from Rev. Father J. E. Pratt, acting principal of Ermineskin Indian Residential School, Alberta. Father Pratt informs me that all the repair work ordered last spring has been done and that the school is, in consequence, in much better condition.\n\nThere is still available out of this year's appropriation for this school the sum of $2,400. It is now proposed to use this amount for the construction of a new classroom and manual training building. The plans are now being prepared by your engineer at Banff. It is estimated that the new building will cost about $5,000 and it is hoped that the balance required will be made available by the department.\n\nThe repairs made to the school would enable the principal to accept more pupils and he would like the pupilage to be increased from the present figure to 160.\n\nThe general condition of the building would require the presence of a night watchman during the 10 school months. I know that the present regulations of the department only allow salaries for six months of the year. Would it be possible to make an exception for this school? The principal as well as the staff would feel greatly relieved of responsibility if the school were allowed to have a night watchman for the full school period.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would ask your agent to make a new inspection of this school and its buildings, with the idea of suggesting what measures should be taken to safeguard the lives of the inmates in case of fire. The principal suggests adding fire extinguishers to the present fire fighting appliances. But you may wish to have your agent's advice on this point.\n\nI hope that you will give these various requests of the principal your early attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nIn any event owing to present regulations it will not be possible to allow the Principal to purchase the lumber. He can, however, give us full details regarding the lumber he would like to have supplied and state the name of the firm from whom he considers it could be secured at the most reasonable cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

These were all logs set on the bank on, hewn on top to receive the floor and morticed into 10 x 10 fir beams, one in top each basement wall and one supporting post near the center of the building. These old logs were quite badly decayed. From 5 to 10 feet of the west end of those that originally rested on the west basement wall were completely rotted away.\n\nA complete new system of floor joists, 2 x 12 on 12\" centers, was placed in this section. These joists were supported near the center line of the building on 6 x 12 beams resting on 6 x 6 posts approximately 9' apart. It was very tedious and difficult to remove the old logs, especially without disturbing the flooring or classes being held in the rooms above.\n\n(2) Reference last sentence, Page 1.\n\nThree beams, in addition to those originally placed along the center line of the building, were placed under the floors supporting the second and third floors in the central section of the building. For some unknown reason, the central beam system running north and south, instead of being in the center of the 69' distance between the east and west basement walls (19'6\"), was approximately 17'6\" from the east wall and 21'6\" from the west. The floor system supporting the second floor, over the main large classroom in the central one-third of the building, was strengthened by placing a 6\"x12\"...\n\nT. S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Service,\nO T T A W A.\nplacing a 6\" x 12\" beam under the west or long portion of the floor span and carrying this beam on 6\" posts approximately 9' apart. Similarly it was found necessary to place a second 6 x 12 beam directly in line with this beam but on the floor above and supporting the west part of the floor system on the third floor. It was not found necessary to place an additional supporting beam wherever under the east or shorter floor span a 6\" x 12\" beam was placed supporting the west portion of the second floor, over the girls' dining room.\n\n(3) Reference last sentence.\n\nWherever found to be unsound, the old posts were replaced with new ones. Additional posts were added on the third floor. The entire central beam and post system was raised with jacks to the proper level and all posts were placed on new concrete footings. The 2\" x 6\" used in the floor systems of the building as reported in my original report was caused by the main supporting 6\" x 6\" central posts sinking into or bending the old rotten wooden floor log joists of the basement.\n\nAs mentioned above the central beam system above the basement was spaced 21.5 and 17.5 feet from the west and east basement walls respectively. But the beam system in the basement, and supporting the first floor, was exactly in the center of the building. Therefore, the posts supporting the second storey were not supported on the main central 10 x 10 beam of the basement but either on a log joist, approximately 2 feet east of the 10 x 10 basement beam, or on a short log bridge between two log joists. One such bridge had failed, allowing the posts to fall 4\" to 5\"; another has sunk into a rotten floor log joist. The new central beam and posts in the basement were placed in the same horizontal plane as the posts supporting the second and third floors.\n\n(4) All floors were levelled where economically possible.\n\n(5) A new fir floor was laid in the first grade classroom east of the kitchen on the first floor. New \"V\" joint was placed on the ceiling over the bread room, and over the medicine and charm room in the basement.\n\nTwo small rooms were partitioned off for sleeping quarters for the sisters from the extreme south basement rooms. Small closets were built in this same basement room to hold shoe and clothing supplies. Old \"V\" joint was used mainly for this work.\n\nA small canned fruit room was partitioned off just north of the stairway into the basement from the girls' dining room.\n\nA stairway leading from the sewing room on the second floor to the girls' dormitory on the third floor was enclosed with new \"V\" joint and provided with a door.\n\n(6) The entire main building was given two coats of paint outside. The roof also received two coats of stain.\n\nAll outside verandahs and fire escape stairs were levelled up, strengthened and repaired where necessary.\nA new well was drilled near the main building. This well was fitted with a new electric pump, automatic pressure controlled. It pumps into a 2000 gallon tank. This pressure tank, when filled to the maximum cut out pressure of 65 psi per square inch, will contain by volume one-half air and one-half water (1000 Imperial gallons). The pressure tank is connected to a 1-1/2\" supply line through a valve and leading through two risers, each of 1-1/2\" diameter to four fire hose connections on each riser, or two fire hose connections on each floor. Between the maximum cut out pressure of 65 psi and the minimum working pressure (tank nearly empty) of 35 psi, a quantity of 1000 Imperial gallons of water would be available for fire at an average pressure of around 45 psi per square inch.\n\nA test was made to show service through a 50-foot length of 2\" rubber fire hose and a 1/2\" nozzle at a maximum pressure of 35 psi per square inch. At this minimum pressure, the hose would throw water as high as the top of the roof of the main building from a position on the ground outside the building.\n\nA connection was made from the old well (about fifty feet away) to the pressure tank. The old well was also fitted with an automatic electric cutout and starting switch and had the pump jack repaired. As the hook-up now stands: All pumps operate at 65 psi. When pressure drops to 45 psi, the pump on the old well (No. 1) starts operating and continues until the pressure reaches 65 psi.\n\nIf the pressure be lowered to 35 psi, the pump on the new well (No. 2) will cut in and continue pumping until the pressure reaches 65 psi. Both pumps could be operating up to 65 psi and after Pump No. 2 cuts out at 55 psi the pump on well No. 1 would continue up to 65 psi. Ordinarily Pump No. 1 will suffice and it will be only on days of heavy draft, such as Monday washday, or in case of fire, that the pressure will be reduced low enough (35 psi) to cut in Pump No. 2.\n\nEach well, singly, on test supplied approximately 5 to 6 gallons per minute. The two pumps working together supplied approximately 6 gallons per minute. During one week's observation, except on washdays, Pump No. 1 supplied the needs of the school by pumping from 12 to 14 hours per day, or at about fifty percent capacity.\n\nAn outside concrete room, connected through to the basement by a small doorway, houses the new well and pressure tank. This room will keep warm enough to keep tank or well head from freezing in cold weather by warm air entering through open door into basement.\n\nA trench six feet deep was dug and one-inch pipe laid therein connecting pressure tank with laundry.\n\nThe work commenced September 16th and was completed November 26th.\nThe following gives an analysis of the cost of the material and labour for the different classes of work done on the building.\n\n**New Water System**\n\n- 1 - Delco Pump ........................................... $256.00\n- 1 - Pressure Tank ........................................... 708.80\n- 4 - Hose Racks ............................................. 21.60\n- 4 - Hoses .................................................. 36.60\n- 4 - Nozzles .................................................. 9.00\n- 4 - Hose Valves ............................................... 12.00\n- Electrical Fittings ........................................... 12.00\n- Pipe Fittings .................................................. 36.60\n- 250 - Lin.Ft. 4-1/4 Gaging .................................. 247.50\n- 1 - Brass Cylinder ............................................ 20.00\n- 250 - Lin.Ft. 2\" Drop Pipe .................................. 105.50\n- 150 - \" 1/8\" Pipe for inside fire service ................. 46.12\n- 250 - Lin.Ft.

The Department cannot understand why you changed these machines without first obtaining our authority. I note that you were allowed 5 smaller machines at a total cost of $159.87. This is a much larger amount than that for which we could have secured the same machines. In view of present regulations and the further fact that the order for the 2 tailor's machines was placed through the Purchasing Branch it is impossible for the Department to pay the attached account which you submitted as it does not comply with the purchase order, especially in view of the fact that the last 2 items cover the cost of articles which are not usually supplied to residential schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

We recommend the disconnecting of one pump and re-connecting of this pump to the other end of tank. At the present time there is no provision made to shut down tank to make any repairs which might be required, we would suggest the installing of gate valves at each end of tank, also re-arrange piping to suit conditions. All the above work we offer to install complete for the sum of $40.21, as per the following list,\n\n| Item                          | Quantity | Price |\n|-------------------------------|----------|-------|\n| 1 - 1\u00bd\" Gate Valve            |          | 5.40  |\n| 1 - 1\u00bd\" galv. elbow           |          | .55   |\n| 2 - 1\u00bd x 1\u00bd x 1\u00bd galv. tees   |          | 1.54  |\n| 1 - 1\u00bd x 1\u00bd x 1\" galv tee     |          | .60   |\n| 4 - 1\u00bd\" galv. elbows           |          | 1.32  |\n| 1 - 1\u00bd\" galv. union & washer  |          | .70   |\n| 14' - 1\u00bd\" galv pipe           |          | 2.80  |\n| 1 - 1 x 1 x \u00be\" galv tee       |          | .36   |\n| 1 - 1\u00bd\" gate valve            |          | 3.00  |\n| 1 - 1 x 1 x \u00be\" galv tee       |          | .28   |\n| 2 - 1\u00bd\" galv nipples          |          | .54   |\n| Transportation                |          | 3.00  |\n| Time of Plumber               |          | 12.50 |\n| Time of Helper                |          | 7.50  |\n\nTotal $40.21\n\nTrusting to receive your valued instructions we are,\n\nYours truly,\nTempleman Bros\nWetaskiwin, Alta.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEC 22 1938\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that the new pressure system that has been installed at the Erminekin Residential School has not been working properly.

It is not, as seemed to be believed by Mr. Hoey that this building will cost $20,000.00. Please advise Col. Lewis, so as to avoid any misunderstanding.\n\n(signed) Father H. Routhier,\nPrincipal, O.M.I.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to yours of the 16th Nov. 1938, no file No. regarding the new building that the Rev. Principal desires to erect at the Ermineskin Residential School.\n\nI took your letter to the Rev. Principal and discussed its contents fully with him and allowed him to have a copy to forward to Rev. Father Routhier, Principal of the Oblate Order here.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the reply from Rev. Father Routhier to Rev. Father Pratt regarding this. It is translated from the French language, therefore does not read grammatically, in English.\n\nRev. Father Pratt has had plans prepared for this new building. This plan calls for a building 40'x60' with class rooms on the ground floor, the basement to be used for recreational and vocational training, the second floor to remain unfinished.\n\nI am enclosing a quotation from the Imperial Lumber Co., Wetaskiwin for the material for the building which amounts to $415.00 and Rev. Father Pratt asks that the Department pay $2400.00 of this account and the balance will be paid from the $2600.00 being allowed him by Rev. Father Routhier. Rev. Father Pratt assures me that the remaining $225.00 will be ample to pay for labour and gravel if he is allowed to do the work.\n\nThere is one discrepancy I notice in this, there is no allowance made for heating this building, installing fire-fighting equipment and that seems to me to be a large item although Father Pratt assures me that he can finish this building ready for occupation for the $5000.00\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAlfred G.B. Lewis,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Ermineskin Indian Residential School, Robbema Indian Agency, Province of Alberta.\n\nThe above school is church-owned and during the past few years we have received several requests for funds to improve and enlarge the building. For this purpose an amount of $500.00 was provided in the current year's appropriation.\n\nDuring the past summer, under the supervision of the Surveys & Engineering Branch, extensive repairs were made to the interior of the main building and a new water system was provided at a total cost of $100.00. This left a balance of $400.00 unexpended.\n\nThrough the office of the local Indian Agent the Principal has written to the Department stating that the school management desires to erect a building apart from the main building in order to provide necessary space for class rooms and vocational training purposes. The Principal estimates that the cost of this building will be approximately $500.00. He requests that the Department allow toward the cost of this building the amount of $2400.00 which is the unexpended amount provided in this year's appropriation. The school management is prepared to supply the balance of approximately $2600.00.\n\nI consider that the additional building mentioned by the Principal is necessary and I should appreciate receiving the approval of the Honourable the Minister to allow $2400.00 toward its cost.\nFunds for the purpose are available in the current year's appropriation and it will not be necessary to secure a special Order-in-Council as a blanket Order-in-Council was secured last April covering the amounts provided for repairs and improvements at church-owned schools in the current year's appropriation.\n\nDirector.\n| DATE | DESCRIPTION | FOLIO | CHARGE | CREDIT | BALANCE |\n|------|-------------|-------|--------|--------|---------|\n|      | To Balance Account Rendered |       |        |        |         |\n| June 25 | TO Drilling Roller Tubes |       |        |        |         |\n| Mechanic 12 Hours $1.00 per hr |       |        |        |        |         |\n| Helper 12 hrs $0.50 per hr |       |        |        |        |         |\n| Transportation 44 miles 10\u00a2 per mile |       |        |        |        |         |\n|      |               |       |        |        | $22.00  |\n\nMELLETT & CO.\nGENERAL STEEL METAL WORKERS\nPipe and Pipeless Furnaces, Stock Tanks, Tank Heads, Earthen Troughs, Roofing, Etc.\nWETASKIWIN, ALTA.\n\nPHONE No. 65\n\nIndian Affairs School Files (RG 10), Volume 6354, File 754-5, part 4)\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO: Wellett & Co.\n\nADDRESS: Wetsaskiwin, Alta.\n\nSERVICE\n\nJune 25, To services rendered as per slips attached:\nMemo: Repairs to boiler at Ermineskin School.\nAuthority: Dept.

I note that the school management is prepared to proceed with the erection of a new class room building provided the Department allows the unexpended amount mentioned above.\n\nYou may inform the Principal that the Department will allow this amount of $2400.00 toward the cost of the new building. The Principal should purchase and pay for the lumber and other materials and forward a detailed, receipted account showing the expenditure that he has made. On receipt of this a cheque for $2400.00 will be sent to him. A request for payment of this amount should reach the Department by March 1.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA.G.B. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nOur Local Indian Agent is much in favour of this propose Sewing Club for the ex-Pupils and says it is much needed and will fill a real necessity. With two sewing machines they could do good to begin with and one of the sisters of the staff could continue to help them and continue their formation.\n\nHoping Sir, that the said given explanations will clear out the misunderstandings and will openly and clearly show that I acted in good faith and I am ready to do everything in my power to pay what it is not authorized by The Dept. I mean the electric irons.\n\nMy only ambition is to work with the Indian Agent and The Indian Dept. and to follow as exactly as possible the instructions received. I may make mistakes and I will be always thankful as it is in the present case when I am reminded of.\n\nBy the present I frankly say that I cannot pay for the three Sewing Machines now here and in use, and if obliged to pay I will have to return them or try to pay for them on terms only.\n\nI am very sorry that it happened that way and I can assure you that it will happen again.\n\nBelieve me always\n\nYours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Principal\nSir:\n\nI have on hand yours of the 19 instant, and may I say that it was really a complete surprise to me when you requested me I had sent in the invoices from the Red Deer Singer Sewing Machines, and this in good faith.\n\nWhen I received late last Summer the two Tailors' Machine, immediately I found out that they were too heavy for the purpose of training the young girls in sewing, and this as often requested by your Dept. At home they will never use a tailor machine and it is why I have tried to exchange them for lighter ones believing that it was O.K., and the Red Deer Sewing Machine Manager agreed to this transfer.\n\nAs to the last two items mentioned in your letter I had never in mind that the Dept. purchase them for us and although figure it is of course I believe we must have bought vouchers for the Sewing Machines. I am ready to pay for the two items mentioned because the Reverend Sisters for the new dresses had to come downstairs every time when pressing the dresses, and these articles are only for the use of the \"everend Sisters in charge of the girls.\n\nI apologize for not first applying to the Dept. for this exchange believing strongly that it was O.K., as far the Company would agree to do so. I also mentioned to our local Indian agent that I was to exchange them giving for reason that first I never called for Tailors' Machine but for ordinary Machines as these tailors' machines are too heavy and useless for the girls to press and sew.\n\nCertainly if I had to pay at this time for Sewing Machine I would not have bought three at the time as my means would not allow me such an expense. I could only have done it on installments plan. If I have to pay for them, my only resources are to return them and pay only for the two Electric Irons & equipment.\n\nBelieve me, Sir, I acted in very good faith and never thought to go over the authority received.\n\nHere I try to give to the girls the real training and with the big tailor machines the training will be a false one as they will never have them at home when their machines are replaced by new one we give them away to our Ex-Pupils, when getting married and are glad to have them having worked with them at the school. Also next Summer after our new addition being completed I will have a new place for a Sewing Club for the Ex-Pupils.\nI inspected the Ermineskin School on the 21st and found everything in good order. Rev. Father Pratt is converting the upstairs rooms of the laundry building into an older boys' dormitory, which will be in charge of a man, and the children now living in the basement will be moved upstairs into the dormitories and the laundry machinery moved into the basement. I am glad this is being done as I was never in favour of children living in this damp, dark basement.\n\nAlfred G.B.

Hoey,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nPlease find enclosed four copies of receipted statement of building material for the proposed addition to the Indian School at Hobema. I trust that you shall forward us immediately due to the amount stated in the recent letter to the acting principal.\n\nYou will realize that in building such an addition, a dire necessity, we are going to considerable expense, probably to the extent of between $5000.00 and $6000.00 above the amount furnished by the Indian Department. For several years many of the pupils have been confined to the very unsanitary basement as a bedroom. Also owing to the increased number of Indians on the Reserve, we have had as many as twenty children over and above the number for whom payment was received from the Department. I trust that you may see fit in view of the increased space available in the future to raise the rent for 160 children at Hobema and if at all possible that the government may assist us in paying at least a part of the debt incurred by the new building.\n\nI wish also to notify the Department that it is my intention if you approve to name Father Edouard Rh\u00e9aume, principal at Hobema, succeeding Father Moulin, and Father Georges Latour, principal at Duck Lake, succeeding Father Delmas. Both Fathers Moulin and Delmas are going out next year and these two much younger men have, I believe, the very finest qualifications to serve in the capacity of principals. I would wish that Father Rh\u00e9aume's nomination become effective immediately and Father Latour's on April 1st.\n\nThanking the Department for its assistance in the past and trusting that all will turn out well,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very Truly,\n\nH.

E. Pratt informs me that he wrote to the Department some time ago to ask for a few beds, springs, mattresses and bedding for the Ermineskin Indian Residential School.\n\nAs he has not received to date any acknowledgment of his letter, he would like to know whether or not you have made arrangements to supply the above.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJOP/TR\nDear Sir,\n\nAs requested in a letter from Mr. Mills under date of March 16th, concerning reported unsatisfactory operation of new water system at Bruneckin Indian School, I visited this school on March 23rd and made a thorough inspection of the layout and adjustment of pressure tanks. I operated both wells singly and both pumps at the same time. I found the installation to be operating entirely satisfactorily.\n\n1. There is an ample supply of water in either well. The man who operates the pump, Mr. Barry, reports that it is only necessary to run six or eight hours per day to supply their needs. The system is therefore not using 50% of the available flow of the wells. The water supply is therefore satisfactory in all respects.\n\n2. The pressure tank, piping, and air and pressure gauges were in good condition and operating satisfactorily.\n\n3. Both pumps and motors were operating satisfactorily.\n\n4. In endeavouring to ascertain what had caused Nathan Pratt to complain as to the operation of the installation I was informed by Mr. Barry that:\n\nMr. (Mr. Barry) had changed the operating range of the pumps so that both ranged between a pressure range of 45 to 65#, instead of one pump operating between 45# to 65#, and one pump operating between 35# and 50#, as the heading was for, and as I had it adjusted when I left in November. (See my letter of November 26th 1920, page 3). This change was made by Mr. Barry apparently on his own initiative, in order to lessen the time each day that the pumps were running. After he made this change one of the old rods broke in the old well and one of the small rod couplings broke in the new well. These pieces were repaired and the pumps in both wells have given no trouble since.\n\nMr. Barry reported that he had trouble with one of the pressure switches. I examined this switch which was the one I set originally to open at 55 pounds and found the spring had been tightened so that the switch did not open until a pressure of 65 pounds had been reached and that a loose wire connection probably made when they were trying to adjust it, had made a rough contact. I requested\n\nMr. Betty to ...............\n\nG. M. Walker, Esq.,\nSupervising Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Service,\nBanff, Alberta.\nMr. Berry to clean the contact points and return the switch to its original cut out pressure of 50.\n\nThe pumps have 1,1/2\" cylinders on a six inch stroke and each will pump approximately 3/4 gallons per minute, or roughly 200 gallons per hour. This small size of cylinder was selected especially so that in so far as was possible the pump would not take out water faster than the water would run in the well. Cylinders too large cause much trouble with air locks as has been experienced at the Gleichen School.\n\nFather Pratt evidently considered the pumps were delivering water too slowly or wanted to cut down the pumping time so they changed the hookup as described above, to have both pumps working all the time instead of one pump working all the time and the other pump sitting in only when the pressure fell to 32 pounds as originally adjusted.\n\nOn March 30th I again visited the school and accompanied by the agent, Colonel Lewis, the new Principal, and Mr. Berry, gave the layout a thorough inspection. Everything was found to be in order and working satisfactorily.\n\nThe hookup suggestion as submitted by a local plumber was found to be unnecessary as no water hammer was heard even when both pumps were operating at high pressure.\n\nIn conclusion I would point out that the adjustments controlling the operation of these installations should not be changed without the advice of some person who thoroughly understands the installation and would realize that there was nothing wrong with the installation that could not have been overcome with proper maintenance of the layout in its original adjustment. It can be expected that, occasionally an old rod or weak coupling will go, but this is strictly under the heading of maintenance, the rod might not have broken had the adjustment not been changed.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nW.H. [Signature]\nAssistant Engineer.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nReferring to your memorandum of March 10th in which you quote from a letter received from the Indian Agent regarding the operation of the new water system in the Ermineskin Residential School, I am forwarding herewith, for your information, a copy of a report received from Mr. Shelson, of our Engineering staff, who made an inspection on March 21st.\n\nYou will note that the water system is working satisfactorily and that any trouble that may have developed was due to local adjustments being made without expert advice, which threw the entire system out of balance.\n\nIt would appear that if the operating staff does not attempt any further adjustments, the system will continue to operate satisfactorily.\n\nDirector.\nMissionnaires Oblats de Marie Immacul\u00e9e\nAdministration Provinciale\n9015-110e Rue\nEdmonton - Alberta\n\nApril 13, 1939\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nAlready close to a full month has elapsed since we sent on to Ottawa a receipted bill of over $4000.00 which we paid to the Imperial Lumber of Ottawa for material for the Erminaskin Indian School of Hobbsma. We had expected that a cheque to the amount of $2400 would be immediately forthcoming, but have as yet received nothing. Would you kindly let me know if and when this cheque may be sent on to us as I do not presently that we could build unless this money does come as promised.\n\nI very much regret that the Department has not seen fit to increase the grant for Hobbsma for at least 175 children. There are practically 200 children of the Catholic faith on the reserve who should be in the school; the school is taking its limit by having 167 children in the present year refusing the school through lack of accommodation. I fear that if nothing is done here you will be forcing the Catholic children to go to the Protestant school at St-Albert and possibly preparing a dangerous issue. I shall later send in a detailed report on the situation unless something is done to remedy the very serious difficulties that will be met otherwise. I know that the Department has tried to be fair, and possibly meets objections from the Government owing to the enormous armaments program, but I do trust that you will help us solve this very serious problem of accommodation at Hobbsma.\n\nThanking you for past assistance and asking that a new investigation be carried out for this case of Hobbsma, I remain,\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nH. Rowthorne O.M.I., provincial.\nOttawa,\nApril 19, 1939.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 13th instant with reference to the amount of $2400.00 which the Department promised to allow toward the cost of the new addition at the Ermineskin Indian residential school.\n\nOwing to necessary adjustments that had to be made in our appropriation consequent upon the close of the fiscal year it has not been found possible to make the payment of $2400.00 but it is hoped that a cheque can be forwarded within the next two weeks.\n\nI regret that at the present time it is not possible to favourably consider your request for an increase in the pupilage at the Ermineskin school. Similar requests have been received from many other residential schools throughout the Dominion but owing to lack of funds such requests could not be allowed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. H. Routhier, O.M.I.,\nProvincial Oblate Order,\n9916 - 110th Street,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa,\nApril 19, 1939.\n\nDear Father Flourde:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd ultimo regarding the water system installed last fall at the Ermineskin Indian residential school Mr. Snelson of the engineering staff of the Surveys & Engineering Branch made another inspection on March 21. His report indicates that any trouble that may have developed was due to local adjustments being made by Mr. Berry or the school staff without expert advice. This threw the entire system out of balance.\n\nThe last paragraph of Mr. Snelson's report reads as follows:\n\n\"In conclusion I would point out that the adjustments controlling the operation of these installations should not be changed without the advice of some person who thoroughly understands the installation and would reiterate that there was nothing wrong with the installation that could not have been overcome with proper maintenance of the layout in its original adjustment. It is to be expected that, occasionally an old rod or a weak coupling will go, but this is strictly under the heading of maintenance, the rod might not have broken had the adjustment not been changed.\"\n\nIf you are communicating with the Principal it would be appreciated if you would point out to him that the system must not be re-adjusted without expert advice.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

It is also noted from the report that he again visited this school on March 30 and was accompanied by yourself.\n\nMr. Snelson considers that the water system is working satisfactorily and that any trouble that may have developed was due to local adjustments being made by Mr. Berry without expert advice.

All fittings shall be of best quality case iron, screw fittings, free from imperfections. Unions shall be installed wherever required and necessary. Where reduction in size of pipes occur, reducing fittings shall be used instead of flanges. Reductions of more than one size in steam mains shall be made by eccentric reducing couplings.\n\nThe ends of the pipes shall be reamed and filed, and all burrs removed from the interior of same. All joints shall be iron to iron joints tested steam tight and properly provided with expansion for expansion when installing all pipes. All necessary drips must be installed where required. Where local conditions require that a steam pipe be raised and dripped that shall be done even if not so shown on plans.\n\nHANGERS: All piping shall be supported or hung in a secure and approved manner. Pipes at ceiling shall be suspended by means of approved iron hangers in a neat and substantial manner.\n\nFLOOR FLANGES, SLEEVES: All openings thru ceilings, floors and partitions must be at least one-half inch larger than the outside diameter of the pipe and the pipes are to be kept fro the woodwork by approved floor sleeves and nickel-plated floor and ceiling plates.\n\nPIPING: The piping system shall be installed generally as shown on the plans. All steam tappings in boiler shell be used, each connected full size of tapping into a steam header from which all steam mains shall radiate. The steam header must be dripped to the return header at boiler thru an equalizing pipe of liberal size. The steam mains shall start with high points at the boiler and shall be graded in direction of steam flow with a fall of one inch per ten feet in ten feet. All lateral branches or spring pieces to risers and radiators shall be taken off top of steam main at forty-five (45) degrees, and shall be graded back towards the main with a fall of one-fourth inch per foot.\n\nThe end of each steam main shall be dripped in the manner indicated on the plans.\n\nAll horizontal steam supply branches, such as spring pieces to risers, offsets in steam risers and runouts to radiators, therefore necessarily must drain in a direction opposite to the steam flow; thus in each case be installed one size larger than the vertical pipes to which they connect, unless otherwise shown on plans, and must be graded with a fall of one-fourth (\u00bc) inch per foot. If such horizontal connections exceed eight feet in length, special attention must be given to their grade, and where the vertical pipes are one and one-fourth (1\u00bc) inches larger on less the horizontal pipes must be made two sizes larger when not otherwise shown on plans.\n\nThe return piping shall be installed as shown on the plans; shall be graded in the direction of flow with a fall of one-half (\u00bd) inch in 10 ft. toward the boiler, and shall be entirely free from sags or pockets. All branch connections are to be made into the top of same at 45 degree angles. The return piping is entirely independent of the drip or bleeder piping, and is to be connected to boiler only as hereinafter specified.\n\nRISERS: Risers are to be run concealed or in the open according to the desire of the owner, providing the Owner or Architect gives due and timely notice to the heating contractor when the building is being erected and will provide a place for said pipes when concealed. All reduction in riser sizes must be made at floor line or ceiling below. All risers must be properly supported and anchored.\n\nAll concealed piping must be capped or plugged and water pressure of at least 15 pounds applied and all leaks made tight when pipes are installed.\n\nThe radiator connections shall be run in floor construction wherever possible, each shall be taken off so that the expansion of riser can take place without lifting or tilting the radiator, or tapping any pipe so as to permit an accumulation of water.\nRADIATOR TRAPS AND VALVES. Each direct radiator shall be provided with a Thermostatic Radiator trap of suitable capacity installed at the return outlet, said outlet to be at low point of the radiator; and with a radiator valve installed at inlet connection located at top of the radiator.\n\nRADIATION. All radiation shall be installed as shown on the plans. Radiators located in front of windows shall be of such height that they will not extend above the window sills. All radiators shall be of hot water patter and provided with top capillary for inlet connection and with a one-half inch eccentric bushing in return tapping. All air valve tapplings shall be plugged, and radiation shall be wall under windows, in corridors and in basement. The radiation to be of a type approved by the Owner.\n\nGUARANTEE.

I believe that the total necessary cost would amount to a sum in the net neighborhood of $250.00.\n\nIt would be essential to you if you could help us obtain from Ottawa the choice of our own company who wishes to buy the heating & plumbing materials, as we & the school shall be financially responsible for the greater part of the amount to be expended.\n\nThanking you for present & past kindnesses & cooperation in best regards to Mrs Lewis, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely\n\nSigned H.

May I offer you my very sincere thanks.\n\nHowever he also mentions that the buying of the material will be done by the Department. Would it not be possible to do as we did when the question came up of buying the building material for the addition? We bought and paid and the Department is to refund the amount promised. The total cost of the plumbing and heating will probably amount to a sum in the neighborhood of $2500.00, the greater part of which, in so far as is now decided, will have to be paid by the school. Would it not preferable that you be given the choice of our Company, seeing that we shall have to pay the greatest part of the sum to be disbursed?\n\nI am including a copy of the specifications required for the heating and plumbing. Evidently if the Department agreed to furnish at its own charge all that is required, I would be only too pleased that they do the buying. Kindly let me know as soon as possible what you can do for us in allowing us to do our own buying.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMAY 15 1939\n\nALBERTA\nSir:\n\nEnclosed herewith please find copies of two letters received by me this A.M. requesting that the sum of $200.00 which has been appropriated for heating & plumbing at the new addition to Bighousek Residential school, be paid on account of an estimated expenditure of $250.00 which the total material would cost.\n\nI have no knowledge that this sum of money has been appropriated for this purpose, but only what Rev. Father Montier Principal of the Oblate Order for Alberta & Saskatchewan told me. He asked me if it would be possible for the Department to do the same thing next year, as they did with the lumber last year; that is, pay the $200.00 on the plumbing material account & the Oblate Order pay the balance. I asked him if he would write me regarding this & I would forward copy of his letter to Ottawa for consideration.\n\nI am also enclosing a copy of the Heating & Plumbing specifications, which was forwarded to me for your files.\n\nIf it is not yet at this information has been made, I would ask that the Indian Affairs Branch accede to the request of the Rev.

The heating and plumbing specifications have been submitted for our consideration and approval. Provision has been made in the current year's estimates for the sum of $900 at the Ermineskin school.

This was done, voucher No. 267 for the amount of $5.50 and No. 267a for the amount of $51.00.\n\nThe amount of $5.50 was incurred for a roll of friction tape to make a leak tight joint and a wheel for a Globe Valve to replace one broken, and with which the water from the pump house to the houses was controlled. This was for the pump at Farm 1, which supplies water to the Farm Inspector, Clerk and Nursing Station.\n\nThe amount of $51.00 was for the work supplying the Agent's House with water, also water for stock and horses. In February, the pipe in the well was found to be frozen and cracked after a severe blizzard. The plumber (Poveshell) cut in a new pipe and on its recommendation, a lamp was lighted installed, which was hung down the well and was turned on on very cold nights, to prevent re-occurrence of freezing.\n\nHoping that this explanation will be in order and that payment may now be made, please.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlfred J.J.

MCDERMID LUMBER CO., LTD.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to Reverend E. Rhesume, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nAddress: Ermineskin Residential School,\nHobbema, Alberta.\n\nAs shown by the attached receipted account,\nthe management of the Ermineskin Residential\nschool has expended for material required for\nrepairs and improvements an amount of $4,175.\nApproval has been received from the Honourable\nthe Minister for the Department to allow\ntowards the cost of the above an amount of ... $2,400.00\n\nAuthority for payment of this sum to the\nErmineskin Residential School, which is a\nchurch-owned building, was contained in\nP.F. 40/1628, of June 54, 1939.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and\nthat the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the\nsame is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\n\nVoucher No. DATE\nOttawa,\nJuly 7th., 1939.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your telegram of the 30th ultimo, a check for $2400.00 is being forwarded to the Ermineskin Residential School.\n\nI regret that there has been so much delay in forwarding this check, but it was due to circumstances beyond our control.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. Welfare & Training.\n\nVery Reverend H. Routhier,\n9916 110th Street,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nAGE T'S REPORT ON HORBEIA AGENCY JUNE 30th, 1939.\n\nI visited the Armineskin school on the 14th and inspected children in the classrooms. All appeared in good order. Elder girls were in dormitories repairing mattresses and sewing. All looked well and healthy. All children that had homes to go to were let out on the 30th for their annual holiday. A few children were being kept in school on account of having indifferent homes to go to. The new addition to the school is slow on account of rain. The exterior is now finished and the roof on, so that the work now should progress faster. It will be ready for occupancy when school opens on 1st September.\n\nA. G. B. Lewis,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir,\n\nBeing warned by the Rev. Father Plourde, of the return of the 5% on the per Capita Allowance, I cannot help thanking you personally and in the name of the Ermineskin School.\n\nBut as a favor pushes one to ask for an other, I dare again to solicit your help for the increase of the per Capita Grant for the number of our children which will be 200 in the coming September, and we are now receiving Grant only for 140.\n\nAfter my being here for 3 months I notice a great difference with the other schools of the Indian Department. It is a pity to see the old building at Hobema. Everyone is living in hope for a new school.\n\nLately with the help of Colonel Lewis Indian Agent for the Hobema Indian Agency, we succeeded to obtain a few acres of land from the Indians, to improve the school farm. We are also going to start soon to put on a working shop for vocational training for our big boys. Actually our school teacher is following a course of physical training, at Mount Royal College, Calgary, to be able to lead the young generation of Indians in physical development.\n\nWe want to work in cooperation with the Indian Department for the success of our school and for the welfare of the Indians.\n\nNow as the new addition to our School is nearly completed, would it be allowed to me to make another request for beds and school desks.\n\n1. Beds: 18 beds size 4 1/2 ft.\n   18 beds size 5 ft.\n   18 beds size 6 ft.\n\n2. Desks: One for teacher and 40 school desks (medium size)\n\nWith thanks once more\n\nI remain Yours truly,\n\nEd. Rheume O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nCopy sent to Mr. Lewis\n\nOttawa,\nJuly 26, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant with reference to matters which you consider require attention at the Ermineskin Indian residential school.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation a total amount of $2500.00 was provided for repairs, improvements and purchase of equipment. We have already forwarded you a cheque for $2400.00 which leaves a balance of $50.00. Owing to the present setup of our appropriation it is not possible for us to exceed the amount specifically mentioned in the appropriation. Under these circumstances the Department cannot purchase both the beds and the desks as their combined cost would exceed the amount available. Please let me know which you wish us to supply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. E. Rheaume, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nErmineskin Indian Residential School,\nHobbema, Alta.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to your letter of July the 20th 1939 (112-1-5) I wish first to thank you for the cheque of $2400.00 which I received from your department.\n\nIn reply to the choice you gave me between the beds and the desks, I wish to inform you that I did choose the beds to furnish the dormitory of our new addition.\n\nI was told that your inspector Mr. Snelson was here lately. Although I missed him I was told that he was satisfied with the work done on the new building.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEd.

The expenditure required by this requisition is strictly unavoidable and the public interest will suffer if it is not made.\n\nSIGNED\u2014\n\nAPPROVED\u2014\n\nDirector\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your 112-1-1 of the 16th September last, I beg to inform you that I have at last been able to get an electrician to come to the Ermineskin Indian Residential School and give me a price for a new fire gong and two break-glass alarms in the new dormitory connecting with the central alarm system.\n\nMr. Chapman of the Chapman Electrical Co. of Wetaskiwin came down accompanied by the salesman of Northern Electric Ltd., Edmonton, and recommended that a No. 8790 \"Benjamin Weatherproof Howler\" be attached to the outside wall and connected with the present alarm system installed in the school. Also that 2 break-glass alarms be installed in the dormitory of the new building, this also to be connected with the present fire alarm system.\n\nThe present alarm system in this school is totally inadequate in so far as gongs are concerned. Each dormitory has a small bell similar to a doorbell and when it rings, it makes about the same noise and distance and children who are rather tired, asleep, or ill, would hear it. The male staff whose duty would be to assist at a fire, live in a house about 50 yards away from the school building and would never hear an alarm. This howler would be heard for a quarter of a mile.\n\nI am also asking for a No. 66 \"Edwards Transformer\", so that the system can be operated from the Calgary Power Company energy instead of the present dry cell operation. Last week the dry cells were dead and consequently there was no power for the fire alarm system. This is too dangerous to be allowed to continue.\n\nI am attaching Form 37/1 in the amount of $46.79 for material, and a Form No. 37/1 in the amount of $30.95 being the cost for labour, and 20% to cover the cost of freight, express and handling charges, which is the customary charge.\n\nI have done this as Mr. Chapman put himself out to come down here and give us an estimate on the job. I would like to see him get the work so I will make each regulation come under $50.00 although I explained to Mr. Chapman that if he came and estimated on the work, he may not necessarily get the contract.\n\nThe only firm on the list in Wetaskiwin shown as Electricians, is Templeman Bros., and they do electrical work on pressure pumps, etc., and not house wiring. They are really plumbers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlfred G. B. Lewis,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nNovember 27, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant you may arrange for the installation of a fire alarm system at the Ermineskin Indian residential school. It is noted that the cost of the material will be $46.79 and that the cost of the labour will be $30.95. Separate accounts should be submitted for the material and the labour. In connection with the freight, express and handling charges receipts should be attached to the voucher which you submit.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A.G.B.

Fr. Plourde from Winnipeg that it is time to send our requirements in Ottawa, I beg to ask your Department for help in our farming outfit.\n\nI have already asked Colonel Lewis, Indian Agent at Hobbema, for a Hammer Mill and swings for the children's play ground, which I consider most important for the school at the present time.\n\nBut with the reducing of the Per Capita Grant the problem becomes greater for us. Since these last two years, we have done our best to improve our farm at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. I must mention that not a single acre of land was ever given by the Indian Department for our School. After many difficulties we finally succeeded in obtaining 80 acres of land from the Indians.\n\nEverything was done in regular form with the Indian Agent. We now have 160 acres in all.\n\nFarming is emphasized in our big boys' training. Our girls milk the cows, take care of the chickens and look after the garden.\n\nIn order to be able to give our boys the farm training they most essentially need, I am asking your department for the most important implements required on a farm: gang plow, a disk drill, a cultivator and a harrow. A machinery shed is badly needed and our root cellar needs repairing.\n\nBeing fully aware of the difficulties of the present times, we cannot however forget the training that our children require in order that they may become good and useful citizens of Canada. You may rest assured dear Sir, that we are doing our utmost towards the education of our Indian children, both for their moral and material good.\n\nI remain yours very truly,\n\nEd.

Phelan\n\nI have been requested to write you concerning the condition of the fire escape installation of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. Rev. Father Rheaume, the Principal, is very anxious to safeguard the life of all the children under his care.\n\nWith the present installation it is doubtful if the children can be awakened quickly enough and make their exit from the building in safety.\n\nAs both the Department and ourselves are very anxious to cooperate in a matter of this kind, would it not be advisable for you to have your Agent at Ermineskin examine the fire exit and safety appliances and report on same. In this way if a fire would take place, we would have the satisfaction to know that all precautionary measures had been taken.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSEP 22 1941\nOttawa,\nSeptember 24, 1941.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant with reference to the fire escapes at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. The funds provided for this school have already been expended and as it is a Church-owned school the amount provided in the current year's appropriation cannot be exceeded.\n\nHowever, I am writing to the Indian Agent requesting him to submit a report.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 24, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Principal of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School has brought to the attention of the Department the condition of the fire escapes.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would make a careful inspection of these fire escapes and report on their condition. If possible you should let me have an estimate of the cost of improving them if improvements are necessary. For your information I may add that the amount provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at this school has now been expended and as a consequence it is impossible to make any further expenditure. However, if new fire escapes are necessary it might be possible to consider providing the funds in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1942-43.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A.G.B. Lewis,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge your 112-1-5 of the 24th instant, advising me that the Principal of the Ermine-skin Indian Residential School had brought to the attention of the Department the condition of the fire escapes.\n\nI inspect this school, when pupils are in residence, once each month, and at each inspection pay particular attention to the fire escapes and hose, and was more than surprised to receive your letter informing me that the Principal had notified the Department that a condition existed, which required attention, in the fire escapes. He did ask, however, that the buzzer system be extended to the new wing of the school, which I have included in my 1942-43 Estimates.\n\nI interviewed the Principal today, and he informed me that he has never made any complaint regarding fire escapes at his school, but that he had referred the matter of the buzzer to Reverend Father Plouard, O.M.I., and he is of the opinion that the Reverend Father must have misunderstood his letter, and had written to the Department complaining about the condition of the fire escapes.\n\nAll buildings used by pupils and staff are equipped with the pole system of fire escape, and the children and staff are practiced in fire drill and ladder interwale, either the Principal or myself turning on an alarm. There is, however, a counter-balanced stairway at the rear of the building, which is used by the girls in fire drill, the boys using the poles. These stairs are made of wood, with rope attached to the counter-balance weight, which lower the stairs to the ground in case of a person being on the top. They seem to be adequate, but could be dangerous in case of a fire taking hold and burning through the ropes and catching the stairs, which as I have remarked, are of lumber construction, albeit, but when the building got to this state other means of exit would have to be found anyway.\n\nIf it is the intention of the Department to install a buzzer at once, I will get prices and submit them for your approval, please.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlfred G. B. Lewis,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo and note that you consider the fire escapes at the Ermineskin Residential School are reasonably satisfactory.\n\nThe amount provided in the current year's appropriation for the Ermineskin School has been expended and consequently it is not possible to consider the immediate purchase of a buzzer system in the new wing. You might, however, obtain prices for this and submit them to us so that we will have definite information on our file.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A.G.B.

Lewis,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nHobbema, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe wish to quote you the following price for proposed work to be done at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School at Hobbema.\n\nWe agree to build 60 lin of brick chimney 8x8 flue lined with flue lining - flashing - thimbles - cut openings and repair woodwork behind chimney, as well as replace broken siding on table of laundry building for the sum of $153.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRevelstoke Sawmill Co., Ltd.,\nPer \"G. Paulsen\"\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 15th, and in reply to your last paragraph beg to report that I had Mr. Paulson, the manager of the Revelstoke Sawmill Co., Ltd., and Mr. Sorenson, the local bricklayer, inspect the lumber at the Kutenai Indian Residential School, and find that in certain buildings from top to bottom, it was their opinion that the lining of the building with a fire-proofing material was out of the question. As due to the constant vibration of the walls caused by the pulley shaft which runs the machinery, it would not remain in position, and would cause endless trouble after it had been attached. It was first thought that Gyp-rock Plaster Board might be suitable.\n\nAfter a thorough examination of the building, it was decided that the building would not present a serious fire hazard if the old chimney, one of which had been torn down to get at the fire which had broken out in the woodwork behind it, were rebuilt; as that apparently was where all the trouble originated. The constant vibration of the building had shaken the mortar loose between the bricks, allowing the fire to escape through the chinks, and eventually set fire to the woodwork. Only one chimney is now available for the different stove and boiler-room buildings, and the large number of stove pipes criss-crossing through both the upstairs and downstairs rooms makes it dangerous as it is at present, and it is recommended that the old chimney be rebuilt, and proper tile chimney lining installed, and that the chimney flue be built up from the floorboards all the basement up to its present position, which is resting on a wooden shelf, and that they be left standing by themselves and not built flush to the wall. If this is done, it is considered that this building will not be any greater fire hazard than any other frame building used for laundry purposes.\n\nThe Revelstoke Sawmill Co., Ltd., in co-operation with Mr. Sorenson, who is the brick layer and plasterer on our preferred list, have offered to do this work for the sum of $53.00. Copy of their tender is attached hereto, and I would ask that if the Department is agreed to do this work, that I be given authority to have the work done at the price quoted.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlfred J.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. E. Rheaume, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nErmineskin Indian Residential School,\nHobbema, Alta.\nERMINESKIN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nHOBEMA, ALTA. May the 14th.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs favorable weather draws nearer we are anxious to know if any money will be granted towards the construction of a new building to house our laundry machinery.\n\nThe sooner we can be assured of it the quicker and the more economically we may obtain the material necessary to start the building, so as to have it completed before the cold sets in the fall.\n\nReverend Father H. Routhier Provincial of the Oblate Fathers for the Province of Alberta, assures that the balance needed for the construction of this building will be supplied by the \"Missionary Funds of the Oblate Fathers\".\n\nHoping to receive a favorable answer,\n\nI remain, yours truly,\n\nEd. Rheume O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\nOttawa,\nMay 18, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, in which you again request the construction of a new laundry.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would again discuss this matter with Indian Agent Lewis. As you are aware, he visited the school in March in company with Mr. Paulson, of the Revelstoke Sawmill Company, and Mr. Sorenson, a plasterer; and at that time they inspected the laundry building. They recommended the erection of a new chimney and authority for this work was given to the Agent in a letter dated April 7 last.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. E. Rheaume, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nErmineaskin Indian Residential School,\nHobbema, Alta.\nSir:\n\nReference your 112-1-5 of the 7th of April last, authorizing me to instruct the Redclayton Sandhill Company to build chimneys in the laundry at the Bruneau Indian Residential School; I beg to report that on receipt of your letter arrangements were immediately made to carry out the work and materials were transported to the job, but the Reverend Father Shemane, Principal, instructed the men not to start the work.\n\nFather Shemane informed me that he had a letter from Rev. Father Flosenda informing him that there was a reasonable possibility that a sum would be voted for his laundry, and until this is definitely settled, he does not wish the chimneys proceeded with.\n\nHe also informs me that Rev. Father Routier, Principal of his Order for Alberta, has told him that if the Department allows the money for the material for a new laundry, he will supply the necessary financial assistance to pay for the labour.\n\nAs it is getting increasingly difficult to get workmen, as they are all very busy, I would appreciate it very much if this situation could be settled immediately, so that either the chimneys can be built while I can still get bricklayers, or the new laundry approved, and the school make their own arrangements for the necessary labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlfred G. B. Lewis,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nMay 19, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, in connection with the laundry building at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. A letter about the same matter was received from the Principal yesterday and in reply he was requested to consult you.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation an amount of $1000.00 was provided for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at this school. If the school authorities consider the laundry building the most pressing necessity, we have no objection to expending the money for that purpose. I note from your letter that if the Department supplied the material the school management would be responsible for all labour. You should again confer with the Principal and ascertain his wishes definitely and, if it is decided to proceed with the laundry, you should forward a requisition for the material required. I presume it is unnecessary for me to say that detailed information should be given about all material in order that purchase may be made by our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A.G.B. Lewis,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nSir:\n\nReference your 112-1-5, dated May 19, 1942, regarding the laundry building at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School; I have several times interviewed Rev. Father Riemer regarding this matter. Some time ago he informed me that Rev. Father Emchler, Principal of the Oblate Order, had approved the erection of a one story building, 30 x 60, with three rooms at the back of the building, one to be used for the farm instructor, one for the nightwatchman, and the third room for a shoe repair shop. The main building will be divided down the center, the right half to be used as a laundry building, and the left half for a drying and ironing room, and the church authorities have decided to use the current year's appropriation of $1,000.00 as part of the expenses in constructing this building.\n\nI would like to point out that it is necessary to install an extension of our fire alarm system to the new dormitory building, and also to the building in which the nuns' dormitories are situated, and also to the inside end at the rear of the main building, as at night when the fire alarm is turned on a number of the staff complain that they do not hear the buzzer which is outside and probably cannot be heard in the rooms at the rear of the building when people are asleep.\n\nAn estimate for this work would have been forwarded long ago, but it has been impossible to get the only electrician in town down to give us an estimate of the cost of this work. As soon as Mr. Chapman can be persuaded to come here and estimate for this work it will be forwarded. This extension of the alarm system is absolutely necessary in my opinion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlfred S. B. Lewis,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nAugust 3, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, in connection with the laundry building at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. In your letter of May 14 you stated that if the Department supplied the material the school management would be responsible for the labour. I should, therefore, appreciate your forwarding a requisition for the material at the earliest possible date, in order that we may place the matter in the hands of our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Your request for purchase of material at a cost not exceeding $1000.00 was submitted to the Minister's office, but before favourable consideration can be given the following assurances are required:\n\n1. That in the event of the Department providing material at a cost of $1000.00, the balance of the cost will be borne by the Church authorities and the Department will not be requested, at any time in the future, to provide any further amount than the material costing $1000.00;\n\n2. In the event of the laundry building being constructed at the present time, is the laundry machinery at present in the school sufficient? If the Department decides to favourably consider buying material costing $1000.00 for this laundry building, it will be on the distinct understanding that we will not be asked to supply additional laundry equipment.\n\nI am sending this letter by air mail and would appreciate your replying in the same manner in order that further consideration may be given to the matter when your reply is received.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

You recently submitted requisitions for the material required.\n\nOn reviewing our files it is found that on April 7 we authorized Indian Agent Lewis to expend an amount of $153.00 in the erection of a chimney at the Ermineskin Residential School. We have not received any definite information from the Agent to the effect that this chimney was erected. Consequently, until we know whether or not the amount was expended, we can only authorize the balance provided; namely, $847.00. Under the circumstances we wired you today authorizing the expenditure of $847.00 for materials for the laundry. Please let me know if the amount authorized in official letter of April 7 was expended or not.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. E.

These bricks still unused have been charged to the account of the Oblate Fathers.\n\nHoping that this will clarify the situation, we remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nEd. Rheaume,\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. R.A.

Subsequently, it was decided to approve the erection of a new laundry and in this regard I would refer you to official letter of October 22, 1942. I am now advised that while the chimneys were not erected, brick to the value of $54.00 were secured from the Revelstoke Sawmills Company Limited. If these bricks are not required, it is possible that the firm will take them back; but if they are needed at the school, you may submit a voucher covering their cost. In your letter of May 14 you mentioned that some material had been transported to the school, and I presume that you refer to the brick.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A.G.B.

Residential School to arrange for purchase and delivery of material required for the construction of a laundry building. In that memorandum you authorized an expenditure of $847.00 and I am under the impression that this amount was authorized in view of the contents of official memorandum of September 28, 1942, in which you were advised that out of the amount of $1000.00 provided in the current year's appropriation for repair and improvements at this school a sum of $355.00 had been spent. As a matter of fact, while the latter amount, namely, $153.00, had been authorized, subsequent developments made it unnecessary to expend this amount. As a consequence we have not expended any of the total amount of $1000.00 provided in the current year's appropriation. The account which is attached amounts to $1000.00 and, if possible, we would like to have authority to pay the full amount. It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid, either at the $1000.00 or at the amount mentioned in your memorandum of October 17, 1942.\n\nThe coding is as follows: 754-77-10-691.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThe Imperial Lumber Company, Limited\n\nESTIMATE\n\nYard\n\nFor Mr.\n\nOccupation\n\nP.

This is the unexpended balance of the original appropriation of $1,000. for this school for the current fiscal year.\n\n(b) That authority to build the laundry be granted on the distinct understanding that the church authorities will be responsible for payment of the balance of the cost of material amounting to approximately $705.85, and for payment of any labour charges involved in the construction of the building.\n\nN.J.

Your request for purchase of material at a cost not exceeding $1000.00 was submitted to the Minister's office, but before favourable consideration can be given the following assurances are required:\n\n1. That in the event of the Department providing material at a cost of $1000.00, the balance of the cost will be borne by the Church authorities and the Department will not be requested, at any time in the future, to provide any further amount than the material costing $1000.00;\n\n2. In the event of the laundry building being constructed at the present time, is the laundry machinery at present in the school sufficient? If the Department decides to favourably consider buying material costing $1000.00 for this laundry building, it will not be asked to supply additional laundry equipment.\n\nI am sending this letter by air mail and would appreciate your replying in the same manner in order that further consideration may be given to the matter when your reply is received.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Residential School to arrange for purchase and delivery of material required for the construction of a laundry building. In that memorandum you authorized an expenditure of $847.00 and I am under the impression that this amount was authorized. A review of the contents of official memorandum of September 28, 1942, in which you were advised that out of the amount of $1000.00 provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at this school a sum of $153.00 had been spent. As a matter of fact, while the latter amount, namely, $153.00, had been authorized, subsequent developments made it unnecessary to expend this amount. As a consequence we have not expended any of the total amount of $1000.00 provided in the current year's appropriation. The account which is attached amounts to $1000.00 and, if possible, we would like to have authority to pay the full amount. It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid, either at the $1000.00 or at the amount mentioned in your memorandum of October 17, 1942.\n\nThe coding is as follows: 754-77-10-691.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nERMINESKIN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nHOBEMA, ALTA, March the 31st, 1943\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThis is to inform you that our night watchman had been performing his duty conscientiously during the month of March 1943.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEd.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. dated 12/3/43.\n\nVoucher No.: 4\n\nDate: 21st April, 1943\nDear Sir:\n\nWe would be very much obliged if the Department could consider giving us a grant for the construction of a hog house.\n\nAt present we have no hog house. All we have are old buildings that are practically falling to pieces, poorly located, cold in winter and under water at spring time.\n\nWith our present accommodation 3 sows only can be cared for, and only summer hogs can be raised. Last winter due to poor location one complete litter was lost. If we had a proper piggery winter hogs could be raised, and as hog prices are higher in winter than in summer this would help us out on the financial side as well as providing meat for our school.\n\nWith the help we now have (i.e., boys working at barns as part of manual training) we could increase our stock of 3 sows to 12 or 15. This would give better returns and help balance market supply.\n\nI have taken the initiative of sending tenders to two lumber yard firms at Wetaskiwin, our nearest business point, which I enclose herewith. I thought my action would save valuable time later on, if the Department would grant our request.\n\nI hope the Department will look favorably on our request, and at the same time this will enable us to do our share in full out war effort of providing bacon for our Armed Forces, and the needy of war stricken areas.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nL.C.

Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Canada.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, September 24, 1943.\n\nDear Father Schmidt:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 21st instant, in which you seek information with respect to the assistance that might be rendered by the Department, should you decide to proceed with the construction of a piggery at your school.\n\nThe records here indicate that the sum of $1,000.00 was provided in the 1943-44 estimates for repairs and the purchase of equipment at the Ermineskin School. It is my understanding that this amount in full will be required to meet expenditures already incurred in the construction of the laundry building. I regret to state, therefore, that it will not be possible to assist you in the construction of a piggery at any time during the present fiscal year. This is a matter, however, that might very well be discussed with the Inspector of Indian Agencies and brought up for review when the 1944-45 estimates are under consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend Camille Schmidt, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nErmineskin Indian Residential School,\nHobbema, Alberta.\nOttawa,\nOctober 14, 1943.\n\nEX'D.\nA.\n\nDear Father Schmidt:\n\nIn writing to you on September 24, I overlooked the fact that the money for the repairs to the laundry had been paid from our appropriation for the fiscal year 1942-43 and consequently there is still available in the current year's appropriation an amount of $1000.00. As Ermineskin is a Church-owned school, we can only expend at it the amount specifically provided. The least of the two quotations which you forwarded and which are enclosed with this letter is $1233.95. It would be appreciated if you would have these estimates revised and only submit quotations on the quantity of materials that can be secured for $1000.00. This will mean eliminating a number of the items shown on the quotations.

These are to be repaired immediately. Some of the hose leaked at the valves and couplings. These require washers and this will also taken immediately. Metal fire extinguishers are missing and glass balls containing a red liquid are substituted. These I consider inadequate.\n\nFire Alarm System.\n\nFire alarm bells in the dormitories are too small and are inefficient, larger bells should be installed. There is no alarm system in the new dormitory. There is no alarm system in the Sister's house and the Priest's house. They would not know if a fire occurred but would have to be informed by messenger. The electric Siren installed here is not loud enough for this purpose. In this connection, I have tried for over a year to induce the Electrician in Wetaskiwin to come down and give me an estimate and suggestion for improving this system. He informs me that he has more work than he can handle and does not know when he can come.\n\nGeneral.\n\nThere are two doors in the girls dormitories, which open on to the same platform. These open against one another, blocking the exit from the smaller girls dormitory. This particular escape is a wooden stairway and should not be used for fire escape purposes. I believe a thorough inspection by a competent engineer should be made of these buildings.\n\nAlfred G.B. Lewis\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nDecember 7, 1943.\n\nMr. A.G.B. Lewis, Indian Agent, Hobbema, Alta.\n\nI have your recent letter with reference to fire protection at the Ermineskin Residential School. I note that you are arranging for repairs to the valves and couplings of the fire hose. If you consider more fire extinguishers are required, please let me know the number that you think should be purchased. You should make another attempt to have the electrician give you an estimate on the cost of installing an additional fire alarm system. We will endeavour to have the school examined by an official of the Surveys & Engineering Branch as soon as possible, but, owing to shortage of staff and the many duties that they are called upon to perform at the present time, it is doubtful if this visit will occur in the near future. In the meantime you should take whatever action you feel is desirable to guard against fire hazard. I refer particularly to the two doors in the girls' dormitories which open on the same platform.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nDecember 7, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Ermineskin Indian Residential School,\nHobbema Indian Agency.\n\nThis school is located approximately 55 miles South of Edmonton and the Indian Agent expressed the desire to have an engineer visit the school with a view to suggesting action that should be taken to decrease fire hazards. It would be appreciated if you would have one of your officials visit this school as soon as convenient and submit a report.\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Ermineskin Indian Residential School\nHobbema Indian Agency, Alberta.\n\nYour memorandum of December 7th last relative to the above was referred to our Engineering and Construction Service for attention.\n\nOur Architect, Mr. Buck, has consulted Mr. Phelan by telephone regarding the matter and the latter furnished him with a copy of extracts from a letter from Indian Agent G. B. Lewis, giving further details.\n\nThe specific items mentioned were defective fire fighting equipment, necessity for an improved and enlarged fire alarm system, the condition of doors of the girls' dormitories opening upon the fire escape and the fact that the fire escape was made of wood.\n\nOn considering the items of repair and improvement to fire fighting and fire alarm equipment, it would appear that they are of a nature which could be as well looked after by the school principal and the Indian Agent as by one of our Engineering Staff.\n\nWhile we have no plan of this school it would seem probable that the difficulty regarding the doors from the girls' dormitories could be overcome by changing the hinges on one of the doors to its other side. With regard to the wooden fire escape, such are in quite general use even in recently erected buildings and in any event, iron fire escapes are not available at the present time.\n\n(over)\nWith the foregoing in mind, it would seem that a special inspection by one of our Engineers at the present time is hardly warranted. However, the Banff Office of our Engineering and Construction Service is being advised that when next an officer is in the vicinity of the Hobbema Agency he should visit the school and report on any matters requiring technical consideration.\n\nJ.M. Waddell,\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 8, 1944.\n\nMr. A.G.B. Lewis, Indian Agent, Hobbema, Alta.\n\nWith reference to my letter of the 7th ultimo, replying to your letter regarding fire protection at the Ermineskin School, I trust that you have found it possible to carry out the instructions already given to you.\n\nThe contents of your letter were also submitted to the Surveys & Engineering Branch and at the present time they have no one available to send to the school, but it is promised that when an officer is next in the vicinity of the Hobbema Agency he will visit the school. You have not advised me if you consider more fire extinguishers are required.\n\nThe difficulty regarding the doors from the girls' dormitories could be overcome by changing the hinges on one of the doors to its other side. With regard to the wooden fire escape, I am advised that such are in quite general use even in recently erected buildings and, in any event, iron fire escapes are not available at the present time.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nReference your 112-1-5 of the 7th December, 1934.\n\nI beg to report that I have, in company with the Rev. Principal, made a further survey of the girls' dormitory and have arranged for \"fire drill\" as follows: First, permanently close the door leading out of the Sisters' cell in the N.W. corner of the Senior Girls' Dormitory. On the \"fire alarm\" sounding the bell, 24 children located in the Junior Girls' Dormitory will take charge of the juniors and lead them either to the outside fire escape on the east side of the building, or to the pole fire escape on the north side or any other exit we may be considered necessary to the occasion, as directed by the Captain in charge of the floor. Drill will be made elastic, and exits must be kept open in conformity with the position of the supposed fire. It is stressed that on occasion it may be possible to use the fire alarms installed in the Senior Girls' Dormitory, but will prevent \"fire drill\" from becoming stereotyped, and in case of a real fire the children will not expect to use the same exit, which may be cut off on account of flames from the floors below, but will use the exits as directed by the Captain of the floor.\n\nThese dormitories are in the roof and all windows are of the \"Dorman\" type. On the west side a verandah roof projects from the exterior wall level with the floor of the dormitory along the south half of the building, and along the north half of the building on the east side, which makes an installation of a fire escape in the Senior Girls' Dormitory if not impossible, a very arrangement undesirable in a building. This new arrangement, while allowing for the evacuation of the children to some extent, will work perfectly well when they have had a few drills. At a drill held by the Principal, the school was evacuated in three minutes. I am enclosing a rough plan of this floor to help you visualize what I mean.\n\nI have written a letter to the electrician, pointing out to him the seriousness of not having an adequate \"alarm\" system in our school, and how much more important it is to ensure the safety of our children than that some individual should have light on his front porch, but so far have had no reply although I wrote over two weeks ago. Would it not be possible to obtain a \"trinity\" for this work, which would force this man to attend to this very necessary and urgent matter.\n\nWith regard to \"Fire Extinguishers\" I would respectfully suggest that the small glass extinguishers be removed from their present position in the school building and installed in the following buildings, which at present have no fire fighting equipment:\n\nSchool Workshop\nHitchams House\nChurch\nInfants House\nLaundry\nPantry\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nI estimate 22 Fire Extinguishers (Metal) should be procured to be distributed as follows:\n\n**Basement:**\n- 6 Extinguishers needed.\n- Storage Room: 1\n- Bread Room: 1\n- Small Boys Refectory: 1\n- Boiler Room: 1\n\n**First Floor:**\n- 10 Extinguishers needed.\n- Kitchen: 1 - Indian Parlour: 1\n- Big Girls recreation hall: 1\n- Grade 3 Class Room: 1, Grade 2: 1\n- Grade 1a: 1 - Boys Class Room: 1\n- Community Room: 1 - Dining Room: 1\n- Parlour: 1\n\n**Second Floor:**\n- 5 Extinguishers needed.\n- Infirmary: 1 - Chapel: 1 - Sewing Room: 1\n- Sisters Dormitory: 1 - 2nd: 1\n\n**Third Floor:**\n- 3 Extinguishers needed.\n- Senior Girls Dormitory: 1\n- Intermediate Girls Dormitory: 1\n- Junior Girls Dormitory: 1\n\n**Attic:**\n- 1 Extinguisher needed.\n\nIn my opinion these extinguishers are absolutely necessary as many an incipient blaze has been brought under control by the prompt use of these, that otherwise might have proved a very serious fire.\n\n[Signature]\nAlfred G.B. Lewis,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 10, 1944.\n\nMr. A.G.B. Lewis, Indian Agent, Hobbema, Alta.\n\nI am in receipt of your very complete report of the 5th instant regarding the action you have taken to minimize fire hazards at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School.\n\nI regret that I am not aware of any action that could be taken to force the electrician at Wetaskiwin to inspect your fire alarm system. Possibly you should endeavour to secure some other electrician, even though you have to bring him from Edmonton.\n\nThere is such a demand for fire extinguishers in buildings occupied by the Armed Forces that it is difficult to secure this equipment in the numbers that you request. However, our Purchasing Branch believes that they can secure at an early date 12 - 1 qt. fire extinguishers and a request is being placed with them for that number.\n\nI would like to know the size and number of the fire extinguishers at present in this school. I would also like to know the approximate length of the hose mentioned in your letter of early December. I presume you have already arranged for repairs to the valves and couplings of this hose.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Ermineskin Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 77 ALLOTMENT 12-415 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

The danger of having this door thus placed is that the big girls may slam the small girls fire escape door closed thus leaving the little girls with only one way of escape, that of using the pipe (fire escape) the small boys use on the second floor below.\n\nBig boys dormitory\n\nOne (pipe fire escape) located on the east side of the building. Hopes are also to be found in this dormitory but the boys do not use them in fire practice till as it burns their hands. The Indian agent has looked the set up over with me, and we have come to this understanding: Have the big girls use the same fire escape door as the little girls, the reason for this is that each big girl has to supervise or be in charge of a little girl during the fire practice. While his way of acting will eliminate one door it is true, but it will at the same time assure that the door on the small girls dormitory will not be slammed closed, trapping the little ones inside.\n\nAs for the water hooks there are 11 hooks to be found in the school, all have been checked over carefully.\n\nThe only fire extinguishers to be found are those of acid liquid in glass containers, so I know they these are not sufficient for fire protection.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nMr. H.A.

No doubt Indian Agent Lewis has already shown you our letters of the 8th and 10th instant. At the present time we are placing an order for 12 - 1 quart fire extinguishers.\n\nIf Mr. Lewis is unable to secure the services of an electrician to fix the wiring I thought that you might be able to arrange for one of the Brothers of your Order who is competent to do this work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I am afraid my report on Fire Protection attached to the November \"Agents Report\" could not have been very clear, as I did not intend to ask for more hose.\n\nThere are 17 small globular glass containers, hanging in wire racks, each holding about a pint of a red coloured liquid, these are to be thrown into the fire. There were at one time, according to the inventory, some metal fire extinguishers, but I am informed that one of the Principals (I believe Rev. Father Pratt C.M.S.) traded these for the present glass extinguishers.\n\nRegarding the Electrician. Unless the Metaskwai man does something very soon I will try to get a man from Edmonton, but it may be a job to induce a man to come all this distance just to give an estimate, without being assured he would get the work.\n\nThanks for the 12 - 1 qt. fire extinguishers you are having the Purchasing Branch procure for us. I will distribute these where they will be most useful.\n\n[Signature]\nAlfred G. B.

School - is a very old building, entirely unsuitable, and in my opinion a dangerous fire hazard. If a fire were to break out in the middle of the night with the temperature below zero there is no doubt but that there would be a serious loss of life amongst the Sisters and the children. The place was spotlessly clean and the remodelled clothing and articles of handicraft were as good as anything yet seen.\n\nJ.K. Morris,\nWelfare Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nThe Reverend Principal of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School called on me today and said that he had received a letter from the Rev. Father Plouard informing him that a sum of money had been set aside for repairs and improvements to the school and that if he had not already been notified of the amount, to get in touch with his Indian Agent and get him to write the Department about it.\n\nRev. Father Rueux wishes me to ask if he will be authorized to spend the sum of $400.00 on the girls' toilet, which has been included in the 1945-46 Estimates, and the sum of $600.00 to build a granary, which was also included in next year's estimates.\n\nRegarding the girls' toilet. The present building is very old and is falling down, the wood being rotten and it is not possible to prop it up as nails won't hold in the structure. It is the intention of the school to build a new toilet and install a flush system and connect it with the present septic tank. This will be more sanitary than the old earth closet now in use and in my opinion should be done as early as possible.\n\nThis school has extended its farming operations and the new granary is required to house the grain from the school farm.\n\nAlfred G. B. Lewis,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 31, 1944.\n\nMr. A.G.B. Lewis, Indian Agent, Hobbema, Alta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th instant, it was only found possible to include an amount of $450 in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Brineskin Residential School. It is noted that approximately $400 will be required to replace the girls' toilet.

Lewis,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThere is at the Hobbema Indian Agency a Progressive Club. This Club was founded by Rev. Father Rheume O.M.I., an R.C.A.F., stationed overseas.\n\nThe objective of the Club is \"Progress in every line\", be it in relation to God, in healthful living, in the homes, on the farms or in the relations with fellow neighbours, all to tend towards the well being and the progress of the community.\n\nThe members of this club are taught that before they can progress they must first of all accomplish their fundamental duties towards God, towards their country, towards their immediate dependents and towards their fellow citizens.\n\nIt is not however enough to remind them what those duties are, we must help them in their struggle for improvement.\n\nThis is done:\n\nA. By lectures! These lectures are followed by open discussion on a subject of actual and well proposed interest. By these lectures we aim to re-educate or continue the education of the members. By these lectures we aim to open their eyes to the deficiencies, to expose the defects and backwardness existing amongst them above all we try to make realize that they can achieve success as well as their white neighbours and that one day if they persevere in their efforts, they will be as good and as useful citizens as any of the other component parts of our Canadian nation.\n\nB. Open forum another means of educating the members of our club is the discussion in open forum of a topic presented at the opening of a meeting. (no member knows what the subject will be till he hears it from the Chaplain) this is done in view of having the members grasp a subject at point blank range and be able to understand it, discuss it thoroughly without preparation and use it then have to do daily. This way of doing shows the Indian that he has an intelligence and that it has a purpose other than giving in blindly to everything without understanding.\n\nThese two first points may be considered as the more serious or intellectual activity of the club.\n\nC. Another means of educating our Indians is Movies. Even though our Club has been in existence for only four years it has already felt the results of its good work. The Club has already organized different forms of entertainment some of which bring financial revenues which enables the Club to sponsor movies. The Club has purchased its own sound motion projector of $450.00 and has paid its first bill of $35.00. It can really be said that the good example of the members of the Club amongst which we have the two chiefs and two councillors is already making others take notice.\n\nTo-date all meetings of the Club have been held in either the boys recreation hall or in a class room at the Ermineskin Indian School, this way of acting has been found very unpracticable by;\n\nOver.\nContinued.\n\n1. The school staff: If lectures are held during school hours some pupils are without instruction; if lectures are held at night the school ground becomes the meeting place of hooligans and disorder reigns in the dormitories.\n\n2. Boredom for members: Most members enjoy and like to be interested but they are not so much interested in coming to club meetings and at the same time act as Sergeant at Arms to too many who flock around the school with aim of disturbing the school children, especially the big girls.\n\nThe movies are given every Monday night at the Hobema Garage, to-date much difficulty has been encountered with the man who actually runs the garage. This garage has been remodelled and is used exclusively for dances and shows when the Club first started holding shows at the Hobema Hall. Garage rent was $5.00(three dollars) a night, then the rent was raised to $5.00 (five dollars) a night; now it is up to $6.00(six dollars) a night plus 25% profits above the first $2.00(twenty dollars) the new hall was uncleaned(claimed the owner) after every show. Now a janitor has been appointed and a salary of $1.00(one dollar) has to be paid him. The promised eighty five dollars ($85.00) has been paid in rent to-date.\n\nFaced with all these difficulties, the members of the Hobema Indian Progressive Club, have resolved at a regular meeting that a hall should be built.\n\nPurpose of said Hall.\n\nA. Band and council meetings, for which no fee will be charged.\nB. Regular and extraordinary meetings of the Club.\nC. Shows.\nD. Wedding dinners and wedding dances, a fee will be charged by the Club for such gatherings.\nE. All other dances will be held in the hall for which a fee will be charged.\n\nLet it be noted that the Club has also resolved in one of its meetings that a Sergeant at Arms, member of the Club, shall be responsible for good order during dances and other gatherings in said hall.\n\nThe Hall is not being built by the management of the Ermineskin Residential School, the hall is built by the Club members themselves, each member has given a personal donation toward this end, the balance of the money comes from Club revenues, membership fees, show collections. It has also been resolved that no band, nor any member of the Club has any personal title to the hall, the hall is being built, owned and operated by THE HOBERMA INDIAN PROGRESSIVE CLUB.\n\nSigned, Rev. Father L.C. Schmidt O.M.I.\nHobbema, Alberta,\nMarch 14th, 1945.\n\nAIRMAIL.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nIn reply to your 112-1-5 dated February 19th, 1945, and your 112-1-5 dated March 8th, 1945 regarding a proposed building to be erected by the Hobbema Indian Progressive Club.\n\nOn receipt of your first letter I interviewed Rev. Father Schmidt who is responsible for this organization and he asked me to leave the letter with him and he would submit a written report. Before receiving this report I went with him when he had been on Sick Leave. Upon receipt of your \"Airmail\" letter of the 8th inst., I got the Agency Clerk to drive me up to the School. Rev. Father Schmidt had not yet prepared his report, but he promised to do this right away and I received it from him this morning and am enclosing a copy herewith.\n\nAs the report shows, the Hobbema Indian Progressive Club members have collected sufficient funds to purchase material with which to build a hall in which to hold their meetings and to exhibit their moving pictures. The construction work is to be done by the members of the Club. They propose to allow the four Bands at this Agency to use the hall for Band meetings, free of charge. This is a decided need; there is no place at this Agency that can accommodate the members of the various Bands at a meeting and it is necessary at present, to hold these meetings outdoors. They also hope to rent the building, for a small fee, for Indian wedding parties and Indian social events. With this revenue they expect to cover the cost of coal, light, caretaking and repairs.\n\nThis Club is doing good work, is undenominational and should be encouraged as it tends to take our Indians out of the rut in which they have lived for years and I heartily approve of the project.\n\nAlfred G.B. Lewis,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 22, 1945.\n\nRe: Hobbema Progressive Club,\nHobbema, Alberta.\nApplication No. 54652.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letters of February 16 and March 7, in connection with the above. I enclose, for your information, copy of a report submitted by the Reverend Father L. C. Schmidt, O.M.I. In commenting on the contents of Father Schmidt's letter, Indian Agent Lewis, who has been in our employ for many years and has always been a very responsible agent, writes as follows:\n\n\"As the report shows, the Hobbema Indian Progressive Club members have collected sufficient funds to purchase material with which to build a hall in which to hold their meetings and to exhibit their moving pictures.

Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI beg to report that a fire, of unknown origin, broke out in the boiler room, which is situated in the North end of the basement of the old dormitory and class room block of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School, just after midnight of the 16th and 17th April, 1945.\n\nA Sister, who was sleeping in the class room immediately above the boiler room was awakened by the smoke and immediately turned on the alarm, and by prompt action of the male members of the school staff in running out the fire hose, we were able to confine the damage by actual fire, to the boiler room and the class room immediately above.\n\nFrom an inspection I made this A.M. the main damage requiring repairs is as follows:\n\nBoiler Room\n1. Metal lath and plaster ceiling to be rebuilt.\n2. New Asbestos cover on boiler.\n3. New steam gauge and water gauge on boiler.\n4. Renew joists where burned and found unsafe.\n5. New sash and frames for basement windows.\n\nClass Room\n1. New flooring in north half of class room.\n2. New base board in north half of class room.\n3. New glass for several windows and doors.\n\nOther Damage\nFloor in the adjoining class room is badly warped owing to water and will have to be relaid. Some rooms will need re-decorating on account of smoke and water damage and other floors may warp in the near future. A small quantity of class room furnishing was damaged and will require replacement. Several windows will require re-glazing, and some cemented to floors has become unsound and will require re-laying. I would respectfully request that the services of an engineer of the Survey's Branch be utilized to estimate the cost of repairs to this building please.\n\nI respectfully submit the following report on the first- Upon my arrival at the school the basement was so full of smoke that it was impossible to go down to discover the seat of the blaze, but a red glow in the smoke showed that the fire was in the boiler room, into which the staff assisted by Mr. McLeod, our Farming Instructor at Agency Head Quarter were directing two lines of hose. Later the fire started to burn through the floor of the class room, and a fire bucket brigade was organized among the older boy pupils, the floor torn up. In this way it was possible to keep the fire under control under the floor.\n\nSmoke was now getting worse and we seemed to be making no headway and I decided to ask the assistance of the City of Wetaskiwin Fire Department, who are equipped with smoke masks and special electric lamps for this kind of work.\n\nOver.\nFire Chief Dave Baker and four of his staff responded to my request and took charge and within one hour and a half had the fire completely out.\n\nI give credit for this fire not assuming greater proportions, to the fire drill, which is regularly practiced in this school, where everyone has a job to do in case of fire, and knows how to do it, and the assistance cheerfully given by the Wetaskiwin Fire Department, to whom I would ask that the Department forward its thanks officially.\n\nI also wish to report that the school was evacuated in five minutes, each pupil passing in front of the school with a blanket. When it was found that there was no immediate danger the elder pupils got clothing and bedding from the dormitory and the girls and smaller boys were billeted in the Church for the night, the elder boys were allowed back into the dormitory of the new wing after the fire was out.\n\nOwing to the mess in the boiler room and windows being out, making it impossible to heat the building immediately, the Rev. Principal asked permission to allow the children to go to their homes for the balance of the week. Classes to resume on Monday, 23rd April, to this I agreed. I have Mr. Templeman, the plumbing contractor here to-day, testing the boiler and putting it into working condition, so that the work in cleaning up the rooms may be started immediately.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted, please.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlfred G.B. Lewis,\nIndian Agent.\n\nAdd: After making this report I went to the school to see how Mr. Templeman had found the boiler and I find that this building is covered by insurance and the adjustor is allowing for the complete removation of the damaged parts.\n\nCopy for:\nO.

You have seen with your own eyes the pros and cons of the situation. I told you my plans, you told me yours. To organize and give the school its own characteristic, I need help. You are ready to plead, at Ottawa, in my favor. So I present you the following list. The following are by order of importance:\n\n1 - A new school\n2 - Failing in obtaining a new school, could we get, at least, a new school for boys, and then organize the old building for the girls.\n3 - Increase in the allowances for the number of children.\n4 - Sewers - they are in a very poor condition. You have seen the cess-pool 20 feet in front of the school.\n5 - Another furnace - one is not sufficient. We are obliged to heat the school by sections. Automatically one end freezes while the other end is being heated and this vice-versa. This obliges the staff to sleep in irregular quarters (i.e. the convent end of the school sacrifices itself; the Sisters sleep in class rooms and in sewing rooms) so that as not to leave the dormitories with children without heat for too long a time.\n6 - Taylor Sewing Machines\n7 - 2 Sewing Machines (Singer)\n8 - Drying Machine for the Laundry\n9 - Dough Mixer (the staff is not ready yet)\n10 - Maple flooring for three floors: Dining Room - 39' x 23', Classroom - 34' x 4', Kitchen - 25' x 17'\n11 - 2 doz. desks for pupils (beginners) 24\" high.\n12 - 2 doz. common chairs\n13 - one teacher's desk\nOttawa, 16th October, 1945.\n\nMr. W.P.F. Hugh, Indian Agent, Fort Macleod, Alberta.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation, an amount of $1,250.00 is provided for repairs, improvements and the purchase of new equipment at the Raineskin Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is our intention to purchase 2 sewing machines, 1 tailor's sewing machine, 24 small desks and 1 teacher's desk. We also have a request from the Principal for the following:\n\n- Drying Machine for Laundry\n- Dough Mixer\n- Metal Flooring for the Dining Room,\n- Classroom and Kitchen\n- Linoleum for Kitchen\n\nI wish you would discuss the latter requests with the Principal with a view to obtaining more definite information regarding what is needed, in order that we may have sufficient information to place before the Departmental Purchasing Agent. In connection with the request for metal flooring, possibly you could purchase this locally. If so, you should let me have the name and address of the firm from which you can obtain a quotation on the cost of the flooring.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\n16th October 1945\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nIndians in Indian Residential School, Robson, Alta.\n\nVOTE 76 ALLOTMENT\n\nSHIP TO The Principal, Indians in Indian Residential School,\nRobson, Alberta.\n\nPurpose for which required:\n\n| QUANTITY | UNIT PRICE | TOTAL |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n| 2 Only   | Singer Sewing Machines - 5-Drawer, Singer No. 127-3-2 G.O.

It is quite possible that the Principal will supply all the laborers for the work. I will send him the necessary quantity of paint and material. He informs me that with 25 gallons of white paint plus 10 gallons of linseed oil and 5 gallons of turpentine he does an satisfactory job. As far as the interior is concerned he would appreciate receiving 25 gallons of varnish and 25 gallons of liquid wax.\n\nHoping that you will be able to supply this material, I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.C.

You will notice that No.1 line is exceptionally heavily loaded. The laundry disposal does connect direct with the sewer and passes thru both tanks. These tanks are not what I take to be septic tanks all the tanks are of cistern type with no walls or shipper, it should appear there is no disintegrating of the disposal. The laundry disposal outlet does not by-pass anything. The cisterns are of cement construction as noted on the sketch.\n\nOn investigating the sewer outlet which is one hundred and fifty yards from the pump of the school, was found to be in a very bad state of repair being blocked up with the summer's dead growth and general gathering together with an old roof slaved into the outlet that had covered the outlet \"once upon a time\". Father Labonte undertook the work of cleaning same out and the work is now under way and he is also going to erect a temporary cover to keep the outlet from freezing the winter.\n\nIn regard to recommendation, I would suggest that the present system be coaxed along this winter and between now and next 1st July an estimate prepared by a Sanitary Engineer as to what I would think an overhaul of the entire system. It is in the programme to have the sewage system of the hospital & nursing station of the Hobbema Indian Agency to be revamped this coming spring when I would suggest that a local contractor could do the whole job. It is my opinion that a Sanitary Engineer be consulted in the school case. If the dept. desire me to proceed with obtaining of the necessary data on a suitable disposal system for the school I would be only too pleased to do the same. The main thing as I see it is to have the work lined up and ready to go at the beginning of summer holidays.\n\nFor your information the boys dining room in the basement (where all the children's dining rooms are) was flooded last July from an apparent back up from the \"A\" tank.\n\nAt present the School have no way of emptying the sewage tanks except by bailling. I would ask for authority to purchase a sump pump (the same type was purchased for the Blue Quill's School) with hose connections at an approximate cost of $50.00.\n\nFor your information I have discussed this matter with the Principal of the School and he agrees with the contents of this letter.\n\nWith reference to the first paragraph of your letter, there is actually no functioning to the sewage system, the disposal runs directly thru all tanks and thru the sewer outlet, there are no settling tanks. In regards to my recommendations I have made above, I hardly feel capable of dealing with situation and in getting further information I contact capable authorities in Edmonton for further advice if the dept. so desire me to do so. I am of the opinion a good sanitary engineer should be consulted. Judging from the\nfrom the sad experiences of our department in dealing with the sewage disposal of the Indian Agency, we cannot be too careful in getting all the advice available. Local soil conditions are none too good and disposal fields do not seem to work and septic tanks of suitable capacity connected to an effluent sewer seems to be the answer to the sewage disposal.\n\nFurther to this letter I would say that the Ermineskin School is in a poor state of repair and quite a dangerous fire hazard as you are aware, so one wonders at the advisability of a heavy expenditure on the present school. I am dealing with some requests for fire protection in another letter.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nW.F.B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nHobbema, Alberta.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nAttention - Mr. P. Phelan, Chief Training Division.\n\nRe Repairs - Ermineskin School.\n\nReference to your letter of the 16th Oct. I regret my delay in replying to same, and at this time of writing I have not all the information that you desire.\n\nIn dealing with the second paragraph of your letter, in which you state that you are purchasing 2 sewing machines, 24 small desks and one teacher's desk, we are not quite clear if the cost of these articles is a charge against the $1250.00. I would appreciate hearing from you in this connection.\n\nRe Drying Machine - for laundry, the principal obtained prices on a drying cabinet but they are much higher than he expected. My suggestion is that a drying cabinet be built with a heating unit and fan installed. This is under consideration.\n\nRe Dough Mixer - the purchase is also under consideration and prices are being obtained.\n\nRe Maple Flooring - I beg to state that in view of your letter I took the privilege of ordering from the Rawatstoke Lumber Co., Ltd., Wataskiwin, Alberta, 785 ft. of No. 1 maple flooring 13/16 x 12\" @ $162.00 per m. $125,550 delivered. This was the only chance I saw of obtaining any flooring and the School Kitchen is in very bad need of being replaced. The above amount will just about complete the kitchen floor 17 ft. x 25 ft.\n\nShortly after Father Labonte took over the school last July the small girls' dining room floor was in very poor state of repair and had to be replaced; he did so at his own expense. He is asking if the sum of $135.00 could be charged against the $1250.00 and refunded to the school. If so, the floor in it was beyond use and I would much appreciate if the amount of $135.00 could be reimbursed to the principal. If so I will obtain his receipted account and forward the same to you.\n\nIn regards to the linoleum for the kitchen in view of the hardwood flooring being obtained for the kitchen, the principal might decide to make a switch of this, however, in view of good quality linoleum being hard to obtain at the moment, he would like time to see what could be done.\n\nI regret my information is somewhat vague but we are working on the same and have in view getting plans made and forwarding the same to you.\n\nW.P.B. Fugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\n*For Medical Off.*\nFile: 112-1-5\n\nOttawa, 16th November, 1945.\n\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh, Indian Agent, Hobbema, Alberta.\n\nI desire to refer to your letters of the 6th and 8th instant with reference to the Ermineskin Residential School.\n\nWith reference to the second paragraph of your letter of the 8th instant, the cost of the articles mentioned will be charged against the amount of $1,250.00.\n\nYour action in purchasing the maple flooring is approved.\n\nWe are prepared to favourable consider payment of the expenditure of $135.00 incurred by the Principal in repairing the floor in the girls dining room.\n\nWith regard to the sewage system of this school, I am submitting the matter to the Surveys and Engineering Branch with a view to having them investigate what is required, early next spring. You may purchase a sump pump at an approximate cost of $50.00.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, 16th November, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, SURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Ermineskin Indian Residential School\n\nWe recently received complaints to the effect that the sewage system at the above mentioned school is not functioning properly. We communicated with the Indian Agent and for your information I enclose copy of his reply together with the rough sketch to which he refers. The Ermineskin school has an authorized enrolment of 140 pupils and it is very desirable that the sewage system be in proper condition.\n\nI would, therefore, appreciate it if you would arrange to have the system of this school examined as early as possible next spring and a report submitted to this office. The Indian Agent is Mr. W.P.B. Puch, Mohawk, Alberta. I feel certain that he will give your official every possible assistance.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nHobbema, Alberta.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nRe Fire Protection Ermineskin School.\n\nI beg to inform you that last week I gave the fire protection of the above school a close examination and I would point out the following:\n\n1. The electric wiring is all outside wiring of the old type run with porcelain cleats, very little conduit used in the old building, this in itself is not all that could be desired.\n2. The main fire escape of the old building which serves the older and young girls is a very rickety wooden fire escape attached to the main building and could be improved upon. In this regard I am getting a quotation on a steel Potter Fire Escape and will forward the same to the department.\n3. Shortage of fire hose\u2014it was fire hose that saved the school last April. Further fire hose asked for in this letter, also half dozen more Pyrene Fire Extinguishers needed.\n\nThe following is an outline of the fire hose needs:\n1. Boys' Play Room: 50 feet long, should be 65 ft long so as to reach Boiler Room. This should give two hoses two boiler room.\n2. Baby Class Room: (New Building) 30 ft long, should be 65 ft long so as to reach the following Class Rooms: Grade 1, 2, & the Big Boys Class Room.\n3. Big Boys' Dormitory: 24 ft long should be 50 ft long so as to reach the stairs.\n4. Small Girl's Dining Room: 20 ft long, should be 50 ft long so as to reach the Kitchen and Indian Parlour.\n5. Big Girls' Sewing Room: 50 ft long, should be 65 ft long so as to reach Sisters' dormitory.\n\nThe above would make the purchase of 120 new hose 5 couplings, however, the Principal and I are both of the opinion that if the following are purchased\u2014\nTwo 65 foot new hoses\u2014130 ft complete 1\u00bd\" unlined linen hose with brass couplings & two nozzles\u2014\n130 ft of hose at .65\u00a2 per ft\u2014$85.00\n2 brass couplings @ $3.50 each\u2014$7.00 (or 5 couplings\u2014$17.50)\nThe hose that would be replaced by the new hose could then be added to existing hoses and three more extra couplings would be needed in addition.\n\nThe Rev. Principal is also asking for Six only hand operated Pyrene Extinguishers\u20141 qt size complete with charge and wall bracket at a cost of approximately $8.00 each\u2014$48.00. I would concur in this purchase, this will give a total of 18-1 qt size hand operated extinguishers which are now located throughout the buildings.\n\nAt the fire last year a smoke mask came in very handy that was sent down from the City of Wetaskiwin Fire Dept., these cost approximately $26.00 each. However it is possible that the dept. have had experience with these masks and that you do not approve of these being supplied.\n\nI would recommend an expenditure of approximately $150.00 to $175.00 for further Fire Fighting Equipment for the Ermineskin school.\n\nW. F. E. PUGH,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, 3rd December, 1945.\n\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh, Indian Agent, Hobbema, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th ultimo the Purchasing Branch is being requested to secure the hose, couplings, nozzels and fire extinguishers which you recommended to be supplied to the Ermineskin Residential School.\n\nIf you can purchase a smoke mask at the price mentioned in your letter you may do so.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received your letter of the 14th inst., dealing with reverse stitch machines. I am ready to take both of them. Did you notify the Dept. of Mines and Resources about the prices?

The tender states that the price is based on sketches and notes forwarded by the Indian Agent, whom, it is indicated, has suggested that certain operations involved should be carried out under his own control.\n\nThe Potter fire escape is a tubular metal unit, supported on structural steel legs and concrete footings. It is felt that a misunderstanding has occurred between the Indian Agent and the Westeel Products Ltd., since the drop to which reference is made is 18 feet 8 inches.\n\nBefore we can express an opinion on the cost, or comment on how the proposed fire escape meets the situation, this Service must be furnished either with copies of the sketches and notes prepared for the Westeel people by the Indian Agent, or shop drawings from the tendering firm supporting their quotation.\n\nIt appears from the tender that the matter has been handled entirely by correspondence. The Indian Agent should arrange to have representatives of firms tendering on the fire escape visit the school and familiarize themselves with the situation, before submitting their tender, which should include the cost of cutting and patching walls and any other incidental operations required, such as the installation of lighting facilities as well as supplying and installing the fire escape.\n\nIt is recommended therefore, that Indian Affairs have Indian Agent Pugh review the matter with the Westeel Products Ltd., and obtain a revised tender from them on the basis we have outlined. This, with complete information on how the fire escape is to be installed, should be forwarded here for our examination.\n\nIf possible, a tender should be obtained from at least one other firm for this work.\n\nJ.

The Ermineskin School visited a number of times and a sewerage report also fire report made on the same, but there is nothing to be added to the education. Personally the more I think about Indian education the further I bog down. One wonders when you see all the newspaper talk, parliamentary talk of committees to investigate this and that, if only some of our critics could live on the reserves it would be their education, on the other hand a shake up of our education system might do a lot of good. It is to be hoped that if any committee is formed to investigate the Indian set up that they will be able to spend considerable time at some of the reserves and schools. I am sure I have visited the kindergarten class and what or how those Sisters start in teaching these young Indians from 7 to 11 years of age not able to speak English is really something, the first year is just nowhere with them.\n\nFamily Allowance.\n\nI think is doing good for the Indians and the children appear better clothes, but it is making a tremendous increase in the office work, it is never ending the checking and rechecking, of the families.\n\nXX XX XX\n\nW.P.B.

H. Ball, Junior Engineer, made an investigation of the sewage system at the above school. A sketch plan of the main building basement was made and the soil and drainage lines located as closely as possible. The outside lines were also located and the elevations noted at points where pipes were accessible. Duplicate prints of plans showing the existing system are being forwarded under separate cover.\n\nThe complaint of the school authorities is that on several occasions line '1A' passing beneath the concrete floor slab of the small boy's dining room has become plugged and water has been forced through the pipe joints to flood the floor. Water also has backed up from line '1A' through the connecting lines '1B' and '1C' and so onto the bakery floor. Line '1A' is an old 4\" tile pipe not in good condition. It carries the discharge from 8 water closets and 3 sinks in addition to the laundry drainage. The diameter and material of pipe in lines '1B', '1C' and '1D' is not known but they are apparently unused and not connected to any fixtures.\n\nAs far as could be ascertained the remaining drainage pipes within the building are adequate for existing fixtures and no trouble has been experienced with them. The only exception to the above is the pipe from the kitchen sink which is frequently plugged with grease despite the installation of a grease trap under the sink. The kitchen line has two clean-outs in the section under the storeroom floor.\n\nLine '1A' is in poor condition and in any event should be of cast iron construction under the building. It is recommended that the section of this line within the building be replaced by a 4\" cast iron pipe. This will entail cutting and replacing the concrete floor.\n\nThe disposal system outside the building is as shown on the accompanying sketch plan. Drainage from the main building passes through lines 1, 2 and 3 to a single compartment tank 'A'. In such the inlet and outlet pipes are only 1 foot above the tank floor. It seems fairly evident that the backing up in line '1A' is caused by accumulation of solids in the tank above the outlet of line 1. The discharge from tank 'A' passes down 6\" tile line '1A' to tank 'C' from which it runs out into the depression of an old watercourse now generally dry. Tank 'C' has apparently had two compartments at some time but the center partition and part of the end wall have crumbled or been knocked out.\n\nT.S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nSurveys & Engineering Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nDrainage from the engineer's house and work-shop passes through a recently built single compartment concrete tank (B) patterned after tank 'A'. The discharge from tank 'B' passes down a recently built 4\" tile line 'B') to join line 'A'. Drainage from the priests' house runs to an old log cribbed tank with the outlet running to the water course into a lower section of which tank C discharges. This log tank is ten years old and due to cave in at any time.\n\nExisting tanks A and B cannot function as septic tanks nor can they be converted for use as septic tanks. Tank C was probably originally intended as a septic tank but is now beyond repair. Two schemes are possible for sewage disposal as follows:\n\n1. To convert tanks A and B into inspection chambers by filling with concrete to the pipe level and to install a new septic tank just below the junction of lines A and B. Tank C would be filled in and line A taken through it to discharge into the water course.\n\nThis scheme would not provide for diversion of laundry drainage around the new septic tank. The estimated cost is $2,000.00.\n\n2. In order to divert the laundry drainage around a new septic tank as located in scheme 1, it would be necessary to run a 4\" line from the laundry to below the tank location. To avoid the extra length of line paralleling line A it is proposed to install a new septic tank, large enough to serve the school, just below tank A and bring a 4\" laundry drain through the building in the same trench as the line recommended to replace existing line 'IA'. This laundry drain would discharge into line A below the new tank. With this layout it would also be necessary to run a soil line from the laundry to connect the water closet in the laundry building. Sewage from the work-shop and engineer's house would be handled by a small septic tank immediately below existing drains and through tank C to discharge into the water course. This scheme is recommended and is estimated to cost $2,300.00.\n\nSewage disposal from the priests' residence does not fit into either of the above schemes and it is recommended that a separate small septic tank be installed near the site of the existing log tank. The effluent from the new tank would discharge into the water course.\n\nTo recapitulate, it is recommended that:\n1. A 4\" C.I. pipe be installed to replace existing line 'IA' and be extended by 4\" tile to the laundry to pick up the water closet there.\n2. A new tank be installed near existing tank A to take sewage from the engineer's house and work-shop, the school building.\n3. A new tank be installed near existing tank B to take sewage from the priest's house and work-shop.\n4. A 4\" line be installed to bypass the laundry drainage around the larger new tank.\n5. Existing tanks A, B and C be filled in and existing lines piped through them.\n6. A new septic tank be installed at the priests' house.\neffluent discharging directly to the water course.\n\nThe approximate estimated total cost of the above six recommendations is $2500.00.\n\nC.M. Walker,\nSupervising Engineer.\n\nCRC &E per:\n\nT.S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nSurveys & Engineering Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nMr. Hoey\n\nCopy of Mr. Cornish's report with blueprints herewith for your information. Recommend the improvements suggested herein be proceeded with. Will you kindly advise if you concur and if so whether $2500 can be made available for this work.\n\nMay 27th, 1946.\n\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal\nErmineskin Indian Residential School\n\nReferring to your notation on a copy of a memorandum from Indian Affairs dated November 16th, 1945, we are now in receipt of a report dated April 24th from Mr. Walker in Banff dealing with suggested improvements in the sewage system for the above residential school.\n\nTwo copies of the report and one copy of each of the two accompanying blueprints are attached. The blueprints show the present layout of the sewer system at the school.\n\nIt is recommended that the following work be done to renovate this sewage disposal system:\n\n(1) A 4\" cast iron pipe be installed to replace existing line LA and be extended by 4\" tile to pick up the laundry water closet discharge.\n\n(2) A new septic tank be installed just below existing tank A to take the sewage from the school.\n\n(3) A new septic tank be installed near existing tank B to take sewage from the engineer's house and workshop.\n\n(4) A 4\" line be installed to carry laundry drainage in same trench with laundry sewer and connect to line A below new tank.\n\n(5) Existing tanks A, B and C be filled in and sewer lines piped through them.\n\n(6) A new septic tank be installed for the Priest's Residence to discharge direct into the water course.\n\nThe estimated cost of this work is $2,500.00 and we suggest that this work be undertaken at the same time as the sewage scheme at Hobbema Indian Agency.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 1st, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Smith, Deputy Chief Superintendent\n\nRe: Ermineskin Indian Residential School\n\nI have your memo of May 23rd, with reference to suggested improvements in the sewage system for the above residential school.\n\nThis is a church owned school, and we are only allowed to expend the amounts specially provided in the current year's appropriation. We have the amount of $1000.00 for repairs or improvements in the Ermineskin Residential School, which we can use, but as just stated, that is the only amount we could use.\n\nWould it be possible to use this amount this year to improve the sewage system, and we could provide the balance in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48, which would permit the work to be completed during the summer of 1947.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION                  | PRICE | GROSS AMT.

Principal of the above school is finding it difficult to obtain a night watchman at the rate of $40.00 per month for months October, November, December, January, February, March and April. You are well aware that this school is a poor fire risk and it is necessary to obtain a good native young man and I would recommend that the wage be increased to $60.00 per month if the dept. can see their way clear to do so. This man keeps a regular patrol on the School during the night, a watch clock being operated in connection with his patrol. For your information the time checks of the watch clock are filed in this office every other day, sample attached.\n\nW.P.R. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nE-1-a\n\nOttawa, August 14, 1946.\n\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh, Indian Agent,\nHobbema, Alberta,\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to increasing the monthly amount allowed for a night watchman at the Ermineskin Residential School.\n\nIt was never intended by the Department that we should be responsible for the full wages of the night watchman. For some years past we have made part payment of his wages and at the present time we are not in a position to increase the amount previously allowed for the Ermineskin School, namely, $40.00 a month for the period October to April.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nHobbema, Alta.\n\nG.H. Gooderham Esq., Inspector of Indian Agencies, Calgary, Alta.\n\nre 1946-1947 Estimates - Ermineakin School - Vote 78 - 491 & 691.\n\nI beg to refer you to the above and to sheet No. 76491. The Principal of the School would like to be advised if the department will consider purchasing the material for the construction of a slaughter house. You will note that I stated on the above sheet that slaughtering arrangements at the school are very unsanitary.\n\nThe Principal is not asking for the granary in the place thereof he is interested in purchasing a dough mixer of a large size capacity one to two sacks of flour. At the present time he is buying all the bread for the school use from Bakery in Wetaskiwin and he is now desirous of baking their own bread.\n\nAny consideration that the department could give to the above two items would be appreciated.\n\nW.P.B.\n\nW.J.B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nI am endeavoring to information and prices on dough mixers should have the same within a week, I will then forward.\nCalgary, August 10, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of letter received from Indian Agent W.P.B. Pugh, Hobbema, with respect to requirements of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School.\n\nRe the first paragraph of Mr. Pugh's letter:\nWhat about a slaughter-house for this institution? Do you think it is justified at the moment? In referring to Sheet No. 76491 of his Estimates for 1946-1947, you will note an item of $900.00 has been included for this purpose.\n\nRe the second paragraph of the Agent's letter:\nOn a recent inspection it was noted that this school had a very antiquated system of making bread, and as a result was buying bread. Ermineskin School is a most important unit, and looks after the education of a great many children. If at all possible it should have a dough-mixer.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nActing Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nGHG/PB\nOttawa, August 14, 1946.\n\nMr. G. H. Gooderham,\nActing Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the Ermineskin Indian Residential School.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation an amount of $1,000.00 was provided for repairs and improvements at this school. However, we have already transferred this amount to the Surveys and Engineering Branch, in view of a report that they submitted showing the necessity for immediate repairs to the sewage system at this school. As a matter of fact, they recommended an expenditure of $2,500.00, but we informed them that we could only handle the $1,000.00.\n\nI note that Indian Agent Pugh is endeavouring to secure information and prices on dough mixers, and, when obtained, he can forward same for our consideration. However, I am not in a position at the present time to state definitely if favourable consideration can be given to the request.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nReference to your letter of 24th Jan 1946, I beg to report that I did not take any action of the Potter Fire Escape for the Ermineskin School until Summer holidays. I then interviewed the Western Steel Products, who stated that they could not entrain the job for at least six months and at that time in June they could not get material.\n\nHowever I did ask them to have their Engineer call the first time he was in the district, but up to the time of writing he did not call.\n\nThere does not appear much that can be done about it; however I will state that there is one wooden fire escape at the back of the school is in very poor shape.\n\nWFBP.\n\nM.

I enquired about the trade-in value of the small boiler he now has and he stated he would like to use it for another purpose.\n\nAs you are aware the present laundry boiler is under size, rating just under the 5 h.p. For your information we have a drier here at the Agency that I believe could be put in use if they had a larger size boiler, the present boiler will not furnish enough power for their present equipment without adding the drier.\n\nI am not aware of the department's attitude towards any replacements for the Ermineskin School but this letter is for your information and I would ask you to pass the same onto the department, with your comments.\n\n(Sgd.) \"W.P.B.

Pugh, the Indian Agent, with quotation from Stanley Brock Limited, is forwarded for your consideration, please.\n\nThe delay in forwarding this request is due to the fact that it was first desired to ascertain what use Father Labonte proposed to make of the old boiler; I am advised by Mr. Pugh that it was the Principal's intention to use same for heating his piggery and for cooking pig-feed; however if the new boiler is allowed, he is willing to let the old one go as a trade-in. Mr. Pugh remarks that the old boiler is of little value.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nGHG/PB\nOttawa, 24 September 1946.\n\nEX'D.\nA.\n\nMr. G.H.

However, even if we did place an order, we would not have any funds to pay for it.

This work would be comprised of the following:\n\n(1) A 4\" cast iron pipe to be installed to replace existing line 1A and to be extended by 4\" tile to pick up the laundry water closet discharge.\n\n(2) A new septic tank to be installed near existing tank B to take sewage from the engineer's house and workshop.\n\n(3) A 4\" line to be installed to carry laundry drainage in same trench with laundry sewer and connect to line A below new tank.\n\n(4) Existing tanks B and C to be filled in and sewer lines piped through them.\n\n(5) A new septic tank to be installed for the Priest's residence to discharge direct into the water course.\nThe location of the above items is shown on the blue-prints forwarded with Mr. Mills' memorandum of May 22nd, 1946.\n\nIf it is your wish that the entire project recommended in Mr. Mills' memorandum of May 22nd, 1946, and which was then estimated would cost $2,500, be completed during the present fiscal year, it is now estimated on account of increases in the cost of materials and wages that the cost will be $3,700 in addition to the $179.48 already spent.\n\nWill you kindly advise me to what extent you wish this project proceeded with during the current fiscal year and the amount of money that will be made available.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, May 31st, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR SURVEYS & ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal - Ermineskin Residential School, Hobbema, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 23rd instant in connection with the above, we were only able to include an amount of $1,000, in the 1947-48 estimates for work at this school.\n\nThis is a church-owned school and due to present regulations, we are only allowed to expend the amount actually provided. We cannot take funds from any other vote.\n\nIf you feel that you can spend this $1,000, to advantage, you may proceed and we will be willing to issue the Encumbrance as soon as you request it.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector\nCOPY OF ENCUMBRANCE REQUISITION\n\nRESIDEN.

Thus the Contractor will complete the work of laying the two lines of soil pipe under the basement floor, but additional work of connecting up to the laundry outside the building will have to be done at some later time.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Walker estimates the work at the Hobbs Agency will be completed on Thursday next so that we should have authority to accept this bid of the Contractor to complete part of Project 2 as soon as possible so that the work can be done before the Contractor leaves Hobbs. Although the work appears to be expensive we recommend acceptance as otherwise we might not have an opportunity of doing the work within a reasonable period.\n\nT.S. Mills\nChief Engineer\n\nJ.M.

Walker,\nSupervising Engineer,\nEngineering Service,\nRANFF, Alberta.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nRe: Ermineskin Indian School at Hobbsen,\n\nThe supplying of labour for the lifting of wood floor and concrete floor over main tile pipeline, replacing with 4\" and 6\" Soil Pipes, CB fittings, Lead and Oakum supplied by Department of Mines and Resources, replacing cement floor (cement supplied by D. of M. & R.) and replacing wood floor and what damaged floor there may be for the price of seven hundred and forty-seven Dollars, ($747.00).\n\nTrusting this meets with your approval.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) \"Jas W. Haddow\",\n\nHaddow & Maughan Ltd.\nAIR MAIL\n\nNo: Sewage Disposal Ermineskin Indian School,\nHobbs, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to the second last paragraph of my letter of September 12th, Messrs. Meadow and Maughan have submitted a price of $745.00 for Item 1 of Project 2, as outlined in our request for bids dated March 27th 1947, copy of which was forwarded to you under cover of our letter of May 9th last. The item consists of replacing the existing 4\" tile drain under the school basement floor by 4\" cast iron pipe. The contractor's letter in this regard is attached.\n\nThe price submitted is considered high for the work involved. However, if this project is to be done by use of yearly appropriations of $1000.00, as your letter of June 13th indicates, it would be good policy to have this item tackled now, with the hope that the main septic tank could be installed next year.\n\nIn reviewing conditions at the school it is apparent that the essential items are the replacement of the tile drain under the building, and the replacement of the existing main tank by a properly designed septic tank. The by-passing of laundry drainage as described in Item 2 is not essential. Since we have not sufficient funds to complete both Items 1 and 2, which naturally go together, it is proposed to eliminate Item 2, in an attempt to prevent the job hanging fire for several more years.\n\nWill you kindly let me know your reaction to this suggestion as soon as possible and also advise whether the bid of Meadow and Maughan should be accepted under the circumstances. In this connection it is important that a decision be arrived at quickly, while the plumbers are at Hobbs.\n\nWith reference to the Contract for the Hobbs Agency work, we have the solicited documents here, and are awaiting receipt of the Security Deposit before forwarding to you. A certified cheque has to come from Winnipeg for the Security Deposit, and should be here within the next day or so.\n\nWork is now under way on the ditch at the Hobbs Agency.\n\nEnclosure\n\nT. S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Service,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nC. M. Walker,\nSupervising Engineer.\nOctober 27, 1947\n\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal - Ermineskin Indian School,\nHobbema Agency, Alberta.\n\nAttached, in duplicate, will be found a copy of an air mail letter from Mr. Walker to this office dated October 22, with duplicate copies of a bid by Messrs. Haddow and Maughan of Edmonton, in connection with work to be done at the Ermineskin School and dated October 20, 1947.\n\nYou will note that the bid is $747.00 for completing Item 1 of Project 2 as described in Mr. Walker's letter of March 27, 1947, one of which was attached to our memorandum to you of May 21st, 1947. The cost of such Item 1, of course, difficult to appraise from this distance but it would seem that Mr. Walker is correct in stating that the price submitted is high for the work involved. It would certainly seem so. If, however, this improvement work at the Ermineskin School has to be done in small amounts each year in order to keep within an appropriation of $1,000.00, it would seem that there would be justification for accepting the bid now submitted.\n\nAs the Contractor is now engaged on the work building the sewer at the Agency Headquarters, there is thus an opportunity to get him to do part of the work required at the Ermineskin School. There will, however, be definitely no doubt in tearing up the concrete basement floor while the School is in session, but under present circumstances there is little likelihood that we could secure a contractor to do such work during school holidays.\n\nKindly advise if we are authorized to accept the offer of Messrs. Haddow and Maughan to complete Item 1 of Project 2 for $747.00 and please state whether letter or acceptance of the offer by Mr. Walker to the Contractor would be sufficient, or if we should forward a proper contract specifications for signature.\n\nThere is, of course, little time to get this work done and it is quite possible that if the work is authorized, it might possibly be completed before standard contract documents could be properly prepared and executed. The type of work also makes such documents difficult to draw up.\n\nT.S. Mills\nChief Engineer\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurvey & Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\n[Stamp: Director]\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal, Ermineskin Indian School, Hobbema Agency, Alberta.\n\nEnclosed for your information are copies of memoranda from Mr. Mills, dated October 27th last and November 3rd.\n\nOn receipt of the first of these memoranda it appeared that it would be uneconomical not to carry out at least part of item 2 of project 2 at the same time as item 1 of project 2. This question was discussed with Mr. Neary by telephone and we undertook to secure an estimate of the cost of item 2.\n\nThis estimate of cost is contained in Mr. Mills' memorandum of November 3rd. Confirming further telephone conversation with Mr. Neary it is our understanding that an additional sum of possibly $100. or $200. can be found for this project and in view of the urgency of the matter Mr. Walker is being wired to accept the offer of the contractor to carry out the proposed work at a total cost of $847.00.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\nErmineskin Indian Residential School\n\nI have for answer your memorandum of November 4 and wish to confirm the verbal agreement reached between your Chief Engineer and our Superintendent of Welfare and Training, that the necessary funds would be raised to carry out the repairs required to the sewage disposal system at this school. Could we please be advised as soon as the work is completed, so that we can prepare the required Order-in-Council. As the Ermineskin School is a church-owned institution, it is necessary for us to obtain an Order-in-Council for expenditures in excess of the amount provided for in the Estimates.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBFH/EM\nWork on Project No. 2 commenced Monday, November 17, 1947, the contractors, Haddow and Maclean Ltd., of Edmonton having just completed the installation of a sewage disposal scheme for the Department at the Indian Agency. All arrangements for disrupting the regular school program had been made with the school authorities at an earlier date.\n\nIt was necessary to tear up three layers of wooden flooring before exposing the concrete floor in a portion of which it was broken up in order to get at the underlying sewer line. All the work was done by hand labor which proved difficult and slow. At the east wall of the building, an excavation down the wall was made and by tunnelling under the foundation, both lines were placed. Outside excavation was hindered by the fact that only half in the ground so that at the west wall the tunnelling was done from the inside and both lines placed as required. However, such connections as were necessary were made inside the building as shown on the accompanying plan. It will be necessary when further work is carried out at this location, that the outside connections be made and those already made on the inside be slightly changed.\n\nClean out structures were installed in the system as a precaution against further inconvenience. Care was taken in the laying of the C.I pipe to see that the maximum amount of fall was obtained from below the foundation on the west wall to the 6\" tile drain in place below the east wall. The necessary connections for all incoming lines and appurtenances were made with the exception of the underfloor drains for which permission had been given to leave disconnected. All pipe joints were inspected and passed as satisfactory. The portion of the concrete floor which was broken was replaced and it was decided by the school authorities to use the concrete floor rather than replace the wooden flooring.\n\nCleaning up operations were satisfactory and the work was completed and turned over to the school on November 29th, 1947.\n\nThe weather in .........\nThe weather in general was cold and snowy but considering the lateness of the season it was only to be expected.\n\nThroughout the course of the work, the school authorities were most co-operative and are anxious to see the rest of the work completed. They suggested that further work should best be done during the summer holidays when the school is relatively inactive. In all, the portion of the work done by the Contractor was carried out in a satisfactory manner.\n\nAttached please find a statement of all expenses incurred during construction of Project.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.

Hunt, Engineer.\n\nThe sewer disposal pipe from the laundry and the one from the rest of the building above the basement enter the drain at the same point. Concern as to its efficiency in sewage removal at this point was expressed by the Rev. Father Adam, principal of the school. However, it is unlikely Mr. Hunt would have made this connection without considering all the possibilities. No blocking has occurred at this point to date.\n\nAs you are aware, the school is very antiquated at the best and when repairs of this nature are done, they are just patchwork. There is a great need for a new school.\n\nIn Mr. Hunt's report you will note that three layers of flooring were removed, exposing the concrete floor. This floor was so rotten that replacement of it was impossible once it was interfered with. This floor was in a basement room which serves as a dining room. It is a very dark and dingy room and not a very enticing place in which to eat. The wooden floor that was removed was not very satisfactory and I believe the cement is the better of the two.\n\nAs Mr. Hunt states, the portion broken was replaced but there is still a considerable area of the floor that was hidden by the wooden flooring which I believe should be smoothed over for the reason that small holes or cracked portions of a cement floor are not satisfactory from a sanitation point of view. The principal of the school has indicated that he intends to have this done.\nEverything possible was done by the contractors and Mr. Hunt to see that the school routine was not disrupted, and the staff expressed appreciation in this regard.\n\nI concur with Mr. Hunt that the work was done satisfactorily under difficult conditions.\n\nH.H.

Until this is done there will be no cure for the condition originally complained of, that is, the backing up of sewage from the present tank to the drainage system under the basement floor. We have minimized the effects of this action by replacing the old tile line under the basement floor with cast iron pipe, but we have not yet attacked the cause. The cost of a new tank will be approximately $2500.00 or an approximate total of $800.00 will be used in purchase of material. If Indians Affairs are limited to an expenditure of $1000.00 per year on this work I do not see how this important item is to be built. It would not be feasible to purchase the necessary material out of this year's funds and hold it for a year, as there is no adequate storage for cement. In any case an amount of approximately $200.00 must be made available for the labour charge of installing the tank, which must be done in one operation.\"\n\nThe estimated cost of this tank is based on the records of last year's work. Originally this tank was estimated to cost $1500.00 but prices are now much higher and there might be a difficulty in persuading a contractor to go into the reserve for such a small project unless the price is high. It would thus seem that a minimum of $2500.00 should be provided this coming fiscal year. If completion of the entire project is desired, a total of $3500.00 would be required. The funds required for the additional work after the main septic tank is completed would thus be $3500.00 - $2500.00 which is $850.00.\n\nWe should be pleased to know what funds Indian Affairs will be able to provide for the coming year.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.

However, in view of the delay in forwarding the accounts for the paint (see official letter of May 4th, 1948), we will have to take the cost of the paint, which is approximately $495.79, from the above amount, leaving a balance of $1,304.21 available.\n\nWe now have a report from the Lands and Development Services with reference to the unsanitary conditions which exist at your school due to the necessity for the installation of anew septic tank.\n\nThe officials estimate the cost at $2,500.00.

Artlett\" Chemist\nApril 22, 1949\n\nMemorandum re Water Supply, Ermineskin Indian Residential School,\nHobbema, Alberta\n\nReceived April 4, 1949\n\nThis Indian school is located on a farm near the small settlement of Hobbema, Alberta, on the Calgary - Edmonton highway. It is owned and operated by the Roman Catholic Church and at present it has 175 pupils and a staff of 22. The school was started in 1894, and some of the buildings still stand.\n\nWater is pumped from two wells to an 1800 gallon pressure tank which supplies the distribution system. Well No. 1, located in the laundry, is 250 feet deep, is not cased, but the 2-inch pump cylinder stands well above the laundry floor. This electrically-operated pump discharges 3 to 3\u00bd gallons per minute but after several hours of pumping decreases to half that amount. Well No. 2 is located in a separate room with the pressure tank. It is approximately 400 feet deep, has 4-inch casing extending well above the floor, and a 2-inch pump cylinder. This well also produces 3 gallons per minute but has a limited supply. Water in well No. 1 is pumped from a depth of 150 feet and in well No. 2 from a depth of 250 feet.\n\nAttached hereto is the analysis of four samples taken for bacteriological analysis. The positive sample is unexplainable unless the bottle was contaminated, so further samples will be taken.\n\nThe attached chemical analysis shows the water to be of negligible hardness and has a Chloride content of 2.0 PPM. The soda content does not make it disagreeable to drink. Some natural gas rises with the water, and gas from a cock on the pressure tank can be lighted.\n\nConclusions and Recommendations\n\nThe water supply at this school appears to be of good chemical and bacteriological quality.\n\nThe small discharge from each pump necessitates almost continuous pumping with at least one pump, necessitating extra attention and low efficiency with the small discharge. The two present wells are located quite close together and the one probably draws water from the other.\n\nIt was noticed that there was no fire protection for the building and the present supply could hardly cope with even the smallest fire.\n\nRecommendations\n\nIt is recommended that the water supply be increased by the drilling of another well.\n\nStanley S. Goff\nSanitary Engineer, District No.8.\nOttawa, May 2, 1949.\n\nRe: Ermineskin Indian Residential School, Hobbema, Alberta.\n\nFor your information, attached hereto is a copy of water supply analysis for the above school, prepared by the Department of National Health and Welfare in conjunction with the Donald Inspection Company reports.\n\nD.M.

Mills,\nChief Engineer.\nHobbema, Alberta,\nSeptember 20, 1949.\n\nMr. G. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n507 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nRe: Estimates, Ermineskin Indian Residential School Farmer's House.\n\nWith reference to your 112-11-6 of September 15, 1949, I beg to inform you that a farmer's residence is needed at the Ermineskin School due to the increased farming operations carried on by the school. You will recall the Ermineskin Band allotted the school 1/2 section of bush land near the lease area west of the power line. This area has all been brushed except a ten rod strip on the west side and is at least half broken.\n\nIt was indicated by the department officials visiting the school that increased farming operations and efficiency were needed to provide adequate food for the 180 children in attendance.\n\nDue to increased staff and the large number of children attending this school and due to the general lack of housing facilities it was considered at least an eight-room house was needed.\n\nThe Rev. Father Schmidt conforming to present opinions regarding use of children labor on the farm is discontinuing this practice and hiring the labor.\n\nIt is hoped this information will suffice.\n\n(sgd) H. N. Woodsworth\nH. N. Woodsworth,\nSuperintendent.\n\nCOPY\nB. F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Ermineskin Residential School\n\nIn the 1950-51 Estimates for Hobbema Indian Agency, Superintendent Woodsworth inserted an item of $20,000. for the construction of a residence for the farmer of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. We questioned the item and made a notation on your copy of the estimates. In the meantime we received the attached copy of a letter from Mr. Woodsworth which is self explanatory.\n\nIt is obvious that our day school erection programme on the Hobbema Reserve is presently doing nothing more but keeping pace with the increase in population. Unless some system of consolidation is introduced at Hobbema, the Ermineskin Residential School will be required for some years to come. It is recommended therefore that an item of $15,000. be placed in the 1950-51 Estimates to cover the erection of a residence for the farmer.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Ermineskin Residential School\n\nI recently had occasion to visit the Ermineskin Residential School. It appears that considerable has been written concerning this building, which, I understand, is not the property of the Dominion Government.\n\nAt the time, I shuddered to think what would happen if a fire were to break out in the building.\n\nIf Mr. Woodsworth were to obtain prices, would the Department consider the installation of tubular metal fire escapes?\n\nAn alteration should also be made in the exits from the senior and junior girls dormitories. These two exits are side by side and if the large girls throw open their door it blocks the exit from the junior girls dormitory.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies\n\nPer:\nOctober 8th, 1949.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n507 Public Bldg.,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nRe: Ermineskin Indian Residential School,\nYour File 112-11-6\n112-4B-2\n\nWith reference to your letters of September 26th and 29th, we have noted your recommendation to include in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1950-51, an amount to provide a farmer's residence at the above school.\n\nPlease have Mr. Woodsworth secure prices on the installation of tubular metal fire escapes. He should also let us know the cost of altering the exits as mentioned in the last paragraph of your letter of September 29th.\n\nBernard F. Neery,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Ermineskin Indian Residential School.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI am informed that there is now to the credit of the above school, the sum of $4,200.00 for repairs and improvements. If this be so, could you please forward the following items, which are being asked for and said very essential.\n\nI.- One refrigerator, made by \"Bell Refrigerator Co.\", 1648 Portage Avenue, Winnipeg. Size 15'6\" x 10' x 9', containing three compartments and two refrigerator units, one for freezing meat and the other for eggs, milk, butter and meal leftovers. This refrigerator was supplied to the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School and is said by Reverend Father Brachet to be first class in every respect and to give full satisfaction.\n\nII.- One 30 quart size Mix-Master. The Principal agrees to pay half the cost of this machine if the Government will buy it and pay the other half.\n\nIII.- Seven sheets of stainless steel 36\"x40\" for covering sinks and kitchen work-tables.\n\nIV.- 100 Gal. of white paint (interior);\n    10 Gal. of linseed oil;\n    5 Gal. of turpentine.\n    3 Pounds of salt.\n\nThe Principal also states that the potato and garden crop in the Ermineskin District was a complete failure and that he has to buy some 500 bushels at $2.50 a bushel. He wishes to know what the Department could do in this matter.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O.

October 12/49\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHerewith enclosed please find letter I wrote to Reverend Father Plourde, O.M.I., who is in charge of Indian questions for the Oblate of Mary Immaculate order in Ottawa.\n\nThe first request in the letter is self explanatory and I would appreciate your recommending that the grant for purchase of potatoes and other vegetables be approved by the Officials of the Indian Affairs Branch at Ottawa. I have contacted farmers in the Fort Saskatchewan district and all are selling potatoes at $2.50\u00a2 a bushel.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"Rev. L. Camille Schmidt O.M.I.\"\n\nMr. H. N. Woodsworth\nSuperintendent\nIndian Agency\nHOBBEMA, Alta.\nHobbema, Alta.,\nOctober 11th, 1949.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nAs you very well know, the situation at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School, Hobbema, Alta., is far from being very bright, but with God's help, I hope to be able to make a success of my work.\n\nI have at last found time to devote to letter writing, and my first letter is to ask for more of your time and help, may I take this first opportunity to thank you for your generous help in the past and ask your assistance for the future.\n\nThe first request is a very special grant, which you will realise is very much out of the ordinary.\n\nThe potato and garden crop at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School has been a complete failure this year. We have reaped enough potatoes for about a month. This puts the school in a very difficult position. I will have to buy some 500 bushels of potatoes at an approximate cost of $2.50 per bushel. I am trying to locate some potatoes in Saskatchewan where I am told they are now selling at $2.00 a bushel. This will mean an expense of $1,000.00. Furthermore, the garden situation is no brighter, I will have to buy carrots and cabbages, but am not in a position to give you the approximate cost of such.\n\nAs you well realize, this is a very extraordinary request and I hope the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch in Ottawa look favourably upon this request.\n\nFollowing are other things I would like to request for the Indian Residential School at Hobbema, Alta.\n\nI- Stainless Steel for kitchen table covers following are the dimensions of the tables:\n- 23\" x 40\"\n- 112\" x 27\"\n- 41\" x 70\"\n- 36\" x 28\"\n- 30\" x 96\"\n- 32\" x 64\"\n- 33\" x 20\"\n\nII- Another thing that is greatly needed at the school is a mix master, 30 quart size. We have no mixer at all, and the children have to mix the dough by hand. Loss of time and material is great in such cases.\n\nIII- Frigidaire\n\nAll we have here at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School is a cooler, which does not freeze or keep meats\nfrozen, we have to put our meats in the freezer at the locker storage in Wetaskiwin, some 12 miles from Hobbema.\n\nIV PAINT:\n\nWe would also appreciate your requesting the Indian Affairs Branch for some paint for the interior of our school, white interior paint could be used very nicely now, as some of the walls are getting grey and dirty.\n\nAluminum paint could also be used on water pipes and water pressure tank.\n\nVarnish could also be used on the floors.\n\nPart of this painting work could be done during the Christmas holidays as this is all interior work.\n\nI wish to inform you that I am sending a copy of this letter to our Superintendent at the Hobbema Indian Agency.\n\nYours very respectfully in Xte.\n\nFather Schmidt O.M.I.\nHobbema Indian Agency\n\nDirector\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOTTAWA, Ontario\n\nRe: Ermineskin Indian Residential School\nPotato Shortage\n\nAttached find a letter received from the Reverend Father Schmidt Principal of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School, and also a copy of a letter sent by him to the Reverend Father Ploude, who will contact you.\n\nAfter receiving this letter, the Principal's request for assistance careful consideration was given to the case. The matter was discussed with Mr. Battle, Field Agent from Mr. G. H. Gooderham's office, during a recent visit here. There seems to be an urgent need for assistance on this situation. I beg to report as follows:\n\n1. Along with the surrounding area of northern and central Alberta a serious drought accompanied by unseasonal frosts, occurred, which according to the local press, is the worst in forty-five years.\n\n2. Of the potato crop, there is a yield very little better than the seed sown; only enough for one month's needs for the 160 pupils in residence at this school.\n\n3. Although there has been a considerable increase in the per capita grant, it is still not enough to cover operating costs of this school. Revenue obtained from farming operation supplement the Departmental grant and enable this school to operate. This farming operation is carried on on the Ermineskin Reserve with land owned by Band and leases with members of that Band. No other Band contribute land although they send pupils to this school. The per capita grant, is I believe, lower than other similar Residential Schools.\n\n4. During the past two school year, 1947-48 and 1948-49, the Ermineskin Indian Residential School cooperated extensively with the rehabilitation of T.B. patients of this Reserve. Children of T.B. families recovering from the Charles Cassell Indian Hospital were accommodated before others, although in most cases, special food and attention was necessary. Families of relief cases are also accommodated first.\n\n5. Obsolete equipment, buildings, inefficiency and lack of land all contribute to high operating cost of this school. This office, during the past two years, has realized the situation and made efforts to correct some of the problems of administration. In this I believe we have the full co-operation of the Reverend Father Schmidt who has inherited this year this tremendous administration problem. The farming catastrophe is however, beyond the scope of this office able to handle. This office therefore respectfully submits a plea for aid. I suggest that a solution may be to raise the per capita grant. It is hoped the Department will be able to solve this emergency at the school. It also should be pointed out, if the pressure for food in this emergency was not on the school, it would be on the Indian parents who are this year of crop failure, may not be even able to feed themselves.\n\nR. M. Woodsworth\nSuperintendent\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Frigidaire for Ermineskin Indian Residential School.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nThe above school has no proper frigidaire accommodation and finds it very difficult to keep meats, milk, butter and other kinds of food in good order and palatable. I have talked this matter over with the Principal and have come to the conclusion that a frigidaire, similar to the one supplied to Fort Alexander Indian Residential School, would fill a long felt want.\n\nPlease let me know what could be done in this matter. Thanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nHobbs, Alta.\nOctober 18th, 1949\n\nDear,\n\nRE - ESTIMATE 1950 - 1951\n\nERMINESKIN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nHobbs, Alta.\n\nREFRIGERATION:\nPresent refrigeration unit only keeps temperature at 40 degrees F. What would be required is a freezer so as to freeze meats and keep them frozen. Actually we must store all meats in the Locker Storage in Wetaskiwin. This of course is an expense, plus the travelling back and forth to Wetaskiwin for frozen meat.\n\nTABLEWARE:\nA complete line of plastic drinking cups and plastic tableware sufficient for 175 pupils and a staff of 25 would be very much appreciated for the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. The tableware being used now are of granite-ware, and are very old and chipped.\n\nFIRE ESCAPE:\nA-The present fire escape system at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School should be renewed by the funnel type fire escape. Today a wooden stairs strapped to a wooden wall is the main fire escape for three dormitories:\n1- Big girls dormitory\n2- Small girls dormitory\n3- Small boys dormitory.\n\nB-At the north end of the small boys dormitory there is a steel pipe fire escape. This pipe is accessible only by crawling through a window before reaching the platform of the fire escape.\n\nAt this particular fire escape, a door-window should be installed to give quicker exit for the small boys.\n\nC-Automatic door latches should be installed on all doors leading to the fire escapes, the automatic push-latch would be the most practical and safest latches to be used, these latches are made up of a bar of steel held by a coil spring, the simple pressure of the hand or the pressure of the body on the steel bar throws the door open. These automatic push-latches would also eliminate the ordinary knob door sets. With the knob door sets, they easily opened from the outside, and here may I state that strangers were found in the dormitories on different occasions in the past. With the automatic door-latches, no door could be opened from the outside.\n\nSCHOOL:\nThe Ermineskin Indian Residential School, is a very old and out dated building, a large number of Indian children are still unable to attend school due to lack of school accommodation even though the Ermineskin Residential School, the Hobbs Indian Day School and the Montana Indian Day School are now in operation. While the Leslie Butte Day School is new, this will not solve the situation, but will help solve it. A solution to the acute school accommodation could be, the building of dormitories, modern dormitories, close to the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. These dormitories could be heated with a central heating system, and class rooms could be added in the future. The present residential school could be used for class rooms, manual training rooms and dining rooms.\n\nThe building of dormitories would solve the fire hazard and the old school building could accommodate larger class rooms, while awaiting the building of modern school rooms.\n\nNEW BARN:\nThe present barn is very old and very cold in the winter time. The milk cows suffer greatly during the winter months in this barn, and this causes lack of milk for the school children.\n\nA herd of 15 milk cows can be handled in this old barn. This proves very insufficient to provide milk for the school children.\nNEW HOUSE\n\nThe housing accommodation at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School for employees is very acute.\n\nThere is only one small house available for the hired help; this house is very small, three rooms downstairs, one kitchen, living room and bed room. The attic is converted in sleeping quarters for 6 children. This house is now occupied by Mr. Baril, whose work around the school consists in janitor, boiler mechanic, carpenter, truck driver, electrician and all other work that has to be done in a hurry.\n\nThe farmer, Mr. Houle, lives in quarters above the work shop. The upstairs of the work shop was converted into living quarters due to lack of proper housing for the hired help at the school.\n\nThe reason for asking this house is that I would move Mr. Baril into this new house and move Mr. Houle, the farmer into the small house, and use the upper floor of the work shop for what it was intended for; a work shop for the boys. We are planning on starting the manual training for the boys at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School, but we are faced with lack of space.\n\nThe new house should have, a basement, a kitchen, living room and one bed room downstairs, and an upstairs with three bedrooms and a bath room.\n\nELECTRIC DISH WASHING EQUIPMENT:\n\nAn electric dish washing equipment would be appreciated at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. The present set up consists of big enameled pans set at the end of each table. It is very difficult to picture the clear clean water after 10 plates have been washed. A sanitary angle could be considered here.\n\nWELL\n\nA new well is also needed at the Ermineskin Indian School. We are now using two wells, at the same time, and both do not prove satisfactory. We are faced with a water shortage every winter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. L. C. Schmidt O.M.I.\n\nMr. H. N. Woodsworth\nSuperintendent\nHobbema Indian Agency\nHobbema, Alta.\nERMINESKIN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nHOBBEMA -:- Alta. October 18, 1949\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWould you please approve and recommend herewith enclosed estimates for the Ermineskin Indian Residential School, Hobbema, Alta.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRe. L. C. Schmidt, O.M.T.\nPrincipal.\nHobbema, Alta.\nOctober 12th, 1949\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: SPECIAL ANNUAL $1,000.00 GRANT FOR ERMINESKIN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, Hobbema, Alta.\n\nWould you approve the following repairs and purchase of equipment for the Ermineskin Indian Residential School, Hobbema, on the basis of the special $1,000.00 grant allowed yearly for this school.\n\nFIRE ESCAPES\n\nA- The whole fire escape system should be renewed by the tunnel type of fire escapes. These funnel type fire escapes would lessen the danger in case of fire and would clear the school of children in much quicker time in case of a fire emergency.\n\nToday, a wooden fire escape strapped on a wooden wall is the main fire escape for three dormitories namely:\n\n1- The big girls dormitory\n2- The small girls dormitory\n3- The small girls dormitory.\n\nB- A door-window in the small boys dormitory should be installed on the north end of the dormitory. Today this fire escape is accessible only by crawling through a window before reaching the platform of the dormitory fire escape.\n\nC- Automatic door latches should be installed on all doors leading to fire escapes, the automatic push-latches would be the most practical and safest latches. These automatic latches are held back or pressed up by a coil spring by the pressure of the hand or the pressure of the body. The spring recoils and lets the latch loose and the door swings open freely. This would eliminate the knob door sets which are easily opened from the outside. These automatic latches are fixed inside the dormitory and doors can be opened only from the inside. Intruders, as were found on different occasions in the dormitories could not have access to the dormitories at no time.\n\nD- The fire escape in the big boys dormitory should either be changed place or remodelled in such a way that there should be at least free access to it. Now the boys come out of the dormitory on to a small verandah and must climb over a two and a half foot railing before being able to slide down a steel pipe.\n\nSTAIR CASES\n\nThe steps in most of the stair cases should be renewed as the wood is very worn out. Rubber mats would serve a double purpose if installed over new steps, these purposes being:\n\n1- Protecting the wood.\n2- Deadening the foot steps of the children while going down or up the stairs.\n\nYour approving of these repairs and purchase of equipment would be appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

Henry,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nHobbema Indian Agency\n\nDEPARTMENT\n\nMINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nHobbema, Alberta\n22 December 1949\n\nDirector\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOTTAWA, Ontario\n\nRe: Ermineskin Indian Residential School\n\nWith reference to a letter from C. A. F. Clark of December 15, 1949, to Superintendent of Indian Education, copy received. I note Major Clark recommends a modern dormitory that will at least eliminate the danger of a night fire destroying the lives of the 180 children in this rapidly deteriorating ancient building. I would recommend that such dormitory be constructed in such a way that it might be used ultimately as a classroom block. I foresee that the residential school as operated at present should gradually evolve into something better. In my opinion a residential or boarding school will always be necessary as long as there are Indians who come from nomadic, broken or no homes, for which there is no solution other than residence.\n\nI know Mr. Neary will agree that a school without qualified teachers is only a school in a limited sense. As there are no qualified teachers employed at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School, this institution cannot truly be called a school.\n\nThe Reverend Father Schmidt, Principal of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School, informs me that no qualified teacher can be employed in the immediate future due to lack of finances at this institution. It would appear also that no prospects of education on a proper level in the foreseeable future are possible unless a start is made in this direction. I would therefore, recommend that the teachers, whether clerical or not, be employed as Civil Servants and detached from the administration of the institution as far as is possible.\n\nI see no justifiable reason why children within one half mile of a Residential School are forced to live in residence as is now the case. Using the present facilities as they are, we can assure a satisfactory school system can be evolved serving both day and residential pupils.\n\nH. N. Woodsworth\nSuperintendent\nJanuary 9, 1950.\n\nMr. H.N. Woodsworth,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nHobbema, Alta.\n\nErmineskin Indian Residential School\n\nThe dormitory block now being planned by our architects can be converted at a later date to a classroom block. It was designed for the Cariboo Residential School at Williams Lake, B.C., and I am requesting our Lands and Development Services Branch to provide me with extra copies of the plan so that it can be mailed to you.\n\nCould you quietly check on the number of children of school age living within a walking distance of the present residential school and who could attend as day scholars. You are probably aware by now of the plan being followed at the Crowfoot Residential School and I believe that a similar arrangement could be made at Ermineskin.\n\nWe follow the usual standard of Departments of Education in establishing walking distances namely:\n\n(a) Children under 10 years of age can be expected to walk up to two miles to school each way daily.\n\n(b) Children over 10 years of age can be expected to walk up to three miles to school each way daily.\n\nThe recommendation in Paragraph 3 of your letter is\nnow being tried out at three residential schools across Canada as an experiment. The whole matter is one which we intend to explore further with the denominations operating residential schools.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\ncc Mr. Gooderham\nHobbema Indian Agency\n\nDirector\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nRe: Administration\nErmineskin Indian Residential School\n\nFurther to my letter of December 22, 1949, I beg to inform you that I have had further conversation with Reverend Father Schmidt, Principal of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School, especially on the subject of qualified teachers and general administrative setup of the institution.\n\nThe purpose of my suggestions, which it is hoped will ultimately lead to a solution of the problem of school facilities for the 100 or more children not yet in school in this Agency, is to provide such facilities and include qualified teachers. I therefore respectfully submit the following proposals which I know will receive the co-operation of the school administration:\n\n1. The immediate use of the facilities of the school as a start to operate at least one day school class room. This, I visualize, would include a civil servant teacher appointed by the Indian Affairs Branch and preferably a Sister of the order as present operating the school. This would solve housing and other problems for the teacher. I am assured such a teacher, fully qualified, could be hired. If necessary, I would make this day school a separate institution as existing schools from the residential school. It is realised, of course, such an arrangement would only be theoretical but by such an arrangement a qualified teacher might be employed and still conform to departmental policy, of instituting a day school system.\n\n2. If a start was made in this direction, I foresee a continuous evolution whereby all children able to go to day school would ultimately do so and those unable would be cared for in residence. The end would, I am sure, conform to policies outlined by the department. The favorite aspects of a residential school system could be retained and the features of a day school system developed. All rural areas are now consolidating their schools, and it would certainly be folly, especially at Hobbema, to build scattered day schools when good roads and buses could very easily bring all children in from at least the Ermineskin and Samson Reserves.\n\nH. M. Woodsworth\nSuperintendent\n\nHNW/ehg\nJanuary 12th, 1950.\n\nMr. H.N. Woodsworth,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nHobbema, Alta.\n\nErmineskin Indian Residential School\n\nReference your 112-11-6 of December 30th.\n\nYour letter of December 30th crossed my letter of January 9th, and I believe we are in accord that at least one day school classroom should be operated at this school.\n\nWe have just completed a similar project at the Fort Alexander School in Manitoba, and it is working to the satisfaction of everyone concerned. Naturally, there must be no segregation of pupils, but the additional classroom building provided helps to prepare educational facilities for all the children, both day and residential school pupils.\n\nWith regard to your second proposal, I will draw it to the attention of Major Clark as soon as he returns from northern Saskatchewan. In the meantime, the information requested in my letter of January 9th will be of great assistance in giving us a proper picture of the situation at Hobbema.\n\nBernard F.

Sch.\nDay School Program\n\nWith reference to your 754-5 (E), I beg to submit as requested, a list outlining the number of children within three miles of this school, of school age or near school age, who could attend as day pupils.\n\nBy placing some of the pupils attending the Hobema Day School in an Ermineskin Day School, the Hobema Day School could be filled by others within a three mile radius of that school. Some pupils, for example, attending the Hobema Day School live near the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. The Hobema Day School is approximately one and one half miles in a direct line from the Ermineskin Indian Residential school.\n\nFor your information, Mr. G. H. Gooderham in a letter dated January 12, 1950, file 112/6-1-1, outlined the program and arrangements in operation at the Blackfoot Indian Day School operated in conjunction with the Crowfoot Indian Residential School.\n\nIn our list, I draw your attention particularly to those children as yet not provided with school facilities.\n\nH.

It is also true, and we admit it willingly, that your Department has at all times been very generous in keeping the school and the out-buildings in proper repair by contributing substantial amounts for that purpose every year. On the other hand, the Oblates have had a staff of both Fathers and Brothers who have worked in this school very faithfully in the interest of the Indians and in a secondary manner in that of the Department of Indian Affairs. I believe that these services should be recognized in a substantial way.\n\nHoping that you will consider the above favourably, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DIRECTOR\n\nERMINE SKIN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nPlease find hereunder a self-explanatory letter from Father Flourde.\n\nI do not feel that we can meet his request as these buildings are completely out of date and the whole structure is in need of replacement. I do not feel it fair to recommend the use of departmental funds for any purchase price or recompense to the Oblate Order.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMarch 3rd, 1950.\n\nRev.

We agreed that it would be difficult for the Department to buy the buildings at Ermineskins when they are no longer of any use.\n\nIt is our intention to replace this school by building a block each year.\n\nAs you are aware, there are also a number of non-Indian children attending this school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

School\n\nAttached find a copy of a letter from the Reverend Father Schmidt, Principal of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School concerning his expenditures in the purchase of potatoes for the school, and receipted invoices.\n\nWhen I was in Ottawa, it was indicated that some assistance from the department might be forthcoming to cover these purchases.\n\nThe Ermineskin School, like the surrounding area, had a crop failure in the 1949 crop year. As a result, it is quite evident the farming operations that normally supply food for the school pupils and in this way act as revenue, have not fulfilled this end. Therefore, the school, faced with no revenue from this source, are finding the financing and feeding of the pupils most difficult in view of the high cost of living index.\n\nI recommend for your approval that aid be given to this institution to keep operating without deficit.\n\nH.

Your File 112-18-5\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo recommending that assistance be granted to the above school, due to the fact that they had a crop failure in the 1949 crop year.\n\nRecently the Minister approved increasing the per capita allowance at the above school from $245.00 to $280.00, effective from April 1st, 1948. As a result, there is an amount of $9,474.16 payable to the Principal of the Ermineskins School as an adjustment in his per capita allowance for the period April 1st, 1948, to December 31st, 1949.\n\nI understand from the Treasury Branch that this cheque has already gone forward, and under these circumstances, we feel that there is no necessity for making a special grant to the school towards the expenses they incurred in purchasing potatoes and vegetables during the academic year 1949-50.\n\nBernard F.

M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit the following;\n\nAt your recent visit to our School you may have noticed the large attendance we had, and it is steadily increasing. We have, actually, an enrolment of 113 pupils.\n\nI would like to point out to you the fact that we have but eight (8) milch cows; you will readily understand that the supply of milk is inadequate to the needs, and that, consequently, an increase in the stock would be of prime importance.\n\nNow, will you kindly lay before the Department the request that we be supplied with four (4) pure-bred Holstein cows. We feel convinced that the only response which can be given to it is a favorable one, since the Department values your opinions so highly.\n\nRelying upon your efficiency as a powerful advocate in our cause, and hoping that the Department will accede to our request, I remain,\n\nYours very gratefully,\n\nRev. P. P. Moulin, O.M.I.\nPrincipal,\nSir:-\n\nOn a recent visit to the Ermineskin Boarding School in the Hobema Agency, the Rev. Father Moulin, Principal of the school informed me that six Holstein cows were being supplied to the Delmas Boarding School, and that he would be glad if the Department could see its way clear to give him a similar number of cows. Since my visit I have received a letter from the Rev. Principal, copy of which I am attaching herewith.\n\nI have already expressed my opinion that the Department would be doing a good act if they could assist all our Boarding Schools in a small way with the right stamp of cows, so that they could build up a herd for themselves, as milk is such an essential in our Indian Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 18, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 404-11A of the 4th instant, enclosing copy of a communication from the Rev. Principal of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School with reference to milk cows. As you are aware, the Department expects these institutions to supply milk to the children in proper quantities, and the onus is on the management. However, you may inform the Rev. Principal that, if he will be responsible for the purchase of two pure-bred Holstein cows, the Department will grant two others. You may make the necessary arrangements for the Department's assistance when you are informed that the school has purchased for itself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

INSPECTOR CHRISTIANSON,\nDATED FEBRUARY 14, 1930, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE\nERMINESKIN'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\n---\n\nOriginal on #112-1-1.\n\nThey have 12 cows at the school. This, in my opinion, is not a sufficient number for an institution that has 145 pupils, besides staff, and as you will realize, there are always times when some of the cows are not giving milk. The quantity of milk they are receiving at the present time is very small, but they had a number of cows that would freshen shortly. They only have stable accommodation for 12 cows, and I do not suppose the Sisters feel that they are in a position to buy any additional cows or build an addition to the barn. I noticed also that their pig pen is very small, and does not provide sufficient room for the pigs that they wish to raise, but I was told that they could not finance the erection of a better pig sty at the present time.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF MR. COMMISSIONER GRAHAM\nDATED FEBRUARY 16th, 1930, ENCLOSING MR. INSPECTOR\nMURDOCH'S REPORT ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE ERMINESKIN'S\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\n---\n\nThe children at the Ermineskin's School\nare apparently well cared for, but it seems to me they\nare not getting the proper food, when seven or eight\ncows are supposed to supply milk for 140 people.\nThe Department should insist on the proper amount of milk\nbeing supplied to the pupils at our Indian schools.\nI think that in many cases we are giving medical attention\nfor illness, when the illness could well be avoided.\nI am sure Dr. Stone will agree with me that when Indian\nchildren are not properly fed they are very susceptible to\ntuberculosis and other complaints.\nOttawa, February 25, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nThe attention of the Department has been drawn to the inadequacy of the milk supply furnished for the daily use of the pupils of the Ermineskin's Indian Residential School. As you are aware, the Department expects that these institutions will supply milk to the children in sufficient quantities, as it is considered one of the most important items of the children's diet. We are informed that the school has at present only 7 or 8 cows, from which the entire milk supply is obtained for the daily use of the pupils and staff.\n\nYou should take up this matter with the Principal and inform him it is expected he will arrange, if there are not other cows in the herd that will soon freshen, for the purchase of a further number of milk cows sufficient to provide an ample supply of milk for the pupils' daily requirements. A request has been made for an increased pupilage as from April 1st next, but, unless the Department is assured that an adequate supply of milk will be available, favourable consideration could not be given this request. After fully discussing the matter of a good milk supply with the Principal, you should inform the department of the action he intends taking to increase the number of milk cows and in furnishing an adequate daily milk supply for the pupils' requirements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. G. Askew, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Indian Agent Mr. Askey gave me knowledge yesterday of a very surprising letter received recently from the Indian Department.\n\nIt has been reported that we did not give an adequate supply of milk to the pupils of the School. When the Inspector Christianson from Regina office was visiting our School at the end of January, he asked how many cows we were milking and our man said: Two.\n\nIt was true but the Inspector did not put any other question, nor make inquiry; it would surprise me very much that a man of his standing would have reported thus only after that one question.\n\nThe fact was we had one cow that was fresh and the other was giving wet milk. Two more could have been milked but scarcity of green feed would have made it hard for them. About a week or ten days after his passage we had 3 cows that calved and one recently. We have now an average of 20 to 24 gallons of milk a day and practically so since the 10th of February.\n\nIn a few weeks we will have 3 more cows to calve, and later, 4 more. In May, for the latest, we will certainly have from 40 to 60 gallons a day. We have 12 cows all under eight years old. Next year, we expect to have 2 more if we have no accident.\n\nAnyway, the one who reported that we did not give an adequate supply of milk to the children should know that when cows are near calving it is not good to milk them nor is the milk of first quality; also that last year during a very dry year, the pasture was not abundant nor very green in September and October; our provision of green feed was not therefore very abundant, only about 15 tons and also hay. It is not enough to make the cows give milk all through the hard season.\n\nThe reporter said we had only 8 cows, we have 12 at present, but I am glad that this remark was made! 9 cows, because we have only 8 stands for cows in the stable. In fact, we are obliged to put 4 cows and calves along with the horses. Our stable is rather small but it was built at our own expense. Now 2 Holstein cows excepted, which were given by the authority of Mr. Graham, the Indian Commissioner, we have received no help from the Indian Department.\n\nWould it not then be a very kind deed of the Department to give us any fund to enlarge the stable or even build a new one, and buy for us 4 or 5 more good milch cows as it has been done for other schools which I envy very much?\nI hope that these remarks will make you understand what we are doing for the welfare of our children and also give you good suggestions to help us in a larger measure for our stable and stock.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, March 19, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the milk supply at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. The Department is glad to learn that more milk is being provided for the pupils than was reported. I regret there are no funds at the present time for the erection of a new barn.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. P. P. Moulin, O. M. I.,\nPrincipal,\nErmineskin Indian Res. School,\nHobbema, Alta.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter No. 112-1-14, dated February 25th last, in connection with the milk supply for the pupils at Ermineskin's Residential School. I have the honor to reply as follows;\n\nThe Rev. Father Moulin, Principal of the school informs me, that they have at present twelve first class cows, and there are two heifers to become cows this spring, which will make a total of fourteen cows.\n\nAt the present time five of these cows are supplying 24 gallons of milk per day for use of the pupils. Three more cows will freshen in a few days, and four more are due about the end of this month.\n\nThe Rev. Principal states further, that the pupils have always had an adequate supply of milk, and if at any time more cows are needed he would be willing to procure them.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 22nd, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the milk supply at the Ermineskin's Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department is pleased to note that there is now a sufficient supply of milk available for the use of the pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. G. Askey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nSir,\n\nA request has been made by the Principal of the Ermineskin Residential School to be provided with a 16\" sulky plow. The school has some forty to fifty acres to be plowed and would have to be placed at the inconvenience of borrowing, if they are not furnished with a plow of their own. The cost of a sulky plow would be in the neighborhood of $100.00. I shall be glad to know if the Department will sanction the purchase of one for use at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 17, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 404-11A R.C. of the 12th instant, relative to the request of the Principal of the Erminekin's Indian Residential School to be supplied with a 16\" sulky plow, and giving an estimate of the cost.\n\nIn reply I have to say that our funds are extremely limited and we will be unable to provide the amount required in the purchase of the plow. It is considered, however, that the school should have this equipment for use on their farm and should arrange to provide same from per capita earnings or other receipts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nErmineskin Residential School,\nHobbema, Alta., March 28, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYesterday, I had a letter from the Acting Indian Agent stating that the Indian Department could not afford to give us a sulky plow, but that it was to the school to provide for this equipment.\n\nI regard to say that at the present time we are too much in debt as you know to make this purchase. In the past 1912-1914 we remodeled our school in order to have the increase per capita; in 1922 we enlarged the school and went in debt up to $17,000; in 1929, we had another addition and repairs made to our own expenses, costing over $8,000.\n\nOther schools had not to go to these expenses, but entirely rebuilt by the Indian Department, they are given stock and implements for their farming commodities. We will then wait to the day when the Indian Department will rebuild our school and give us the means of teaching farm work to our pupils.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. P. Loulin, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nW. REGINA, SASK., 13TH APRIL, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Department No. 112-1-14 of the 17th ultimo, I enclose a copy of a letter which I have received from the Reverend Principal of the Ermineskin Residential School, to the last paragraph of which I would particularly draw attention. It is not quite clear what the Reverend Father Moulin intends to convey. It may be the expression of a spirit of resignation or it may mean that instruction in farming must cease until he has what he considers proper field equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nCalgary, Alta., Dec. 28th, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nIn connection with my report on the Hobbema school, I would like to know if the Department would consider spending say about $200.00 for repairs on this building next summer. As I pointed out in my report some of the stairs and floors need repairing, also whether the Department would furnish a Sulky Plow. This has been asked for before.\n\nThe Principal informed me he did not have the funds to put out on repairs for the building at the present time, or to buy any farming equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) M. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, January 10, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, requesting to be informed if the Department would provide an expenditure of approximately $200 to carry out repairs to the stairs and floors of the Ermine-skin Indian Residential School during the coming summer, also to supply a sulky plow.\n\nFor your information, I may say that certain provision is being made in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year for repairs to this building, but, at the present time, I am not in a position to state whether same will be finally approved or not. I would suggest that this matter be drawn to the attention of the Department early next spring, when full particulars should be given as to the repairs required to be undertaken and the approximate cost of any material and labour required.\n\nRegarding the supplying of a sulky plow, I may say that we have no funds for this purpose at the present time. A request for this equipment should be forwarded in due time next spring, after our Appropriation for the next fiscal year is available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to bring to your attention that while inspecting the Ermineskin School in the Hobbema Agency, the Principal made requests for the following:\n\n1 - team of horses, at an approximate cost of $150.00\n1 - set of harness, at an approximate cost of $40.00\n4 - milch cows, at approximately $10.00 each - $160.00\n1 - Shorthorn bull, milch strain, approximately - $125.00\n1 - Seed Drill, at an approximate cost of - $225.00\n\nA Blacksmith and Carpenter shop is now operated by the School, where the boys receive lessons in blacksmithing, repair-work, carpenter work, etc., every day, and the following equipment is required for this shop:\n\n1 - Anvil, 75 pounds;\n1 - Rip Saw which would be run by electricity, and which would cost about $20.00;\n1 - Hand Forge.\n\nBesides the above, the Principal has asked for some paint, varnish, etc., for interior decorating, to the amount of about $75.00.\n\nI would ask that these requests receive the consideration of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\nPB CALGARY, ALTA., April 26th, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to bring to your attention that while inspecting the Ermineskin School in the Hobbema Agency, the Principal made requests for the following:\n\n1 - team of horses, at an approximate cost of $150.00\n1 - set of harness, at an approximate cost of $40.00\n4 - milch cows, at approximately $40.00 each $160.00\n1 - Shorthorn bull, milch strain, approximately $125.00\n1 - Seed Drill, at an approximate cost of $225.00\n\nA Blacksmith and Carpenter shop is now operated by the School, where the boys receive lessons in blacksmithing, repair-work, carpenter work, &c., every day, and the following equipment is required for this shop:\n\n1 - Anvil, 75 pounds;\n1 - Rip Saw which would be run by electricity, and which would cost about $20.00;\n1 - Hand Forge.\n\nBesides the above, the Principal has asked for some paint, varnish, &c., for interior decorating, to the amount of about $75.00.\n\nI would ask that these requests receive the consideration of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, April 30, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 404-11A of the 26th instant, reporting on your inspection of the Bruleeskin Indian Residential School, and also your letter of the same file number and date, regarding the request made by the Principal, to be supplied with a team of horses and harness, a number of milch cows and a bull; a seed drill, supplies for blacksmith and carpenter shop; paint, etc., for interior decorating.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the total appropriation available in our Estimates for the current fiscal year for this school is the sum of $300, which was for miscellaneous repairs and improvements. I regret, therefore, that it will not be possible to supply the team of horses, a set of harness, four milch cows and a shorthorn bull. When next year's Estimates are being prepared, consideration will be given to including an amount to cover the cost of the above named live stock.\n\nIf the Principal and yourself consider the seed drill, at an approximate cost of $225, and the paint, varnish, etc., for interior decorating, as well as the blacksmith and carpenter shop equipment, are more needful than spending the entire appropriation in the purchase of the above mentioned equipment, etc., the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of the seed drill, the paint and varnish for interior decorating, an anvil, rip saw and hand forge. Purchase of the paint, varnish and blacksmith shop equipment should be made from firms on the approved list. Prices for the seed drill should be obtained from the local agents of manufacturers of farm equipment, who are on the approved list, and purchase should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price. Please obtain accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the above authorized supplies, which should be certified in the usual manner and forwarded for payment.\n\nYour report on your inspection of this school has been noted with interest. The Department is pleased that good progress is being made under the circumstances in this old school building. We note that the children are in good health and also that the school authorities intend, this year, to extend their gardening and farming operations. The Department has also noted your remarks regarding the prevention of fire hazard in the building. An order is being placed here for three additional fire extinguishers.\n\nConcerning the condition of the beds in the dormitories, certain funds are available for new equipment. If you will obtain from the Principal and forward a list, stating the number of beds required, as well as their length and width, we might be prepared to supply a reasonable number. It is presumed that new mattresses would be required with any beds supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM.

It is noted that the authority for incurring this expense is stated to be departmental letter dated April 30th, last - our file 112-1-14.\n\nIn that letter, you were informed that the total appropriation available in our Estimates for the current fiscal year for this school was the sum of $300, which was for miscellaneous repairs and improvements, and it was regretted that it would not be possible to supply the team of horses, a set of harness, 4 milch cows and a shorthorn bull. You were informed that, if the Principal and yourself considered the seed drill, at a cost of $225, and the supplying of the paint, varnish, etc., as well as blacksmith and carpenter shop equipment were more needful than expending the entire appropriation for repairs and improvements, you could arrange for the purchase of these supplies.\n\nThe Department is unable to understand, from our letter, that any authority was given to purchase horses. Before paying the account for supplying the mare, I would request further information as to the reasons for the purchase. As you were informed that only $300 was available, you might state what equipment it is intended to supply for the balance of the available appropriation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Principal were here in Calgary on June 1st, and the matter was talked over with Mr. Phelan. In addition to the $300.00 that had been authorized previously, Mr. Phelan authorized another $100.00, making a total of $400.00, which was to be expended in the purchase of equipment that seemed to be most necessary for the institution. You will readily understand that if we had bought the drill at $225.00 there would have been only $75.00 left to buy other equipment, so it was decided to do without this for the present.\n\nI trust this explanation will be satisfactory to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nM.

Lewis,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been appointed Bursar at the Ermineskin Indian Residential school, Hobbema, with the instruction of establishing a farm in connection with the school and teach the boys a few things about the machinery and the methods of farming in the West, which will be the natural mode of making a living for them. There is an embryo of a farm so far, with practically no machines, and I have decided to buy a tractor; latter on the other machines will follow, but I find that it is almost impossible to get anything in this line unless you have a permit from the Board of Priorities. Most Agents have it but Hobbema is not in this favored category, and it is why I am asking to get it for me. I do not know yet what make of tractor I will buy; I will decide as soon as I have the permit. I suppose it is too early yet to know if there is any tractors discarded by the army, available for our kind of work.\n\nThanking you most sincerely, I remain respectfully Yours,\n\nE. Ruaux, O.M.T.\nOttawa,\nOctober 6, 1943.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to your intention of purchasing a tractor for use at the Ermineskin Residential School. In view of the small arable acreage at this school at the present time, the Department doubts the necessity of having a tractor. It is possible, although we have no definite information to that effect, that we might be able to secure a tractor for you after the war, as there will be a considerable amount of this equipment surplus to requirements at that time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. E.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

to remove the children from the premises during the blasting operations and the foundation work for the new school, the classrooms were closed on June 8 and the children moved to the summer camp.\n\n**TOTAL number of days in Quarter**: 91\n\n**AGGREGATE number of days pupils in residence during Quarter**: 3456\n\n**AVERAGE attendance of pupils during Quarter**: 57.76\n\n**AMOUNT of per capita grant due for Quarter**: $167.68\n\n---\n\n**NOTE**\u2014Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CONVEY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Holy Angels Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 1, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 400\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, page ii No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence by all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita paid for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Holy Angels Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: Sister Mary Anne Delamere\n\nDated January 5, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit the following:\n\nAt your recent visit to our School you may have noticed the large attendance we had, and it is steadily increasing. We have, actually, an enrolment of 113 pupils.\n\nI would like to point out to you the fact that we have but eight (8) milch cows; you will readily understand that the supply of milk is inadequate to the needs, and that, consequently, an increase in the stock would be of prime importance.\n\nNow, will you kindly lay before the Department the request that we be supplied with four (4) pure-bred Holstein cows. We feel convinced that the only response which can be given to it is a favorable one, since the Department values your opinions so highly.\n\nRelying upon your efficiency as a powerful advocate in our cause, and hoping that the Department will accede to our request, I remain,\n\nYours very gratefully,\n\nRev. P. P. Moulin, O.M.I.\nPrincipal,\nSir:\n\nOn a recent visit to the Ermineskin Boarding School in the Hobbema Agency, the Rev. Father Moulin, Principal of the school informed me that six Holstein cows were being supplied to the Japowe Boarding School, and that he would be glad if the Department could see its way clear to give him a similar number of cows. Since my visit I have received a letter from the Rev. Principal, copy of which I am attaching herewith.\n\nI have already expressed my opinion that the Department would be doing a good act if they could assist all our Boarding Schools in a small way with the right stamp of cows, so that they could build up a herd for themselves, as milk is such an essential in our Indian Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 18, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 404-11A of the 4th instant, enclosing copy of a communication from the Rev. Principal of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School with reference to milk cows. As you are aware, the Department expects these institutions to supply milk to the children in proper quantities, and the onus is on the management. However, you may inform the Rev. Principal that, if he will be responsible for the purchase of two pure-bred Holstein cows, the Department will grant two others. You may make the necessary arrangements for the Department's assistance when you are informed that the school has purchased for itself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

INSPECTOR CHRISTIANSON,\nDATED FEBRUARY 14, 1930, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE\nERMINESKIN'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\n---\n\nThey have 12 cows at the school. This, in my opinion, is not a sufficient number for an institution that has 145 pupils, besides staff, and as you will realize, there are always times when some of the cows are not giving milk. The quantity of milk they are receiving at the present time is very small, but they had a number of cows that would freshen shortly. They only have stable accommodation for 12 cows, and I do not suppose the Sisters feel that they are in a position to buy any additional cows or build an addition to the barn. I noticed also that their pig pen is very small, and does not provide sufficient room for the pigs that they wish to raise, but I was told that they could not finance the erection of a better pig sty at the present time.\nThe children at the Ermineskin's School are apparently well cared for, but it seems to me they are not getting the proper food, when seven or eight cows are supposed to supply milk for 140 people. The Department should insist on the proper amount of milk being supplied to the pupils at our Indian schools.\n\nI think that in many cases we are giving medical attention for illness, when the illness could well be avoided. I am sure Dr. Stone will agree with me that when Indian children are not properly fed they are very susceptible to tuberculosis and other complaints.\nOttawa, February 25, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nThe attention of the Department has been drawn to the inadequacy of the milk supply furnished for the daily use of the pupils of the Ermineskin's Indian Residential School. As you are aware, the Department expects that these institutions will supply milk to the children in sufficient quantities, as it is considered one of the most important items of the children's diet. We are informed that the school has at present only 7 or 8 cows, from which the entire milk supply is obtained for the daily use of the pupils and staff.\n\nYou should take up this matter with the Principal and inform him it is expected he will arrange, if there are not other cows in the herd that will soon freshen, for the purchase of a further number of milk cows sufficient to provide an ample supply of milk for the pupils' daily requirements. A request has been made for an increased milking as from April 1st, next, but, unless the Department is assured that an adequate supply of milk will be available, favourable consideration could not be given this request. After fully discussing the matter of a good milk supply with the Principal, you should inform the Department of the action he intends taking to increase the number of milk cows and in furnishing an adequate daily milk supply for the pupils' requirements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Ass't Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. G. Askew, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nEmineskin Residential School,\nHobbema, Alta., March 7, 1930.\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Indian Agent Mr. Askey gave me knowledge yesterday of a very surprising letter received recently from the Indian Department.\n\nIt has been reported that we did not give an adequate supply of milk to the pupils of the School. When the Inspector Christianson from Regina office was visiting our School at the end of January, he asked how many cows we were milking and our man said: Two.\n\nIt was true but the Inspector did not put any other question, nor made inquiry; it would surprise me very much that a man of his standing would have reported thus only after that one question.\n\nThe fact was we had one cow that was fresh and the other was giving yet milk. Two more could have been milked but scarcity of green feed would have made it hard for them. About a week or ten days after his passage, we had 5 cows that calved and one recently. We have now an average of 20 to 24 gallons of milk a day and practically so since the 10th of February.\n\nIn a few weeks we will have 3 more cows to calve, and later, 4 more. In May, for the latest, we will certainly have from 40 to 60 gallons a day. We have 12 cows all under eight years old. Next year, we expect to have 2 more if we have no accident.\n\nAnyway, the one who reported that we did not give an adequate supply of milk to the children should know that when cows are near calving it is not good to milk them nor is the milk of first quality. Also that last year within a short year, the pasture was not abundant nor very green in September and October; our provision of green feed was not therefore very abundant, only about 15 tons and also hay.\n\nHay is not enough to make the cows give milk all through the hard season.\n\nThe reporter said we had only 8 cows. We have 12 at present but I am glad that this remark was made: 8 cows, because we have only 6 stands for cows in the stable. In fact, we are obliged to put 4 cows and calves along with the horses. Our stable is rather small but it was built at our own expense. Now, 2 Holstein cows excepted, which were given by the authority of Mr. Graham, the Indian Commissioner, we have received no help from the Indian Department.\n\nWould it not then be a very kind deed of the Department to give us any fund to enlarge the stable or even build a new one, and buy for us 4 or 5 more good milk cows as it has been done for other schools which I envy very much?\nI hope that these remarks will make you understand what we are doing for the welfare of our children and also give you good suggestions to help us in a larger measure for our stable and stock.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, March 19, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the milk supply at the Ermineskin Indian Residential School. The Department is glad to learn that more milk is being provided for the pupils than was reported. I regret there are no funds at the present time for the erection of a new barn.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. P. P. Moulin, O. M. I.,\nPrincipal,\nErmineskin Indian Res. School,\nHobbema, Alta.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter No. 112-1-14, dated February 25th last, in connection with the milk supply for the pupils at Ermineskin's Residential School. I have the honor to reply as follows;\n\nThe Rev. Father Moulin, Principal of the school informs me, that they have at present twelve first class cows, and there are two heifers to become cows this spring, which will make a total of fourteen cows.\n\nAt the present time five of these cows are supplying 24 gallons of milk per day for use of the pupils. Three more cows will freshen in a few days, and four more are due about the end of this month.\n\nThe Rev. Principal states further, that the pupils have always had an adequate supply of milk, and if at any time more cows are needed he would be willing to procure them.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Hon. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 22nd, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the milk supply at the Ermineskin's Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department is pleased to note that there is now a sufficient supply of milk available for the use of the pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. G. Askey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nSir:\n\nA request has been made by the Principal of the Bruleneaskin Residential School to be provided with a 16\" sulky plow. The school has some forty to fifty acres to be plowed and would have to be placed at the inconvenience of borrowing, if they are not furnished with a plow of their own. The cost of a sulky plow would be in the neighborhood of $100.00. I shall be glad to know if the Department will sanction the purchase of one for use at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 17, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 404-11A R.O. of the 12th instant, relative to the request of the Principal of the Ermineskin's Indian Residential School to be supplied with a 16\" sulky plow, and giving an estimate of the cost.\n\nIn reply I have to say that our funds are extremely limited and we will be unable to provide the amount required in the purchase of the plow. It is considered, however, that the school should have this equipment for use on their farm and should arrange to provide same from per capita earnings or other receipts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nErmineskin Residential School,\nHobbema, Alta., March 28, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYesterday, I had a letter from the Acting Indian Agent stating that the Indian Department could not afford to give us a sulky plow, but that it was to the school to provide for this equipment.\n\nI regard to say that at the present time we are too much in debt as you know to make this purchase. In the past 1912-1914 we remodeled our school in order to have the increase per capita; in 1922 we enlarged the school and went in debt up to $17,000; in 1929, we had another addition and repairs made to our own expenses, costing over $8,000.\n\nOther schools had not to go to these expenses, but entirely rebuilt by the Indian Department, they are given stock and implements for their farming commodities. We will then wait to the day when the Indian Department will rebuild our school and give us the means of teaching far work to our pupils.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. P. Loulin, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nW. REGINA, SASK., 13th April, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Department No. 112-1-14 of the 17th ultimo, I enclose a copy of a letter which I have received from the Reverend Principal of the Ermineskin Residential School, to the last paragraph of which I would particularly draw attention. It is not quite clear what the Reverend Father Moulin intends to convey. It may be the expression of a spirit of resignation or it may mean that instruction in farming must cease until he has what he considers proper field equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nIn connection with my report on the Hobbema school, I would like to know if the Department would consider spending say about $200.00 for repairs on this building next summer. As I pointed out in my report some of the stairs and floors need repairing, also whether the Department would furnish a Sulky Flow. This has been asked for before.\n\nThe Principal informed me he did not have the funds to put out on repairs for the building at the present time, or to buy any farming equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) M. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, January 10, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, requesting to be informed if the Department would provide an expenditure of approximately $200 to carry out repairs to the stairs and floors of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School during the coming summer, also to supply a sulky plow.\n\nFor your information, I may say that certain provision is being made in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year for repairs to this building, but, at the present time, I am not in a position to state whether such will be finally approved or not. I would suggest that this matter be drawn to the attention of the Department early next spring, when full particulars should be given as to the repairs required to be undertaken and the approximate cost of any material and labour required.\n\nRegarding the supplying of a sulky plow, I may say that we have no funds for this purpose at the present time. A request for this equipment should be forwarded in due time next spring, after our Appropriation for the next fiscal year is available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to bring to your attention that while inspecting the Ermineskin School in the Hobbema Agency, the Principal made requests for the following:\n\n1 - team of horses, at an approximate cost of $150.00\n1 - set of harness, at an approximate cost of $40.00\n4 - milch cows, at approximately $40.00 each - $160.00\n1 - Shorthorn bull, milch strain, approximately - $125.00\n1 - Seed Drill, at an approximate cost of - $225.00\n\nA Blacksmith and Carpenter shop is now operated by the School, where the boys receive lessons in blacksmithing, repair-work, carpenter work, &c., every day, and the following equipment is required for this shop:\n\n1 - Anvil, 75 pounds;\n1 - Rip Saw which would be run by electricity, and which would cost about $20.00;\n1 - Hand Forge.\n\nBesides the above, the Principal has asked for some paint, varnish, &c., for interior decorating, to the amount of about $75.00.\n\nI would ask that these requests receive the consideration of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, April 30, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 404-11A of the 26th instant, reporting on your inspection of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School, and also your letter of the same file number and date, regarding the request made by the Principal, to be supplied with a team of horses, four milch cows and a bull, a seed drill, supplies for blacksmith and carpenter shop, paint, etc., for interior decorating.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the total appropriation available in our Estimates for the current fiscal year for this school is the sum of $300, which is set aside for miscellaneous repairs and improvements. I regret, therefore, that it will not be possible to supply the team of horses, a set of harness, four milch cows and a shorthorn bull. When next year's Estimates are being prepared, consideration will be given to including an amount to cover the cost of the above named live stock.\n\nIf the Principal and yourself consider the seed drill, at an approximate cost of $225, and the paint, varnish, etc., for interior decorating, as well as the blacksmith and carpenter shop supplies, are more needed than specified in the entire appropriation in the purchasing of the above mentioned items, etc., the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of the seed drill, the paint and varnish for interior decorating, an airil, ripper and hand forge. Purchase of the paint, varnish and blacksmith shop equipment should be made from firms on the approved list. Prices for the seed drill may be obtained from the local agents of manufacturers of farm equipment, who are on the approved list, and purchase should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price. Please obtain accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the above authorized supplies, which should be certified in the usual manner and forwarded for payment.\n\nYour report on your inspection of this school has been noted with interest. The Department is pleased to note progress is being made under the circumstances in this old school building. We note that the children are in good health and also that the school authorities intend, this year, to extend their gardening and feeding operations. The Department has also noted your earnest remarks regarding the prevention of fire hazard in the building. An order is being placed here for three additional fire extinguishers.\n\nConcerning the condition of the beds in the dormitories, certain funds are available for new equipment. If you will obtain from the Principal and forward a list, stating the number of beds required, as well as their length and width, we might be prepared to supply a reasonable number. It is presumed that new mattresses would be required with any beds supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nM.

Principal were here in Calgary on June 1st, and the matter was talked over with Mr. Phelan. In addition to the $300.00 that had been authorized previously, Mr. Phelan authorized another $100.00, making a total of $400.00, which was to be expended in the purchase of equipment that seemed to be most necessary for the institution. You will readily understand that if we had bought the drill at $225.00 there would have been only $75.00 left to buy other equipment, so it was decided to do without this for the present.\n\nI trust this explanation will be satisfactory to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nAug. 30 1935\n\n[Signature]\n\nNobara Alta\nSwinak Indian School\nNobara Alta\n\nAug 26 35\n\nTo Mr. Lara, May, 1935\nWhite Bird Leg. 1.00\nTo Grand 25.00\n\nPAID\n\nAug 30 1935\nSeptember 30 1936\n\nYOUNG\n\nRobson, Alta.\n\nGrinnell Indian School\n\nRobson, Alta.\n\nSept 29 1936\n\nTo One Horse,\n\n5 yrs old, Brown, 1400\n\nBond, A.

September 28, 1943.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been appointed Bursar at the Ermineskin Indian Residential school, Hobbema, with the instruction of establishing a farm in connection with the school and teach the boys a few things about the machinery and the methods of farming in the West, which will be the natural mode of making a living for them. There is an embryo of a farm so far, with practically no machines, and I have decided to buy a tractor, latter on the other machines will follow, but I find that it is almost impossible to get anything in this line unless you have a permit from the Board of Priorities. Most Agents have it but Hobbema is not in this favored category, and it is why I am asking to get it for me. I do not know yet what make of tractor I will buy, I will decide as soon as I have the permit. I suppose it is too early yet to know if there is any tractors discarded by the army, available for our kind of work.\n\nThanking you most sincerely, I remain respectfully Yours,\n\nE.

In view of the small arable acreage at this school at the present time, the Department doubts the necessity of having a tractor. It is possible, although we have no definite information to that effect, that we might be able to secure a tractor for you after the war, as there will be a considerable amount of this equipment surplus to requirements at that time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6.

The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Holy Angels Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: July 4, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of the Return giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Holy Angels Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: Sister Mary Anne Deslauriers\n\nDated January 5, 1943.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I & A 403\nReop.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Holy Angels Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: Sister Mary Anne DeLanieres.\n\nDated April 2, 1945.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated April 5, 1945.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A.401\nRog.

Quarter:** 5503\n\n**Average attendance of pupils during Quarter:** 87.56\n\n**Amount of per capita grant due for Quarter:** $145.25\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby Certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Holy Angels Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 1 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter for all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in which all pupils were present, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Holy Angels Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1944.\n\nDated October 3, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nJ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper place.\n\n4. All Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Holy Angels Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: Sister Marie Anne Deslauriers\n\nDated January 5, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: J.

correctly made and entered at the foot of column.**\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the feet thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of quarterly grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Holy Angels Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 3, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: Fort Chipewyan, this 5th April, 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When counting the number of pupils, all names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Totals\n\n- **Total number of days in Quarter:** 92\n- **Aggregate number of days pupils resided during Quarter:** 770\n- **Average residence of pupils during quarter:** 8.3 days\n- **Amount of per capita pupil fee for Quarter:** $25.41\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pasting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils in residence during quarter, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter minus every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Holy Angels Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 5, 1947.\n\nI have most carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated this 9th January 1947.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, putting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Holy Angels Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated October 1, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Signature]\n\nthis 10th October, 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

School opened for the term on September 3.\n\nThree days later the flu broke out among the pupils and attacked the majority of them but kept them out of the classrooms only a few days.\n\nFrom September 19 to September 26, the three classrooms were closed for the potato harvest.\n\n**TOTAL number of days in Quarter**: 92\n\n**AGGREGATE number of days pupils in residence during Quarter**: 602\n\n**AVERAGE attendance of pupils during quarter**: 65.44\n\n**AMOUNT of per capita grant due for Quarter**: $3,108.88\n\n---\n\n**NOTE**\u2014Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days that all pupils are present during the quarter and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby Certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Holy Angels Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: Sister Mary Ann Delaney\n\nDated July 1, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Fort Chipewyan this 9th July, 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9.

herewith submit the Quarterly Return of\nthe Holy Angels Indian Residential School for the Quarter\nended June 30. The following remarks complete it:\n\n1. The Primary Classroom was open 45.5 days during the quarter;\n   the Intermediate Classroom ... 44.5 days;\n   the Senior Classroom .......... 44 days.\n\n2. The classrooms re-opened after Easter on the 8th of April.\n\n3. From the 11th to the 28th of April, the three classrooms\n   were closed by order of the District Nurse on account of an\n   epidemic of flu. Many day scholars, all the pupils resident\n   at the school and several members of the staff fell within\n   the first four days, but all were able to resume their tasks\n   after two weeks.\n\n4. In June, four days were allowed for the cutting of potato\n   seed and the planting.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSister M. Ann Deslauriers,\nprincipal.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils named on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Holy Angels Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated April 1, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFonds No. I.A. 403\nRep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, saying i.e. No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Holy Angels Bay School for the Quarter ended 19...\n\nPrincipal.\n\nDated 19...\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Holy Angels Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 1, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated July 14, 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in which each pupil is entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Holy Angels Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1949.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated April 6th, 1949.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated April 7th, 1949.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Athabasca Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Holy Angels Ind.

These will be taken during the next quarter.\n\nOne extra holiday was granted by His Excellency Bishop Breynat and was approved by Mr. J. N.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI declare that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Holy Angels Indian School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: Sister Olivia Lomie\n\nDated Oct. 8, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Fort Chipewyan\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Conroy, on the Boarding Schools in Treaty No. 8 and Mackenzie District, Dated December 18, 1911. Original on File 160370-15E\n\nCHIPEWYAN\n\nThe Boarding school at Chipewyan, under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Mission, is one main building with two wings. Its length fronting on the lake, is 105 feet. The school is well situated on high ground, protected on three sides by rising ground and timber and is only exposed to a south wind from the lake.\n\nThe foundations are of stone, 18 inches thick. The walls are logs, sheeted both outside and inside with planks. Galleries opening from the ground and second floors run the entire frontage of the building.\n\nThe building is economically planned, the rooms are all exceptionally well lighted, and the ventilation is very fair.\n\nThere are four dormitories, two for boys and two for girls. Their measurements are 37 x 32 x 8; 32 x 66 x 8; 31 x 22 x 8 and 37 x 32 x 8. These give accommodation according to Departmental regulation, for 51 pupils. The class rooms are two in number; one 32 x 23 x 76, accommodating with regard to floor space 75 pupils, and cubic space 32 pupils. The other is 37 x 20 x 76, accommodating (floor space) 46 pupils and (cubic space) 22 pupils. The total accommodation is for 54 pupils. The average attendance is about 45. There is no hospital, but a special room is kept for cases of sickness. There are two fire escapes from...\nChipewyan con.\n\nthe dormitories.\n\nTwo hot air furnaces give every satisfaction, stoves are also placed in the larger dormitories and class rooms.\n\nThe water supply is obtained from a force pump from the lake to the kitchen, where the reservoirs are placed. An independent pump is kept ready in case of fire. There is also a well in the rear of the building.\n\nThe class work follows pretty closely the regulations of the Department. The girls are taught sewing and cooking, and the boys are taught elementary carpentry and farming. The boys help in the general work around the Mission. The girls take turns in the kitchen and are given enough practical experience to stand them in good stead when they leave school.\n\nThe Mission has drained a little lake in the rear to provide a garden. There they raise enough vegetables for use in the school, and about 800 bushels of potatoes.\n\nThe Mission owns eight cows, a bull, and four heifers.\n\nI would recommend that the Department send in two blackboards, a dozen desks, some wall maps of the Dominion and the north country, and a globe.\nHoly Angels Boarding School,\nFort Chipewyan, Alta., July 24, 1916\n\nTo the Honorable Robert Rogers,\nMinister of Public Works,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nWhereas the Holy Angels Boarding School is situated on the northern shore of Athabasca Lake at Chipewyan,\n\nwhereas the school is dependent for water on the lake water and whereas the lake water is often by muddy water in the spring and summer season and it is unwholesome and dangerous for the pupils to drink and whereas our school is gratified with your cooperation and financially incapable of securing a remedial condition of things and whereas we have seized the opportunity of our (signature)\nand he pointed out again to us in this way, that the Honorable Minister of Public Works and his Government would be financially on the digging of a well and gathering all necessary apparatus and things which are essential.\n\nFor the approximate cost we have asked Mr. H. A. Macleod to visit the St. Albert Institution and see and ascertain the cost of plant and such cost will cover cost of plant except perhaps the drilling because the shaft is rocky.\n\nAn engine supplied would have to be put away as no coal can be secured at the present.\n\nIn granting our request your Government will secure but lasting gratitude and we shall not be forgetful of your kindness.\n\nWe remain yours devotedly,\n\n[Signature]\nSister Laurie Matron\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nHonourable Robert Rogers,\nMinister of Public Works,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed you will find petition of the Chipewen Convent. As per the petition I have visited the Institution at St. Albert and I find that the installation will be about $600. This is exclusive of the cost of drilling the well, and the usual cost is so much per foot, I am not aware of the amount. The circumstances are these: Chipewen is situated on the mouth of Lake Athabasca, and the Athabasca River flows into the mouth of the Lake down in the Rocky River, which empties into the Slave at the Junction of the Peace and the Slave. The Athabasca River is very muddy at all times of the year except late in the fall and early in the spring. The Lake is extremely muddy by reason of its shallow waters (maximum depth in normal water 8 to 10 ft.) for a distance of about 25 miles towards Fond du Lac. It becomes, therefore, impossible for any of the institutions at Chipewen to get clear water during the greater part of the year. In the main, and the only water available is the Lake water. This has proven to be a source of danger to the children in attendance, and whilst visiting the northern\ndistrict the Sisters asked me to request the Government assistance.\n\nThe well which would be dug for the Sisters could be used by a large portion of the population of Chipewyan, it being only a small trading post. Whilst this may not be considered public works, I can vouch for the fact that the request made by the Sisters is a very reasonable one indeed.\n\nI travelled the Athabasca, the Rockey and Slave Rivers for a distance of 700 miles and I always welcomed a brook from which I could get clear water to drink. Even when the water is settled in pails and barrels, it is at best riley. From a sanitary point of view it seems that the Government ought to do something for that Institution, which is established for the public welfare, which at best is living in seclusion for the sake of Christianity and education of children.\n\nI trust you will give this request a favourable consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(SGD) H.A.

A. Mackie of Edmonton and the officers of the Fort Chipewyan Boarding School, in reference to the sinking of a well in connection with the institution. I have read these communications and I hope to be able to do something to assist them but I wish to defer action until the return of Mr. H. A. Conroy, our Inspector for Treaty No. 8, who is conversant with the situation there. I am retaining these communications for my guidance later on.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nHonourable Robert Rogers,\nMinister of Public Works,\nOttawa.\nMemo. to Mr. Scott.\n\nOttawa.\nNov. 20th, 1915.\n\nIn regard to the proposal from Mr. A. Mackie that the Department should assist the Catholic mission in their efforts to provide a supply of well water for the institution at Chipewyan I have to report that although it would be a very desirable thing to have a supply of well water at this institution yet the natural obstacles are of such a serious character that in my opinion the cost of construction and installation would be prohibitive.\n\nThe country in the neighbourhood of the School is very rocky, and it is a very questionable matter as to whether it is at all possible to drill down more than 10 or 15 feet between the rock ridges without striking rock.\n\nA good well has been in use at the Chipewyan settlement for several years, and is situated at the Hudson's Bay Co. post, but it is probably about 1000 yds distant from the mission. This well is not the sole source of the drinking water supply, for during a great part of the time, the ordinary lake water is used by the community. It rarely occurs that Athabasca Lake recedes to such a low level as was in evidence this summer at the time when Mr. Mackie\nwas visiting the settlement. When the lake is at its ordinary level the water is easily accessible and not unduly impregnated with mud or silt, so that it is quite fit for drinking purposes.\n\nIf the mission would make some preliminary effort in the direction of locating a supply of well water, I would have no hesitation in recommending that assistance be given toward the expense of boring or drilling, and cribbing work, but until an indication of water can be obtained it would in my opinion constitute a departure from the usual policy of the Department to become liable for an expenditure which cannot be estimated or controlled, and for which there would be no guarantee of proportionate results.\n\nInspector Treaty No.8\nHead Office: Royal Bank Chambers, Edmonton\n\nSept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa,\n\nDr. to The Northern Trading Co.\n\nLimited\n\nEDMONTON\n\nALBERTA\n\nTo 2 sewing machines for Holy Angels Boarding School, Ft.

If the mission would make some preliminary effort in the direction of locating a supply of well water, the Department might then be in a position to assist towards the expense of boring and cribbing.\n\nAn alternative scheme would be the erection of a windmill with an attachment for pumping water and the carrying of a pipe line to the deep water channel at the head of the lake, where the Roche River runs in, a distance of about five hundred yards. A fairly close estimate could be given of the approximate cost of this project, whereas, in the case of rock drilling, this would be impossible.\n\nThe Department would, therefore, be pleased if you would request the mission authorities to have a careful examination.\n\nRev.

The Athabasca lake has also been an uncertain source, owing to the receding of the water of this during the season of low water, when the accumulation of silt in the margin of the lake, (largely vegetable matter,) renders this water unfit for use.\n\nThe school authorities have, after many efforts, succeeded in finding the solution, they having dug a well on the bank of the lake, which is reported to contain an abundant supply of pure water, which is filtered from the lake through the intervening sand.\n\nThe estimate of the school for completing the work is placed at $1,500.00. There is no data supplied, however, showing how this cost is arrived at or the height to which the water is to be elevated, and, in the absence of this, an approximate estimate has been made, which would appear to be reasonable, viz.: -\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Pump and well                             | $50.00 |\n| 600 feet of galvanized 1\u00bd\" wafer pipe     | $180.00|\n| Galvanized fittings                       | $50.00 |\n| Galvanized iron for tanks                 | $20.00 |\n| Excavating (partly rock)                  | $400.00|\n| Freight (estimated)                       | $200.00|\n\nTotal ........................................ $1,300.00\nAs an adequate supply of potable water is necessary for the successful carrying on of the school, as is also efficient fire protection, I would, therefore, recommend for your consideration the grant necessary for carrying the water to the school and that the erection of the tanks be made.\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, September 7th, 1918.\n\nDear Mr. Mackie,\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo and enclosed communication from Sister Laverty regarding the installation of a well and pump in the Holy Angels' Boarding School.

They have been hauling water from the lake, which in low water is quite a distance from them. This is not satisfactory, and would be disastrous in case of fire.\n\nThe Mission has found good water some 300 feet from the School; and if this is so, I think that either a wind mill or a gasoline engine should be installed. Two tanks will be needed, 750 gals. each, one for the general needs of the school, and one for fire protection. They can be installed for about $500. If the Mission furnishes the labor. Of course they will have to be placed high enough to give gravitation, and in some place where they will not freeze.\n\nIf a plant can be installed for $1500, it will be a very reasonable price, provided that for this price the Mission is able to secure something that will be satisfactory. As the Mission seem to think that they can provide and install the plant for this price, and as it is a very reasonable figure, I would recommend that it be allowed.

On the fifth of April during dinner time, our sister Mary, coming back from her visit to the sick, saw fire and thick smoke rising through the roof of the right wing near the chimney.\n\nThe church bell called for help and soon all the people in Chipewyan was at the scene. The fight against the terrible flames lasted nearly two hours before complete victory could be won. The firemen extinguishers have proved to be very efficacious, but we had not enough of them. Water was carried in tons with two sleighs from the lake (about 15 mile distance).\n\nWe expressed heartfelt thanks to the devoted workers who displayed heroic efforts in the circumstance.\n\nThe fire began near the chimney. The roof was bored in several places; the interior of the roof is completely burnt with all that was in the attic. Damage has been caused also by throwing the furniture through the window-panes from the gallery. Our school desks (old and new) tall tables were all broken; now roughly repaired, they have a poor appearance. It is an opportunity to try and have modern desks\u2014but oh... we cannot afford to make that expense.\nShould not the Department make us a gratification which would be in some time a present for our golden jubilee that we will celebrate in the spring 1847? For thirty years we have raised and taught the children of this country at our expense, and treated the sick in the same way.\n\nMay I hope to begin my twenty-fifth year teaching in Chipewayan with favorable duties?\n\nExpecting a favorable answer,\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nHonourably Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nM.

Dufault.\n\nP.S.\n\nIn my last Report, I have not given the note taken by the nurses to give an idea of her work.\n\nVisits 573\nTreatments 900\nDrugs given 1635\n\nFrom March 1922 to March 1923.\nOttawa, June 29, 1923.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, reporting the loss occasioned to the Holy Angels school building by fire which occurred on the 5th of April last. The loss of your mission is regretted, but we are pleased to learn that the fire was extinguished without the entire loss of the building. We hope that arrangements can be made to carry on the work until the damage to the building has been repaired.\n\nRegarding your request to equip the school with new desks, I beg to say that we would be favourably disposed to comply with your wishes. Before we could place an order, it will be necessary to give full particulars as to the sizes and the number of each size required to supply our schools with either the single or double type of desk, the former seating one pupil and the latter, two. I enclose a page from a catalogue which gives the ages of the pupils for which desks are manufactured. Please check this over and make out a list of the number of desks needed for the pupils between the ages mentioned, and furnish full shipping directions, that is, how you would advise having them forwarded from waterways. We will then consider the placing of an order for the number of desks required.\n\nPlease forward a sketch of the classroom, showing the number of rows of desks and the number in each row. A front and rear seat for each row should be ordered, and when the desks are set up they would present a better appearance in the room. We would suggest that single desks be supplied, as they are found to be the most satisfactory.\n\nWhen your reply is received, it may be too late to order the desks to go forward this season, but we would have the necessary information to purchase and forward them at the first opportunity next spring.\n\nWe have noted the number of visits made by the nurses, from March 1922 to March 1923.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Study it. The more you know about it, the better you will like it. See Next Page for Full Description.\n\nWESTERN SEATING COMPANY\n\nRepresentatives\n\nOffices at Winnipeg, Man.; Regina, Sask.; and Edmonton, Alta.\nDESCRIPTION OF HINGE\n\nRead This Carefully---It is Important\n\nNO Chain is stronger than its weakest link. Also the life of a school desk cannot be greater than the life of the hinge. In the development of the New Globe Automatic our energy was directed toward the elimination of faults in the Hinge.\n\nOUR SUCCESS IS COMPLETE\n\nWe sincerely believe that the Hinge in the New Automatic is the strongest Automatic Seat Hinge ever invented and comes nearer to being noiseless than any other now on the market.\n\nAbsolute noiselessness can only be secured by the use of rubber or leather buffers, or springs and when such parts are used it is only a question of time till they become worn or dislodged and must then be replaced or the desk is too noisy for further use.\n\nThose who have had experience in getting repairs for school desks know how difficult and unsatisfactory it is, and, therefore, the desk that will wear the longest without needing repairs is the most valuable one to the school.\n\nThere are fewer parts in the Hinge of the New Globe than are found in any other School Desk Hinge on the market. This alone reduces the possibility of its getting out of order.\n\nIt does not depend on bumpers or rubber, leather or other material, nor on springs of any kind for its noiseless action.\n\nThe steel balls used in the Hinge are one-half inch in diameter, being twice as large as those used by any other manufacturer, thus giving greater wear resisting qualities.\n\nThe balls in the Hinge of the New Globe ARE NOT held in position by means of springs, because when such is the case the spring will in time lose its tension allowing the balls to get out of their proper position, or draw out entirely.\n\nIn the Hinge of the New Globe the steel balls absorb all friction, there being no wearing contact of iron against iron. In every other so-called Ball Bearing Desk there is a wearing contact of iron against iron.\n\nThe accompanying diagram, Fig. 1, will give you a clear accurate understanding of the great simplicity of the Hinge, and you will note that \"A\" is the Seat Arm; \"B\" shows a portion of the Desk Top or Casting. When the seat is raised the Ball \"P\" fits into the socket \"Q.\" The Shoulder \"R\" on \"A\" moves in Groove \"S\" on \"B\" when the seat is raised or lowered. Ball \"O\" rests in the Seat \"R\" and acts as a stop for the seating \"B\" at \"S\" between \"J\" and \"K.\" The Casting grows gradually thicker as it nears the point \"K\" so that the Ball rolls less easily as it reaches the end of its course. This brings the seat to a gradual stop without jar or noise. When the seat is lowered the ball rolls towards \"J\" where the casting is also thicker. The seat comes to a gradual stop in the same way and for the same reason as when it is raised.\n\nThe office of the Bolt \"T\" and the Cap \"Q\" is merely to hold the parts together. The bolt passes through the Seat Arm and the Slot \"G\" cuts through Casting \"B\" and \"H.\" The notch \"E\" Casting \"I\" is placed over the Lug \"C\" on \"B\" to prevent \"D\"s\" turning with the Seat Arm.\n\nThe Lugs \"L,\" \"M,\" and \"N\" prevent the Seat from raising or lowering beyond the proper position and also carry a part of the weight of the pupil, thus relieving the working parts of some of the strain.\nRegina, Sask., August 13th, 1925\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn answer to your esteemed favour of the 8th inst., beg to advise that we can supply at the following prices the desks for the Holy Angels Boarding School, Fort Chipewyan, Alta., to wit:\n\n- 8 #3, Single Automatic Desks $9.00 each\n- 10 4\", \" \" \" \" 9.25 \"\n- 2 5\", \" \" \" \" 9.25 \"\n- 4 6\", \" \" \" \" 7.85 \"\n- 4 3\", \" \" \" \" 7.85 \"\n\n1 101 Teacher's Desk, golden ash, 31.25 \"\n1 1562 \" Chair \" elm, 8.15 \"\n\nThese prices are to be understood for the furniture K.D., F.O.R.

This boarding school has at present eighty-two (82) children, of which about one-half are orphans in our charge. It is about the water.\n\nWe get our supply of water from the Athabasca Lake. This water is of a very poor quality especially in the spring and fall. To obviate this inconvenience, instead of affairs we would like to dig a well on the edge of the lake. It is in front of our school and about three hundred (300') feet from the building. About twenty (20') feet deep there is excellent water. We have seen the facts before and what we would need about twenty (20) barrels of Portland Cement; One (1) Anti-Freeze Pump and a small Motor of three and one-half (3\u00bd) H.P., and about fifty (50') feet of pipe. The full installation should not cost over five hundred ($500.00) dollars.\n\nThis is what I take the liberty of asking you to give us for the sanitary benefit of our children. However, small may be the expenditure we are unable to meet such expenses.\n\nHoping that you will be kind enough to consider our demand, I remain with sincere thanks\n\nYours, etc.,\n\nC.

Mr. Chene reports that His Lordship's scheme would cost approximately $550 and that it ought to give satisfactory results.\n\nI should be pleased to have your instructions.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, November 3, 1924.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, relative to the water supply at the Holy Angels' Indian Residential School. I have noted that it is extremely desirable that a well be provided and the water pumped to the school building.\n\nI am pleased to authorize you to purchase, after securing competitive prices, 20 barrels of cement, one anti-freeze pump, a small motor and 50 ft. of pipe. The Deputy Superintendent General has directed that a grant of $550 be made to Your Lordship in this connection. When you are sending to the Department the voucher in duplicate in favour of the firm given the business you or the principal of the school should certify to it and it should be supported by a statement showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted. The school management will have to be responsible for the labour and the installation - the Department's grant of $550 to be for materials only.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Sister Dufault, Principal of the Holy Angels Indian Residential School, Fort Chipewyan, to be supplied with the various articles as mentioned in your letter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we have no funds available to furnish the two wooden motor washing machines asked for.\n\nRelative to the 40 desks, I beg to say that in 1923 desks were supplied this school sufficient to accommodate 36 pupils. As a per capita grant is allowed for only 40 pupils, the Department is not prepared to supply any further desks at the present time. We are also not prepared to supply a typewriter.\n\nA supply of playground equipment, consisting of footballs, volley ball outfits and soft balls and bats, has been ordered and will be sent.\n\nWe are communicating with Rev. Father Fahler and requesting him to advise us where the 12 beds for the use of the Sisters and the sewing machine are to be forwarded. We are also requesting him to obtain prices in Edmonton for a refrigerator, and when we receive a reply from him, consideration will then be given to ordering the beds, sewing machine and refrigerator.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I shall be pleased if you will advise the Department as soon as possible whether you could recommend that the beds and sewing machine be forwarded to Montreal in order that they can go forward with the supplies which you are ordering in Montreal for your schools and missions, or whether you would advise that these supplies be obtained in Edmonton and forwarded from there when navigation opens in the spring.\n\nI have also to request that you will obtain prices in Edmonton for the supplying of a refrigerator, approximately 5'3\" in height, 5' wide and 1'9\" deep. The prices which you obtain for the supplying of this refrigerator should be submitted for the consideration of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Having proposed this to the Department, I received a favorable answer by the second letter dated Nov. 3rd.\n\nI suppose you are now aware that we have passed under the jurisdiction of His Lordship Bishop Bregan.

Music has become a recognized necessity in the modern educational system and of course the piano is the first facility in demand.\n\nBut this piano has presented a problem to the teacher, particularly the teacher of very young children. How can she play the piano and at the same time give her class the proper attention to keep order and instruct them in the details for songs and exercises?\n\nChristie's School Piano is the answer to that question. Just three feet seven inches in height, and weighing but four hundred pounds, it can be easily moved to any desired position in the class room where the teacher can sit facing the class while she plays. In this manner her music can be played and her class properly instructed at the same time. No straining or stretching is required\u2014the teacher can clearly see over the top of the piano.\n\nSeven and one third octaves\u2014Full iron plate\u2014Kent standard size\u2014Overstrung scale\u2014Responsive action\u2014Strings, three to each treble note\u2014Rock maple pin plank.

She even gave piano lessons on it. We never complained, for she is so kind-hearted she would have suffered at the thought, but, more the less do we need a piano.\n\nI will not ask her to sign this request; it would try her poorly and she could be tempted to give us back our organ which, I know, she uses three hours every day and often times more than that.\n\nOf course, we would need a small piano; one of Christie's for instance.\n\nMrs. who said: \"What you do to the poor, you do to me,\" will surely say yes to\nthe hundred gold what you so kindly do to our\nyour little ones.\nBegging him to give you all kinds of\nprosperity I remain:\nGratefully yours,\nMiss M.-L. Champoux\nteacher\nSour St Omer Superior\n\nTo the Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI most say that the Holy Angels Boarding\nSchool, is in much need of a piano, as\na few of the girls are taking music lessons\nand would prefer to have music lessons\nso I am in favour of the Boarding School\ngetting a Piano from your Department.\n\nSincerely yours,\nJohn Taylor\nP.S.

Please certify on each copy of the accounts as follows: \"Goods received. Prices charged fair and just\", sign and forward same to the Department. Due consideration will be given to payment. You will, no doubt, require that payment be made direct to the merchant from whom these purchases are made. These accounts should reach the Department by the 20th of March, next, at the latest, in order that, if payment is made, the funds can be taken from our Appropriation for the present fiscal year.\n\nRegarding an advance on the per capita grants, I have to say that at the present time the Department is unable to state whether same can be made before the first of April, next, or not. If we have sufficient funds remaining for the purpose in our present Appropriation an advance on the grants could be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nReverend J. C.

The School is situated just at the South end of the village, bordering on the river. This institution was built something like 70 years ago, according to information I received. The original building was of logs but I presume it has been sheeted inside and out several times, and although it is very old it is still in a good state of repair. The ceilings, of course, are not up to standard heights, and the halls are narrow, but the building has a lot of windows, and when the thermometer gets down between 60\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 below zero in the winter time, it is not very difficult to get an abundance of fresh air into the building. I went over the school and looked over the equipment, and everything was in good order. The children had good beds to sleep in; home-made, but\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nall has good feather ticks as mattresses and lots of bedding. You will realize that where there is an abundance of geese and ducks it is not difficult to get lots of feathers for ticks.\n\nThere are two classrooms in the building. One classroom was supplied with the regular school seats, old type, but the other one had home-made tables and benches.\n\nI also looked over the fire-hazard at the school, and I am sure we all realize that in an old frame building of that nature there is always danger of fire. However I think all precautions are being taken that possibly can be to eliminate risk. There is, of course a set of stairs inside the building. Then there are two sets of stairs down to the ground on the outside of the building, one at each end. There are also several fire extinguishers in the building; but in case of fire the main thing would be to get the children all out of the school and not stop to use fire extinguishers. I might mention that the building is not very high and if there was a fire, especially in the winter time, it would not hurt the children to jump out through the windows. I also noticed that axes were kept handy in case of the necessity of breaking windows or doors. Two sisters sleep in each dormitory.\n\nThe building is heated by two hot-air furnaces situated on the main floor. There is no modern convenience in this institution of any kind and water is hauled by team from the lake and dumped into the cistern. The school\nauthorities were just completing the erection of an ice house and refrigeration plant to enable them to keep their food supplies during the summer months, which I am sure is quite a problem in an out-of-the-way place like Fort Chipewyan.\n\nThere is a new hip-roof barn at the school which houses the cattle and horses. There are also several storehouses and outbuildings and a separate building for all the male members of the staff. As the buildings do not belong to the Department I presume this is sufficient report in connection with the same.\n\nLIVE STOCK:\n\nThe school keeps a few head of cattle under great difficulties. Last fall they had to get rid of several animals on account of the scarcity of feed. The Principal informed me that they were hauling hay 50 miles. They had 9 cows, 4 horses and about 100 chickens.\n\nA small farm is operated by the school but the crop is cut for feed. Last fall they harvested 750 sacks of potatoes and an abundance of other garden truck.\n\nIt might be interesting to the Department to know that in 1892 some wheat raised by the school authorities there received 1st prize at the World's Fair in Chicago. They have no trouble in raising gardens up in that part of the country if they can find the soil. Around Fort Chipewyan this is\ndifficult as the land around there is principally composed of rock.\n\nAt the time of my visit there were 79 children in residence at the school: 39 Treaty and 40 non-Treaty. As we approached the school Doctor Lewis made the following remarks: \"Mr. Christianson, I know you have seen Indian children in residential schools all over the country, but I am sure you have never seen a healthier lot than we have in this institution;\" and after I had seen them I quite agreed with the doctor's statement: There was no illness of any kind in the school, nor did I notice a sickly looking child amongst them; and they are evidently well fed and cared for in every way. In conversation with the Sister Superior I learned that the children always receive a meal of fish per day. This winter they have been able to get an abundance of cariboo meat and in every way the children more or less live as in their natural environment, receiving pretty much the same food as they do in their own homes, but a little better. I was in the dining room when the children were eating and they seemed to be getting all the food they required, which is born out by the appearance of the children. I saw the children at one time or another practically every day, as I often passed the school, and called in there, &c., and they were all well clad.\n\nThe training carried on there is more\nor less along the requirements of the North:\nThe girls learn to make moccasins, to do\nsilk work on leather, to knit and make their\nown clothes, &c. They are also taught cook-\ning and learn how to make bread and bannock,\nand in every way they are taught things that\nwill be useful to them when they leave the\nschool. The main thing is not to keep any of\nthe children in school too long, as the boys\nhave no avocation to go to when they are dis-\ncharged other than that of their fathers and\nforefathers, viz., to make a living off the\nland by hunting, trapping and fishing.\n\nThe classroom work at the school\nseemed to be very satisfactory, and I found\nthat some of the children had gone as high\nas Grade VI. Both teachers were quite effici-\nent in their work; and I was surprised to\nmeet Sister Robinette, who was at one time\nthe senior girls' teacher at Lebret, and an\nexcellent teacher, having had years of ex-\nperience.\n\nThe staff of the school consists of\nthe following: 12 Sisters of Charity belong-\ning to the order of Grey Nuns of Montreal;\nFive priests at the mission and three brothers,\nas well as 5 other male employees. During the\nlast 3 or 4 years, or since Doctor Lewis came\nto Fort Chipewyan, there have been many changes\nin the personnel of the school. The Rev. Sis-\nter McQuillan is the Superior. She is an Irish\nSister and Doctor Lewis informed me that she\nwas very efficient. Rev. Father Caudier is\nPrincipal of the school, and he has occupied this position for approximately two years. I considered him a very capable Principal and the Agent informed me that he was of the same opinion. Father Caudier left for the East while I was at Fort Chipewyan, and he will probably call on the Department when he is in Ottawa.\n\nDuring my stay up there the School put on a concert in my honour and invited most of the settlers from the village to it, and it was enjoyed by all present. I must say they made a very creditable showing.\n\nIn conclusion I would say that in my opinion Holly Angels School is carrying on splendid work in spite of great handicaps.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to our conversation re Holy Angels' School at Fort Chipewyan, I humbly wish to draw your attention on the urgent need of rebuilding this school, a need which you had the opportunity of acknowledging during your visit last year. Unfortunately we are actually compelled to suspend the work through lack of funds to purchase the necessary material. We have in view a fire-proof building. Before proceeding any further we would like to be sure that the Department is willing to cooperate as soon as circumstances permit.\n\nAs stated previously in our conversation, a promise by the Government of a grant of $30,000 in next year's estimates would be quite satisfactory. We can guarantee the balance required for the rebuilding of the school.\n\nWith the hope that our request will meet a favourable reply,\n\nI remain\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nJune 9, 1936.\n\nDear Bishop Breynat:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, relative to the need of rebuilding the Holy Angels School at Fort Chipewyan and requesting that the Department provide, in its Appropriation for the next fiscal year, a grant to the amount of $30,000.00 towards the cost.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, when our Estimates are in course of preparation, consideration will be given to your request. I am, however, unable to state at the present time whether it will be possible to obtain an appropriation to assist towards the cost in erecting a new building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Rev. G. Breynat, O.M.I., D.D.,\nVicar Apostolic of Mackenzie,\nFort Smith, N.W.T.\nOttawa, July 31st, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the voucher which you submitted in connection with the cost of lumber and building material purchased for the construction of a laundry at the Holy Angels Indian Residential School.\n\nThe following accounts are attached to your voucher:\n\n(1) An account for $236.83 from the Hayward Lumber Company.\n\n(2) Account from Dupuis Freres for $111.00.\n\n(3) Account from Ashdown Hardware Company for $75.00.\n\nYour voucher requests that the cheque be issued in favour of the Holy Angels Indian Residential School but I would point out that none of the accounts you submitted have been receipted. If you obtain receipts from these three companies and attach these receipts to the voucher with the accounts, payment can then be made to the Principal of the Holy Angels School. If, however, the accounts have not yet been paid, it will be necessary for you to prepare and forward three vouchers, in triplicate. The first voucher should request payment of $236.83, in favour of the Hayward Lumber Company and their account should be attached to the voucher. Vouchers prepared in a similar manner should be forwarded for the Ashdown Hardware Company and Dupuis Freres.\n\nNo special provision has been made in our appropriation for the current fiscal year for any expenditure at the Holy Angel Residential School and, under these circumstances, I am not prepared to state whether or not we can pay the above accounts but they will receive further consideration when submitted in a proper manner.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

On the other hand, owing to my remoteness from civilization during the whole summer, I fail your letters lately, and it took a little time before having all invoices received, as we pay usually each firm at every two or three months without having each and every invoice received.\n\nConsequently, you will please find enclosed herewith vouchers in triplicate signed and certified in behalf of His Excellency the Right Revd. Bishop G. Freynat, also receipted invoices in favour of the four R.C. Indian Residential Schools located in his diocese, namely Ft-Chipewyan, Ft-Resolution, Ft-Providence and Aklavit.\n\nAlthough you stated that provisions have been made up-to $300.00 only for the equipment of these schools during the current year, we would greatly appreciate receiving whatever amount exceeding this sum, if the Dept. of Indian Affairs could graciously allow it. In fact, vouchers enclosed represent a small portion of what has been spent during the current year in connection with the equipment of these four schools.\n\nPlease make the cheques in favor of the R.C.

Only the sum of $300.00 was provided for equipment at each of the schools, and I would point out that, during the present year, accounts have already been paid as follows:\n\nDesks supplied Aklavik - $135.55\nFort Resolution - $294.15\n\nIn addition, the sum of $3,500 was paid in supplying and installing a lighting plant.\n\nI would point out that you forwarded only one copy of the account from the firm from which purchase of the equipment was made.

Schools located in the Mackenzie Diocese. Should it happen that in the future the vouchers would have not reached your office, I would gladly furnish you with any assistance you may require and see to it that our schools do not delay in sending same.\n\nWhen checking lately all payments received from the Department for night watchman at the I.R. School of Fort-Providence, N.W.T., I found that up to the present time, no payment has been received through our Bank for the abovesaid night watchman since the beginning of the present year, that is last October 1937. So, I was wondering whether you have received no reports for that school, or whether the cheques have been mailed directly to the Principal at Fort-Providence. Your answer regarding this matter will be greatly appreciated.\n\nAs regards to the payment for night watchman at the Holy Angels' school of Fort-Chipewyan, I found cheques 648982-64205-69950-, being respectively for the months of October, December & January, February. According to our records, I do not find any payment made for the month of November, unless this payment has been made directly to the school. Will you please let me know whether this month has been paid or not.\n\nPayments for the other I.R. Schools, viz., Resolution and Aklavik have been all received.\n\nThanking you for past favors,\nI am,\nYours respectfully,\n\nFather J. Serrurrot, O.M.I.,\nBursar, R.C. Missions of Mackenzie.\nOttawa,\nApril 4, 1938.\n\nDear Father Serrurot:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 31st ultimo I find that Cheque 50723 for $40.00 was issued on December 20, 1937, in payment of the allowance for the night watchman at the Holy Angels Residential School for the month of November, 1937. This cheque was issued in favour of the Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of MacKenzie and was forwarded to Banque Canadienne Nationale, Edmonton. It was deposited in that bank on December 24, 1937.\n\nOn reviewing our files I find that no request has been received for the payment of the allowances for the night watchman at the Providence Mission School since October 1, 1937. I will arrange to forward cheque for this amount. This is an instance of the matter about which I wrote to you; namely, that when it is left to the Principals to request payment of this amount some of them do so and some of them neglect to do so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAlong with all our other demands upon our finances comes the water supply in Fort Chipewyan. The water is very low and hence it requires a long pipe to reach the water fit for drinking. The doctor has issued a request that we extend our pipe for the pumping of water from 1500 to 2000 feet so as to avoid the danger of pumping stagnant water and jeopardizing the health of the children. This accommodation will cost an extra $400, about.\n\nMay I kindly ask you to consider this and obtain a grant for this expenditure.\n\nWith thanks and kind wishes,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBishop of Adramyte,\nVicar Apostolic of MacKenzie.\nOttawa,\nApril 22, 1938.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant requesting pipe for the Holy Angels (Fort Chipewyan) Indian Residential School.\n\nAll purchases are now made by our Purchasing Agent and it is, therefore, necessary for us to have specific information regarding what is required. I would, therefore, appreciate if you would let me have full particulars regarding the 2000 feet of pipe which will be required at the Holy Angels school. You should state whether you require tile or iron pipe, also its diameter and the length of each section of the pipe. As soon as this information is obtained I will arrange to have our purchasing agent secure it. I note from your letter that you estimate the cost at $400.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

McGill:\n\nYour letter of the above date to hand and carefully studied.\n\nThe situation in this Agency regarding the control of Tuberculosis is very poor.\n\nThe only residential school in this Agency is at Fort Chipewyan and it also takes in day school pupils of half-breed and white families.\n\nThe school is an old antiquated building with no facilities for carrying out segregation of tubercular pupils and it has been my custom to discharge any active cases that may arise. Any cases that I consider not active but need extra attention I attempt to put on hospital routine with special food.\n\nI do not think a great deal can be done towards the control of Tuberculosis until we have a more modern residential school and a hospital located at this point.\n\n(Sgd.)

Head, M.D.\nMedical Superintendent.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_sask_test/c-8710.pdf",
