But the missionary could not read, and so the cure was lost. After many failures, he heard of a man named James Weidman, who had been educated by the missionary. James Weidman, however, had never seen the recipe written down. He knew it by heart, but could not read it. So he asked the missionary to write it out for him. The missionary did so, and then James Weidman went home and wrote it out again. It was then discovered that the recipe was the same as the one that had been lost. This discovery led to the discovery of the cure for consumption.\n\nIf U want a Sewing Machine, Organ or Piano, consult\n\nJAMES WEIDMAN,\nAgent.\n\nNOTICE.\n\nNOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN THAT AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE NORTH WEST CENTRAL RAILWAY FROM WINNIPEG TO RED RIVER IN THE PARLIAMENT OF CANADA, FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE NORTH WEST CENTRAL RAILWAY COMPANY, LTD., AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES, WAS READ THE FIRST TIME IN BOTH HOUSES OF THE PARLIAMENT ON AUGUST 25, 1884, AND WAS READ THE SECOND TIME ON SEPTEMBER 19, 1884, AND WAS READ THE THIRD TIME ON OCTOBER 6, 1884, AND WAS PASSED INTO LAW ON OCTOBER 7, 1884.\n\nJ.
