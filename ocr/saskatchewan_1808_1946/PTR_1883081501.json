[{"id": "00638a2dcc776d9d5483b04ee4ddcb89152f5772", "text": "INCORPORATION.\n\nSince our last issue this question has assumed a new phase. Instead of calling a public meeting at which the views of the people could have been heard, a few prominent citizens drafted and signed a large number of signatures to a petition to the North West Colonial government for incorporation and defining the eastern limits of the town as between the Hudson Bay Company's town site and Mr. John Macdonald's property. The residents of the east end requested to be included in the proposed town limits, but their privilege being denied them they have sent another petition requesting that, if the town be incorporated, their property shall be included. This will mean the incorporation of both petitions and the drafting of a General Municipal Ordinance, under which we will have to apply for incorporation.\n\nOBITUARY.\n\nThe death is announced of Hon. Wm Elder, Provincial Secretary of New Brunswick. Mr. Elder, who was a member of the Protestant ministry, in which he labored for several years, was a brilliant scholar, having studied at Edinburgh, Dublin and Glasgow Universities. He mourned his death most profoundly; however, and may be said to have been the George Brown of New Brunswick. For many years he has been the editor and proprietor of the St. John Telegraph, the oldest Liberal newspaper in the Province, and was acknowledged to be one of the most finished writers and speakers in Canada. A few months ago he became the Provincial Secretary of the Blair administration, and the success of which he contributed much. His death will be a serious loss to the Liberal party and press of New Brunswick.\n\nWHO MAKES OUR LAWS?\n\nWe endorse the statement of the Toronto Telegram when it says: \"The English press is once more discussing the giddy young Marquis of Randolph. The last time it discussed him was in connection with a scandal in which the young man was involved, but not a contemptible part. This time it is in connection with his election to the dukedom of Marlborough. He is reported to be one of the most immoral respectable persons in English society, which, to say the least, can hardly be said to be flattering. The fact that by the most accidental birth he has been placed beyond the reach of bodily harm, enables him to rank the duke and also to a seat in the House of Lords, where he will make laws for the benefit of more respectable members. This is one of the beauties of the English system of primogeniture, by which the eldest son or next of kin steps into a vacant chair in the Lords, no matter though he be the biggest rascal in the three kingdoms. What chance would such a man have of being made a peer of those who sit in the House of Lords were chosen by the people whom they are supposed to represent?\"\n\nTHE LONDON HORROR.\n\nA little more than two years ago London was dismayed by the disastrous results of a calamity which at that time visited the city, and once more the hand of the destroyer has been laid upon her. The inhabitants of London were treated to a Friday evening of the 14th July, and the morning they were called upon to wage a desperate struggle with the elements, the horrors of which will remain fresh in the memories of those who participated in the battle against the forces of nature. The loss of life is put down at about twenty. Under the circumstances it is surprising that it was not greater. It is impossible as yet to estimate the loss to property. In the words of the London Evening News, \"a population of upwards of 2,000 persons have been well nigh bereft and at least a score of lives have been lost. About a score of houses have been destroyed and perhaps three or four times that number wrecked by being floated away from their foundations and stranded on the streets or upon the banks of the river.\" It will be many days before the inhabitants of the flooded valley recover from the disastrous effects of the late calamity. Much hard work will have to be done before the victims of this disaster have been rendered completely destitute. So far the burden of assisting the victims has been left to the City of London, whose inhabitants have been very generous. Much will still require to be done, however, and some general scheme should be adopted. There is not a town or village in the Province Ontario but would contribute substantially to a general relief fund.\n\nTHE MERCER HEAT CASE.\n\nThe Mercer case has been before the courts for the last twelve years and has been the subject of a political storm as well as the center of a great party division. The action of the Ontario Government has, however, been sustained by the highest legal authority in the country. The point at issue out of the case of the late Andrew Mercer, a wealthy citizen of Toronto who died intestate in 1871. Every effort was made to lay claim to the property without any title. The real estate held by Mr. Mercer was eventually transferred to the Crown, who was claimed to be represented in Ontario by the late Mr. Justice Gordon. In the meantime, however, Mr. Andrew Mercer, an illegitimate son of the deceased, had taken possession of the property and disputed the title of the Crown. The case was finally decided by the Court of Chancery. The Vice-Chancellor overruled the demurrer. His decision was applauded, one of the pleas being that Mr. Mercer had been without heirs and the estate consequently having escheated to the Crown should revert to the Dominion which alone represented the Crown. This decision was rejected by the Ontario Court of Appeal. The decision of the Ontario Court was appealed and reversed by the Supreme Court. The Ontario government has determined to appeal to the case to the Privy Council which will give a decision in their favor. Apart altogether from party lines the decision will assist in settling the powers of the Provincial Governments.\n\nCROP PROSPECTS.\n\nFrom all parts of the District we are in receipt of the most encouraging reports of the crops. Hay is abundant, but very few of our farmers have as yet commenced to cut. Very favorable weather the cut deserves to be delayed. Of the grain and root crops it may be too early to speak, but as some of the grain is beginning to ripen, we are in hopes that any danger from frost is now over. We have seen some oats eight weeks old, which are full headed and almost ripe already to harvest. Altogether the initial signs are that we may average yield of from thirty to forty bushels per acre. The wheat is naturally abundant over the prospects and they certainly are to be congratulated. From other parts of Canada we have been encouraged reports. Apparently the season has been unusually dry and later reports tell of rather severe frosts. In Manitoba the yield is not likely to average unusually large while Ontario reports generally indicate a good growing crop in general, corn and fall wheat a failure, roots fair but fruits a failure. Reports from private sources are even more discouraging. Some have been grown in place seed which had been sown rotting instead of sprouting owing to the excessively wet season; in others some crops were so poor that they were plowed under. In others land that was prepared was never sown at all. We only want settlers and means to work our lands to make this one of the best growing sections in the Dominion. The farms which have import crops in many localities have passed us by. The small amount of low lying land, the broken nature of our prairie and our sheltered location all tend to keep us safe from either cold winds or fogs.\n\nOUR SCHOOLS.\n\nThe opening of the new school on Monday last reminds us that we long for a larger building for our High School. Prince Albert was the first place in the North West Territories for which a school was erected and owing to this and to the otherwise excellent condition of our school it has been able to maintain its high position. Parents and others in the district owe much to the liberality of the Rev. Mr. Macdonald and the Canadian Presbyterian Church for their assistance in establishing and maintaining it, but owing to the increase in the population this assistance has been withdrawn and we have been left to shoulder the entire expense ourselves. The next question of paying the salaries of teachers and other contingent expenses has been eagerly met by the public, but in view of our school census the accommodation is only of a temporary character and unless additional seats have to be provided, in order the Mission one is now unfit for use. The plan of expanding a new school building is now being considered and it will become a more serious burden than the erection of a new school building. Possibly by the end of the year there will be a surplus for the past year amounted to over fifty dollars and an expenditure of not less than $500 will be required in order to fit it up for use during the incoming winter. The time will soon come when it will be necessary to provide for matriculation in Manitoba or Saskatchewan Universities. The question of the location of the school is one of the greatest interests of the different parts of the town will soon be such as to make the school a vital importance. Will not our men and women be the makers of a more commendable school system.\n\nMAMMOTH STOCK OF FRESH GOODS\n\nJust received by steamers Northcote and Manitoba\n\nWe have decided to sell at special prices for the next two months.\n\nCall and get the best value for cash ever offered in Prince Albert.\n\nDry Goods\nGroceries\nProvisions\nCrockery\nHardware\nBoots and Shoes\nWooden Ware\nFancy Goods\nClothing\n20lbs Mess Pork\nBacon and Ham\nCanned Fruits\nMaple Sugar\nBiscuits\nCigars and Fancy Pipes\nBaskets etc., etc.\n\nNOTICE.\n\nIn making your customary purchases for the coming winter, please take care to see that the goods purchased are of good quality.

Then Willie came to another speech in his history.\n\n\"Ma, who was Julius Caesar?\"\n\n\"An old soldier man who lived with Julius Caesar,\" said Mrs. Jones.\n\n\"What did he say about him there?\"\n\n\"It says his wife's name was Cleopatra.\"\n\n\"The very same. Old Cleo used to wash for us. It's strange how they come to be in such beds.\"\n\n\"Honey, honey (she murmured), Jones, so young, while Willie looked at his ma with wonder and admiration that one day he could carry all she knew. Presently he found his mother had to ask,\n\n\"Who, who, who was Julius Caesar?\"\n\nWhip, which was one of the pupils of his history and Mrs. Jones, trying to thread the point of her needle.\n\n\"But what made him famous?\" persisted Willie.\n\n\"Everything,\" answered Mrs. Jones, emphatically.\n\n\"Everything,\" echoed Willie. \"That's right, Miss Jane. Which is how people would take its oats. He dressed in a sleek and pillar-case uniform, and when his ears were surrounded him he shouted, 'Give me liberty or give me death,' and ran away.\"\n\n\"Bully for Julius!\" answered Mrs. Jones, enthusiastically.\n\n\"That's right, Miss Jane. Which is how people would take its oats. He dressed in a sleek and pillar-case uniform, and when his ears were surrounded him he shouted, 'Give me liberty or give me death,' and ran away.\"\n\n\"CARROT RIVER.\n\nThe present population of Carrot River is about 125. It would have been far easier to settle a town of that size, had it not been for the surveys which have been ordered by the government in the survey of the surrounding townships. They have been ordered because the surveys which have been ordered do not cover the whole area. As there are no even roads, no bridges, no fences, no houses, and only isolated farms, a large number who intended to have settled permanently in the town are now looking for some other spot in which to settle. However, the main purpose of our Ottawa rulers is to make sure that the town is not deserted by any monopolists who obtained their votes. Very patriotic, is it not? The town will be able to send representatives into the legislature in the near future.\n\nTHOMAS O. DAVIS.\n\nT. N.
