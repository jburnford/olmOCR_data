Some of these contain secession and rebellion, independence or annexation; but these expressions doubtless have been hastily used in the heat of the discussion of an exciting subject. One thing is certain, that public opinion is aroused to the highest pitch, and is unanimous on the part of both Conservatives and Reformers, in the determination to resist the Provincial effort to restrict and maintain the independence of the local Legislatures.\n\nWhat intensifies the feeling just now is the fact that the Legislature has been dissolved and generally elections probably event now going on. The leaders of neither political party venture to justify the recent action of the Dominion Government, but the address of the Hon. Premier, Mr. Norquay is not so unanswerable on this point as it might be. The last straw was the disallowance of the Emerson and North Western Railway Charter. This has raised the popular feeling to fever heat, and at an indignation meeting held in Emerson lately, some pretty strong language was used and a delegation was appointed to go to Winnipeg to remonstrate against the action of the Government. Mr. Norquay, it appears in his speech at that place, some time ago, pledged himself to resist, that is, to get a bill introduced at Ottawa to prevent that the people of Prince Albert and the North West generally insist upon their right to a weekly mail, and allow no other once. They will put off on one pretext or another long enough, and they will not stand it any longer. It is a crying shame that whilst other parts of the Dominion have their railroads, telegraph, post offices, etc., the North West Territories should be left without a mail once in three weeks. It is not dealing fairly or justly with this important question of the people of the North West. If the Government expect to retain the support and confidence of the people of those Territories, they must honorably fulfill their obligations and promises both in regard to this matter and also in regard to those other grievances which we particularly specified in our last issue. It is not fair to the present contractor either, nor can it be expected that he will be efficient when faced with the accumulation of three weeks mail matter to forward. This last mail was three days behind hand and we believe it will be before long that the \"fans\" cannot be satisfied in the way they propose to do it. Any pretension of farmers making, and at best but bad pretence, will only make matters worse.\n\nWe have already said that time and again, the people have yet made display of rebellion, and no disposition toward either independence or annexation has been shown. We have heard and seen nothing here and there may have dropped a hasty word in these directions, but the hearts of the people is sound and true to our present Dominion relationship. But if anything can shake our feelings and awaken the spirit, it is the thought that the rights and privileges which we are being deprived of are being adopted in quartered quarters. We stand on our own feet. That is all. We rely on the kindness to investigate the true state of the case, possibly they would come to see that the best mode of quitting the \"fans\" would be to repair that wrong.\n\nTHE MAIL SERVICE.\n\nWe were much disappointed that no word was received by the last mail as to the immediate prospect of a weekly mail between Prince Albert and Qu'Appelle which we were led to believe had been accomplished. As the first issue of our paper we published a letter from Mr. J. T. Taylor, Capt., and Hon. D. M. Hambly of Manitoba, who had interested themselves in the matter, stating that we could depend upon getting a weekly mail shortly, and that the contract for future years was in the hands of the Minister, who had informed him that a contract had been entered into at a yearly cost of over $3,000. Nothing could be more desirable than this, and we could not lose imagination as to what it was. We understand that a letter was received by the Postmaster here, from the mail contractor at Qu'Appelle, stating that he had heard nothing of the promised mail, and that he did not believe that it was going to take place, at all events for some time to come. Now it is just as well for the Government and Post Office authorities at Ottawa to remember that the people of Prince Albert and the North West generally insist upon their right to a weekly mail, and allow no other once. They will put off on one pretext or another long enough, and they will not stand it any longer. It is a crying shame that whilst other parts of the Dominion have their railroads, telegraph, post offices, etc., the North West Territories should be left without a mail once in three weeks. It is not dealing fairly or justly with this important question of the people of the North West. If the Government expect to retain the support and confidence of the people of those Territories, they must honorably fulfill their obligations and promises both in regard to this matter and also in regard to those other grievances which we particularly specified in our last issue. It is not fair to the present contractor either, nor can it be expected that he will be efficient when faced with the accumulation of three weeks mail matter to forward. This last mail was three days behind hand and we believe it will be before long that the \"fans\" cannot be satisfied in the way they propose to do it.

The crops are turning out very well.\n\nAt a meeting of Kinmonth Lodge, U.D., A.F.A.M., G.R.M., held in the Masonic Hall, Prince Albert, Nov. 1, 1882, the following officers were elected:\nW.M.: Rev. Thomas J. Agnew, S.W.: Hon. Henry Benson, S.W.: Mr. H. H. Charlesworth, Tho. E. Baker, Treasurer; Rev. J. F. Kennedy, Secretary; Rev. Wm. Brewer, Tyler.\n\nLowest Prices.\n\nJ. R. McPhail, STEWART & WOOTTON\nCLAIM JUMPING.\n\nThe regulations which require a man to be away from his homestead more than six months without leave of absence from the Minister of the Interior, has given rise to a great deal of claim jumping in this neighborhood of late. Some hardship may arise from the regulations in some cases, yet there is no law in the country itself. It is scarcely fair that a man should go out and find work which he never intends to improve. If he wants land he should by all means apply for it under the regulations. Yet the claim jumper is very often no better than the claim taker. If a claim may be taken for speculative purposes, why not also for the purpose of raising crops? We would suggest that the regulations be so amended that the party who cannot prove his residence should be cancelled, as evidence of good faith, be allowed no leave of absence, but be compelled to remain upon his homestead from the date of entry.\n\nTHE CASE.\n\nRemandment for the Attempted Murder of a Child.\n\nHillsboro, Oct. 15.\u2014Mr. Justice McDonald delivered sentence today in the case of Daniel Doyle, convicted of attempting to murder a child under twelve years of age. The prisoner was remanded until the 26th inst., when he will be sentenced. The judge called on the prisoner to stand up and he briefly addressed him to the effect that the crime was not worth the life of the victim, and had found him guilty. One was revolving in his mind that the prisoner had not only been found guilty, but had been found by the jury he entirely concurred. It was now his duty to punish him accordingly. He had no creditable information that the prisoner's whole life had been that of an incorrigible man on whom public trial, for his crimes, had been brought to an end. As he seemed callous to the voice of shame, and as the crime of which he had been convicted was of the most serious nature, he (the judge) would try if his feelings could be reached in another way, and apply a check to the prisoner's way. He then sentenced the prisoner to be imprisoned for the period of one year, with hard labor, and receive twenty lashes on the bare back.\n\nTHE CANADIAN NORTH WEST.\n\nAt Ottawa, October 13th, 1882, an order in Council was issued dividing the great North West Territory, beyond the confines of Manitoba, into four new districts, each to have its own separate Territorial Government. The new names and locations are as follows: Assiniboia, containing about 120,000 square miles, bounded on the north by the international boundary, on the east by the western boundary of Manitoba, on the south by the line traced between 110 and 111 west longitude; Saskatchewan, containing about 110,000 square miles, is bounded on the north by Assiniboia, on the east by Lake Winnipeg and Nelson Lakes, on the north by the line drawn 55\u00b0 latitude, and on the west by a combination of lines making that boundary of the previous district\u2014the northern boundary of Saskatchewan being bounded on the south by the international boundary, on the east by Assiniboia and Saskatchewan, on the west by British Columbia, and on the north by the continuation of the line bounding Saskatchewan and Athabasca, containing about 120,000 square miles, bounded on the north by Alberta, on the west by British Columbia, on the south by the line bounding British Columbia, and on the east by the line which intersects Athabasca River, then by Lake Athabasca, and following Peace Lake and the Rocky Mountains, which forms the northern boundary. The new Saskatchewan district includes Battleford, Carberry, Prince Albert, Assiniboia, Athabasca, Fort Macleod, Saskatchewan, and Athabasca Rivers and Forts Macleod and Athabasca. It comprises the fertile, well watered, and easily irrigated district of Athabasca taken by the celebrated Pierre Radisson, and now known as the North-West. The Great Bear Land will have the effect of extending the boundaries of the district very considerably, and probably, by having such a capital amongst, it will become a center for settlement more central than the British Columbia or British Columbia.\n\nFor many animals from the British Museum, London, England, have been obtained at a cost of one hundred pounds sterling.

The subject of absolute prohibition,\nhas not been brought before our Legisla-\ntures, but there can be little doubt\nthat the experiment of such a communi-\nty where there has been tried, the proof\nthat it cannot be successfully carried out. The\nattempt to do so has only led to every\nactivity being employed in connection\nwith the introduction and use of deleterious\nessences and extracts which are far more\nharmful than the consumption of the\nuse of unadulterated liquors. Such being\nthe case it becomes a serious question\nwhether a well regulated and properly\nguarded system of licenses would not be\nbetter for this country, now that it is be-\ncoming so thickly settled and accessible\nfor the purpose of the present law which\nwas designed to regulate the habits of\nthe Indians.\n\nIn conclusion we may say that a\nwell and well written article by the second\nmember of the Winnipeg Commis-\nsion, and not by the way, a well conduct-\ned trial would be desirable.\n\nThe extension of a Liquor License\nLaw to the North-West Territories is likely soon\nto be discussed by Parliament. The\nTerritory of the North-West, the\nIndian residents of that part of the lakes,\nhave been subjected to a great deal of\nwrangling over the question of licenses\nwith Premier Neepay on the subject, and some have complained\nof the manner in which the well regulated\nsystem of licenses will work in the North-\nWest.\n\nSince the question has been raised\nin Parliament reports of any increase in\ndrunkenness have been received here,\nand it is very probable that the territo-\nrial government will make some changes\nabout its license laws. People in the\nNorth-West are becoming very suspi-\ncious of the intentions of John\nNeepay's party that \"prohibition\" will\ncome soon by Act of Parliament. If\nit does come, as has been hinted at by Acts\nof Assembly, it will be a great blow to\nanyone who resides in the North-West, as\nit will certainly be extremely difficult\nto find any place to obtain liquor. It\nwill also be very difficult to get any\nlicenses, by reason of a law which was\naimed to regulate only the habits of the\nIndians, but which will affect everyone\nwho resides in the North-West. It is\nnot possible to imagine how anyone\nwould be able to get a license under\nsuch circumstances.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT\n\nLAVING MILLS AND\nSASH AND DOOR FACTORY,\nDOORS, SASH, &c.\nKeep constantly on hand, good quality\nwooden doors, sashes, etc., etc.\nGOODFELLOW BRO'S.\nW.
