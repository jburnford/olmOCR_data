Mr. Dewdney has, in so promptly acting on the suggestions made by the citizens, given evidence of the deep interest he takes in the affairs of the Territories.\"\n\nThe necessity for a revision of the tariff referred to has been very much felt for a long time and we are glad that it has now been attended to; the fees are too high generally throughout, and reduction will be hailed with satisfaction by all interested. Mr. Dewdney appears to be fully alive to matters affecting the North-West, and generally gives such attention as come under his charge. We would like to see him prompt and active. We would like to see Mr. Dewdney take up the matter of the expenses of the late Assembly election; this election was held in June last, six months ago, but not until recently Office bearers of Prince Albert and Kinistino districts have not been paid and the different officers employed under them have had to wait and suffer in consequence. Such treatment is unkind, and has a strong tendency to alienate the sympathy of the people from the Government; we trust that Mr. Dewdney will give this matter his best attention and see that the expenses are paid forthwith.\n\nA provision has been inserted in the School Ordinance at the present session of the Assembly, making attendance at the public schools compulsory during a certain portion of each year. We believe that such a provision will meet with the hearty approval of those on whom the burden of supporting schools falls. Under the law, as it stood, in many schools there was only a small proportion of the children whose school age attended school, while the rest were growing up in ignorance, and this was owing to the negligence or ignorance of the parents. If parents will not send their children to school, they cannot be compelled to. This amendment of the law meets with our entire approval.\n\nThe information given to the electors of this district, at the meeting held on Tuesday, by Mr. Macdonald, while not having the force of an official statement, was nevertheless of a most encouraging and reassuring nature. Mr. Macdonald's speech was very interesting and clear on the subject of railway communication, and he gave the public a perfect idea of the steps taken by him in the past, and also as to the arrangements which have been completed up to date. After hearing Mr. Macdonald, we have no doubt but that the Regina and Long Lake road will be pushed forward vigorously in the spring and that it will be within easy distance of Prince Albert by the end of next summer.\n\nNothing is evident, and that is that it will not be owing to any neglect of our member if we do not get railway communication with the outside world at the earliest possible date. Mr. Macdonald has always placed our interests at Ottawa, and was in every way deserving of the vote of thanks which was so unanimously tendered to him at the meeting. We would urge the congregation urge upon the committee appointed to consider the matter the necessity of at once proceeding with their work, so as to have it completed and the result in Mr. Macdonald's hands before the session of the Dominion Parliament begins.\n\nGO TO AGNEW'S FOR Stoves Stoves Heating Drums Stovepipe Coal Oil T.J.

The report stated that the land grant had been approved by the government, and that the land was now available for settlement. The minister also announced that the Dominion government would be willing to consider the possibility of selling the land at a reduced price to encourage settlement.\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS.\n\nThe DISLOYAL MAIL.\n\nTo the Editor of The Times:\n\nSir,\u2014The Times of the 23rd of November has the following paragraph in a column of London news relating to the question of the loyalty of the Assembly:\n\n\"A special Commissioner Moore will, without doubt, be called to the seat of government to investigate the actions of Sir Charles Warren, but his appearance there will be delayed by the fact that he is engaged in a private matter.\"\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Sir Charles Warren has been appointed as the new Commissioner of the Assembly, and he will be arriving in Ottawa shortly.\n\nFirst Class Goods\n\nNever before heard of in Prince Albert.

Beever, secretary.\n\nThe chairman briefly explained the object of the meeting and put the question which had been handed to him and the president of the Lorne Agricultural Society to call a special meeting to consider the same question, and the object of the meeting was to impress upon the Government the necessity of immediate connection by railway with Prince Albert.\n\nMr. Macdonald, M.P., being called up on a vote\u2014a very important vote\u2014tore across every action which had been taken by himself and the delegates at Ottawa last year in endeavoring to secure the connection of the line from Long Lake road to Prince Albert. He said that they had intervened every month, and that they were still equally alive to the necessity of this plan for a road, the only difficulty being in the way of raising sufficient money as there seemed to be no prospect of giving money grants to branch lines. He then read a letter from Mr. Munro of Rainy River, Sir John A. Macdonald, and Mr. Nanton, of the financial firm of Onder Haemond & Nanton, showing that the finances of the company were not completed, and that everything was now in readiness to begin the construction of this line. Mr. Allan said that the work would be prosecuted vigorously in the spring. Mr. Macdonald spoke very hopefully of the Government having the railway line in hand before the fall.\n\nJohnson then moved the following resolution, which was seconded by Thos. McKay and carried unanimously:\n\n\"That whereas the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway has opened outside markets from Prince Albert and on market the prices given locally for produce will not cover the cost of production.\"\n\n\"And whereas this was also the case with the Dominion Atlantic Railway, which went to Ottawa last year by the Town Council, and the Board of Trade and the Lorne Agricultural society;\n\n\"Resolved that this meeting desire to again urge the Government into a state of decision into which this settle-\n\nment has been placed, and most urgently urge them to give the encouragement necessary to the Canadian Pacific Railway to build to Prince Albert by 1889, and that copies of this resolution be handed to the minister for Saskatchewan.\"\n\nCol. Spratt addressed the meeting and moved:\n\n\"That this meeting beg to tender its thanks to Mr. Macdonald for his services in the past and that they have confidence in him and that he future do his utmost to guard and advance the interests of the people in regard to the railway line between James MacArthur and carried unanimously.\n\nMr. Macdonald, in a well-chosen remarks remarks, thanked the members for their attention and pledged himself to do all in his power to advance the interests of Prince Albert by having railway connection. He said that he would greatly aid him if proper statistics were compiled, so that he could show the advantages of connecting Prince Albert by railway.\n\nMoved by the Rev. J. Agnew and seconded by Mr. J. Agnew and carried.\n\n\"That this meeting appoint a committee to collect statistics throughout the District of Prince Albert and report the same to the Government our representatives in Ottawa, and the importance of securing early railway communication.\n\nThe committee appointed to collect the proper statistics were\u2014Hon.
