DRINKWATER,\nSecretary,\nMONTREAL.\n\nL. A. HAMILTON,\nLand Commissioner,\nWINNIPEG.\nMANITOBA.\n\nThe Province of Manitoba is one of the seven Provinces of the Dominion of Canada. It is situated in the very centre of the North American continent, being midway between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Winnipeg, the capital of the Province, is 1,424 miles from Montreal, the summer port of the Atlantic Ocean Steamships, and 1,483 miles from Vancouver on the Pacific Ocean. The southern frontier of the Province, bordering on the United States, is about the same latitude as Paris and the south of Germany.\n\nManitoba has an area of 123,200 square miles, or nearly 79,000,000 acres, including the water surface. It contains at the present time a population of about 110,000, the larger portion of whom are from Great Britain and Eastern Canada. There are also quite a number of settlers from the United States, Australia and other countries, and in addition there are some very prosperous colonies of Icelanders, Swedes, Mennonites, and Hungarians. It is impossible in the space available to give more than the merest outline of the capabilities and natural advantages that this Province possesses; these are set out fully in the \"North-West Farmer,\" and other publications issued by the Canadian Pacific Railway, copies of which can be obtained on application at any of the offices of the Company.\n\nThe following extract is from an article published in May, 1888, in the St. Paul and Minneapolis Pioneer Press, one of the leading papers of the United States:\n\n\"Manitoba, the garden of the Northwest, the country which is now and will be still more in the future the storehouse of this continent; the land of wheat, the best that has ever been grown; the fertile belt, with its millions of acres of the best available land; the country which offers an unsurpassed home for the millions who will yet till its fertile prairies, a country second to none, and first in its productive yield. Last year the actual yield of wheat was thirty-two bushels to the acre. To prove this is easy. There was in crop 432,124 acres, with a return of 11,000,000 bushels. There was exported 9,000,000 bushels, there is now in store 1,500,000, there is 1,500,000 still in the farmers' hands, while the estimated consumption in the Province, and certainly a low one, was 2,000,000. What country can show an equal result? Nor was this all. There was grown millions of bushels of oats, barley and of peas, and of potatoes and other roots there were additional millions raised.\"\n\nWHEAT SURPLUS.\n\nThe large surplus of wheat produced in Manitoba is eagerly sought after by European millers, and, owing to its superior quality and hardness, commands the highest price of any wheat grown in the World.\n\nRICHEST SOIL IN THE WORLD.\n\nThe soil is a rich, deep, black, argillaceous mould, or loam, resting on a deep and very tenacious clay subsoil. It is among the richest, if not the richest, soil in the world, and especially adapted to the growth of wheat. Analyses by chemists in Scotland and Germany have established this. This great richness of the prairie soil has arisen from the gathering of droppings from birds and animals and ashes of prairie fires, which have accumulated for ages, together with decayed vegetable and animal matter, the whole resting on a retentive clay subsoil. It is to the profusion of this stored up wealth in the soil that the agriculturist from the older countries is invited.\n\nMANITOBA.\n\nGENERAL FEATURES.\n\nManitoba is not a monotonous stretch of level prairie, but on the contrary, its topography is of a varied and diversified character, and in some parts extremely picturesque. In the South it is broken by the Pembina and Turtle Mountains, and in the North by the Riding Mountains. The eastern and central portion has large areas of forest broken up, with lakes and prairie openings. It is well watered by numerous rivers, which generally occupy broad and deep valleys, and are almost invariably wooded along the banks.\nCLIMATE.\n\nThe climate of Manitoba is warm in summer and cold in winter. The summer mean is 65\u00b0 to 67\u00b0, which is very nearly the same as that of the State of New York. But in winter the thermometer sinks occasionally to 30\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 below zero. The atmosphere, however, is very bright and dry, and the sensation of cold is not so unpleasant as that of a cold temperature in a humid atmosphere. Warm clothing, especially in driving, and warm houses are, however, required. The snow fall is very light.\n\nManitoba is one of the absolutely healthiest countries on the globe, and pleasant to live in. There is no malaria, and there are no diseases arising out of, or peculiar to either the Province or the climate.\n\nTHE SUMMER IS CHARMING.\n\nThe long hours of continuous sun-light and warmth afford the remaining conditions to bring the crops to maturity. Warm weather, usually very equable, prevails, but sometimes a heated spell develops. The nights, however, are always cool and most agreeable. As summer gradually wanes and indications of autumn approach new features of delight present themselves. The heavens do not appear as if draped in mourning. There are no indications that the fountains of the great deep are broken up. The roads do not become impassable; on the contrary, nature becomers the suggestion of anything sad or gloomy. It is doubtful that any portion of our year is more agreeable than autumn. This is greatly to the advantage of the husbandman who is afforded the most favorable opportunity for harvesting and threshing and preparing the ground for another season.\n\nHarvesting begins in August and ends in September. The harvesting season is considered the finest of the year. The atmosphere is at all times clear, bright, and free from moisture. So much so is this the case that there is no necessity for stacking the grain. In many cases the farmer draws his grain straight from the field to the thresher, and from the latter to the elevator. It is not an uncommon thing for a farmer to have his wheat all cut, threshed and marketed before the end of September. In this way, all the expense of two extra handling is saved, and the heavy cost of erecting barns and granaries is avoided.\n\nTo all these natural advantages may be added the fact that the hardships of pioneering are scarcely felt in Manitoba. Railways, schools, churches, and thriving towns and villages are now scattered all over the country. Wherever the settler turns he will find colonies of his own countrymen\u2014English, Scotch, Irish, Welsh, French, Germans, Scandinavians, Russians, etc., etc., all vying with one another in building up the wealth of the Province. Under the laws of this country all are placed on the same footing. Successful beyond their anticipations, is the story told by men of every nationality under the Sun.\n\nASSINIBOIA.\n\nThe District of Assiniboia lies between the Province of Manitoba and the District of Alberta, and extends north from the International boundary to the 52nd parallel of latitude, and contains an area of thirty-four million acres. Traveling westward on the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, the District is entered at a point 412 miles west of Winnipeg. It is divided into two great areas by the Missouri Coteau, or third prairie steppe that crosses the Railway at Secretan Station. Each of these divisions has its own peculiar characteristics, making the eastern portion essentially a wheat-growing country, and the western better fitted for mixed farming and ranching. The great plain lying south of the Qu'Appelle River and stretching south to the International Boundary is considered to have the largest acreage of wheat land, possessing a uniform character of soil found in any one tract of fertile prairie land in the North-West. The eastern part of the District is known as the Park Country of the Canadian North-West. The surface is rolling, dotted over with clumps of trees, usually found bordering the shores of lakes or meadows. The valley of the Pipestone is considered the most attractive section. Coal in abundance is found in the South, in the District drained by the Souris River. This District, including the Province of Manitoba, will one day be the\n\nAN ARMY OF SELF-BINDERS.\n\nHARVESTING BY WHOLESALE.\n\nCANADIAN NORTH-WEST CROPS MAKE SUCCESS SURE.\nGREATEST WHEAT PRODUCING SECTION\n\nof the American continent, for the following reasons. 1st. It has a soil particularly rich in the food of the wheat plant. 2nd. A climate under which the plant comes to maturity with great rapidity. 3rd. On account of its northern latitude it receives more sunshine during the period of growth than the country to the South. 4th. Absence of rust, due to dryness of climate. 5th. Absence of insect foes.\n\nThese conditions are specially favourable to the growth of the hard, flinty wheat of the Scotch Fife variety, that is so highly prized by millers all the world over, giving it a value of from 10 to 25c. a bushel over the other varieties grown in Europe and the older parts of Canada. It has now the distinctive designation in the wheat markets of the world of\n\n\"MANITOBA HARD.\"\n\nWhile this soil produces a berry of such a high grade, the percentage between the amount of grain produced for that sown is amazing, and the record shown by the last complete statistics of an average of 30 bushels per acre, is one that has not been approached on this continent.\n\nASSINIBOIA.\n\nWESTERN DISTRICT.\n\nThis region, which is fully equal to the Bow and Belly River District as a stock country, and to the Calgary District as a mixed farming country, has been ignored in the rush to the latter places. It is now beginning to attract the attention it deserves, as attested by the large number of settlers that have taken up land during the past season. The plain south of the Railway line, lying along the base of the Northern Slope of the Cypress Hills, and extending West to Medicine Hat, is unsurpassed for grazing purposes by any part of the North-West. It is everywhere thickly covered with a good growth of nutritious grasses,\u2014the grass is usually the short, crisp variety, known as \"Buffalo Grass,\" which becomes to all appearances dry about mid-summer, but is still green and growing at the roots and forms excellent pasture both in winter and summer. A heavy growth of grass suitable for hay is found in many of the river bottoms and surrounding the numerous lakes and sloughs. It is difficult to believe that cattle and horses prefer, what appears to the casual observer to be short dried-up grass, to the green, juicy grasses of rank growth that are found bordering the lakes and sloughs; but it only requires a short experience of the country to prove the truth of this assertion. It is amazing the rapidity with which poor emaciated animals brought from the East get sick and fat on the stunted buffalo grass of the plains.\n\nThe supply of timber on the hills is considerable. There is also an abundance of fuel of a different kind in the coal seams that are exposed in many of the valleys.\n\nSettlers in this Section of the Company have thus at hand an abundant supply of timber suitable for house logs and fencing, and both coal and wood for fuel.\n\nSETTLEMENTS.\n\nThe principal settlements are in the District South of Maple Creek, Dunmore and Medicine Hat. Parties in search of land, either for mixed farming or stock-raising, are advised to examine the country South-West of Swift Current Station, along the Swift Current Creek, South and West of Gull Lake, South of Maple Creek, the Valley of MacKay Creek that flows North from the hills crossing the track at Walsh, and South of Irvine and Dunmore.\n\nTHE CYPRESS HILLS COUNTRY.\n\nThese hills, which may be dimly seen in the South from the Railway, are especially adapted for stock raising and as their elevation is sufficient to make general farming an uncertainty, the grass land that nature has so bountifully provided will not likely be disturbed by the plough, thus giving to the farmer on the plains adjoining, never failing hay meadows and unlimited pasture ground for his stock. The snow fall is light, the climate is tempered by the Chinook winds, and water\n\nA CANADIAN NORTH-WEST FARMSTEAD.\n\nTHE RESULT OF SIX YEARS' EARNEST WORK.\n\nThere are hundreds more as good got without capital to start with.\nThe southern half of this area is well adapted for raising horses, cattle and sheep, and fattening them without other food than the rich bunch or buffalo grass which grows everywhere spontaneously, and which cures itself on the stem, retaining its nutritious properties all the year round, without cutting or covering, excepting that it may be covered by the light falls of snow during the winter months, which covering rather improves it than otherwise, and is very seldom deep enough to prevent the animals eating it off the ground.\n\nDuring the last five years many thousand cattle, sheep and horses, have been raised in the southern half of Alberta on the rich grass without any feeding or shelter other than the shelter found along the hill sides or in clumps of trees. The cattle and sheep when taken off the pasture are fat and fit for any butcher's shop in the world, and the horses are rolling fat.\n\nWhile the south is so well adapted for cattle ranching, it is also an excellent country for mixed farming. But the northern country is not so well adapted for raising live stock altogether out of doors, there being more snow and cold; it is however, equally good, if not better, than the south in most respects for general farming. It is eminently suited for mixed farming, and as a butter and cheese producing district, should win for itself an enviable name.\n\nALBERTA.\nTHE NORTHERN PART.\n\nA resident of the District writes, that \"the northern part may be described in general terms as rolling prairie, dotted over with bluffs of spruce and poplar, interspersed with lakes and meadows, and intersected with numerous small creeks, giving the whole a particularly park-like appearance, which, in point of natural scenery, is beyond the possibility of exaggeration. I have seen the most beautiful spots of five of the eastern provinces, and of several of the states across our southern border, but I have never seen any section of country which in its natural state could compare with this. Indeed it is almost impossible for a stranger looking off some commanding butte, to realize that the delightful prospect all around him is \"in condition primeval.\" It would not seem difficult to persuade some Rip Van Winkle awakening suddenly among such surroundings that the buildings and fences had been mysteriously removed, and that those beautiful bluffs in the distant landscape were the orchards and ornamental trees among which stately residences had once rested, and that those smooth symmetrical slopes were the fruitful fields of a departed race of agricultural princes.\"\n\nCATTELE RAISING.\n\nTo-day Alberta stands peerless among the cattle countries of the world; and the unknown land of a few years ago is now looked to as one of the greatest future supply depots of the British markets.\n\nAlthough cattle had been introduced into Alberta a number of years back, it was not until 1881 that the foundation of the present great industry was laid.\n\nThere are now on the ranges of Alberta over 120,000 head of cattle, which at any season are neither fed nor sheltered; cattle, too, which in point of breeding, size and general condition, are equal, if not superior, to any range cattle in the world; for the Alberta rancher, industrious as he may be in many points of management, is deserving of the greatest credit for the high grade which the range cattle have reached. Shorthorns, Hereford and Angus bulls have been imported, at great expense; but the interest on the outlay has indeed been both satisfactory and encouraging, and the young cattle of the Alberta ranges would compare favorably with the barnyard cattle of Great Britain.\n\nWith a local market which annually consumes from eighteen to twenty thousand heaves, and the demand ever increasing; with the great market of the world, within easy access, with our natural advantages enticing the most experienced cattlemen from the American Territories and British Columbia to invest in the business here, who can say what will be the future of this industry which has grown with such gigantic strides in seven years.\n\nTo the capitalists and the farmer who intend engaging in the cattle business the writer would say: examine well into the resources and attractions of any other country in which you may be inclined to make a home; compare the advantages it offers with these offered by Alberta, and having done so, there is little doubt but that you will make a happy and prosperous home for yourself under the shadow of the Rocky Mountains, and assist in stocking the fertile valleys of fair Alberta.\n\nNOT ALL LEVEL PRAIRIE!\n\nPLENTY OF VARIETY!\n\nROLLING LANDS,\nHILLS, WOODLANDS,\nLAKES and RIVERS.\nand shelter are everywhere abundant. Professor Macoun in his exploration of these hills found that the grasses of the Plateau were of the real pasture species and produced abundance of leaves and were so tall that for miles at a time he had great difficulty in forcing his way through them. Although their seeds were all ripe August 14th, their leaves were quite green.\n\nIn all the valleys and on the rich soil of the higher grounds the grass was tall enough for hay. No better summer pasture is to be found in all the wide North-West than exists on these hills, as the grass is always green, water of the best quality always abundant, and shelter from the autumnal and winter storms always at hand.\n\nRANGE CATTLE.\n\nA rough estimate places the number of cattle in this District at 20,000. The fall round up of the Maple Creek Association showed 12,000 head in that section. The profits to the stockmen are large as can be readily imagined when it is shown that $12.00 per head was paid for steers on the ranges this year, animals that cost their owners only the interest on the original investment incurred in stocking the ranch, and their share in the cost of the annual round ups. Yearlings are now being sent into this country all the way from Ontario to fatten on the nutritious grasses of these Western plains, and it is reckoned that by paying cost of calf and freight for 2,000 miles the profit will be greater than if these cattle had been fattened by still feeding in Ontario. Everything seems to point towards this being the future fattening ground for cattle intended for European markets.\n\nALBERTA.\n\nThe Provisional District of Alberta, the great ranching, dairy farming and mineral country of the Canadian North-West, embraces an area larger than that of England and Wales together. Lying on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains and bounded on the north by the Provisional District of Athabasca, lat. 53\u00b07', on the south by the International boundary line, on the east by the Provisional District of Assiniboia, and on the west by the summit of the Rocky Mountains, until it intersects the 120th degree of longitude, then due north to lat. 55\u00b07', the eastern boundary of the Province of British Columbia, a length of some 300 miles from east to west, and 500 from north to south; it includes in its 107,700 square miles, every variety of forest and stream land, grazing and agricultural land, mineral and oil districts. In it are comprised 45 millions of acres of the most fertile soil on the continent, and some of America's best deposits of coal and metals.\n\nAlthough but yet in its infant years, the fame of Alberta has extended to the remote parts of the world, and travellers, tourists and health-seekers from many lands have come to enjoy the magnificence of its scenery, to inhale its health-giving mountain air, and bathe in the healing waters of its mineral springs; and many who come but for a brief stay are enticed by the attractions of its many and varied charms, as well as the bright prospects of health and success to make homes for themselves beneath the shadow of the ever beautiful, majestic, awe-inspiring Rockies. Bright, happy homes they should be in this land of sunshine and fertile abundance.\n\nGENERAL FEATURES.\n\nAlberta may be described as having three distinct surface features, viz.: prairie lands on the east, which are thickly timbered in the northern part of the province; then come the rolling lands or foot hills, extending some 10 miles from the base of the mountains, mostly heavily timbered, and lastly the majestic mountains, the great backbone of this continent, walling its western boundary. Viewing it from north to south, from east to west, what can we say in truth but that it is a wondrous land, beautiful in the extreme, possessing all the features that delight the eye and fit it for the home of man.\n\nCAPABILITIES.\n\nThat part of the District of Alberta, already proven to be well suited for general farming by the methods followed in the old Provinces of the Dominion of Canada, as well as in the United States, extends from the American Line on the south for 400 miles north, and from the foot of the Rocky Mountains for 200 miles eastward.\n\nTHE FAT HERDS\n\nUPON\n\nA THOUSAND ACRES,\n\nTHRIVE UPON THE RICH NATURAL GRASSES,\n\nAs does their owner, on the profits they afford.\nSHEEP RAISING.\n\nAlberta today offers what the Australian colonies had to offer thirty years ago: millions of acres of rich grass lands, well watered and adapted in every respect for growing first-class mutton and fine wool; in a land blessed with a climate of sufficient heat and sunshine during two-thirds of the year to keep the flock in active circulation, thereby insuring a fine fibred wool; with mild winters and early springs, where cold rains and dust storms, so injurious to the fleeces, are almost unknown; often inducement, too, which Australia never could offer, a railway running through the centre of the grazing lands and markets for mutton and wool within easy reach. The clear, dry bracing air of the country suits sheep, which suffer from little or no disease. Sheep mature early, owing to the fine quality of the grass. To winter them safely, good, warm, sunny sheds, plenty of hay (10 tons to the 100 head) and careful looking after all that is wanted. Throughout the greater part of the winter, sheep only require one feed a day, the rest of the day they are let out to graze, and brought home into sheds at night.\n\nALBERTA.\n\nDAIRY FARMING.\n\nThe leading features that mark out this section of Canada, as the country pre-eminently fitted for the manufacture of cheese and butter, are:\n\n1st.\u2014The rich natural grasses on which the cows can graze the whole year round, doing away with the necessity of artificial feeding. 2nd.\u2014The entire absence of highly flavored noxious weeds, the consumption of which taints the product of the dairy. 3rd.\u2014The summer temperature cooled by the mountain breezes, with the sparkling springs of cold mountain water with which the country abounds.\n\nPossessing all these natural advantages, it cannot be wondered at that those who have embarked in this business, have been eminently successful; and that the claims urged for Alberta, that she will be able to outstrip all competitors, in the cheap production of the highest grades of dairy products are well founded.\n\nHORSE RAISING.\n\nAs a horse breeding country, Alberta bids fair to be to Canada what Kentucky is to the United States. A country where the horse attains the very height of perfection. Its northern location, its high altitude, its invigorating and dry atmosphere, mild winters, with luxuriant grass and plentiful supply of purest water, are all conducive to the growth and development of the noble animal; and although the industry is still very young, the Alberta horse has become noted for endurance, size, power, and freedom from hereditary or other diseases.\n\nThere are now present in Alberta over 20,000 head of horses, varying in point of quality from the hardy, (Cayuse) Indian Pony, to the beautiful, well formed thoroughbred. Thoroughbreds from Great Britain and Kentucky, Clydesdales from Scotland, Percherons from France, and trotting stock from the United States, have been imported at great expense, and the result is that the young horses of Alberta will compete with any in Canada.\n\nAs an investment, horse ranching in Alberta offers bright inducements, and the farmer or capitalist coming to this country and wishing to engage in this business, will find millions of acres of unoccupied meadow lands, possessing every attraction and advantage, from which to choose a location; will find, too, a country where the cost of raising horses is surprisingly low.\n\nMINERALS.\n\nThat Alberta possesses untold wealth in her immense mineral deposits, is no longer a matter of speculation. For years past gold in paying quantities has been found on the banks and bars of the North Saskatchewan River. The discoveries made last fall in the vicinity of Prairie Creek are full of importance, and the locality will no doubt ere long be the scene of much mining activity. Gold colours are found in almost every stream and river in Alberta, and as the country is thoroughly prospected there is every reason to suppose that rich finds will be discovered. Large veins of galena have been located which are pronounced by experts to contain a large percentage of silver. Capital\n\nROOM TO GROW!\n\nALWAYS MORE FAT ACRES\n\nFOR THE SUCCESSFUL SETTLER TO ADD TO HIS FIRST CLAIM IN THE CANADIAN NORTH-WEST.\nALBERTA.\n\nCLIMATE.\n\nThere is no place in this western hemisphere that enjoys more bright sunlight, during the year round, than Alberta, and it enjoys at least fifty per cent. more than the average.\n\nTHE SPRING is the most trying; not because it is particularly wet or severe, or long, but because with a mild winter, one expects to see a correspondingly early spring. In Alberta one is usually disappointed on that score, because the spring there is very rarely any earlier than in Manitoba or Ontario. The winter is shortened mostly by its often being nearly New Year before there is any winter weather to speak of.\n\nTHE SUMMER once entered upon, the weather is superb; between the days of bright, life-producing sunshine, copious warm showers fall bathing the rich soil like a hotbed, and forcing vegetation forward in rapid and rank profusion.\n\nTHE AUTUMN WEATHER of Alberta is perfect. Towards the end of September the air gets chilly at night, with frost enough to make the roads crisp in the morning; the sun rises in matchless splendour, the blue vault of Heaven is unmarked with even the shadow of a cloud, the atmosphere clear and light, bright and invigorating, thrilling every pulsation of feeling, sharpening the intellect, and infusing ruddy energy into every part of the body.\n\nNo one can do justice with the pen to the splendour of this weather; day after day, week after week, sometimes clear up to Christmas-tide, this fall weather remains unbroken, warm, joyous, delicious.\n\nWHEN WINTER sets in, the siege is usually sharp, short and decided. There are bright, keen days, with low readings of the thermometer, alternating with days of great warmth. Considering both latitude and altitude, the thermometer may be several degrees below zero in the forenoon, and in the afternoon a south wind (Chinook) may spring up, and in a few hours the temperature will be 40 or 50 degrees above zero, and for days, often weeks, in the winter season, Albertans enjoy summer weather, consequent on these south-west warm winds. Usually cold weather sets in about the first of January, and continues with intervals of Chinook weather, until the beginning of March, when the real cold weather is past. After that time cold snaps, generally of but a few days' duration, often occur.\n\nThe following points in favour of Alberta should be considered by settlers looking for locations:\n\n1st. Richness of the natural grasses.\n2nd. The natural beauties of the country.\n3rd. Abundant supply of water and fuel.\n4th. Cheapestness of lands, whether acquired by purchase or lease.\n5th. Subtropical climate.\n6th. Special advantages for raising cattle, sheep, and horses.\n\nWHAT CAN BE DONE!\n\nThe First Year in Manitoba.\n\nA practical farmer of some years residence in Manitoba makes the following statement:\n\nLand can be purchased cheaply here, or it can be had for nothing, by homesteading. This enables farmers with small capital to commence farming. It is all plain sailing; no stamps or stones to take out; all level prairie land ready for the plough. A farmer can begin on a small capital. A single man can start on an outfit of $385, made up as follows:\u20141 yoke of oxen and harness, $115; plow, harrow, etc., $40; stove and furniture, $40; bedding, etc., $20; lumber, doors, windows, etc., for log shanty, $50; provisions, $90; seed, $30. A farmer with a family of five, would have to lay out $240 more, bringing his outlay up to $625.\n\nA farmer can come in about the middle of March, select his land, and build his shanty; he can commence to plough about the 5th of April; he can break 10 acres and put it under crop on the sod; he can continue breaking for two months after he puts the 10 acres under crop, and can easily break thirty acres, and backset the 40 acres in the fall, ready for crop in the spring. He can raise enough on the ten acres to give him a start; he can cut hay enough for his oxen and a cow in July, and it will cost him about $60 additional to seed the forty acres in the spring.\n\nSuppose he puts in 30 acres of wheat, and raises 25 bushels to the acre, at 80 cents per bushel, it will be worth $300; say 5 acres of oats at 40 bushels per acre, at 35 cents per bushel, $70; say 1 acre of potatoes, 200 bushels, at 40 cents, $80; 3 acres of barley, 40 bushels per acre, worth 40 cents, $48; and 1 acre of garden stuff at $1.20; total, $918. After deducting expenses of harvesting and the whole original outlay, the farmer will still have something to the good to start with next year. Young farmers should take a note of this, and secure land in this country before it is all taken up.\n\nWHAT CAN BE DONE!\n\nButter Making in Alberta.\n\nA practical man in Alberta, makes the following statement about Butter making in Alberta:\n\nA settler arrives here having means to put up a small house on his 160-acre homestead, and has also means to get a span of horses, a plough and harrow, with enough of seed to plant a few acres. Then, if he has a wife, and $100 left, let him buy two cows; if more money still, more cows \u2014 say five cows the first year. From these he will be able to make five pounds of butter daily during five months, worth in our market 25 cents a pound (Is.) This will support himself and wife. The milk will also feed three calves and a couple of pigs. Now, it must be remembered that the care of these need not prevent him from cultivating a good garden and attending to a goodly number of acres of crops besides. And it must be also remembered, in connection with all this, that no matter how favorable the season may be, the garden and the cultivated acres may prove a failure, but neither hail-storm nor frost affect the returns from properly attended milch cows.\n\nOf course, the above applies to individual beginnings of an industry that will unavoidably merge into a co-operative dairy farming, when the creamery will be established in the centre of the township, where the individual or company will gather the cream from the surrounding farmers, and employ a practical and trained butter-maker, who will produce from the uniform and unequalled cream of Alberta, the gilt-edged creamery butter of commerce, unsurpassed, if equalled, by any in the world.\nTHE CAPABILITIES OF A TOWNSHIP.\n\nLet us suppose a township in Alberta, containing land. A township is six miles square, divided into sections of 160 acres each. Let us suppose this township to contain 24 sections, each farm capable of sustaining a family. This makes 3840 acres in the township. If we assume that a fair average cow will yield sufficient milk to produce one pound of butter a day for five months in each year, then 10 lbs. of butter produced daily at, say, 20 cents per pound, would amount to a season to the handsome sum of $150. Now, if this sum were coming into a single township, it would be enough to pay all the bills that after the farmer had been engaged in the morning, he can then, until the milking of cows, attend to the demands and duties of his profitable mixed farming.\n\nMARKETS.\n\nNow, where you find a market for all this surplus production, you need give little trouble. It is said that there are markets in Alberta, each making a demand which would be twenty commissions, or more, to control the productions. Butter and eggs, if they are not only of good quality, but also cheap, make the handling and marketing of these products form of agricultural enterprise of high position than any other. And it is perfectly safe to predict that the cream-mills of Alberta, butter will be found in abundance, building a most ready market. Once and reputation is once established, and the demand for our productions is why I urge every settler to the inviting lands of Alberta, and its capital, Edmonton, the most practical place in which the common sense and a good wife.\n\nAVAILABLE LANDS.\n\nOut of the immense area surveyed by the Government, it is estimated that at least ten million acres are open for free entry. Two million acres of this belong to the Province of Manitoba. It is difficult now to obtain the best Lands in the Province of Manitoba within easy distance of a railway. An old saying of a section is to be picked up here and there in the well-settled parts of the Province, but practically every man who can expect to find land that will suit him. There is considerable land to be had in the West of Oak Lake, in the Bradmore Agency, within easy distance of the Railway Grant. Eastern Assiniboia is only well-settled, and difficulty is experienced in getting a homestead close to the line where the second principal meridian is crossed. In Western Alberta, with the exception of the Calgary District, land is to be had in every Township. Valuable locations can be secured at reasonable rates of the railway stations. Then for the settler who cannot afford to select from in the District of Prince Albert, Battleford, Edmonton, or the valley of the Great Saskatchewan. This District is now being opened up by the construction of a Railway from Edmonton to the very heart of the Saskatchewan country.\n\nRAILWAY LANDS.\n\nIt is a great advantage to those who have capital to be tempted by the attractions offered, into going far away from a railway. To such, however, we can give well the lands offered for sale by the Railway Company. The facilities offered for your doing this will save a great deal of expense and valuable time necessarily lost in selecting a location.\n\nThe Company's lands are of every description; meadow, bush, timber, prairie, heavy clay lands, and light loamy soils. The requirements of every settler can be met both as regards quality and price.\n\nCOST OF RAILWAY TICKETS REFUNDED.\n\nSpecial round-trip explorer's tickets can be obtained at the Company's Land Office, the full price of which will be refunded if the holder purchases 160 acres or more. In this way, land hunters are enabled to make a personal inspection of the land free of cost to themselves.\n\nFor the convenience of investors, every Station Agent in the West is supplied with price lists of the lands in his respective District, and is instructed to give land seekers every possible assistance in enabling them to see the lands.\n\nSOUTHERN MANITOBA LANDS.\n\nSpecial attention is called to the lands of the Manitoba South-Western Railway Company, administered by the same department as that charged with the lands of the Canadian Pacific.\n\nOwing to certain difficulties, which have now passed away, the railway lands in Southern Manitoba were for a long time locked up from sale or settlement. In the meantime, all the available Government lands were occupied and farmed, so that at the time the railway lands were thrown open for sale they were in immediate demand. Having all the fruits of civilization, the usual accompaniments of pioneer life are wanting.\n\nThis section of country is\n\nWELL WOODED:\n\nfine groves of poplar, oak, soft maples and elms abound and give pleasing diversity to the landscape, while meadows are so interspersed with the black, loamy, arable land, as to make the annual crop of prairie hay unusually large.\n\nOn account of the abundance of hay and water this part is especially adapted for mixed farming, and there are numerous herds of high class shorthorn; de cattle besides flocks of well-bred sheep, Shropshires and Southdowns predominating.\n\nOn nearly all the farms wells are found, yielding an almost unlimited supply of fine spring water, of a soft quality, admirably suited for the infusion of tea, or for washing purposes.\n\nTHE SOIL is a black loam, and the yield of wheat and other cereals per acre reaches a very high average\u2014root crops, such as mangolds, turnips, beets and potatoes attain to great perfection and size. In garden produce, a consignment of giant squash, mammoth pumpkins, cotton, cucumbers, carrots and onions is annually sent to the exhibition at Toronto.\n\nWILD FRUITS ABOUND.\n\nIn the woods are to be found in great quantities saskatoons, raspberries, cranberries, wild plums, gooseberries and currants, also red and black cherries.\n\nGAME.\n\nAt the lake, in the shooting season, pheasants, waneys, and grey geese, besides forty-two different species of wild ducks are in flocks that literally cover miles of water; partridges and scrub rabbits are in great numbers in the bush, and deer are by no means scarce.\n\nThe neighboring prairies are plentifully stocked with grouse, Jack rabbits (said by old country sportsmen to be identical with the English hare), Sandhill cranes and other game; fur-bearing animals are also numerous.\n\nFISH.\n\nThe farmers enjoy considerable leisure time in winter, and numbers go fishing on the numerous lakes with which the district abounds.\n\nFish are caught by hook and line, through holes cut in the ice, and large quantities are salted away for summer use.\n\nThe majority of farms occupied or still in a state of nature in this district, are remarkable for possessing what has been described as \"the perfect combination,\" viz: water, hay, wood, and wheat land of the richest description.\n\nThe scenery is very beautiful, whether on the flowery earth-waves of the prairies, or by the clear, winding streams, overshadowed by thickly wooded banks.\nADVICE TO SETTLERS.\n\nThe newcomer need not fear that when he reaches Winnipeg he will fall into the hands of thieves, impostors, or unfriendly people. If he follows the directions of this pamphlet, he will put himself in the hands of friends who will look after him. The train is met upon its arrival by the agents of the Government and of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, who take charge of immigrants and give them all the assistance and advice they need in a strange land.\n\nCHOOSING A LOCATION.\n\nIn cases where they have already fixed upon some locality for settlement, where friends are awaiting them, they are shown how to proceed directly to that point. If they have not decided upon such a locality, but intend to seek a home somewhere further West, they should immediately call upon the Land Commissioner of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\n\nTHE PRICE OF RAILWAY LANDS.\n\nTheir nearness to a railway station or market, the amount of settlement, the nationality of people in the neighborhood, and the exact character of the soil can be learned at his office. Every quarter section of the whole vast area owned by the Railway Company has been gone over by official inspectors and reported upon in detail.\n\nAll this information is open to the intending settler. If the land of a certain section is sandy, or rocky, or marshy, or alkaline, or otherwise unsuitable for farming; he is told so; if it is good land for grazing, but poor for farming, he learns that; if it is thoroughly fertile and desirable, this will be pointed out. In short, the whole truth, whether it is favorable or unfavorable, can be learned from the maps and surveyor's notes shown in this office.\n\nPERSONAL INSPECTION.\n\nMost men, nevertheless, naturally wish to examine for themselves the section which seems to them from these reports most suitable, and this is strongly recommended in every case. They are then told what is the quickest and cheapest way to reach it, (special facilities being provided for this purpose), and, when necessary, are furnished by the Dominion Government Intelligence Officer with a guide, who either accompanies them all the way from Winnipeg, or meets them at the nearest railway station, and goes with them to the designated locality. If they are pleased, (which is usually the case), all the arrangements for taking it up, or for its purchase, are made at once at the nearest agency, and they can immediately take possession. Only a very few days therefore, need elapse between the arrival of an immigrant at Winnipeg and his settlement upon the land of his choice.\n\nWHERE SHOULD I GO?\n\nIf you want to confine your farming purely to grain growing, select your land in\n\nMANITOBA OR EASTERN ASSINIBOIA,\n\ngetting as close to a railway station as possible. If for cattle, horse or sheep raising,\n\nWESTERN ASSINIBOIA OR ALBERTA.\n\nMixed farming can be carried on to advantage in any of these Provinces.\nFREE GRANTS\n\nDOMINION LANDS REGULATIONS.\n\nUnder the Dominion Lands Regulations, all Surveyed even numbered sections, excepting 8 and 26, in Manitoba and the North-West Territories, which have not been homesteaded, reserved to provide wood lots for settlers, or otherwise disposed of or reserved, are to be held exclusively for homesteads and pre-emptions.\n\nHOMESTEADS.\n\nHomesteads may be obtained upon payment of an Office Fee of Ten Dollars, subject to the following conditions as to residence and cultivation:\n\nLand, other than that included in Mile Belt, Town Site Reserves, and Coal and Mineral Districts, may be homesteaded in either of the three following methods:\n\n1.

Railway Co., Winnipeg.\n\nSOUTHERN MANITOBA LANDS.\n\nTHE LAND GRANT of the MANITOBA SOUTH-WESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY, is now placed on the market, and offers special attractions. It consists of over 1,000,000 acres of the choicest land in America, well adapted for grain growing and mixed farming, in a belt 21 miles wide, immediately north of the International Boundary, and from range 13 westward. That portion of this grant lying between range 13 and the western limit of Manitoba is well settled, the homesteads having been long taken up. Purchasers will at once have all the advantages of this early settlement, such as schools, churches and municipal organization. The fertility of the soil has been amply demonstrated by the splendid crops that have been raised from year to year in that district. The country is well watered by lakes and streams, the principal of which are Rock Lake, Pelican Lake, Whitewater Lake, and the Souris River and its tributaries, while never-failing spring creeks take their rise in the Turtle Mountain. Wood is plentiful, and lumber suitable for building purposes is manufactured at Desford, Deloraine and Wakopa, and may be purchased at reasonable prices. At the two latter points grist mills are also in operation.\n\nThe terms of purchase of the Manitoba South-Western Lands are the same as those of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co.\n\nTHE Canadian Pacific Railway\n\nIS THE ONLY RAIL ROUTE TO THE FERTILE FARM LANDS AND THE BROAD PASTURES OF\n\nManitoba,\n\nThe North-West Territories,\n\nAND THE MINING, LUMBERING, AND FARMING REGIONS OF\n\nBritish Columbia,\n\n\u2014AND IS ALSO\u2014\n\nThe Best Route to WASHINGTON TERRITORY!\n\nAnd Points on Puget Sound and the Pacific Coast.\n\nNO CUSTOMS TROUBLES! NO TRANSFERS!\n\nPassengers from Europe, Homeseekers, Tourists and Sportsmen, leave the Trans-Atlantic steamers at Quebec, in summer, and at Halifax, Nova Scotia, during the winter months. At either of these ports they will be met by an agent of the Company, who will take charge of them, see after baggage, and furnish all needful information concerning the journey.\n\nNo Railway in America offers so many accommodations to SECOND CLASS, or COLONIST, Passengers at so little expense as does the CANADIAN PACIFIC. Colonists are able to travel to NEW HOMES IN MANITOBA, the NORTH-WEST, or BRITISH COLUMBIA, with nearly as great comfort as First Class Passengers.\n\nCOLONIST SLEEPING CARS.\n\nThe Cars devoted to the use of Colonists are taken upon the same fast trains with the first-class cars, and every one is a sleeping car, going through WITHOUT CHANGE to the PACIFIC OCEAN. These cars are similar in size, warmth and ventilation to the first class cars, but are not upholstered. The seats are arranged in pairs facing one another on each side of the car, are of comfortable shape, and so made that they can be joined into a berth ready for the spreading of a mattress and bedclothes. Every passenger has a single berth and a ticket is furnished for it EXACTLY the SAME as in FIRST CLASS SLEEPER. Over each pair of seats a broad upper berth, hinged against the wall of the car, can be let down and form an additional sleeping place. No Extra Charge is made for these Sleeping Accommodations; they are a part of the Regular Car. Second Class Passengers, however, must provide their own bedding. If they do not bring it with them, a complete outfit of mattress, pillow, blanket and curtains may be bought of the Agent of the Company at the point of starting at a cost of $2.50. (These articles become the property of the purchaser). The curtains may be hung around the berth, turning it into a little private room. SMOKING IS NOT PERMITTED in any part of this car.\n\nFor further Information apply to\n\nARCHER BAKER,\nEuropean Traffic Agent.\nMap of part of MANITOBA and the NORTH WEST TERRITORIES of CANADA shewing the lines of land grant of the CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY.\n\nNOTE\nThe Company's Lands in part consist of the odd numbered Sections in the Townships coloured Green.\n\nWinnipeg, 1st Jan. 1890.\nLand Commissioner.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_sask_test/P001862.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 28, "total-input-tokens": 54668, "total-output-tokens": 12266, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 547, 1], [547, 547, 2], [547, 4485, 3], [4485, 4485, 4], [4485, 8785, 5], [8785, 8785, 6], [8785, 12780, 7], [12780, 12780, 8], [12780, 17440, 9], [17440, 17440, 10], [17440, 21774, 11], [21774, 21774, 12], [21774, 25980, 13], [25980, 25980, 14], [25980, 32164, 15], [32164, 32164, 16], [32164, 39115, 17], [39115, 39115, 18], [39115, 42032, 19], [42032, 42032, 20], [42032, 46042, 21], [46042, 46042, 22], [46042, 51539, 23], [51539, 51539, 24], [51539, 51539, 25], [51539, 51818, 26], [51818, 51818, 27], [51818, 51818, 28]], "primary_language": ["en", "en", "en", "None", "en", "None", "en", "None", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "None", "en", "None", "None", "en", "None", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true, true, true, true]}}]
