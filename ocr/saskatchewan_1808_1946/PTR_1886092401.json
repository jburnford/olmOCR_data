MAVEETY\n\nPRINCE ALBERT N.W.T.\n\nFRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1886.\n\nTHE GLOBE ON MR. DEWEY'S\n\nThe Globe of August 20th says\u2014\n\n\"Mr. Dewey has been visited by his proposals by nearly everybody with whom he spoke, who, said he, would, if elected, be able to settle the question by means of his contracting friends.\"\n\nAnd when the temperature is about 75\u00b0, and the wind is blowing from the southeast, the odds are that Mr. Dewey will repeat his broadcast charges. We do not know how much of this money will find its way into this district, but certainly it will be very popular, so the water is being approached and the stream is badly needed by many.\n\nOUR ANNUAL EXHIBITION\n\nWe are very happy to announce that our annual exhibition will take place at our usual time next Fall (November 3rd), and we are sure it will be a success.\n\nThe Exhibition Committee have already begun their preparations and they have displayed in securing the necessary funds to offer suitable prizes. What they have done emerges now, however, and we are sure that their efforts will be rewarded. The Exhibition Committee has been working hard to secure funds and we are very pleased to say that they have been very successful.\n\nWAR CLAMS\n\nFrom our despatches it will be seen that the clamor for the balance of the war claims has been answered by the first Commission appointed by the Government. We do not know how much of this money will find its way into this district, but certainly it will be very popular, so the water is being approached and the stream is badly needed by many.\n\nTHE SASKATCHEWAN\n\nThe Battlefield Herald says today\u2014\n\n\"An interception of the irrigation canal by the breaking through of the new channel of the Saskatchewan at the Cut Bank should be prevented by vigorous prosecution of the proposed improvements on both sides.\"\n\nA correspondent of the paper says\u2014\n\n\"It is said that the river could be easily kept in its channel by driving piles in the river bed, thus raising the level of the water and forming an embankment that would contain the water and keep it within proper limits. Also, the banks would need to be raised so that the river would not be able to encroach upon the lands of the neighboring farmers.\"\n\nGeneral Merchants\n\nAND\n\nIndian Traders.\n\nWM.

We'd\nrather see it blame for less.\n\nCan you think of anything more important happening\nthis week that was not in the paper? No,\nyou don't know as you can, but then it\nis my paper, and I'm going to tell you\nsoons. That is the editor's business, he\ngets paid for it. Ha! ha! ha! That's\none good one, isn't it? You can't say\nthat about your paper, can you? Can't\nget over it, can you? Good joke on the\neditor. Guess he'll be careful next\ntime he goes out with you in future. But say, friend,\ndon't you ever stop to think that the village\npaper is only a weekly affair, and that\nyou will let it be? You buy a new\nhouse and put up a house, and see how quickly\nthe paper will go down the drain, and\nif you knew how to fix things up, you\nwould be good at it. Buy a lot on Third\nstreet and put up a three story brick\nblock with glass fronts on the ground floor,\noffice, residence, on the second and third\nfloors. If you could do that, the village\npaper will tell the world what a ter-\nrific man you are, and how far\nseeing you are to put your money\nwhere your mouth is. Being a big\nterror, but prove a grand ornament to the\ntown, and set the Legislature or Con-\ngress, and see if they don't come and\ntell the people all it knows about you.\nHas your great grandmother used to\nsell milk? Has your great grandmother\never been a rag-picker, and how many of your rel-\natives have been hanged or sent to Congress?\nIf so, you may plant your paper in the\njunkyard and forget it. But say, friend,\nare you seeking honors, and that\nthe people will vote to elect you to sit\nin the house of Assembly? Buy a\nplay 100, and see if the paper don't call\nyou a public spirited philanthropist, who\nwill help the poor and needy? You\nwill do his fellowmen most good. Yes,\nthe village is just what you make it, and\nif you don't make it, why help it least.\n\n\u2014Dundas N.Y. Herald.\n\nThe Hudson Bay Railroad schedule is\nstill somewhat in doubt. High Sather\nlastly stated telegram was that he was\nshipping rails on Saturday and that work\nwould begin on Monday, he making the\nfollowing day.\n\nTERRITORIAL NEWS.\n\nThe Lethbridge News says:\n\nA rumor is current in town that a\nparty of six Indians who left the reserve\non Tuesday last, have gone on a\nhunting expedition, left in search\nof game. With whom they had a\nparty of Crows with whom they had a\nfriendly intercourse. The Indians\nwere superior hunters of the Crows and\ncame upon and returned to camp. An\nIndian party of seventy-five which left\nhere some days ago, has not been heard\nfrom, and it is feared they have\nbeen annihilated. We understand\nCrows have been seen near the reserve,\nwhich will be the latter part of this\nweek, a party of 200 still leaving\nbehind. We give this information\nas a man just in from the Blood camp\nand says it is worth, as we are\nunable at the present writing to find out\nanything more reliable.\n\nThe Calgary Tribune says:\n\nMr. Robert Thomson, Mr. Moses, S. A.\nSmith and R. L. Baker were engaged\nputting up hay in one of the township\nfields of this place this morning. A lynx\ncrossing the road in front of them was\nworking. Seeing his rile Mr. Smith\nstarted to pursue. Seeing him advance\nthe lynx started to run, stopping in\nthe grass as if to hiding. He drew\nnearer to the animal it crouched lower\nto the ground, raising his head and\npaws and only its tawny tail was vis-\nible above the grass. When about 15\nfeet away the lynx raised his rile and\nran about 30 feet away. Mr. Smith\nsaid, \"I'll bet you a V you dare not take\na step from your shoulder and walk up\nto the animal.\" Mr. Smith then stepped\nback, and lowering the rile he stepped\nup to the animal. With within a few\nfeet of the animal Mr. Smith fired a\nlightning bound, setting its jaws firmly\nby into his shoulder, and endeavoring\nto pull it off. Mr. Smith dropped his rile\nhe seized it by the neck with\nboth hands and succeeded in holding\nits head down, raising it at a considerable\ndistance from its body. The animal\nstruggled violently, but Mr. Smith\nmaintained his hold until the animal\nwas killed.\n\nNotice.\n\nA SALE OF CAST HORSES\n\nBelonging to the N.W.M.P., will take place at Qu'Appelle Station, ON Friday, the 15th of October Next.\n\nBy Order,\n\nW.
