This comes in 40 gallon barrels; and one gallon is sufficient to cover from 80 to 100 square feet. To use this gum, with 2 or 3 ply roofing, to re-roof the school verandah, would cost approximately $40.00.\n\nNo quotation was obtained on the cost of the casting required for the washing machine, as Messrs Stanley Brock Ltd had to write to the factory for this.\n\nThe foregoing quotations, apparently, do not include the following items shown on the list forwarded to the Department with my letter of the 17th April:\n\n- 2 - Hollow Iron Posts for the class room.\n- 3 - Quarts Pyrene Liquid\n- 4 - Acid & Soda refills, 2\u00bd gal.\n   No; 14 copper wire, lamp cord, toggle switches, rosettes, cleats, screws &c;\n   1 - Gase Glass 12 X 10\n   1 - \" \" 12 X 14\n   1 - C \" \" 12 X 20\n   and the 'Corbin' Door Checks.\n\nI may say that the four section wall radiator, shown on the 4th page of the requisition, was deleted, and does not figure in any of the foregoing quotations.\n\nIt will be seen therefore, that the foregoing quotations considerably exceed the amounts appropriated for the various works as per your letter of the 4th May, with the exception of the furnishings for the staff rooms, which can be procured for $21.00 less than the amount appropriated. The school Principal, Rev. R.T. Chapin states that the drag harrows can be eliminated, as they are not of very great importance for this year now.\n\nIt is difficult to say what, if anything, can be deleted from the requisition in order to reduce it, as everything asked for is of considerable importance. However, the order of importance might be shown as follows:\n\n- Engine Repairs & Plumbing Repairs & Tools.\n- Re-wiring the building (To reduce fire hazard)\n- Painting exteriors of buildings\n- Paint for interior of building\n- Lumber, Firebrick, Cement & Ten Test\n- Furnishings for staff rooms.\n\nI shall be glad if, after reviewing the foregoing, the Department will advise me what work may be undertaken.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

Among other improvements required, it is necessary to overhaul the hot water heating system for the laundry, baths, etc., at an estimated cost of $275.00. Mr. Agent Waite, Portage la Prairie, has forwarded a quotation obtained by the Principal of the School from J. W. Rames, Plumber and Fitter, Portage la Prairie, for supplying any materials required and the labour, installing same. Mr. Waite states that he considers the work in the repairing and alterations to the hot water heating system to be very necessary and urgent.\n\nI should be pleased to be advised if it would be satisfactory to have Mr. Rames do the work or to receive the names of other plumbers in the city of Portage la Prairie, who should be asked to estimate on the work. At the present time, the school is without hot water for laundry and bathing purposes.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMr. J. D.

One thing which could be done immediately would be to fit the kitchen range with coils and a good-sized tank, adequate to supply hot water for the kitchen. It seems rather strange that he did not attend to an absolute essential like that before some of the other major changes which he has made since he took over the School.\n\nI wonder why we should not put the steam boiler in the laundry into action rather than move it to the basement and use it as a hot water heater. I cannot remember just at the moment where the laundry is located in the Portage School, but the new system which has been installed at Mameey works so admirably that I am wondering why we could not use this to provide hot water - not only for the laundry - but for the rest of the building. Meanwhile, Mr. Jones must have a tank, with a small jacket heater underneath it. Supplying him with a jacket heater as a temporary measure, as was done at Norway House, while we work out the whole problem would seem to be the logical thing to do.

(RG 10, Volume 6273, file 583-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of Department Letter 127-1-5 dated May 6th, together with telegram of same date. This work is now under way.\n\nHowever, it was found that the upright boiler needed a complete new set of flues, consequently this increased the cost. Mr. McKay, Mr. Weite, and myself went carefully into the situation at the Portage la Prairie School and we are convinced that, with the changes anticipated, the school will be furnished with abundance of hot water, at the lowest possible cost. The material and labour will cost approximately $350. I informed Mr. Jones, Principal of the school, that this amount would be deducted from the $475 allowed for repairs to the cow barn and implement shed.\n\nI might just add that in my opinion the repairs requested are not urgently needed, other than that six extra stanchions be provided and properly installed to accommodate more cattle. Mr. Jones is anxious to have the city water connected with the stables. However, this is not necessary as he at present has a good well inside the barn.\n\nAs soon as the work is completed, the vouchers will be forwarded to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to Department Letter 127-1-5 dated May 6th, and to say that the repairs required for the balcony at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School should be carried out this year. It is in a dilapidated condition and needs to be raised and made level. The floors need renewing and the front should be fitted with windows and screens. This balcony is on the cold side of the building and, when properly repaired, will no doubt reduce considerably the cost of heating.\n\nMr. Jones, the Principal, is a first class carpenter and I have no doubt that the full amount of $800 will be required to make the necessary repairs. He states he is willing to supervise the work, but is of the opinion that a first class carpenter should be hired as he himself has other duties to attend to and could not be present all the time.\n\nMr. Jones is anxious to start the work at once and I would request that the necessary authority be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nMay 28, 1936.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nIt is intended to carry out the following work, for which funds are provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School (Electoral District of Portage la Prairie), Man.:-\n\nRepairs to balcony - $500.\n\nSupplying paint, varnish, etc., for interior decorating - $100.\n\nMr. Inspector Hamilton states that the balcony at this school is in a dilapidated condition and needs to be raised and made level, that the floors require renewing and the front fitted with windows and screens. This balcony is on the cold side of the building, and, when repaired, the cost of heating would be considerably reduced.\n\nThe Principal is a first-class carpenter and he states he is willing to supervise the work but requests the services of a carpenter to assist him.\n\nI would request your authority to incur an expenditure of $500 in repairing the balcony and purchasing paint, to the amount of $100, and I shall be pleased to receive the name of a competent carpenter to assist the Principal in carrying out the repairs.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir:\n\nAttached is a rough sketch of the septic tank and outlet in connection with the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School.\n\nThe syphon should be renewed at once. The pipe line leading from the septic tank to the lake shore should be uncovered; one branch is useless and the indications are that the pipe on the other branch is liable to give way at any time. If the pipe needs to be renewed, I would recommend that it be extended from the septic tank straight to the lake shore, as indicated on the enclosed sketch.\n\nThis work will probably cost $150. to $200. and should be carried out as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, May 29, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 208-11A U of the 21st instant, with sketch showing the proposed new outlet from the septic tank at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School and stating the work required and the probable cost.\n\nIn connection with the septic tank, the Department has had correspondence with the Department of Health and Public Welfare, Manitoba, also a report dated March 11th, last, from Mr. D. B. Gow, District Engineer, Dominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau, regarding the discharge from the tank into Crescent Lake. He reported that, after discussing the situation with the Chief Sanitary Inspector, Department of Health and Public Welfare of the Province, the attitude of the Inspector was that the sewage disposal plant met the requirements of the Manitoba Department of Health and that there was little ground for the complaint made by the town of Portage la Prairie.\n\nIt is hoped, if the new outlet is made, as suggested by you, that there would be no objection from the Health authorities or the town of Portage la Prairie in having the sewage from the tank continue to enter the lake. However, before the Department is prepared to authorize any expenditure in renewing the pipeline with a new outlet, it is considered advisable that you refer the matter to Mr. Gow and obtain his report and also his opinion concerning what should be done in placing the sewage disposal system at the school in good condition, with an estimate of the cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

You should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, for all material and accounts, in triplicate, for the labour, stating the number of days or hours employed and the rate paid.

R. Russell, clerk at the Portage La Prairie Agency in which he states the $300 allowed for material and work in connection with the veranda has all been spent and it will require $60 more to complete the work. Mr. Jones, the Principal, has requested that the $60 needed be taken from the $100 allowed for paint, and I would recommend that this be granted. The other fifty could be used to purchase paint, and the labor can be done by the staff members. I would like to be assured by the Department that it will be in order to allow Mr. Jones and the staff to do the painting rather than employ Mr. Garnier as suggested, otherwise the balance of $50 will be of no value.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, August 5, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the first instant, the Department will allow an additional amount of $50.00 in order to complete the verandah at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School. The painting should be carried out as previously instructed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, September 9, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 208-11A U., of the 4th instant, enclosing copy of a report from the Acting District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power and Hydroelectric Bureau, Winnipeg, which deals with the condition of the septic tank at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted the Engineer is of opinion, if temporary repairs are made at the present time, that the present sewage disposal system will carry the school through the coming winter. In this connection I have to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure, not exceeding $125.00, in carrying out the temporary work suggested by the Engineer. All costs should be kept to the lowest possible point. When the work is completed, itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of any materials and labour, should be forwarded. Regarding any extra labour that it may be necessary to employ, over and above what can be performed by the school staff, full particulars should be stated on the vouchers, giving number of days or hours employed and rate paid.\n\nWe have noted, for inclusion in our Estimates for the next fiscal year, an item to cover the cost of installing a new sewage disposal system, for the amount as estimated by the Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nAugust 31, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nAs requested by you I visited the Portage la Prairie Indian School in connection with complaints from the school management as regards the sewage disposal system. The Principal was absent upon the occasion of my first visit but at a later date I was able to contact him.\n\nAs you are aware, the sewage disposal layout at this school is quite old; there are no drawings showing the installation and it appears impossible to obtain reliable data regarding what the system really consists of. The School Management, during the winter of 1935-36, were obliged, on account of the backing up of sewage into the school, to excavate down to the pipes leading both into and from the septic tank, clean out the same and upon numerous occasions had to clean out the septic tank.\n\nFrom our own observations and those of the present Principal of the school, it would appear that the sewage situation at the Institution is as follows:\n\nRoof drainage does not pass through the septic tank and is not drained into Crescent Lake. Laundry and kitchen drainage flows with the sewage into the septic tank in one outlet from the school. There are two manholes giving access to this discharge line between school and septic tank but there is no screen in front of the septic tank. The tank itself of concrete is divided into two parts with a 6\" opening between the two. Information is not available as to the size of the tank or as to what is in the syphon portion of the chamber. A manhole gives access to the settling part of the tank but there is no means of access to the syphon chamber. I do not know whether or not a syphon was ever installed in the syphon chamber but in any case there is now none in operation. I understand there are no baffles in the settling chamber and that in reality the whole tank is one chamber insofar as action is concerned. The syphon chamber has never been cleaned out, there being no means of access - it is probably filled with solid matter, even to the extent of blocking the entrance and exit to the chamber. There are two outlets from the syphon chamber, one of which is completely blocked with solids. The other outlet had a broken pipe joining the tank and it was blocking at this outlet that created much trouble last winter. Apparently these two outlets unite before being discharged above the water line into Crescent Lake. Upon the occasion of my last visit August 20th, to the school, there was a strong disagreeable odor from the discharge extending even to the entrance to the school.\n\nThe troubles experienced last winter will probably again occur this coming winter unless remedial measures are undertaken. The trouble probably lies in the blocking of the syphon chamber and the two outlets. Cleaning out of the syphon chamber, opening up the blocked\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\noutlet and replacing broken pipe in the other outlet will probably eliminate trouble during the coming winter. To gain access to the siphon chamber it may be necessary to break down the wall between the two parts of the tank. This wall serves no useful purpose under present conditions anyway.\n\nI would suggest, as a temporary measure, that the siphon chamber be cleaned out and that the two outlets be opened up near the tank and be put in working condition. However, the sewage disposal system at this school is obsolete and in view of the frequent complaints from Portage la Prairie residents, it is advisable to modernize the system next summer holidays. I would suggest that the laundry and kitchen wastes be segregated in the building and be drained directly past the septic tank, that a new and enlarged septic tank be constructed with settling basin, siphon chamber and siphon. I would also suggest the lowering of the outlet drain from septic tank to lake so that the outlet is at or below the water level.\n\nIt will probably cost $100.00 to $125.00 to carry out the temporary work suggested now and $1,650.00 to modernize the disposal system next year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD. B. Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nIn reply to Department Letter 127-1-5 dated May 29th, I now enclose copy of a report received from Mr. Gow of the Dominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau, which deals with the condition of the septic tank at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Gow is of the opinion that temporary repairs can be made which will carry the school through the coming winter. The cost, I am sure, can be kept within Mr. Gow's estimate.\n\nI think provision should be made in the 1937-38 Estimates to cover the cost of a new disposal system. Mr. Gow sets this figure at approximately $1650.\n\nI would like to be advised at once if the necessary repairs may be proceeded with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJe tiens \u00e0 joindre le rapport de forme sur le syst\u00e8me d'export de l'Hotel de M. La P.

G 400-1-2-7-8-9.\n\nThese vouchers exceed the amount allowed\nby the sum of $305.52\n\nThe additional cost above the amount es-\ntimated, is due to lumber expenditure and paint.\nThe cost of labour is approximately correct.\n\nOn the 20th of July, a check of expen-\nditure was made, and at that time a further\namount of $50.00 was asked for, to offset the\ncost of additional labour. At the time of the\ncheck up, I was informed by Messrs Gibb, McCaig\nand Eliwood that their account would be approx-\nimately $500.00.\n\nThe flashing of the valleys and leads on\nthe balconies was very necessary, and was also\nadditional to the initial estimate. It was the\nintention of the Principal to purchase the paint\nout of the $100.00 allowed for interior decorating.\nI would not sanction this, as the $100.00 was\nset out for a definite purpose.\n\nThere is no doubt that the verandah should\nhave been painted on completion, and the labour\nof painting was done by the school staff.\n\nI would further advise that no tender was\ncalled for the bill of lumber.

As the work to be done is inside it is thought that it might be continued this Fall to advantage.\n\nWill you kindly let me have a report in regard to the painting and also in regard to the repairs to the balcony? Would you suggest that any additional money be spent on this school this year?\n\nW.J.F.

The local Agent states the extra cost, above the estimate, was due to more lumber being required and also to the installing of flashing on the valleys and leads on the balconies and the painting that was carried out after the work was completed.\n\nIn view of the additional cost of the balconies, the Agent would not approve of the expenditure of $100 being incurred by the Principal in the purchase of paint for interior decoration. We can provide funds, to the amount of $100, in the purchase of paint and are informing the local Indian Agent accordingly. He is being instructed to arrange for the purchase of paint, varnish, etc., to that amount, for the purpose of interior decorating.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nIndian Affairs.

According to the vouchers forwarded by you, the two carpenters - Moffatt and Elwood - were paid at the rate of 65\u00a2 per hour and Stanley Bugg, \"for labour as labourer\", at 35\u00a2 per hour. Bugg states that he received a very small wage for carpenter work and does not think he received a fair remuneration.\n\nI would request that you will state the difference in work performed by Bugg, in comparison with the other two men and also if he received the prevailing rate of wages for the work he performed.

The building is steam heated. The boiler, while old, is stated to be in fair condition. Wood is used as fuel.\n\nConsiderable expenditure was incurred at this school during the present fiscal year in carrying out repairs and painting and the Department has made no provision, in the Estimates for the coming fiscal year, for renewing heating equipment. The local Indian Agent is being requested to furnish a report regarding the condition of the present heating system at the school and the cost of any repairs or renewals that may be required. I may add that Mr. Inspector Hamilton, who submitted a list of the requirements of the Principal, for inclusion in our Estimates for the next fiscal year, makes no reference to any expenditure being required in improving the heating system.\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nTo: Rev.

G 702, amounting to $30.00 in favour of Rev. J. Jones, Principal, Indian Residential School, PORTAGE LA PRAIRIE, Manitoba, for Grant towards salary of night watchman, Indian Res. School, for the month of December 1936. Allotment 2 Sub-allotment 260.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 126-1-5 dated September 29th 1936.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 518\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nWINNIPEG, MAN., January 11th, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 21st, and to say that I had occasion to be in Portage la Prairie on January 6th, on which date I inspected the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School.\n\nWhen a wind is blowing, it is indeed very difficult to heat the building. However, this is not altogether the fault of the furnace as the building is old and out in the open where there is no protection.\n\nThe boiler is put out by the Schwab Heating Company, but, although old, appears to be in good condition. It no doubt consumes more fuel than the more modern type of boiler. Last year a blower attachment was supplied and this makes it possible to obtain a very hot fire.\n\nThe fire box is large and I am sure, when I examined the furnace, there were at least 200 lbs. of coal on the fire and this was a blazing mass such as one might find when a forge is being operated.\n\nIn spite of this fire, the dormitories on the north and west side of the building were extremely cold. It would be impossible for one to sit down and spend any time in the dormitory. I am sure the children find it very cold in the morning when they get up to dress. The windows are supplied.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nare supplied with outside sash, but there is still a lot of cold air admitted. It would improve the condition to fit another storm sash on the inside. However, as the windows are quite large and numerous, this would entail considerable expense.\n\nThe ceiling of the dormitories consist of common boards nailed to the joists and covered with tin. The ceiling must be 18 ft. high at least and I am sure a lot of the heat escapes in this way. There is a long hall running through the centre of the building and the ceiling of this hall, together with the ceiling over all the closets, is 4 ft. lower than the ceiling of the dormitories. The wall of the dormitories along this 4 ft. space is lath and plaster and there is no doubt what heat there is goes to the top of the room and gets out through this thin coat of plaster. These walls should be sided and insulated. I am also of the opinion that it would pay to insulate the ceiling of the dormitories. The work could easily be carried out by the Principal and the shavings and lime necessary would not run into a large amount of money. The electric wiring is all enclosed in pipe, so there would be no danger of a fire.\n\nUp to the present time they have burned 100 tons of coal, costing $455, and Mr. Jones, the Principal, states it will cost at least another $700. Last year the total cost for fuel was $1500. The reduction this year we figure is partly due to the milder weather this fall and to the improvement made when the verandahs were enclosed on the west side of the school. I have no doubt the cost of heating could be considerably reduced if the above improvements were carried out and I feel this should be done, even though a new furnace were being installed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nOttawa, January 15, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your very complete report regarding the heating of the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School.\n\nI regret that our funds at the present time do not permit favourable consideration being given to the installation of a new furnace.\n\nI am interested in the suggestion contained in the sixth paragraph of your letter, and you might let me know the approximate cost of the material that would be required to carry out your recommendation. On receipt of this information, we will decide if funds are available.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. G.

Eaton Co. Ltd.\n\nIt will take approximately 1,050 bags of wood wool at 25\u00a2 per bag F.O.B. Winnipeg, and the freight charge will be approximately $40., a total of $262.50. In addition, almost 1,000 ft. of shiplap will be required. This can be purchased locally for about $30. per thousand feet.\n\nMr. Jones requests that a floor be laid after the insulation has been applied. This is not necessary but would provide a storeroom. It would require 9,500 B.F. of shiplap to cover the ceiling joists.\n\nEaton's will need about one month's notice in advance of delivery.\n\nI would appreciate the Department's instructions in reference to this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

In addition, our funds are so limited at the present time that it is not possible to consider an expenditure of, approximately, $300., for which special provision had not previously been made.\n\nYou might write again in connection with this matter some time during the coming summer and, if funds can be secured for the purpose, the work could be done before next winter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Allotment 2 Sub-allotment 260\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\n\nLetter No. 126-1-5 dated September 29th 1936.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nof Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. 518\nPortage la Prairie\n9th March 1917\n\nR. H. Henry\nIndian Agent\nAlta.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIndian Res. School R.H.P.\n\nEarly in this winter I wrote you as to the defects in the heating of this building. I suggested that the doors and windows were in much need of the attention of an experienced general Carpenter and that the ceiling in particular should be insulated.\n\nAn Inspector presumably from the Dept. of Public Works visited the building in January of this year. I did not see him of course as his visit was made in the day time. I understand he suggested that the ceiling should be insulated. Subsequently I am informed the Superintendent of the School was asked to measure the area of the ceiling which I presume was done.\nI think I mentioned before that the steam pipe arrangement is defective in so much as that the live steam supplies the sheltered part of the building and the exposed part yet what is left over after heating the sheltered portions that on a cold night to get heat to the part that needs it involves overheating the sheltered.\n\nThe system might be named a modified single-return. I would suggest that it should be still further modified.\n\nMy suggestion have been with a view to securing for the children some degree of comfort and a reduction of the cost of that comfort.\n\nWhat I have already put forward if carried out will do so in cold weather. There is the circumstance of the mild weather to be taken care of. To meet this I make this suggestion which will also to some degree take care of this overheating of the sheltered part.\n\nRun a feed pipe from the capota or steam chest to the return pipe where it descends to the rear bottom of the boiler.\nThe steam pipe on leaving the Cepola goes straight into the kitchen; there it branches out past joints north, the other going south. As it proceeds, it becomes a water pipe returning the condensed steam to the boiler. Up to the point where the two pipes descend to the bottom of the boiler they are well above the top of the boiler.\n\nI propose that these two pipes should be also steam pipes, as well as water pipes. A new feed from the Cepola to each of these pipes just before they bend to descend will have the effect of putting two steam where none yet now is, to the radiators in the two hospital wards and the nurses' rooms. They will also have the effect of giving steam to the N.W. and S.W. dormitories without the extra pressure that overheats the East side of the building.\n\nIn mild weather it will enable the heating to be done as a \"Vapor\" installation at greatly reduced cost.\n\nThe cost to make this slight alteration or rather addition to the piping should not be great and will be saved in the future winter fuel bill.\n\nYours truly,\n\nWm. E. Harris\nOttawa, March 13th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nEnclosed is a copy of a letter received from Wm. B. Laird, who is, apparently, a member of the staff at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School.\n\nThis letter refers to the same matter as was discussed in our previous correspondence with you and, when replying to official letter of the 12th ultimo, you might include a report regarding Mr. Laird's suggestions. If you approve of them, you should supply an estimate of the cost of putting them into effect.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEnc. 1s.\n\nS. J. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nMarch 17th, 1937\n\nSir,\n\nRe: 127-1-5,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 13th., instant, also enclosed, a copy of letter received by the Department from the night watchman of the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, in reference to certain improvements to the heating system at the said school. In reply I beg to advise that I am not in receipt of any previous correspondence in this matter, and would be pleased to receive a copy of the correspondence dated the 12th, ultimo.\n\nAt the present time the Principal is at the Brandon Fair, and on his return a steam fitter will be taken to the school to look over this work, and an estimate forwarded to the Department as soon as received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Superintendent,\nWelfare and Training,\nIndian Branch Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIndian Residential School,\nPortagela Prairie, Man.,\nMarch 8th, 1937.\n\nJ. Waite Esq.,\nIndian Agent.\n\nDear Mr. Waite,\n\nYou will remember that I requisitioned for two sewing machines and one heavier tailor machine. These three were delivered, but I am informed by the local Agent of the Singer Sewing Machine Co., that only two have been paid for, one ordinary machine and the tailor machine. We need these three machines and I shall be grateful if the Department will pay the Singer Co. for the machine.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) Joseph Jones.\nMarch 18,\n1937.\n\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nSir,\n\nThe attached is a copy of a letter received recently from the Principal, Portage Indian Residential School, and concerns a purchase of sewing machines by the Department from the local agency of the Singer Sewing Machine Company.\n\nThree machines were requisitioned by the Reverend Principal, under cover of my letter of the 25th of January 1936. The requisition was for machines as follows:\n\nOne - No. 31-K-20, and two - No. 127-3-2.\n\nDepartment letter, 127-1-5, dated Ottawa, February 3rd., 1936 advised me that three machines were being supplied, for use at the school, the order being placed from Ottawa. Apparently two machines were purchased, and Voucher No. F.683, in an amount of $114.06 was forwarded to the Department. The Principal evidently took delivery of three machines, and the Department authority stated above, covered this number. The Agent of the Sewing Machine Company is not in the district, and his return is not expected for some time. For this reason, I am unable to get in touch with him to see what his contract calls for, - two or three machines. If the Department ordered the delivery of three machines, then I cannot account for the delay in his forwarding of the account.\n\nWill you please advise if I am to submit a voucher for the additional machine, which amounts to $35.07.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs, Branch,\nOttawa, March 23rd, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the sewing machines supplied in February, 1936, for use at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, and also enclosing copy of a communication which you received from the Principal regarding payment for three machines.\n\nIn reply I would say that the order which was placed with the Singer Sewing Machine Company was for two machines - one No. 31-K-15 and one No. 2 - 127-3 - and payment was made for these machines. If three machines were delivered, the Company had no authority to supply this number, and the Principal will have to be responsible for payment of the extra machine.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nMarch 31,\n1937.\n\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nSir,\n\nRe: 127-1-5.\n\nIn reference to your letter of the 13th instant, file above noted, in connection with suggested improvements to the heating system, Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, I beg to advise that on the 20th I visited the school with Mr. G. MacKay, Steamfitter of Portage la Prairie. I had Mr. Laird also at the school, so that he could make his suggestions personally. Mr. MacKay is of the opinion that the change in the heating system, as suggested by Mr. Laird, is not workable, but before condemning the scheme he will have the opinion of an expert, who is expected in the district early in the month of April. As soon as I am in receipt of the expert's report, I will again advise.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Superintendent,\nWelfare and Training Branch,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** Rev.

This damaged the firebox, ash pit and burn of the left hand section, past repairing. The top of the range is still in good shape.\n\nIt will need a new range boss top.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. S. McKay.\nDear Mr. Weite,\n\nFurther to our conversation on the phone this morning, re explosion in the kitchen range.\n\nThe explosion occurred about 6:45 this morning; the water jacket in the end fire box blew up and wrecked that end of the range. Fortunately no one was seriously hurt; one girl, Rosie McKinnie received a small bruise and a slight burn.\n\nMr. Gordon McKay is dismantling the wrecked part in preparation to the new part that will be required.\n\nI would suggest that we ask Mr. Norton to see the Gurney people in Winnipeg about replacing part of range.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nJoseph Jones\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report received from Rev. J. Jones, Principal, Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, in regard to an explosion in the water jacket of the cook stove. The explosion wrecked the greater part of the stove and a new stove is required. Windows were broken in the kitchen, but no one was seriously hurt. The girl who was bruised and burnt is attending school again, in fact she was not laid up. I asked Mr. J.G. MacKay to dismantle the water jacket and advise me of the cause. A report is herewith attached from Mr. MacKay. I again interviewed Mr. MacKay this date and even yet he cannot understand the cause of the explosion as the mass of corrosion was of a soft nature. The jacket has been again connected to the two sections of the cook stove, and I am assured that an accident of the same nature cannot happen again with the new connection.\n\nA new stove is required, as the two sections at present in use are not sufficient, and I enclose a cut of the stove furnished by the Gurney Company Limited together with their prices.\n\nAs this stove is very necessary will you kindly telegraph instructions to Mr. Inspector Hamilton, Winnipeg. I am forwarding him a copy of all correspondence so that he will be familiar with the situation. I am asking this as I shall be away from the office towards the end of the current week, paying treaty.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch;\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, June 15th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the explosion in the water jacket of the cook stove at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School. In view of your recommendation, the Department approves the purchase of a new stove at a cost of $148.52.\n\nFor your personal information, I may say that the sum of $300 was provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and replacements at the Portage la Prairie School. The expenditure of $148.52 for the stove will reduce the amount available for any other work that might be necessary to $151.48.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nS. J.

An amount of $148.52 has already been expended in the purchase of a stove. This leaves a balance of $151.48 to be expended at this school. Under these circumstances, it is not possible to consider the installation of a new septic tank or insulating the walls.

Approximately half this amount has already been expended. Today we received a letter from the Agent enclosing requests from the Principal for improvements to the sewage and heating systems amounting, approximately, to $10,000. Included in these requests is one for air-conditioning the building. The Department is rather surprised to receive such requests, and Mr. Waite is being informed that there are no funds available.\n\nWhen you next visit the Portage La Prairie Indian Residential School you should look over the building carefully and advise me what repairs you consider are absolutely necessary, in order that the necessary funds may be provided in the appropriation for the next fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

He told me that only $600.00 had been allotted to the Portage la Prairie School and they were badly in need of some repairs and of having some other work done, particulars of which had been sent to the Department.\n\nI explained what the financial situation was and that we had been unable to get the amount I would have liked for Indian administration but that, possibly, if revenues improve, we might be able to do better next year.\n\nHe explained that he would like to have a work-shop to carry on vocational training and gave me some instances of results which had come to Indian boys whom he had been able to help in a vocational way. I asked him to write fully to Mr. Hoey, giving him particulars of what he had in mind and mentioning the fact that he had briefly discussed it with me.\n\nJones impressed me as rather a practical chap and as being very much interested in Indian welfare work.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, August 26th, 1937.\n\nDr. H.W.

H 375,\n\namounting to $148.52 in favour\n\nof Gurney North West Foundry Co., Ltd., WINNIPEG, Man.\n\nfor Only unit for left hand end of range at the Portage la Prairie Residential School, as per account attached.\n\nCode: 52-2199\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\n\nLetter No. 127-1-5 dated June 15th 1937.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nof Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. 518\nIndian Residential School\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nSep. 9th 1937\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am forwarding to you an outline of our recent conversation re-Repairs, Improvements & Equipment for this school.\n\nFirst. Consideration of increasing grant from 90 to 100 pupils this year. During the past two years I have been caring for additional pupils above the grant earning pupils. At present I have 54 boys & 46 girls in residence and 6 others wanting to come in. I have already discharged 12 this quarter. There are many more children on the four reserves that ought to be in this or some other school. To reduce our pupilage by sending ten of these children home would be a great injustice to them.\n\nSecond. The heating system is very unsatisfactory. We do not get the heat and comfort from the amount of fuel used. The engineer who examined the plant at the request of the Department submitted an estimate which was forwarded to the Department. The boiler inspector was here on August 10th and reported \"Renew Front Manhole front, Repair front and sides brickwork which is in very bad shape.\"\n\nThird. Repairs to leaking roof. New valley flashings required. If this is not done soon the valley rafters will rot and let down the roof.\n\nFourth. Carpenter and repair shop required at once in order to begin Manual Instruction classes, and also to provide facilities for repairing and overhauling machinery during the winter months. The practical instruction in all forms of mechanics for these boys is the best type of education.\n\nFifth. Insulating of ceiling in school and grouting of all window frames. Estimated cost for insulation $350.00 Grouting $74.00\n\nSixth. Water bowls and connections for barn. Estimated cost $134.35\nSeven. Electric refrigeration. Estimate already sent in to the Department.\n\nEight. New Septic Tank and connecting sewer. I am sure there will be objections from the City and Municipal authorities to the present state of the disposal entering Crescent Lake.\n\nNine. Replacement of team which died from the disease (Encephalitis) which is destroying so many horses in Manitoba. Estimated cost for team $350.00. May I remind the Department that I have had to purchase 6 head of horses and 21 Jersey Cows during the past two years and I cannot spend any more of my grant in replacing stock.\n\nI have outlined our needs in the order of their urgency and I trust you will give them your best and early consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph Jones\n\nRev. Joseph Jones\nPrincipal\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, September 15, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a list of repairs submitted to the Department for consideration by the Principal of the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School.\n\nI may state that Mr. Jones discussed these items with me, personally, when he visited Ottawa a few weeks ago. It is not at all likely that we shall be able to secure an amount of money sufficient to undertake these repairs during the coming fiscal year. I would like, however, if you would visit this institution at your convenience and let me have your recommendation with respect to the repairs that, in your judgment, are most urgently needed. Mr. Jones also expressed the opinion that the farm attached to the school is too small and that an additional quarter section, at least, should be purchased. You might, in your report, let me know if, in your judgment, additional land is necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. G.

MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nS. J. White, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter 127-1-5 dated September 15th, I will deal with each request as listed -\n\n1. - The heating system is old but Mr. Jones' estimate of $75.00 to $100.00 will do the necessary repair work. This is urgently needed.\n\n2. - New valley flashings required and the work should be carried out this fall. Will probably cost $75.00 to $100.00.\n\n3. - Already have a building to meet this need. Attached is a small sketch showing the building and location.\n\n4. - This building is really very cold, especially the dormitories and if at all possible, I would recommend the insulation. Cost approximately $350.00.\n\n5. - Well and pump in the barn - equipment not urgent.\n\n6. - Refrigeration should be estimated for. Only material and electrical equipment needed as Mr. Jones can build the box.\n\n7. - No serious complaints from anyone. Mr. Jones appears most concerned. Should be in the estimates for next year. It will cost at least $1500.00.\n\n8. - Mr. Jones now wants his gas engine replaced instead of the team. The present engine is 20 years old and would bring about $100.00. A new engine will cost $1100.00. A good team can be purchased now for $275.00 but will higher in the spring.\n\nThe question of more land is one for the Department to decide. The land desired by the principal lies across the lake from the school. It will likely be expensive and when purchased Mr. Jones will immediately want money to build a bridge across; probably three to five hundred dollars. If a fifty acre block adjoining the school farm could be purchased I would recommend it, providing the price is fair but beyond this I am not prepared to go.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6273, file 583-5, part 6)\nMr. Jones is firmly of the opinion, because he has one hundred pupils in residence, he should receive a grant for one hundred. His allowance is $90. I pointed out that no principal should take it upon himself to enroll more children than his allotted number. The dormitories have perhaps sufficient cubic feet of air space but this is ruined by the extremely high ceiling - 15 ft. The floor space of two dormitories is 756 sq. feet each and for the other two 650 sq. feet each. It is also impossible to walk between the beds except sideways. The building is poorly constructed and in my opinion, it would be impossible to control a fire if one occurred. Overcrowding would increase the risk and I am not prepared to make the recommendation.\n\nAs an alternative, and for your consideration, I present the following - a new day school on the Long Plain Reserve, costing perhaps $2000.00 - very little more than one year's grant for ten pupils. If this was carried out there would be no waiting list for the Portage school and no need for more farm land. The Indians of Long Plain are doing very well and many would welcome having their children come attending a good day school.\n\nI believe a decision must soon be made either to increase the outlay and pupils at Portage or build day schools. A day school at Long Plain would perhaps help to decide the problem.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

He points out that it is a much larger job than suggested by the principal. It would mean that a large portion of the roof would have to be opened to allow for the entering of the valley's edges, and if cold weather should come with the roof open, it would be impossible to heat the school. It would also be impossible for a man to work on the roof in extreme cold or stormy weather.\n\nHe also points out that a large portion of the eave troughing will have to be renewed and estimates that the work will cost at least $500.00. Mr. Waite recommends that the work be held over until April next year and a larger sum of money authorized, in order that a thoroughly satisfactory job may be carried out.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

The matter will have to rest until the weather moderates, and I suggest it be left in obeyance until the month of March.\"\n\nOn the 12th instant I received Mr. Hamilton's reply asking that I write the Department direct and in the meantime I have again seen the manager of Messrs. Cadham Hardware Co., in connection with a bill of materials required, and am informed that the man who made the estimate of the work was not permanently in the firm's employ and at present he cannot get in touch with him. The Manager claims that the estimating for the material required is a lengthy job and dangerous at this time of the year. He advised me that he would do his best to locate the man who made the estimate, and if this is not possible, the matter would have to be left in obeyance until early spring. I might say that there is no other firm in town who would give an estimate at this season of the year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nPortage la Prairie, Man., Jan. 14, 1937\n\nM.

We discussed this quite fully in your house recently and so I am pretty well conversant with the ideas which you present. Just as soon as I have an opportunity I will discuss this matter with Mr. Hoey and see if he is at all interested.\n\nI was going to say that if your suggestion had the support of Mr. Jones, Superintendent, it would have additional support. I presume, however, he is fully in accord with your suggestion.\n\nMrs. Leader and I are quite established in our little apartment where she does her own housekeeping. We are quite comfortable in spite of the weather which is very changeable, alternating rain with snow and hard frost. The streets are very slippery, but we manage to paddle around some way.\n\nWith kind regards to you and yours,\n\nI remain-\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHarry Leader, M.P.\nHarry Leader by Int.\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed in my letter today about the Indian School.\n\nI have not succeeded in securing the name of the inspector who was first sent to inspect the school and suggested insulation\u2014but I am of the impression it was Thomson.\n\nI know it is structurally feasible to make the slight change I suggest\u2014I experimented at my own expense, and my finding was verified by Gordon McKay at the time of the second inspection\u2014which was the first time the heating plant was really looked at\u2014\n\nSo far as I know the repairs & the windows were never considered possibly because of the very mild weather prevailing at the times of the inspection.\n\nI hope, for the sake of these poor kids you can prevail on the authorities to put their feet in the air and do things which is right by them unfortunate.\n\nI got the first of the newspapers today\u2014thanks.\n\nYour very truly,\n\nWm. S. Laird\n\nP.S. I wish you would send me a copy of the new proposal.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6273, file 583-5, part 6)\nDear Sir,\n\nIndian School\n\nA year ago I wrote Mr. Hoey concerning the condition of the Indian School here and of the advanced almost cruel imposition on the helpless Indian children (about 100 of them) who as inmates are compelled to sleep in the dormitories provided.\n\nI pointed out that the run down condition of the windows permitted the wind to blow across the rooms which is no joking matter when the temperature is down below zero and often 30\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 below as it was during the past two winters of this winter so far it has been mild with little wind.\n\nThe building is steam heated (low pressure). The heating plant as constructed is inadequate and on cold nights the steam rarely reaches the dormitories in the N.W., S.W. corners, and one might say never reaches the Hospital ward.\n\nThe ventilation is what might be termed a modified \"single return\" plant etc. It is doubtless\nreturn\" as to the main steam pipe and \"single return\" as to two series to the individual radiators.\n\nAs a result of my representations an inspector was sent from Winnipeg. He arrived for his \"inspection\" when the weather was fine and mild almost a thaw. I understand the main total of his inspection was a suggestion that the ceiling of the upper floor might be insulated.\n\nNothing about the windows or the heating plant. No conditions of this inspection would not, could no show up the defects, so no report.\n\nI again wrote Mr. Hoey\u2014this resulted in a more thorough inspection, but it was made under fine spring weather conditions\u2014a further inspection was made and I understand a report was made that called for a large capital expenditure.\n\nThe net result of these 3 inspections is that the only repairs made in 1987 was replacement of damage done to the south range.\nApart from the welfare of the children, the condition of the building and heating plant is such that at least a third of the cost might be that some nights half of the cost of heating is money thrown away\u2014some $500.\n\nI suggested to Mr. Hoey that a carpenter should be hired to put the windows and storm windows into weatherproof condition\u2014that would take I believe 6 weeks for a good journeyman carpenter.\n\nThe heating plant should be modified by connecting two boilers with the return end of the main steam pipe. This would require two 4 inch pipes, the top of the boiler to the two return pipes. It is mechanically feasible and a steam fitter and helper should do a complete job in three days.\n\nThe effect would be that the rooms now receiving no heat would have live steam by a complete single return system. The system would then be half the modified single return and half single return. The saving in cost of heating would pay for the repairs to the windows and the alteration to the heating plant. No capital expenditures.\nThere is no doubt that ventilation of the upper ceiling would effect further savings but the first thing in the repairs to the windows, second getting the heating plant into an effective condition. Third the ventilati\n\nAs you know I was on the staff for the winters of 1935-6 and 1936-7. On cold nights the nurse had to have coal oil stoves in the hospital rooms to get the heat up to 50\u00b0. She often had to tie on the bed with bed clothing over her to keep warm.\n\nAs a last word I would say the neglect of the Indian School at Portage la Prairie is a disgrace to Canada and a waste of public funds.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWm. E. Lewis\nOttawa,\nFebruary 19, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIt has been again suggested to the Department that certain repairs are very necessary at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School in order to permit of its being properly heated.\n\nIn our appropriation for the fiscal year 1938-39 an amount of $2,000.00 is being provided for repairs and improvements. The items specifically mentioned are for refrigeration, insulating the building and general repairs. However, if there are other repairs or improvements more urgently required it will be possible to make a change.\n\nI would, therefore, appreciate if you would carefully consider what is most urgently required at the Portage la Prairie Residential School keeping in mind that $2,000.00 is the total amount that can be allowed. Complete information regarding what you consider necessary should be handed to Indian Agent Waite to whom a copy of this letter is being forwarded. It would be well for you to consult him before submitting your requirements to us.\n\nAs you are aware the amount mentioned above will not be available until after April 1 and consequently your letter should reach us through Mr. Waite's office about that date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

You will remember that I discussed this matter with you last year. I don't know a darn thing about it myself, but Mr. Laird, who has been fireman at the institution seems to have some ideas. I have never discussed this with Mr. Jones, the Superintendent, and do not know whether he is in favour of the improvements suggested by Mr. Laird.\n\nWith kind regards to yourself\nand Mrs. Hoey, I remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHarry Leader, M.P.\n\nenclosure 2.\nOttawa, February 18, 1938.\n\nDear Mr. Leader:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 17th instant and also letter received by you from Mr. Laird, of Portage la Prairie, attached thereto.\n\nI may state that I am today communicating with the Principal of the Indian Residential School at Portage, asking him to comment on the repairs and improvements suggested by Mr. Laird in his letter. If you can find it convenient to drop in at my office in the course of a week or so, I shall be glad to discuss the matter with you personally.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A.

You and Inspector Hamilton have seen this decrepit tractor and know that it is about to fall to pieces. It has been in use for 21 years and certainly cannot survive another year; we cannot plough with it and it will not handle the separator for threshing.\n\nWe lost a valuable team last Summer through the disease (Encephalitis) which ravaged this district.

These machines can be delivered immediately.\n\nExtremely little trouble has been experienced with this type of Refrigerator as it contains Sealed in Mechanism, therefore eliminating such attentions as oiling, and belt trouble etc. and carries the five year guarantee on the mechanism. While the Standard Commercial Unit require much more periodical attention to belts and other mechanical features, carrying only one year guarantee.\n\nThere is another important feature also in having two units, as the entire 19 cubic feet of refrigeration would not be exposed to an inrush of warm air when the doors are opened, as the normal operation of the two units would only necessitate the opening of one door on either machine. This fact lending itself to certain economy in operation.\n\nIt is with pleasure that we submit the following prices and special reductions:\n\n2 models E-95 Westinghouse Electric Refrigerators, total capacity 19 cubic feet, regular price $810.00\n1 model E-45 Westinghouse Electric Refrigerator, total capacity 4.5 cubic feet, regular price $214.00\nTotal Regular price $1024.00\n\nSpecial Reduced price on the following models good until March 31st, 1938\n\n2 Models E-95 Westinghouse electric refrigerators, total capacity 19 cubic feet, reduced price $680.00\n1 Model E-45 Westinghouse Electric Refrigerator, 4.5 cu. ft. $199.50\nReduced price on the above machines $879.50\nLess 20% Discount to Gov't Institutions $175.90\nTotal price $703.60\nTotal Reduction $320.40\nTotal $1024.00\nTerms of Settlement, sixty days cash.\n\nWe understand there is also a special 2% sales tax which might be rebated upon application to the Manitoba Power Commission.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nManitoba Power Commission\nPer:\n\nAlbert H. Irving\nDistrict Supervisor\n\nE.& OE.\nA.W.M.\nIndian Residential School  \nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nMarch 14th 1938\n\nMr J. Waite,  \nIndian Agent,  \nPortage-la-Prairie,  \nMan.\n\nDear Mr Waite,\n\nI beg to submit this statement of the estimated cost of Repairs and Improvements to this school.\n\nNo. 1 Repairs to valleys of roof of mainbuilding material and labour $185.00\n\nNo. 2 Refrigeration as per Hydro Estimate, this includes installation. This system recommended has many advantages over the \"walkin\" refrigerator in that it is all metal, cost less to operate, will not absorb odours like the wood \"walkin\" and has a lower initial cost. The two models E-95 will give 19 cubit feet capacity which will be sufficient for Staff and Pupils food refrigeration and the model E-45 will be ample for the Principals Suite. Please note the special prices given by the Hydro $703.60\n\nNo. 3 Conversion of Granary and ice house into workshop. This building will make an excellent workshop. It will require some concrete work, windows, doors, and interior sheeting. The price given is for material only, the Principal will supply the labour. Cost of Material $340.00\n\nNo. 4 Implement shed for Separator and granary to replace granary converted into workshop. One side of this new shed will be for the separator and the other side will have grain bins, there will be concrete footings for the building and concrete floor for the granary. Labour supplied by Principal, cost of material only $410.00 Size of shed 18' X 32\"\n\nNo. 5 Fittings for Barn, water bowls, piping, and water tank, force pump, labour supplied by Principal. Material only $154.00\n\nNo. 6 Lumber for walls of boys playroom to replace broken plaster. Material only $75.00\nNo. 7 Grouting or Caulking around all window frames, this is done by a pressure gun forcing in a rubber like substance that stops all draughts. Material and labour 75.00\n\nNo.8 Insulation of ceiling of school with wood wool as per Cook Construction Co. Estimate 200.00\n\nNo.1. Repairs to Valleys 165.00\nNo.2. Refrigeration 703.60\nNo.3.

Full information is given. The amount exceeds the $2,000.00 allowed by the Department and leaves nothing for unforeseen repairs. I beg to set out the necessary repairs in the following order:\n\n- Repairs to roof: $185.00\n- Insulation: $200.00\n- Grouting of Windows etc.: $75.00\n- Boys play room: $75.00\n- Implement shed: $410.00\n- Workshop: $340.00\n- Refrigeration: $703.60\n- Barn fittings: $154.00\n\nTo keep within the limit of the $2,000.00 and leave a little for unforeseen repairs I would suggest that the refrigerator for the Principal's personal use be eliminated, also the fittings for the barn. The total saving on these would be approximately $353.50.\n\nPlease note that in nearly every repair, labour is supplied by the school free of cost to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclos.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nMarch 18, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant enclosing letter received from the Principal of the Portage la Prairie Residential School requesting a tractor I regret that no funds were provided for this purpose.\n\nHowever, it may be possible to find funds for the purchase of a new team.

I can attend to the building part, the painting, and the grouting, but a tinsmith should do the roof repair. You will recall that I stated this in my estimates. This work should be done in the dry weather and not left until the late Fall.\n\nThe log house is to be converted into the workshop, but until the Refrigerators are installed I must keep the ice. Will you enquire into this?\n\nAnother item in the estimates was the Insulation. The best time to do this is while the pupils are out on their holidays.\n\nHas the Beatty tender of $134.00 for drinking bowls, tank & piping been accepted?\n\nMr Harry Leader asked me if I would agree to accept the services of a local carpenter to assist me in the building programme. I told him I had no objection to this providing that his wages did not come out the grant already set apart for improvements to this school.\n\nI shall be glad if you will call the attention of the Department to the items not yet authorized.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph Jones\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith a letter received from the Reverend Principal, Portage la Prairie Residential School in reference to certain improvements and requests through estimates.\n\nWill you please advise in this matter.

As an amount of $2,000 was provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at this school, there is still an amount of $1,202.47 available.\n\nPlease let me know the approximate amount that would be required to pay for the services of the tinsmith. At the same time you should state the name and address of the tinsmith whom you would recommend be employed. Upon receipt of this information, the question of engaging a tinsmith will receive immediate attention.\n\nI have reviewed our file, but am unable to locate the Beatty tender of $134 for drinking bowls, tank and piping. I would appreciate your forwarding a copy of this.\n\nIn the principal's letter of March 14 forwarded under cover of your letter of March 15, item No. 8 stated that he had received a quotation of $200 from the Cook Construction Company for insulation of ceiling with wood wool. I cannot find that this tender has been forwarded here. Please obtain it and send it to me for consideration.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.\nWith reference to the refrigeration, you forwarded with your letter of March 15, 1938, a quotation dated February 25, 1938, from the Manitoba Power Commission, quoting a price of $703.60 for suitable refrigeration installation. However, this letter stated that the price just mentioned was only good until March 31, and as our funds were not available at that time, no action was taken. Please let me know at once if this price still holds good. If so, you should forward a letter from the Manitoba Power Commission to that effect.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa,\nJuly 28, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn my letter of the 23rd instant I requested information regarding the request of the Principal for the services of a tinsmith at the Portage la Prairie Residential School. I have no doubt I will hear from you in that regard within a reasonable time.\n\nYesterday we received an inquiry in connection with the employment of a carpenter. While we have arranged for the purchase of material no authority has yet been given for the hiring of any labour. I was under the impression that the work was being done by the school staff. Please let me know at once if any tradesmen other than the tinsmith will be necessary. If so, you should state the tradesmen required and the approximate length of time that their services would be necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nJ.

We have been further given to understand by the gentleman in charge of the School that the required cabinets are approximately two only 8 cu. ft. cabinets, and one only 6 cu. ft. cabinet.\n\nWe have pleasure intendering herewith on genuine Frigidaire domestic cabinets, with the famous Meter Miser compressor. These cabinets are recognized as being suitable for the purpose you have in mind, have large ice making capacity, large shelf area, and are generally equipped with the necessary devices etc. to make a convenient and practical equipment to take care of your problem.\n\nWe are allowing you 25% discount from the regular f.o.b. Winnipeg prices, and will lay these cabinets in at Portage la Prairie, including the five year guarantee. The price of the Master 8's which we understand are required two in number, are $293.00, or a total of $586.00. The Master 6-38, a net price of $225.50, making a total for the three cabinets of $811.50, including Sales Tax.\n\nWe are attaching illustrations of both cabinets with this quotation, and sincerely hope that you will be able to give us favorable consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE J.H.

The quotation is for two of 8 cu. ft and one of 6 cu. ft. capacity.\n\nThe Hydro is quoting on Westinhouse make of larger capacity in the two larger ones 9.5 cu. ft and the smaller one of 4.5 cu. ft for the Principals suite.\n\nWe shall be pleased with either the Westinhouse or the General Motors refrigerators, both are guaranteed for five years. The General Motors will be slightly cheaper in operation, it has smaller capacity. The Westinghouse price is lower, capacity greater, and the Agency is in our local city.\n\nIf The Department decide to buy from the Ashdown Co., we can take the 4.38 capacity for the Principals suite instead of the 6 cu. ft.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the Quotation of the Manitoba Power Commission.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph Jones\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nAugust 24, 1938\n\nSir:\n\nRe 127-1-5\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 9 inst. in connection with the refrigerators for the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, I beg to advise that the matter has been taken up with the Reverend Principal and I enclose herewith his letter concerning the installment of the refrigerators.

This was requested for the Principal's quarters but the Department does not consider it necessary to supply this. Funds for the purchase of the refrigerators are available in the current year's appropriation. From the information given above it would appear that the quotation from the Manitoba Power Commission is the lower.\n\nActing Director.\nSir,\n\nRe: 127-1-5\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, and wish to advise that Mr. W.B. Crealock's name appears on Department letter 53-126, dated Ottawa, July 24th, 1936 in respect to the purchase of binder twine. The firm deals in hardware and are agents for the firm dealing in staunchions etc. Mr. W.G. McKay has done all the steamfitting and plumbing repairs at the school for the past three years. His first job was done under the direction of Mr. Inspector Hamilton under the authority of Department letter 127-1-5 addressed to Mr. Hamilton June 12th, 1936. The Cook Construction Company is the only firm in Portage la Prairie, I am informed, that do this work. Regarding refrigeration requirements, my letter on this subject was forwarded to the Department on the 24th ultimo.\n\nI also wish to advise that the furnace will require some repairs to put it in shape for the winter. The boiler inspector suggested that the break in the manhole should be welded. This will have to be done by an experienced mechanic. The door arch also requires repairs to the brick-work. The school staff will make this repair if fire clay \"Flibblic\" is purchased. The approximate cost of the welding and fire clay will be $40.00. The Principal also mentioned repairs to the children's skating rink; 2x4 lumber, cedar posts, creosote and paint at an approximate cost of $145.00, and 300 feet of 1\u00bd pipe at a cost of $50.00. The pipe is also for the skating rink.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 14, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant regarding repairs to the Portage la Prairie Residential School I will advise you later regarding the quotations received from the Cook Construction Company, W.

It is noted that the cost of fire clay and the welding will not exceed $40.00.\n\nYou should forward a requisition giving detailed information regarding the lumber, cedar posts, creosote and paint that is required for repairing the skating rink. The Purchasing Agent will be requested to secure these.\n\nAs the amount provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Portage la Prairie School is practically exhausted it will not be possible to consider purchasing the 300 feet of 1\u00bd inch pipe.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

PRATT\n\nI desire to refer to your telephone communication to Mr. Phelan in regard to the purchase of refrigerators for the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School.\n\nIn the fall of 1937 when forwarding his estimates for the fiscal year 1936-39 the Principal requested that we provide funds for the purchase of refrigerators as there was no cold storage equipment in the school and it was very much required.\n\nNaturally we requested him to let us have an estimate of the probable cost of refrigerators in order that we could decide whether or not the amount could be included in the estimates. He supplied this information and when funds were available we wrote to the Principal requesting him to let us have full details regarding the refrigerators required. He replied by forwarding the quotations which have been sent to the Purchasing Agent.\n\nWe did not request him to secure prices but no doubt what happened is that when we asked him to give us an estimate of the cost of the refrigerators he consulted one or more firms with a view to determining what was necessary. It follows that these firms knew that he was requesting refrigerating equipment and, therefore, submitted quotations to him. In replying to our letter asking details of the equipment required he considered that the most satisfactory way would be to forward us the quotations he had received.\n\nR. A.

The system operates and Mr. Jones states the tank is cleaned out each fall.\n\nIn 1936, I understand, the Crescent Lake was used as the outlet for other sewage systems. However, such is not the case today as these have all been eliminated at considerable cost. We, apparently, are the only offenders.\n\nMr. Gow closes his report by stating it will cost $1650.00 to modernize the disposal system. I doubt if the city would be satisfied with allowing any overflow to pass into the lake. I believe a disposal field is advocated.\n\nI would like to suggest that Mr. Gow thoroughly investigate the situation and submit a report, outlining the system most suitable and acceptable to the city of Portage la Prairie, at the same time stating the entire cost of the work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.F.

The lake has now been developed as a Park area and odours which arise from the discharge are considered to be objectionable. The school cannot be connected to the town sewerage system and the use of a disposal bed, if it could be operated satisfactorily during the severe winters which is doubtful, would involve pumping from the septic tank to the disposal bed.\n\nMr. Gow suggests that the old sewer line and septic tank be repaired and used only for the kitchen and laundry waste and that a new septic tank and sewer line be built to care for the sewage. Both tanks would discharge into the lake without disposal beds, but it is felt that better septic tank action would be obtained and that the offensive odours would be reduced to a large extent. The cost of this work, including $200.00 for engineering and contingencies, is estimated to be $2,000.00.\n\nAs under present conditions expenditures should be held as low as possible and as the health of the public does not appear to be endangered in any way, we concur in Mr. Gow's recommendation and suggest that the Indian Affairs Branch be requested to provide the necessary funds as soon as possible.\n\nEncl.\n\nKindly return the attached plan as soon as it has served your purpose.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6273, file 583-5, part 7)\nSir,\n\nRe - Indian Residential School at Portage la Prairie, Manitoba\n\nEarly in 1935 we were asked to report upon the condition of the sewage disposal system at the above mentioned school, following complaints about the disagreeable odor coming from the effluent. Under date of June 29, 1935, we reported upon the situation and pointed out that inasmuch as the Health Department of Manitoba had reported that the situation was not detrimental to the health of the citizens of Portage la Prairie or such as to warrant any apprehension, we did not consider any alterations essential. We again reported upon the situation under date of March 11, 1936, at the request of the Department of Indian Affairs, following complaints they had received. Again we reported that it was not considered necessary to make any alterations or extensions. Under date of August 31, 1936, we reported upon the matter, following request from the Inspector of Indian Agencies, at Winnipeg that we examine the situation at the school, in view of the difficulty of operation reported by the Principal of the school. In this report we outlined the conditions at the school and included suggestions as to temporary work that should be carried out and recommended modernization of the system during the holiday season of 1937. I understand that the temporary work was partially carried out by the school management and that there has not been undue operating trouble experienced since. There was no action on the modernization of the system.\n\nIt would appear as if Crescent Lake, into which the effluent discharges, was at one time a sweeping curve of the Assiniboine River and that the altered course of the river left a marshy river bed encircling a large area of wooded land. The Parks Board of Portage la Prairie developed this enclosed area as a park and by pumping from the river maintain water in the old watercourse during the summer. The Indian School is outside the limits of the town as is also that portion of the artificial lake into which the school discharges its sewage. The Parks Board claim to have eliminated the discharge of sewage into the lake except from the Indian School, and the complaints as to the offensive odors from the effluent from the school originate with this Board.\n\nWe are enclosing a print of plan showing school site in relation to Crescent Lake, also the location of septic tank catch-basin, manholes and sewer outlets. The profile is based partly upon information furnished by the School Principal. The road between school site and lake is a public roadway not extensively used, but in the route to the pumping plant of the Town of Portage la Prairie. The school is over a mile from the town limits and the town's sewage system does not cover the four\n\nT. S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Service,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nwesterly blocks of the town, as the main trunk system is inadequate to carry any additional load, the sewerage from the area would have to be pumped and furthermore the area is only sparsely occupied. Owing to the distance from the town's system, the fact that there is insufficient fall from school to the town's system to utilize gravity, and the excessive cost, it is considered impractical to connect the sewage system at the school to the Portage la Prairie sewage system.\n\nOwing to the elevation at which the drains must leave the school and the level to which a septic tank must be constructed, it will be out of the question to discharge the effluent to any disposal bed, except by pumping. We are opposed to passing kitchen and laundry wastes through a septic tank into a disposal bed, and our experience with tile disposal beds at Indian Schools, under our severe winter conditions prevailing here, has been such as to discourage us from suggesting any new installations. It is suggested, therefore, that the kitchen and laundry drainage at this school be separated from the sewage drain and passed through the existing outside drain to septic tank and then discharged into Crescent Lake as at present. The present septic tank will be repaired and fitted with manholes for cleaning, etc. The drain to septic tank will be examined, the catch basin will be replaced by manhole, fitted with screen. A new septic tank will be constructed of sufficient size and depth to care for the sewage from the school. The drain from this new tank will connect with the drain from the old septic tank and the effluent discharged into Crescent Lake. The second tank is considered advisable because of the small size of the old tank, its condition and the desirability of separating kitchen and laundry wastes from the sewerage. No disposal bed will be provided.\n\nThe writer had a meeting with the Parks Board of Portage la Prairie, the Town Engineer being present, and four other members including the Chairman. At this meeting members were asked to state the grounds upon which they made complaints re the Indian School and what they wished done. They explained that prior to six or seven years ago, there were no complaints regarding offensive odors from the sewage drain at the school and that the septic tank cannot be operating properly. Asked if they would be satisfied if we built a new modern septic tank and lowered the outlet, they stated they would - if it would eliminate all offensive odors. It was then explained that such odors could not be entirely eliminated without the construction of a tile disposal field; that I was not prepared to recommend the construction of such a field because it necessitated pumping of the effluent and we had no assurance that the disposal bed could be successfully operated. It was pointed out to the Board that no complaint had ever been made by the Municipality in which the school is situated, as to offensive odors; that the Sanitary Inspector of the Manitoba Department of Health had reported that the system met their requirements; that the Medical Health Officer of the Town of Portage la Prairie had taken frequent samples of water from the vicinity of the outlet from the school and found no contamination and that any system of sewage disposal, regardless of cost, with the possible exception of a successfully operated tile disposal bed, was bound to have some disagreeable odors associated with the system. It was explained to the Board that we were prepared to recommend to Ottawa that the work, as outlined above, be carried out this summer and while they were not being asked to approve of such measures, we wished them to know that what was being proposed should go far in eliminating grounds for future complaints.\ncomplaints regarding the sewage system at the school. The members of the Board said they did not want to take any unreasonable stand and considered that if the work, as outlined, was carried out, it was all that could reasonably be expected, in view of the heavy expenditures being incurred in connection with war costs.\n\nOn the plan accompanying this letter we have shown in red, an outline of what work should be undertaken - this work being as follows:\n\n1. Separation of laundry and kitchen drainage from sewage system within the school building.\n\n2. Uncovering existing drain from building to septic tank, rebuilding catch basin, repairing septic tank and providing manhole for cleaning, and also uncovering and extending drain from tank to lake.\n\n3. Construction of new septic tank with 4,000 cubic feet capacity, with manholes together with drains to and from tank, as shown on the plan. This tank will not be built of reinforced concrete but will have wooden top, wooden manholes and no syphons.\n\nThe separation of laundry and kitchen drainage from the sewage will probably involve considerable work as kitchen and laundry are at opposite ends of the building. It will probably be preferable to construct a new drain outside the building and connect the kitchen drainage and laundry drainage to it, rather than attempt to lay new drain under the floor the entire length of the building. It is realized that uncovering these pipes in the building may reveal much work that should be done and hence the difficulty of estimating the cost of this part of the work.\n\nThe gradient of the drain in the school is very flat and the same is true of the drain from the building to septic tank. Stoppages are of frequent occurrence and it may be necessary to increase the gradient outside the building; if uncovering of drain reveals the gradient too flat. It is difficult to accurately estimate the cost of modernizing the old layout, but much work has to be done.\n\nThe new tank will possibly not be fitted with syphon chamber and the construction will be as simple as possible with no reinforced concrete being used.\n\nThe estimated minimum cost of separating kitchen and laundry drainage from sewage system is $250.00, the cost of modernizing existing layout is $450.00, while the cost of new septic tanks and connecting drains is $1,100.00. The total estimated cost is $1,800.00, so that $2,000.00 should be provided to allow for engineering expenses and contingencies.\n\nPreparation of plans of septic tank will be proceeded with, but as the other work depends largely upon conditions of which little is definitely known at present, no detailed drawings will be prepared prior to the work being undertaken. If the work suggested is authorized, it should be undertaken in early July, while the pupils are away and before harvest gets under way.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Gow, in his report, states:\n\n\"owing to the elevation at which the drains must leave the school and the level to which a septic tank must be constructed, it would be out of the question to discharge the effluent to any disposal bed, except by pumping. ... The present septic tank will be repaired and fitted with man-holes for cleaning, etc., and a new septic tank will be constructed of sufficient size and depth to care for the sewage from the school. No disposal bed will be provided.\"\n\nMr. Gow refers to a meeting he had with the Parks Board of Portage la Prairie, with the Town Engineer present. When asked if they would be satisfied if the Department built a new modern septic tank and lowered the outlet, they stated they would, if it would eliminate all offensive odors. I am not of course an engineer and hesitate to pass judgment on this matter, but I am not at all sure that the members of the Parks Board would be satisfied if we built a new septic tank while the effluent still continued to be discharged into the little lake. Mr. Gow it would appear, explained to the members of the Board that this repair work, when completed, would not wholly eliminate the offensive odors.\n\nMr. Gow estimates that the repair work would cost approximately $2,000.00, and, in view of the fact that his report did not reach the Department until May 9, it was impossible to include an appropriation for this work in the present year's estimates. I cannot state at this moment if\n\nit is -\n\nHarry Leader, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ont.\nit is the intention of the Government to introduce supplementary estimates. Mr. Gow does not submit an estimate of what it would cost to construct a disposal bed and he appears to be opposed to the construction of such a bed which would involve the installation of pumps.\n\nIn view of the critical period in which we find ourselves - perhaps the most critical in the Nation's history - am not at all sure what action we can take this year to remedy conditions at the Portage school. It is my intention, however, to discuss the matter with representatives of the United Church when they visit Ottawa in the course of a week or two. I can only assure you that if it is possible to secure the funds, some action will be taken.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A.

There is a great deal of contamination besides the odor.\n\nIt is the wish of the Council, that if anything can possibly be done without delay, that the work be proceeded with at once.\n\nWe have been informed that our local member Mr Leader has been trying to have this work done, and any consideration you can give this at this time would be very much appreciated by the citizens of Portage and the surrounding district.\n\nWe are,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nActing Sec. Treasurer.\n\nOAD/S\nOttawa, August 19, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 8th instant, in which you seek information with respect to what action is likely to be taken by the Department in the repair of the sewage disposal plant at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School.\n\nI regret to state that it was not found possible to make provision in the estimates of this year for the amount necessary to undertake the reconstruction of the sewage disposal plant at this school. Mr. Gow's last report on the institution is dated Winnipeg, April 23, 1940, but this report did not reach the Department until May 9. Our departmental estimates were prepared and printed prior to this date.\n\nI feel it is only fair to you and to the City Council to state that the repairs suggested by Mr. Gow, at a cost to the Department of approximately $2,000, are not at all likely to remove the offensive odor to which you refer in your communication. Mr. Gow's report reads in part as follows:\n\n\"The writer had a meeting with the Parks Board of Portage la Prairie, the Town Engineer being present, and four other members - including the Chairman. At this meeting members were asked to state the grounds upon which they made complaints re the Indian School and what they wished done. They explained that prior to\n\nO. A. Ditchfield, Esq.,\nSecretary-Treasurer,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\"\nsix or seven years ago, there were no complaints regarding offensive odors from the sewage drain at the school and that the septic tank cannot be operating properly. Asked if they would be satisfied if we built a new modern septic tank and lowered the outlet, they stated they would - if it would eliminate all offensive odors. It was then explained that such odors could not be entirely eliminated without the construction of a tile disposal field; that I was not prepared to recommend the construction of such a bed because it necessitated pumping of the effluent and we had no assurance that a disposal bed could be successfully operated. It was pointed out to the Board that no complaint had ever been made by the Municipality in which the school is situated, as to offensive odors; that the Sanitary Inspector of the Manitoba Department of Health had reported that the system met their requirements; that the Medical Health Officer of the Town of Portage la Prairie had taken frequent samples of water from the vicinity of the outlet from the school and found no contamination and that any system of sewage disposal, regardless of cost, with the possible exception of a successfully operated tile disposal bed, was bound to have some disagreeable odors associated with the system.\n\nIf conditions at the school have grown steadily worse and consequently more objectionable to the citizens of the district, consideration may have to be given to the closing of the institution. It is unnecessary to add that it is wholly impossible for the officials here to even consider proceeding with the repairs, in the absence of any Parliamentary Appropriation to cover the cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

May I again urge upon you the necessity of doing this work.\n\nYours very truly,\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This matter has been discussed very fully and in detail with the authorities of the United Church. If I remember correctly, I intimated to you when you called at my office that no provision was made in the estimates of this year for the repairs that appear to be necessary at the Portage School. In view of this fact, it is simply impossible for us to proceed with the work. If conditions are bad and if they are likely to become more objectionable, we shall have to seriously consider closing the school. A month or two ago the water system at the Brandon Residential School became inadequate to meet the needs of the institution and in order to repair it we had to abandon the construction of the Ahousaht School at the Pacific Coast. This will give you an idea of how limited the funds at our disposal actually are.\n\nI have no assurance at this date that we\n\nHarry Leader, Esq., M.P.,\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\nshall be able to include in the estimates of next year a sum sufficient to remodel the sewage disposal plant at Portage. It is altogether likely that you will be communicating with the office of the Minister in respect to the matter. If you do this, the claims of the Portage School will be very carefully and very sympathetically reviewed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOFFICE OF\nTHE SECRETARY-TREASURER\n\nSeptember 5, 1940.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Sewage Disposal Plant at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of 19th Ult. addressed to Mr. O. A. Ditchfield with respect to the above matter.\n\nYour letter was read in open council and the members expressed disappointment that no action is being taken to remove what the City Council considers a menace to the public health.\n\nWe would point out the fact that this sewage passes through a septic tank that has been in operation for many years, into an artificial lake that is maintained by the city at considerable cost, and is used for boating etc.\n\nIt does seem unfair that odors, which unmistakably exist, should be permitted to interfere with the full enjoyment of what we consider one of the city's principal recreation centers. You mention that no complaint has been received from the municipality in which this property is situated. May I point out that the entire lake bottom is owned and controlled by the City of Portage la Prairie.\n\nAs before mentioned this particular septic tank has been in operation for many years. Unquestionably it\nhas outlasted its usefulness and is now depositing raw sewage into the lake.\n\nThe situation is a topic of much discussion among our ratepayers and they are urging us to do our utmost to see that some remedy is applied.\n\nWe respectfully urge that the question be reopened and given further consideration at Ottawa.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary-Treasurer.\nOttawa, September 14, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 5th instant, in which you express disappointment, on behalf of the Council, at the failure of the Department to proceed with certain repairs to the sewage disposal plant at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School.\n\nIn addition to your communication, I am in receipt of a letter from Mr. Harry Leader, M.P., in which Mr. Leader emphasizes again the urgency of the matter. I can only state that in the absence of the funds necessary to undertake the work, the conditions at the Portage School will be very carefully reviewed when the 1941-42 estimates are under consideration. I should state again however that if the odor to which you refer has become very objectionable consideration should be given to the closing of the institution.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nW. H. Burns, Esq.,\nSecretary-Treasurer,\nCity of Portage la Prairie,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nMr J.Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage-la-Prairie,\n\nDear Mr Waite,- When we were doing some repairs to the fire box of our furnace last Fall we found that the inside wall had fallen over against the boiler, to repair these would involve greater expenditure than the grant allowed at that time. I reported this last Fall and I trust that the necessary funds be provided for this repair. May I also point out that I have not received any intimation of any grant being provided for repairs this year.\n\nI respectfully submit a request for a grant of six dollars for cleaning out the Septic Tank this Fall.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nJoseph Jones\n\nP.S. May I suggest that I be allowed to engage a bricklayer and labourer and purchase the necessary Fire Brick to repair the furnace. I do not know the number of brick required until we take down the wall and find out the extent of the repairs needed.\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nOctober 2nd, 1940.\n\nSir,\n\nThe attached letter has been received from the Reverend J. Jones, Principal of the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School regarding repairs necessary to the school furnace.\n\nMr. Hugh Winton who has done considerable work at this school went over the furnace and advises me that these repairs will cost at the outside approximately $220.00. This will include firebrick, common brick, lime, fire clay, cement, bricklayer and labourers wages. He quotes this figure at the outside as he cannot furnish the actual cost until the wall has been taken down.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nEncs.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nOctober 8, 1940.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant in which you intimate that certain repairs are necessary to the school furnace at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that Mr. Hugh Winton, a carpenter of Portage la Prairie, estimates the cost of these repairs at approximately $220.00. In view of the urgency of the matter and your recommendation you are authorized to engage Mr. Winton to undertake these repairs. It is desirable that the cost should not exceed the above-noted figure.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nMr J.

Under any circumstances there is bound to be some inconvenience caused to those in charge of the school but it is considered that the least inconvenience would result if the work were carried out in July when the majority of the Indian children are away from the Institution on holidays. Conditions at the school are not any more serious now than they have been for many years past, so there does not appear to be any necessity for the carrying out of this work before July.\"\n\nUnless there have been recent developments of which we have not been informed, we agree with Mr. Gow that the summer holidays would be the most suitable time for carrying out the work.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.

They will leave for holidays at the end of June and arrangements will be made to begin the work at that time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. H.

With reference to the above, I have to report that the above named complainant called this office by phone at 10:00 P.M., of the 14-4-41, & stated that one set of harnesses was missing from the stable at the Ind school, & he had made a thorough search for same but could not locate them, & he believed that same had been stolen & requested Police investigation.\n\n2. I patrolled per P.C.8085, to the Ind school this A.M., where the complaint was interviewed. He stated that the harness in question had been hanging on pegs in the stable behind two horses, which owing to sickness had not been worked since April 8th, 1941, & therefore the harness had not been used since then. Since the farm instructor, Alec ROXBURGH, had reported to him on the 14-4-41, that the harness was missing from the stable, & after he had made a thorough search of the premises without success he had decided that it had been stolen. The harness is described as follows:\n\nOne set heavy harness (make unknown) colour black, black steel harness, straps attached, blue coloured brow bands with brass dots, new heel chain attached to one end of one trace, old set, much repaired. Value \u00a320.00.\n\n3. Alec ROXBURGH was next interviewed & stated that the harness had not been used since April 8th, & thought he had seen the harness hanging on the pegs on Friday morning 11-4-41, & found them missing on Saturday Morning the 12-4-41, but thought that Mr. JONES had taken them for repairs, so he did not report the matter to Mr. JONES until the 15-4-41. He further stated that the doors of the Ind stable are never locked. He gave the following statement:\n\nStatement of Alec ROXBURGH, Farm Inst., Ind School, Portage La Prairie.\n\nI am Farm Instructor at the Indian School Portage La Prairie. We have two sets of harness in the stable, but only one set is used every day. On Sunday April 12/41 I noticed that one set of harness was missing from the usual pegs. I am not certain but I thought the harness was there on Friday morning April 11th. This set of harness had not been used since April 8th, 1941. I thought Mr. JONES, the Principal had taken the harness to be repaired, so I did not say anything to him until Monday April 14th, at which time I asked him if he had taken the harness for repairs & he replied that he had not. I saw Jim DANIELS in the boys lavatory in the school on Thursday night, April 10th, but did not see any of the Indians around the school on Friday night April 11th. I don't know of any suspects, but it would appear to be the work of some Ind who knew the routine of the stable.\n\nSigned: A. ROXBURGH.\n\nFile numbers must be quoted\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6273, file 583-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRe: Alleged Theft of Harness Sec.266.C.C.\n\nComp.of Joseph JONES, Principal of Ind School - Portage la Prairie, Man.\n\n4. It was learned from Mr ROXBURGH that two Indians boys of the school (Wallace JOHNSON & Michael PASHA) had been in the habit of using this harness on the two horses prior to the time when it had been taken out of use on April 8th. These two boys were interrogated at length, but no information of value could be obtained from them. They both stated that they had seen the harness on the pegs in the stable on Friday morning April 11th but had not seen it since that time. They also stated that Indians from The Long Plains Reserve are often at the school to visit their boys, both during the day & night, & they were in the habit of taking their horses to the stable at the school to water them when they came with wagons & teams, but they had not seen any grown up Indians around the school on Friday April 11th.\n\n5. The harness in question was hung on pegs close to the door of the stable (the doors of which are never secured), which is situated approx 50 yds to the East of a main travelled road to Portage a distance of one mile. The fields North, South & West of the building are water soaked & impassable. It would appear that this theft has been committed by some Indian from the Long Plains Ind Reserve who it is reported come to visit their children at the school any time they wish & tie their horses outside the stable & also go to the stable where the harness was kept to water their horses, & some person who knew that the particular set of harness was not in use. A number of the boys at the school was questioned by the writer & Mr JONES in an effort to learn whether any Indians were around the buildings on the night in question, but without avail.\n\n6. In view of the fact that JIM DANIELS, of the Long Plains Ind Reserve was seen in the school on Thursday April 10th & knowing that he does not have very good reputation, I patrolled per P.O.905, with Cst. Wrightson, to the Long Plains Reserve to further investigate this matter. Jim DANIELS was interrogated & admitted that he was at the school on April 10th to visit some of the boys, but had not been there since & he denied any knowledge of the harness. A thorough search of his premises was carried out but the harness in question could not be found. Further enquiries were made on the Reserve & Mr SAWER, the farm instructor interviewed, but no information of value could be obtained. Mr SAWER stated that he would keep a lookout for the harness in question & notify this office if he obtains any information.\n\n7. On the return of the patrol to Portage further enquiries were made around the Indian school district & Settlers interviewed but no additional information was forthcoming. All second-hand stores & Junk stores at Portage were checked but the harness could not be seen or any trace of it found. The Portage City Police have been given a description of the harness & will keep a lookout for same. Harness will be inspected during patrols in the dist.\n\n8. Investigation will be continued in this matter & further report will follow.\n\nS.U.I., Exp.F.93, April 1st to 15th, 1941.\n\n10-5-41.\n\nSgt.\nW.H.Stevens, Reg.No.1029,\n1/c Portage Detachment.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In his reply he writes, in part, as follows:\n\n\"The smell in the kitchen has been remedied, although the contraption for combating the smell is only temporary and will have to be renewed in a year or so.\"\n\nI should appreciate receiving your comments on the Indian Agent's statement, as we were hopeful that when the work was done it would be a permanent job.\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nSurveys and Engineering Branch\n\n532 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWINNIPEG, April 25, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal, Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, Manitoba.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 22nd with reference to the above mentioned project and asking for particulars as to the method of eliminating the sewer gas from the kitchens of the school.\n\nPart of the work carried out during 1941 included the laying of a 4\" drain to discharge all wastes from the kitchen into the catch basin outside the building. This drain also carried the discharge from water closets, wash basins and baths in the staff quarters above the kitchen and much of the plumbing in connection with the same passed through the kitchen. The connection to the main sewer line running the length of the building under the floor had been broken and sealed with the laying of this 4\" drain. All sinks, wash basins, water closets and etc., leading into this drain are trapped. No trap, however, was placed in the new 4\" drain for this would have necessitated a manhole just outside the building since it has been found that such traps frequently become plugged and access to the same must be provided. The drain discharges into the old catch basin at an elevation slightly above the drain outletting to the old septic tank. The catch basin is provided with a metal cover which is not air-tight.\n\nOur inspection in January confirmed the complaints received regarding the sewer gas in the kitchen and it was evident that this gas could only come from leakage through the plumbing in the kitchen after backing up from the old septic tank to the catch basin and thence into and through the new 4\" drain to the kitchen plumbing. We had no desire to bring in plumbers to go over all the old traps and plumbing in order to locate the point at which the sewer gas was leaking. It was decided to trap the 4\" drain at its outlet into the catch basin although the pipe only protruded 1/2\" from the face of the concrete. This was accomplished by having made at a cost of $1.50, a galvanised elbow to fit over the 4\" protruding pipe and insert downward into the liquid which stands in the basin below the outletting pipe. The so-called contraction is only temporary inasmuch as 1/2\" does not provide as much holding surface as several inches. However, it has remained in place and the sewer gas in the kitchen has been eliminated. The school authorities should clean out this catch basin twice yearly and at such time it will be necessary to remove and replace the elbow which is a few minutes labour only.\n\nYou mentioned in the last paragraph of your letter that the Director of Indian Affairs had hoped that the work would be of a permanent nature. He apparently has in mind the work carried out at the Portage la Prairie Indian School during 1941.\n\nT. S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering and Construction Service,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6273, file 583-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWe should realize, however, that the purpose of the work carried out at the school during 1941 was not to overhaul the plumbing to locate and repair leaks or to do work necessary to overcome the plugging of water closets and etc. It was to reduce the disagreeable odor arising from the sewer outlet at its entrance into Crescent Lake and the pollution of Crescent Lake itself - conditions which had been the source of many complaints during recent years from Portage la Prairie organizations. It is true that the partial separation of laundry and kitchen drainage from the main sewer system did relieve the situation somewhat within the school, yet the sewer system in the school continued to be very unsatisfactory. The main sewer running the length of the building is laid at too flat an angle and the connecting pipes emptying into it have very little slope so that at times of overloading, plugging of the lines results, creating unsatisfactory conditions. We were always careful to point out that the work we were carrying out was not for the purpose of overcoming these conditions. These conditions, insofar as the laundry and kitchen drainage is concerned, were eliminated but they still exist in the sewer lines and the correction of the same will necessitate the tearing up of the flooring and the complete realignment of the main sewer and connecting sewers to it within the building itself. This will entail a great deal of expense as it is an expensive job.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) D. B. Gow,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\nDr. McGill:\n\nIn reply to your memo of April 17th last.\n\n5/5/42.\n\nJ.M.W.J.M.W.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle,\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal, Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reference to your notation on Dr. McGill's memorandum of the 17th instant regarding the elimination of sewer gas in the school kitchen, we are enclosing two copies of Mr. Gow's report dated the 25th instant.\n\nRegarding the Indian Agent's remarks, it will be noted that the catch basin should be cleaned out twice a year and if it is then found necessary to renew the elbow which traps the 4-inch drain, it will be a very simple and inexpensive matter to do so.\n\nMr. Gow states that the purpose of the work carried out last year was to correct a condition at Crescent Lake into which sewage from the school is discharged, and not to remodel the plumbing system in the school. The separation of kitchen and laundry waters from the sewage from the main school has improved matters at the school but much remains to be done yet to put the plumbing system in satisfactory condition. This might be brought to the attention of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.T. Miller\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ. M.

I have had a boiler expert out here and he has attempted to repair by reaming the tube, this was not effective because it is the tube that are leaking and not at the joint of the tube and plate.\n\nTo make a complete job the tubes will have to be replaced, and this should be done at once as we have no other method of heating water for washing or baths.\n\nI would respectfully ask for authority to proceed with this repair and for a grant to cover the cost of same.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6273, file 583-5, part 7)\nMr J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage-la-Prairie.\n\nDear Mr Waite,- I have an estimate of the cost of repairs to the hot water heating system. New tubes will have to be put in the boiler and new valves supplied to shut off the water from the other part of our water system, the present valves will not shut off the water, we have to shut the water off to clean out the boiler frequently to take out the scale that forms rapidly in the boiler. The total cost will not exceed $145.00 one hundred and forty five dollars.\n\nThe boiler and reserve hot water tank have never been covered with asbestos, if this was done it would conserve fuel, at present we lose the heat by radiation for the large exposed surface of the two (boiler and tank)\n\nMr McKay will cover the two with one inch thick blocks of asbestos then over this another one inch thickness of asbestos plaster, then the whole covered with cotton pasted on. For this work he will supply labour and materials for the sum of Seventy five dollars.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nJoseph Jones\nDear Sir,\n\nThe attached two letters have been received from the Reverend Mr. J.

(RG 10, Volume 6273, file 583-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\nBe sure to have the paint well brushed out.\n\nTrouble results from paint being applied too thick; three thin coats are better than two thick ones.\n\nThree or more days should be allowed between coats for drying.\n\nSee that the oil used for thinning is pure raw linseed oil.\n\nBe sure to stir the paint up well. The proper way to stir paint is to box it, that is, pour it back and forth from one can to another until it is thoroughly mixed.\n\nBy following the above directions good results will be obtained.\n\nWe recommend the employment of a first class painter.\n\nQUANTITY REQUIRED\n\nTo estimate the quantity of Diamond A Absolutely Pure Paint required for two coats, measure the distance around the building, multiply by the average height, which will give the number of square feet to paint. Divide this number by 400 (the number of square feet Diamond A Absolutely pure Paint will cover, two coats to the gallon) and this will give you approximately the number of gallons of paint to buy for the body. Then multiply this number with this quantity, which will give you the amount needed for the cornices, trimmings, waste, etc. To estimate the amount for floors, ceilings, etc., divide the number of square feet by 400 as before, which will give you the quantity needed.\n\nOf course it will be understood that surfaces vary in their natures and that this estimate is based on a surface of the ordinary good condition to receive paint.\n\nQUALITY PRICE ECONOMY\n\nThe actual outlay of money in painting work can only be measured by the net cost of the completed job.\n\nIn the first place, it costs as much to apply an inferior paint as a good one, and the cost of the application is much more than the cost of the material used. Comparing the covering capacity of Diamond A Absolutely Pure Paint (400 square feet, two coats to the gallon) with the advertised covering capacity of cheaper priced paints (usually 300 to 350 square feet, two coats) and it will be found that the actual first cost or actual outlay of money is less for Diamond A Absolutely Pure Paint than for the inferior grades, and besides the additional saving in applying fewer coats there is also the vast saving in the durability or preserving qualities. Every package of Diamond A Absolutely Pure Paint is thoroughly tested as to quality, color and consistency, and each package bearing our label is the unqualified guarantee of quality and satisfactory results from its use when properly used.\n\nTHE J. H. ASHDOWN HARDWARE CO., LIMITED WINNIPEG\n\nSaskatoon - Regina - Edmonton - Calgary\n\nPAINT PROTECTION\n\nPaint is a necessity and should not be clasped as a luxury, although it is a luxury to have everything around a home bright and clean. The cost of painting is actually less than the inevitable wear and tear of any surfaces which are left without proper protection. Protecting it is one luxury which costs nothing to indulge in.\n\nIt is a heavy expense not to paint, and no expense to keep well painted every surface exposed to the elements.\n\nAs a general rule a property owner gives very little attention to the painting of his house except from the standpoint of appearance; of course it is desirable that property should have a bright and clean air, but the greatest value of paint is for protection. It is most essential and compared to the great cost of the inevitable replacements when left unpainted, the cost is actually nothing.\n\nAll surfaces must be satisfied and kept so; the elements are always seeking a weak point of attack, and unless kept thoroughly protected, decay and destruction soon follow.\n\nMACHINE-MADE PAINTS Versus HAND-MIXED PAINTS\n\nTHEN AND NOW\n\nYears ago, paints as mixed by the painter, consisted of two ingredients, white lead and linseed oil. There is still some paint of this character used, but a great deal more than formerly as new scientific, chemical tests and thorough research work have developed that a paint made from pure carbamate of lead and linseed oil is not the most satisfactory or durable paint coating.\n\nINGREDIENTS THAT MAKE A GOOD PAINT\n\nPure white lead and linseed oil are good as far as they go, but they do not go far enough. It is an acknowledged fact that white lead when mixed alone with linseed oil has a tendency to powder and chalk. Zinc added gives eight protection counteracts this action. Zinc also increases the covering power of the paint, and, when used with white lead and linseed, appears to be the only quality that makes it take the coloring matter readily. White lead and zinc oxide, further, on account of their high refractive power, enable the manufacturer to incorporate the largest possible quantity of linseed oil in the mixture of paint, and, as is well known, linseed oil gives life and elasticity to the paint.\n\nIt is therefore important that a good prepared paint shall contain pure zinc oxide and linseed oil, and it is equally important that these three ingredients should be put together in the correct proportions.\n\nDiamond A Absolutely Pure Paint, backed by the valuable practical results we have reached, are the best guarantees we can offer to anyone that ordering Diamond A Absolutely Pure Paint, we put them together, make perfect paints. If we knew how to improve them further we should gladly do so.\n\nDIAMOND A ABSOLUTELY PURE PAINT\n\nSold Subject to Chemical Analysis.\n\nGuarantee\n\nWe hereby Guarantee DIAMOND A ABSOLUTELY PURE HOUSE PAINT to be made entirely of Pure White Lead, pure Oxide of Zinc, (except such shades as do not contain Lead and Linseed Oil) Pure Turpentine, Pure Linseed Oil, Pure Turpentine Dryer and nothing else, and is sold subject to chemical analysis.\n\nTHE J. H. ASHDOWN HBWE. CO., Limited\n\"Diamond A\" Absolutely Pure Paints.\n\nFor painting houses outside and inside, and for all kinds of general painting. This paint is the highest school of modern paint making; the exact proportions of the best known materials are combined in the proper manner, thereby producing a perfectly balanced, thoroughly efficient paint. It dries with a firm glossy surface, retains its tone and color and will give the maximum of durability.\n\nDirections\n\nGeneral directions for the proper use of this paint, and the proper preparation of the surface to receive it, are printed on the labels and also on this card.\n\nSpecial Work\n\nOccasionally a job is in such condition that no paint will give satisfactory results when applied in the ordinary way. In such cases we invite correspondence and will give directions for special treatment.\n\nNumber of Coats\n\nTo secure best results, new work should have three coats, that is, two besides the priming coat. The latter should be sufficient to give a generous efficiency to the paint. For old work, as a rule two coats are sufficient, unless the old paint is practically all gone, in which case three are better.\n\nOne Gallon of \"Diamond A\" Absolutely Pure Paint, Covers 400 to 500 Square Feet, Two Coats\n\nDirections for Use\n\nNew Work\n\nShake all knots and sticky spots before applying. The priming coat is the most important. Do not prime with oil, as the succeeding coat will not adhere to it. Prime with Diamond A absolutely pure paint; reduce with pure raw linseed oil, 1/2 pint to a gallon of paint. After priming allow at least 36 hours to dry; putty all nail holes carefully.\n\nSecond Coat\n\nFor the second coat, add a pint of pure spirits of turpentine to each gallon of paint.\n\nThird Coat\n\nThe third, or finishing coat, should always be applied as the paint comes in the original can. All coats must be well brushed out.\n\nOld Work\n\nWhen the surface is porous and has not been painted for a long time, it should be treated the same as new work; the paint must be removed from the surface by using steel brushes or scrapers. Old surfaces that have been exposed to coal smoke, chimney door jambs, etc., should be thoroughly scoured. Where the surface is in fair condition, add one pint of turpentine to each gallon of paint for the first coat; also the second.

The number of gallons asked for is approximately 203 and the cost of same will be in the neighbourhood of $725.00.\n\nThe cost in labour putting on the paint would be paid for by the school authorities.\n\nMr. McNeill also asks for 700 square feet of Beaver board to be supplied at an approximate cost of $40.00. The interior of the building is badly in need of painting. The girl's play room, for which the wall board is required is in need of repair. The plaster on the walls being loose and liable to collapse. The work of putting on the Beaver board would be done by the school staff and is very necessary. The painting of the interior is a big job and I would suggest that only the very necessary painting be done during the present fiscal year. I beg to suggest the sum of $300.00 be allowed for the purchase of paint and $40.00 for wallboard.\nOttawa,\nDecember 28, 1942.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Man.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, you may purchase beaver board at an approximate cost of $40.00 for use at the Portage la Prairie Residential School.\n\nI note your suggestion that an amount of $300.00 be allowed for the purchase of paint. This sum is available and I believe is sufficient for the present time. However, as this decision reduces the quantity requested by approximately 50% it will be necessary to revise the requisition accordingly and I, therefore, return it for this purpose. You should send it back as soon as you have re-arranged the quantities in order that purchase may be made through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nR.A.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nThe Fire Commissioner's report on the Portage Residential School stated that certain defective wiring should be attended to and I had an electrician check over the building and the attached is the cost of putting the wiring etc., in the school in first class condition. The electrician was recommended by the Manitoba Hydro Commission and there will be a charge for his work in checking over the building. The account will be forwarded in the course of a few days. I would recommend that this work be carried out so that the fire commissioner's recommendations may be completed.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 5, 1943.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Man.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo, you may authorize the Principal of the Portage la Prairie Residential School to incur an expenditure of $43.55 for repairing the electric wiring at the school as recommended by the Manitoba Hydro Commission.\n\nR.A. Hesey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMay 7, 1943.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nI enclose two requisitions which Indian Agent Waite has forwarded for the Portage la Prairie Residential School. While Mr. Waite has signed the requisitions he has not accompanied them by a letter giving some details regarding the necessity for filling the requisitions.\n\nIt has not been our practice to supply double-decker beds to any Indian residential school. If there are sufficient beds in the Portage la Prairie School at the present time for the pupils for whom grant is allowed the Department does not see any necessity for supplying additional beds. At the conclusion of the war there is no doubt that there will be plenty of beds available for free distribution.\n\nYou will note that a large quantity of paint is requested for painting the outside of the barn. I doubt very much if, owing to present conditions, any farmers in Western Canada will do any extensive painting of their barns this summer. You are well aware of the labour shortage and, besides, paint is not easy to obtain. We do not object to interior painting which keeps the rooms looking clean but, as pointed out, we are inclined to feel that it would be unwise to paint the exterior of the barn this year. It would be appreciated if you could find it possible to visit the Portage la Prairie\nResidential School some time in the near future and discuss the whole matter with the Indian Agent and the Principal and let me have a report.\n\nR.A.

On May 13th I visited the school as requested.\n\nThe Department will recall that interior paint was supplied for this school last year and the improvement in the building is most gratifying. Two thirds of the interior of the school has been painted. All has had two coats and in some rooms three coats were required to give a good finish. All work done up-to-date has been for the benefit of the children; no paint has been used on the staff rooms or on the Principal's suite. The work is not yet completed and at present Mr. McNeill has two good painters working full time.\n\nThe outbuildings have not been painted for many years - perhaps twenty; however, they are in good repair and if possible should be painted. Mr. McNeill points out that these are Government buildings, yet he is prepared to spend funds on wages for painting if the Government will provide the paint. Mr. McNeill points out the decision rests entirely with the Department; but if they wish the work done the paint must be provided at once before the men now engaged finish the interior work and leave. I think more buildings throughout the country would be painted if the cost was only a question of the purchase of paint. I can only add that the buildings need painting and the painters now engaged are doing excellent work.\n\nThe double-deck beds were requested to provide more floor space and thus make it easier for the children to reach the fire escapes in case of fire. At present I consider the beds are too close together and that they cause a fire hazard. However, after going into this matter carefully, I think the number could be reduced to four beds complete with mattresses. I find the school now has eight - thirty-six inch beds not in use because they have no mattresses. These beds would accommodate two small boys each. A number of the boys are brothers and thus there should be no objection to the arrangement. Some of these thirty-six\" beds could also be used in the infirmary, thus releasing smaller beds for the dormitories. I am changing the requisition to read as follows:\n\n4 - double deck beds complete with mattresses,\n6 - 36\" mattresses, standard length.\n\nA.G.

He pointed out that they expected to thin out the stain with oil but to do so would have made it too thin. The barn roof is only half painted and of course must be completed. The pearl grey paint is needed to finish the junior classroom.\n\nMay this quantity be purchased from the firm supplying the previous order? They, no doubt, will give the same price. I believe the stain cost slightly less than $1.00 per gallon. The man doing the painting is still available and immediate authority for the expenditure will be appreciated.\n\nA.G.

At present there are two poles as a means of escape and these are condemned. It is pointed out that if the main stairway were cut off by fire or hot gasses, there is a possibility that the fire escapes could not be used by the children in the senior dormitory. I have obtained a quotation for the construction of the two stairways from Messrs. Gibb and Ellwood Co. Ltd., Portage la Prairie, and inclose same herewith. The cost complete, except the painting of the stairs, which can be done by the staff, is $115.00. I would strongly recommend that this work be done as soon as possible.\n\nJ.

As you are aware, we supplied paint at a cost of $205.00 to this school in June, 1943. We are now approaching the end of the fiscal year and our funds are running low. In addition the amount of money specifically provided for repairs and improvements at the Portage la Prairie Residential School during the current fiscal year is practically exhausted. With the above in mind I regret that we are not in a position to fill the requisition which you forwarded. We will, however, keep the matter in mind and order the paint early in April and its cost will be charged against the amount provided in the 1944-45 appropriation for the Portage la Prairie School.\n\nR.A.

The arch is leaning outward and the brick work over the arch is in a dangerous state. I have had Mr. Davis look over the job and he estimates that it will cost $50.00 to repair the arch and it will have to be bolted to a plank inside the school. This means drilling seven stones forming the arch.\n\nMr. MacNeill would like this work done during the holidays but I feel that the work should be done at this time as there is danger of bricks falling in case of a sudden jar.\n\nWill you please advise in this matter.\n\nJ.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMemorandum\n\nWe have your memorandum of the 1st instant, your file No. 127-1-5, with reference to hot water boiler for the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, and note that the Indian Agent now requests that a Safford Bungalow Heater B-32, rating 400 cubic feet be supplied by Mr. Gordon McKay, instead of the Gurney Heater described on your requisition of June 27. Mr. Waite did not state the price for the B-32 boiler, and we are therefore unable to set up a purchase order.\n\nUnder the circumstances I would suggest that the Indian Agent arrange for the purchase of the boiler which he states has already been delivered.\n\nVoucher and detailed invoices should be sent to this Department for the usual action. I would suggest that in addition to the information already furnished this office, that the capacity of the boiler in gallons be indicated. This authorization is valid on the understanding that the price of the Safford heater is not in excess of the Gurney heater - $212.00.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nWMV/HC\nOttawa,\nAugust 3, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\nA\n\nMr. J.

Huston, of the Portage la Prairie Residential School has made request to have certain changes made to the windows of his residence which is a suite in the school, also redecorating of the suite.\n\nIt is many years since the suite was decorated and although it is still in good shape I think it should be done. At least three Principals have been in residence here since it was re-decorated.\n\nThe cost of changing the windows is $118.00. This price was furnished by Mr.Haid. The cost of decorating, labour only $250.00. Paint, varnish, etc.$50.00. The cost of the paper, chosen by the Principal's wife is quoted at $58.80.\n\nThe Principal is very anxious to have this work done as he has been supplied with a quantity of very fine furniture by the Women's Missionary Society.\n\nI also obtained a price for cutting two doors into the playrooms. The cutting of these doors will allow the children to go immediately into the playroom instead of walking up flight of stairs. This would save stairs which are showing signs of wear and would keep the children out of the main halls.

He wishes the Department to furnish floor covering for the whole of his living quarters. There are approximately 150 square yards of floor in the suite and I beg to enclose a tender on the linoleum and the cost of labour.\n\nThe floor of the suite is at present of maple and is badly worn in places. There are also a number of stained spots that spoil the appearance of the whole.\n\nMr. Huston claims he is being given furniture by the Women's Missionary Society at a cost of $1000. and the condition of the floor will spoil the effect.\n\nThe amount being spent on this suite to date is as follows:\n\nChanging windows, $118.00, decorating (labour) $250.00, paint, varnish etc. $50.00, wallpaper $58.80. Total $477.80.\n\nThere is no doubt that something should be done to the floors and in the long/probably the cheaper floor would be linoleum.\n\n[Signature]\nWhite,\nIndian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nOttawa, March 15, 1945.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa.

Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage La Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Waite;\n\nThe school requires at the present time certain repairs and a few minor changes made in connection with the water and the electric light system throughout the buildings. Mr. McKey the Plumber and Mr. Beck the Electrician have both surveyed the required work and have given their estimates on cost of same. The Electrician's services and repairs would cost $40.00 that of the Plumber's $85.00 making a total of $125.00. The Plumber's charges would include a new toilet bowl. I trust the Department may see its way clear to finance the above work which is so essential now at the very beginning of the school term when both systems will be taxed to capacity.\n\nDuring the past year or two considerable painting has been done to the interior of many of the rooms within the school building. Prior to that this work had been neglected for many years. There are still quite a number of the rooms still to be done. Would the Department supply the school with sixty gallons of white paint (Sherwin-Williams if possible). If this is done we will be glad to provide help from our regular staff to see that it is applied.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The inside of the school is now clean with the exception of a few of the smaller rooms. I beg to recommend these purchases.\n\nThe outside of the school should be painted and before this is done a few minor repairs should be made to the roof, doors, windows and eavestroughing.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: 125-1-5, Ottawa, September 17, 1945.\n\nWith reference to the above noted letter and further to my report of the 12th. idem, I wish to enclose herewith a report and costs of repairs to the windows at the Portage Indian Residential School. There is also an estimate for a storm porch to be built at the main entrance of the building. While this is not absolutely necessary at this time it should be considered. In regard to the repairs to the windows, this is a very necessary repair. The original windows on the ground floor were one piece of glass 32 X 34. As these windows were constantly being broken and were very costly to replace, a series of Principals gradually boarded them up, until all the windows in the boys' lavatory have been boarded up. It is the same in the dining room and the girls' portion. It is suggested that smaller windows be installed, - 9 lights to each window. A window broken would then not be too expensive to repair. During the years, sand from the road has blown into the frames and water has caused some, in fact most of the window frames, to rot and replacements will have to be made. Last year I was able to have glass replaced in all the doors without expense to the Department. The replacing of the glass in the windows is too expensive for the school to undertake. I would strongly recommend that the repairs be done, the school is gradually improving in appearance through the efforts of the present Principal, who is very anxious to co-operate in any scheme for the benefit of the pupils and the condition of the school generally.\n\nThere is still an expensive repair to be done on the\neavestroughing and the roof. It seems impossible to obtain prices for the repair of the eavestroughing which should be done while the scaffolding is erected for the painting. I would also be pleased if the Department would furnish the name of the firm who laid the roof. It is a tiled roof, the building was built in 1915. There appears to be no records at the agency office in regard to the building. It will be necessary to have the roof repaired as it is leaking badly in places. There is a possibility that the whole roof will have to be replaced; I would, however, be pleased to receive advice from the firm who laid the roof in the first place.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 19th October, 1945.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant you may accept the tender of Chas. Haid for material and labour in making certain alterations and repairs at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School at a total cost of $489.50.\n\nThe estimate received from the firm covers the following:\n\n(1) To build and install one removable Stormporch outside main entrance, size 6' x 5'6\" x 9' with one door with glass and windows at front and two sides and painted two coats: $ 95.00\n\n(2) To alter twenty-two lower halves of C.R. Windows from 1 lt. (34x32) to 9 lts. supply new glass, also new wood where required and to make such other repairs to said windows as may be necessary to make them as airtight as possible. 160.00\n\n(3) To make and install seven new Storm sashes (size 38\"x70\" - cut 18 lts.) and install new brickmoulding 85.00\n\n(4) To make and install one Stormdoor with frame (size 42\" x 71\") 20.00\n\n(5) Repair window frames and install new sills where required 40.00\n\n(6) Make and install two odd size Storm sashes 15.00\n\n(7) To paint all new woodwork two coats 30.00\n   Plus 10% 44.50\n\n$489.50\n\nThe Department will depend on you to see that Haid carries out in a satisfactory manner the work which he has offered to do.\n\n...........over\nWith reference to the latter part of your letter, I understand the school was built by the Brown Construction Company and presumably the roof was put on under their direction.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| QUANTITY | STOCK NO. | DESCRIPTION                  | PRICE | GROSS | DISCOUNT | NET   |\n|----------|-----------|------------------------------|-------|-------|----------|-------|\n| 1        |           | Only 2\u00bd gal.

It is also suggested that this new wiring be cabled in metal conduit. The approximate cost of this will not be more than $100.00.\n\nThe refrigerator and washing machine is directly connected to the main circuit by light wire and is continually blowing fuses. This arrangement is also dangerous and may cause fire. It is suggested that special wiring be installed, also enclosed in a metal conduit. This would eliminate the fire hazard and would give more power directly to the refrigerator and washing machine. Both these circuits are not operating at the present time and the repair is very urgent. The cost of the washing machine conduit would not be more than $150.00. The prices were submitted by Mr. Beck of Portage la Prairie.\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, 27th November, 1945.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant, the following expenditures for the Portage la Prairie Residential School are approved:\n\n(1) $100 - Material and labour to repair the fire alarm system.\n\n(2) $150 - For special wiring enclosed in a metal conduit in order to suitably operate the refrigerator and washing machine.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nGEORGE SPRIGGS, Chief.\n\nDecember 3rd, 1945.\n\nFIRE DEPARTMENT\n\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nMr. J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie.\n\nInspection of Indian School;\nPortage la Prairie.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHaving inspected the above building on December 1st 1945, re: fire protection, I would strongly recommend the following.\n\n(1) New hose, to replace that which is in service at present on the hose reels, as it is unfit for further service.\n\n(2) Three 2\u00bd gal. Soda-acid Fire extinguisher, be placed in basement, as there are no extinguishers there at the present time.\n\n(3) On the ground floor there are two foam type extinguishers, these should be replaced by the soda-acid type.\n\n(4) 300ft. of 2\u00bd\" cotton, rubber lined hose, (1) hydrant key, and (1) nozzle with \u00bd\" tip should be supplied for use on outside hydrant, this would give protection to the out buildings.\n\n(5) 1- lqt., vaporizing liquid extinguisher, should be placed in laundry.\n\n(6) Fire exit doors should be marked by signs and red lights, as the sleeping quarters are badly over crowded, 24 beds in one room 26ft X 30ft; the beds being only about three or four inches apart, with one bed blocking the exit door, but there was no other place for it.\n\n(7) Stovepipes from kitchen stove should be renewed, and the ceiling above same be protected by asbestos.\n\n(8) Valves on standpipes should be examined and repacked etc.\n\n(9) The spaces around the steam pipes where they pass through the floors should be covered with metal.\n\n(10) Quarter round should be put around edges of floors wherever necessary.\n\n(11) Two - Soda-acid Fire extinguishers should be placed in the small school room, as this is heated with a hot air furnace in the basement.\n\nSigned Geo. H. Spriggs,\nFire Chief.\nDuring a recent visit to the Portage Residential School, it was noted that one of the hose was in poor condition and I did not feel entirely satisfied with the general condition of the fire fighting equipment. I asked the Fire-Chief of the Portage la Prairie Fire-hall to make a complete inspection and let me have a report on his findings. A copy of his report is enclosed herewith. All hose and connections were tested and condemned. The hose is 2\" cotton.\n\nItem 4 deals with a hose and connections for the hydrant in the yard, which the Department pay a rental of $150.00 per year. This hose should be boxed near the hydrant and be ready for immediate use.\n\nThe fact of the beds being too close together has been brought to the attention of the Principal. It also has been noted that one bed blocks the passage to the fire escape.\n\nI beg to suggest that items, Nos. 1 to 5 be purchased by the Department, including item No.11 and that I be allowed to do the necessary fixing suggested in items 6 to 10.\n\nI also beg to request that I be allowed to engage the services of the fire-chief to make a visit to the Sandy Bay School for the purpose of inspecting the fire equipment there. The cost of the inspection at the Portage School will be approximately $5.00 and at the Sandy Bay School possibly $10.00 with an additions expense for travelling.

Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Huston called me this morning about the jacket heater in the school. I dismantled the heater and found the following damage:\n\nFound the boiler corroded rather badly and with a large amount of loose scale and a crack in the boiler at one side of the slice door, running 4\" up on the outside, across the bottom and approximately 6\" on the inside.\n\nIt is my experience that a repair of this nature is seldom satisfactory.\n\nThe cause of this damage, in my estimation, is that the scale has banked up under the fire door, causing an uneven heating of the boiler, resulting a strain on the casting and an eventual break. At the outlet of the boiler I took out a piece of scale 3\" long and two thirds the size of the outlet.\n\nThe size of the boiler is, Triumph Mogul, No. B.32, made by the Dominion Radiators, Serial No. 46004.\n\nI installed this boiler in 1944. The damage is not caused by a faulty boiler, but the water supply in the city having very heavy lime deposits.\n\nI would suggest a new boiler, as I do not think a satisfactory repair can be made on the old one.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.G. McKay.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6274, file 583-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept.

Mr. McKay is definite in his statement that to try and repair the boiler would not be satisfactory. He claims that the damage is not due to any negligence and that he has the same trouble with other boilers in the city.\n\nThis boiler is practically new. It was purchased in 1944, at a cost, with fittings of $212.00. Agency voucher No. 0,422, October 6, 1944.\n\nMr. McKay is doubtful if there is a new boiler of this type available.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. 126-1-5 dated Oct. 20, 1945.\n\nVoucher No. P. 853\n\nDate: February 1, 1946\nMr. Waite,\n\nIndian Agent,\nPortage La Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Waite;\n\nAn observant visitor to certain of our Indian Residential schools would ask why we have deliberately set out to make our residences such dull and unattractive places. I must confess that it might easily appear that we had done so intentionally. Some schools are as void of light illuminative colors as a medieval dungeon. Where an attempt has been made to introduce color dark brown floors and battleship gray walls has been the answer. The whole appearance is in many cases depressing. Hades could not appear more colorless, drab or forlorn. It would almost appear to the visitor that some other motive rather than the education of the child had possessed us. Have we lost sight of the fact that in the education of a child that its environment should stimulate rather than dull the senses. That brightness, cheerfulness and cleanliness create an atmosphere where little children respond.\n\nThose of us who have had to do with Indians over a period of years know that their existence is often hard and dull and colorless. That children born into this environment and nurtured there until the age of seven come into our schools with minds shadowed by the frustrations of their home existence. It's like accepting a plant that had sprouted in the cellar. It needs the atmosphere of Spring not the dullness of Winter. An Indian child more than the average White child needs to be transplanted into the type of environment that is Spring like in its warmth and color and cheer. His morose and frustrated mind needs to be induced out of its shell and infused with color and light and cheer. Only then will it live above the dissipation of less worthy thoughts.\n\nDuring my years in the North I discovered that an Indian's dog brought up in a certain way became imured to it, from puppyhood it had only known one manner of life and therefore in adulthood accepted it without protest. I know there are people who would argue keep the school more and more akin to condition on the Reserve because it will not be such a let down for the child who on graduation must return home. I would argue that the school should incorporate factors and means to develop the aesthetic side of the child's nature. This is not done through textbooks but by making his environment attractive. Lacking this there is a very grave danger that the Indian child will grow up like the Indian puppy content forever with life as it is because it is ignorant of a better way. We must make beautiful and attractive the child's environment hoping that time will make him a stranger to anything that is by comparison inferior. Later in life, perhaps on the Reserve the adult will create about him in so far as he can the environment native to his childhood. The hope of creating the inner urge for the betterment of conditions on the reserve lies in the quality of those things learned by the child.\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nThe Woman's Missionary Society\nThe United Church of Canada\n\nYou will agree Mr. Waite that I have attempted since taking charge of the above school a year ago to put this theory into practice. That I came to a school badly in need of attention. The encouraging thing has been that you and through you the Department at Ottawa have responded to my appeals for help in many ways.\n\nIn my impatience to make the building presentable in the minimum of time I have spent money I thought could be spared for the purpose from per capita grant and local sources. Board and clothing at the average Indian school can always be improved by greater expenditure, consequently a principal feels guilty diverting even surplus funds to other items.\n\nIt will not be necessary for me to enumerate to you who visits the school the various changes that have been wrought. Since your last visit we have redecorated and modernized two rooms with bright paint and light green inlaid linoleum. One of these rooms was the sewing room. It unfortunately is on the dark side of the school and requires artificial light all day. We installed a fluorescent light and the bright walls and floor covering creates a noon day atmosphere. New chairs have been purchased and all sewing machines repaired. The cost was just a fraction over two hundred dollars.\n\nOur main hall or corridor has to be lighted artificially. We had one of our men an amateur at painting go over all the walls, doors and ceiling with white paint. It has made a remarkable difference. Now we would like to have a professional painter go over all the work with a final coat of white. Mr. Green of our city would do the work at one third the price quoted by a local firm last Summer. We would like to see the loose linoleum taken from the floor and put in an upstairs corridor where it is badly needed and inlaid linoleum cemented down in its place. In selecting linoleum for this main hall we would like to have a six foot strip of moss green linoleum run the full length of hall and have a border on either side about six inches wide in a deep red or black.\n\nThis should add color and smartness to the very part of our building that is seen by every visitor. Mr. Green will do the painting and supply the labor in laying the linoleum for $100.00. He can do this now at the price I have stated where later on toward Spring the demands upon him are too great. I feel that every year we should aim to smarten up our school by doing something similar to what I now suggest. I have one of our own men painting away at our dormitories but I feel the main hall is work for a professional painter.\n\nOn an enclosed sheet I have stated the various things required also quantity and prices of same to carry out the decoration of our main corridor. Would you please present the request I now make to the department at Ottawa that they finance the proposed work. You might also remind them that we do need the linoleum badly and that the only difference between the linoleum I request and any other of similar quality is in the color and not in the price. I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He informed me that all five machines owned by the school are badly worn and that the present repair job will assist in extending their usefulness for but a brief period.\n\nActing on the advice I think the present is a good time to prepare for next year by making application right now for three new machines, treadle type. This would assure delivery before Christmas of this year.\n\nEnclosed is a circular from the Sewing Machine Company that may be of interest.

Production of new machines is again under way. Shipments are not equal to the tremendous demand, but machine orders for Schools and Institutions are given priority over those for household use.\n\nIf your school is in need of new equipment we shall be pleased to hear from you, either direct to us by letter or through our nearest shop. We will be pleased to take care of your order for special cabinet type Electrics designed for schoolroom use - or for regular type treadle machines.\n\nWe will allow a credit for any machines traded-in against the purchase of modern electric or new style treadle type.\n\nThe former generous discount to schools will again be allowed when the order stipulates the machines are for use in a classroom. There has been no increase in our prices in fifteen years, so the present offers a splendid opportunity to invest in new equipment.\n\nWe take this opportunity to advise you our nearest shop will be glad to provide prompt and efficient service in repairing machines now in use. Repair parts for Singer machines are always in stock.\n\nWe are not yet in a position to furnish Fashion Aids, such as Electric Irons, Buttonhole attachment, Zipper Feet, Zig-zagger, etc. etc. but we are assured all of these helps to sewing will be available before the opening of your Fall term.\n\nIf your teacher is in need of a book of instructions or paper Stitching Charts for Beginners, we shall be pleased to take care of your order.

(RG 10, Volume 6274, file 583-5, part 8)\nDear Mr. Phelan;\n\nA letter has just been received by our local Agent Mr. Waite from your office in which it is stated that your purchasing agent is unable to procure any other color than brown inlaid linoleum. It also stated that the brown linoleum was being purchased.\n\nIn the letter in which I requested this linoleum I went to great length trying to explain that I was trying to get away from dull drab colors within the school by the introduction of bright cheerful colors. It was quite a shock for me to learn that brown linoleum was being sent.\n\nThe colored linoleum does not cost one cent more than the brown. I went into the Portage hardware this morning and I saw six full size rolls of colored linoleum. I feel sure that if you granted me permission I could procure the desired colors here in the West.\n\nThe way the Department has responded to my appeals from time to time has been very encouraging. It certainly inspires one to do his best but please do not send me brown linoleum.\n\nCould it not be arranged that I could be granted permission to purchase the linoleum. I would of course keep within the price range that governs your purchasing agent. Last year you sent me brown linoleum and later granted me permission to exchange same for another color. Gaults in Winnipeg made the exchange without any extra cost.\n\nTrusting you may be able to withhold shipment of brown linoleum and grant me permission to secure locally linoleum of the same gauge but in colors requested in the first instance. I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: 127-1-5, December 7th, 1945.\n\nI beg to refer to paragraph 4 of Chief Geo. Spriggs, Fire Chief, Portage la Prairie, report on the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School.\n\nThe hydrant mentioned in his report is outside and should have the protection of a house for the hose. This fact was mentioned in the first paragraph of my letter covering the Chief's report.\n\nThere is a hydrant house in the yard of the Instructional Centre here, under the direction of D.V.A. I made inquiry about this house in April, at that time the Superintendent was away and I could not obtain definite information about acquiring it. I again visited the centre today and was informed that the matter had been taken up and the Superintendent suggested that the house be taken over as on loan at present. The house is surplus and will not be required at the centre and most likely will be broken up if left there. The cost of building a house would be expensive at the present time and the hose should be housed near the hydrant to be of use in an emergency.\n\nI beg to request authority to hire a truck for the purpose of removing the house to the school and the sum of $35.00 to place a cement base under the house. I estimate the cost of moving the house and setting it on a base would cost approximately $50.00.\nThe Superintendent is certain the house will never be required, it is surplus and although the house will be taken over as on loan, no further inquiry will be made about it.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 22, 1946.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant, the Department approves an expenditure of $85.00 to provide a house for the hydrant at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nThe attached letter and diagram of the electric feeder system of the Portage la Prairie Indian School was furnished by Mr. John Beck, Electrical Contractors, Portage la Prairie. The report and diagram are self explanatory.\n\nThe following are the parts required and the approximate cost of same.\n\n| Item                  | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Entrance switch       | $35.00 |\n| Fuse Box              | $40.00 |\n| Small parts           | $8.00  |\n| Service Conduit       | $15.00 |\n| 3 Phase Switch        | $10.00 |\n| Piping                | $10.00 |\n| Conduit pipe wire 60' | $6.00  |\n| Wire for old conduits, three, 1000 feet | $50.00 |\n| Extras                | $20.00 |\n| Gutter Box            | $10.00 |\n\nTotal: $204.00\n\nThe approximate cost of labour would be $110.00.\n\nMr. Beck claims that the report and diagram would give the Engineering Branch a good idea of the required parts, which could probably be purchased cheaper by the Department than he could buy them.\n\nIf this work is to be done by Mr. Beck, he requests that the diagram be returned to him.\n\nIndian Agent.\nPORTAGE ELECTRIC\nJOHN BECK AND GEORGE COLLEY\nELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS\n\nPORTAGE LA PRAIRIE, MANITOBA\nApril 26, 1946\n\nIndian Office,\nPost Office Bldg.,\nPortage la Prairie.\n\nRe Entrance Service,\nIndian Residential School.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nThe enclosed diagram parts could be fitted to present conduits on south wall, without much work. The present service conduit is broken and weathered out completely. Also the present old entrance switch is located badly and very old. The feeders to panels on each floor are only 2 wire 110 volts. If these are removed and replaced with new wire and three wire 110-220 Volt which would give better power factor and eliminate future trouble.\n\nThe fuse cabinet and gutter box could be supplied by Longley Electric Manufacturing Company, Winnipeg, and the wire required could be figured by the Dominion architect, except for fuses lengths to fuse panels on floors which a quantity could be sent and balance not used returned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJohn Beck\nA. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agency,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nI attach for your information correspondence received from Indian Agent Waite, with reference to a porch on the south side of the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School.\n\nThe current year's appropriation, included amount of $400.00 for the repairs and improvements for this school. The estimated cost of the porch is considerably higher, you will note, from the quotation I am forwarding.\n\nBesides sheeting, I understand from Mr. Waite's letter, we will have to incur expenditures this year for plumbing and piping.\n\nWith the above consideration in mind, do you think that the building of the porch could be postponed until next year.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nJune 1st, 1946.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School.\n\nVOTE 76 ALLOTMENT ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

The ideal time would be July and August. Church officials, perhaps government officials and women from all across Canada will be at the school during the latter part of August.

The colors once employed in their decoration have faded until the whole room in each case is dull and drab.

In the earlier letter a careful estimate was made by the N.J. Laidlaw contracting firm at Portage La Prairie and had to do with the erection of a porch over the South entrance to the above school. In the latter letter an estimate was submitted by H.E.

I regret that you have not seen fit to reply to my request and to date I have no way of knowing if you are in receipt of the letter that went through our local Indian office.\n\nIt had been planned that I should leave for holidays on July the second or third. Naturally I would like to know where I stand with reference to getting this paint job done before I leave. Would you please give this matter your immediate attention and reply by air mail.

Painting the dining-room -\n   Material and labour $135.00\n\n2. Painting junior classroom -\n   Material and labour $220.00\n\n3.

Among the defects he found was the roof which he reported being perforated in a good many places. Last night we had a gentle rain yet it was necessary to have four pails on the stairs to catch the drips. One or two bedrooms also suffered. Water like this running through the insulation in the ceilings on to the floors below certainly plays hob with the interior of the building. Will you please bring this matter to the attention of the Department.\"\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJUL 8 1946\n\nIndian Affairs.

Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the Principal's residence at the Portage la Prairie Residential School.\n\nI note from your letter that an engineer recently visited the school. We do not know who this was, as no instructions were issued by this Branch for such an official to inspect the buildings at Portage la Prairie.\n\nPlease let me have an estimate of the cost of repairing the roof.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nThe Woman's Missionary Society\nThe United Church of Canada\n\nMay 14/46\n\nMr. J.W. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage La Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Waite:\n\nEnclosed is a copy in triplicate of the estimate of cost to erect a porch over the entrance to the south end of our school residence. The contractor and his well founded reputation will need no introduction to you.\n\nYou will note in the estimate the stipulated size and construction of the proposed porch. Its quality and size apart from practical demands must be in keeping with the appearance of the main building. A careful perusal of the enclosed estimate and a mental comparison of prevailing costs should commend the statement to your judgment.\n\nThe entrance we propose to have covered by the porch is one being used by all the boys every time anyone of them feels inclined. Through it they go to the classrooms, the workshop, the barn, the skating rink and the playground. The male members of the staff use it continually. All the girls must pass through it at least eight times a day in going back and forth to the classrooms. One might say that the daily traffic of the girls alone is equal to that of four hundred people. The entrance now through wear and lack of repair demands that something be done immediately.\n\nThis entrance is just over our grocery store room. It is also right outside the boy's playroom. Since it opens to the outside and is unprotected from the wintry winds it becomes a sort of grief for most of the school year.\n\nThe proposed porch would overcome the distress just mentioned. It would have a door in each of its three outside walls so that one could use the door on the side sheltered from the wind. It would protect the steps leading down to the ground level and so eliminate the hazard of slippery steps all during the winter months. It will also provide a place where men and boys can change their barn and field attire before entering the residence. It is close to the skating rink and can be used by all children as a place for changing their footwear.\n\nThe general hospital within this city has a porch to their front entrance opening to the south similar in detail to the one I now recommend for our use. I feel if they had to have it that our need is a thousand times greater since we use our entrance just that many times more. After two winter putting up with the problem created by the exposure of our south entrance, I trust a definite move may now be made to adopt my suggested remedy. I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Reverend Principal, Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School relative to a porch he requests the Department have built on the south door of the school. At present there is a stone platform outside the door, with four stone steps. This door lets in a lot of cold winds, especially when the wind is in a southerly direction in the wintertime. The door is used continually and the porch will be used as an outside dressing room.\n\nThe cost of building this structure appears high. The intention is to have the porch well lighted during daylight hours, with sufficient room to accommodate a number of children who have been working around the barn or who will be changing to skating boots during the winter season. The removal of the stone platform and the steps will be undertaken by the school staff, without cost to the Department.\n\nI enclose a sketch of the proposed porch which will give some idea of what is proposed. The General Hospital has a porch of the same size for the admission of a wheeled ambulance.\n\nI wish to inform the Department that a further demand is expected this season for a shop for manual training with room for a laundry in the basement. The intention is to build this structure apart from the school, connected by a tunnel.\n\nI would be pleased to be advised the amount allotted to this school for improvements this year. There\nis also a possibility of a heavy expenditure for the renewal of plumbing and piping. The Engineering Branch are to furnish this estimate.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Repairs to Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, File 127-1-5, June 3rd.\n\nI note the appropriation allowed this year is $400.00, which amount will not begin to cover the repairs, let alone the required improvements.\n\nThe electrical work authorized certainly is required and it leaves little of the $400.00 provided.\n\nMr. Waite states there is a possibility of a heavy expenditure for the renewal of plumbing and piping and this work probably cannot be avoided. The Engineering Branch no doubt is in a position to say what is required and what expense will be involved. If this were known one would then be in a better position to give a decision on the new porch.\n\nThe porch will prove very useful and will conserve a lot of heat during the winter months. If the plumbing repairs are not too expensive and if funds can be made available, I think the porch should be authorized. On the other hand, if expensive urgent repairs to plumbing are required then Mr. Waite should be instructed to include at least $1200.00 in the school estimates for 1947-48 and earmark it for the porch.\n\nAs requested, your correspondence is returned.\n\nA.G.

(RG 10, Volume 6274, file 583-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School\n\nIn connection with Mr. Heey's memorandum of January 29, 1946 and your notations of February 1st thereon, you are advised as follows:\n\nOur Mr. Margreaves visited the school on June 20, 1946 and carried out an inspection of the Heating, Ventilating & Plumbing services, along with a general check-up of the building structure.\n\nIn a brief summary, it can be stated that a general deterioration has taken place in all of the mechanical services. It is apparent that very little maintenance has been carried out for some years, and many parts of the equipment are badly worn and cannot be satisfactorily repaired. The radiation is insufficient to properly heat the building to a temperature of 70\u00b0 Fahrenheit when the outside temperature is at 30\u00b0 below zero.\n\nIt was particularly noticed throughout the building, however, that everything was meticulously clean and fresh, as regards paint work and general cleanliness.\n\nGoing into some detail, the following is an outline of conditions as they exist at the present time.\n\nThe steam heating system is a one pipe job, and there is not enough radiation to adequately balance the heat loss. Generally, the radiation is approximately 25% low, with varying discrepancies in different parts of the building. The general layout of piping is of fair design, but in many cases movement, caused by expansion and contraction, has resulted in leaky connections. The radiator air valves are in very poor shape, with every evidence pointing to a serious deterioration in the packing; another cause of leaks. Most valves are without handles; the stems have been mutilated so badly that handles could not be fitted. The radiator air vents have been tampered with so often, that only a few are in their normal upright position, and therefore, are not functioning as intended. No attention has been given to making the necessary provisions for expansion, by the use of offsets, etc.\n\nThe boiler is a horizontal return tubular type, enclosed in a brick setting. The brick work has deteriorated badly in places, and the steel front has been cracked over the fire door, and poorly welded. The grates are warped, and are not in good condition. It was stated by the engineer-caretaker, that when Mr. Hose carried out his inspection, and an attempt was made to raise a steam pressure, some of the joints in the boiler...\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nJoints in the boiler room piping leaked badly, and there is every reason to believe that the entire piping system has plenty of leaky joints as the piping and covering is badly deteriorated.\n\nA system of this design should operate under a small pressure, 1 to 2 lbs., for good results; but it is not possible under existing conditions to do this.\n\nGenerally the radiation is 25% low, and in some individual rooms, the radiation is as much as 50% low, without taking into consideration the condition of the windows. In this connection the Boys' Recreation Room has 140 sq. ft. of radiation, where 226 sq. ft. is required. This is 60% low. The Girls' Recreation Room has 136 sq. ft. where 235 sq. ft. is required. This is 26% low. Varying discrepancies were noted throughout the building.\n\nBy calculation, the Basement is about 23% low, and with the radiators located at the ceiling, larger ones should have been installed to compensate for stratification of heat at the ceiling.\n\nMany of the visible leaks over the windows, which were thought to be caused by structural faults, can be laid to pipe connections.\n\nThe Ventilating System exists in name only. It was laid out for gravity operation with heating coils placed in the air stream to induce circulation. This system is totally inadequate, and the design is quite obsolete. The system is not used now. The fresh air registers are incorrectly located, and the same can be said for the exhaust registers. The duct work appears to be fairly substantial, and is in relatively good condition. This system could be mechanized at comparatively reasonable cost and put into satisfactory operation. It is badly needed.\n\nThe Plumbing System does not present a serious problem. While blockages have occurred, we would hesitate to blame the system. Some lines should be thoroughly cleaned periodically, and some checking should be done on the use of the fixtures in the Pupils' Bathrooms. Some of the leaks and blockages could be attributed to careless use of fixtures. Some faucets need replacing, and all exposed traps should be cleaned.\n\nNo complaints were made of any shortage of hot water, but the hot water faucets should be kept in better working order.\n\nSome structural observations were made and the following points are raised. Nearly all the windows are badly in need of repairs. The frames themselves seem to be in fairly good condition but the sash in nearly all cases is so loose that it would be hard or impossible to put into a satisfactory condition. The meeting rails do not fit together, the stops are in many cases as much as \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) to \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\) away from where they should be. Most windows, in addition to having double hung sash, have inside opening casements acting as dorm sash. These casements are very poorly fitted and the fastening devices are in a poor state of repair.\n\nMuch heat is lost from this window condition and repairs are imperative...\nAll leaks cannot be laid to the heating or plumbing system. The roof is in bad shape. Asbestos cement shingles laid diagonally on sheathing strips have become loose and have been displaced in different areas. Looking up from inside the roof space, one can see a great number of holes all over, giving the appearance of a sieve. The galvanized iron flashing and ridge has rotted in many places and the galvanized eaves troughing is broken away and is in generally poor condition.\n\nGeneral Recommendations\n\nIt was pointed out by the Principal, that there is a possibility of installing laundry machinery at this school. If so, high pressure steam will be required and a new boiler would be necessary. One high pressure steam steel portable type boiler could be made to handle all the services and is therefore recommended. A return pump would be needed also.\n\nThe ventilating system should be remodeled and put into operation.\n\nAll windows, with one or two exceptions, should have extensive repairs.\n\nIt is felt also that a new roof should be laid.\n\nCracks in the mortar joints and brickwork should be repaired.\n\nPlumbing and drainage lines should be cleaned, and all leaking faucets repaired or replaced as may be found necessary.\n\nAll steam mains from the boiler room should be made tight throughout, and every radiator valve replaced. Those radiators in public spaces, dormitories, recreation rooms and classrooms should be fitted with low shield valves. Additional radiation should be located in those rooms which are under heated. All radiator air vents should be replaced and the present tappings plugged and new tappings made to receive vents.\n\nIf new laundry equipment is to be provided for the school in the near future, it is recommended that the existing low pressure heating boiler be replaced by a new steel portable type high pressure steam boiler having capacity to provide for all services requiring steam. The estimated cost of this installation plus repairs to the mechanical services would be roughly $5,000.00.\n\nIf new laundry equipment is not to be provided, it is felt that the existing heating boiler could be made to serve the heating and ventilating requirements for several years yet, provided it is thoroughly overhauled. An approximate saving of $2,000.00 might be effected.\n\nA number of important repairs to the building are vitally necessary and it is recommended that at least 48 windows be repaired, the roof replaced, and new flashing and eaves' troughing provided. The estimated cost of structural repairs, apart from work on the mechanical services, would be approximately $5,500.00.\n\nIn view of the...\nIn view of the complicated nature of the mechanical repairs considered necessary, it is unlikely that a contractor would submit a lump sum quotation. It is felt, therefore, that if work is approved and authorized, it should be carried out under Mr. Gow's supervision, from data and instructions previously in this office, and that Mr. Gow should be authorized to arrange for purchasing materials and obtaining the services of skilled tradesmen, to the best advantage locally. An inspection by an officer from Ottawa would be required before final payment was made.\n\nT.S. Miller\nChief Engineer\nOttawa, August 1st, 1946.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe: Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nReference is made to your memorandum of January 29th last relative to the above.\n\nInspection of this building including its heating and plumbing equipment was made in June last by Mr. A.H. Hargreaves of our Engineering and Construction Service staff and for your information I am enclosing a copy of Mr. Mills' memorandum of July 31st in which Mr. Hargreaves' recommendations are embodied.\n\nIn brief, Mr. Mills states that vitally necessary repairs to the building are estimated to cost $3,500.00. If it is decided that laundry machinery is not to be installed, the existing heating boiler can be made to serve heating and ventilating requirements and the necessary repairs and alterations to the mechanical services are estimated to cost $6,000.00. If, however, laundry machinery is to be installed the use of the existing boiler will have to be retained and in addition a new boiler will be necessary increasing the estimated cost to $8,000.00.\n\nMr. Mills' recommendations as to how the work should be proceeded with, are concurred in. Will you kindly advise us as to your wishes in this matter so that necessary instructions can be sent Mr. Gow as soon as possible. If it is decided that no laundry machinery is to be installed the sum of $9,500.00 should be transferred to our Engineering and Construction Service. If laundry machinery is to be...\ninstalled, the amount should be $11,500.00.\n\nJ.M. Hardle,\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, August 9, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, SURVEYS and ENGINEERING BRANCH.\n\nRe: Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of August 1st, with reference to the inspection of this building by Mr. A.H. Hargreaves.\n\nThe report that you have forwarded to this office has been very carefully studied. In preparing our appropriation for the fiscal year we were not aware that such an expenditure for improvements would be required at this school. We find many similar requests for large expenditures at other Indian Residential Schools and as a consequence the funds at our disposal do not permit us giving approval of the recommendations that have been received.\n\nWe can provide an amount of $3500.00 for the necessary repairs to the building and this amount will be transferred to your Branch.\n\nWe can provide an additional amount of $1000.00 which might be sufficient to make repairs to the heating and plumbing systems so that they will operate in a reasonably satisfactory manner for the coming winter.\n\nThe amounts requested in your memorandum will receive attention when we prepare our estimates for the fiscal year 1947-48 and the necessary work can be done during the summer of 1947.\n\nDirector.\nPARKHILL BEDDING LIMITED\n\nMANUFACTURERS OF BETTER BEDDING\nUPHOLSTERED LIVING-ROOM FURNITURE\n\nCUSTOMER'S COPY\nNotre Dame and Erin Sts.\nWINNIPEG.\n\nMarch 5, 1946\n\nINVOICE No. 831\nTERMS 906 Net 30 days\n\nSALESMAN\n\nDEPT.

(RG 10, Volume 6274, file 583-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Phelan;\n\nThis happens to be Sunday. It is not the day we usually choose for writing business letters but I trust it may be excused under the circumstances.\n\nIt is pouring rain outside, the third big rain thus far in what looks to be the beginning of the Autumn wet spell. Our present distress lies not in what is happening out of doors but in the fact that the rain on each occasion comes through our perforated roof. At present we have five pails on the steps to catch the drip that has leaked through two stories to the main floor level. You can hear the drip into the pails half way through the building.\n\nThis could be laughed at providing one was in an old barn where there was nothing to take hurt. One could always shift one's position to a dry spot somewhere. When this happens in this fine building I do not think of myself or the comfort of others, I think rather of the destruction that rain creates with the walls, the floors and with the insulation in the ceilings.\n\nLooking back over correspondence dated ten or more years ago our roof over the school residence was giving plenty of trouble. It has been a source of grief ever since. Mr. Weite our local Agent and Mr. Hamilton the Superintendent I feel sure would confirm this statement. The Engineers that were here two months ago reported the need for a new roof.\n\nThe present roof is old and worn through. The color has faded and departed with its usefulness. The time has come for a complete new covering before the sheeting and rafters underneath rot with the wet. I fear the effect of rain water getting into the chemical insulation between the studding that supports the top floor ceiling.\n\nWhatever is decided upon with reference to this roof should be done at once before the real wet spell and before cold weather makes it slippery and cold and dangerous for men to work at such a height on a steep roof. Trusting for the sake of the interior of the building action will be taken immediately. I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This amount will cover only some of the more outstanding items, as we did not provide in our estimates for the amount of $11,500.00, which is the total requested in the Surveys and Engineering report on your school. The demands for expenditures at practically all our Indian Residential Schools have been abnormally high this year for many obvious reasons. The funds at our disposal will not permit the total expenditure.\n\nI have referred your letter to the Surveys and Engineering Branch so that they will give priority in the expenditure of the available sum to the repair of the roof.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Purchase Order 7426 was issued on December 28th, 1945, to Gutta Percha & Rubber Ltd. for 6 - 50 foot lengths of hose, 1 nozzle and 1 hydrant key. These items were shipped to the school on January 30th, 1946, and the account amounting to $238.62 was forwarded by the Principal, Mr. Huston and paid. In view of this we cannot understand your statement that the fire hose has not been received and the school therefore is without adequate fire protection. Please let me hear from you with regard to this matter.\n\nWe presume from the second and third paragraphs of your letter that you are unable to carry out the arrangements recommended in your letter of May 14th. Under these circumstances an expenditure not exceeding $250.00 is approved for building a house over the hydrant. However, I hope you will be able to keep the expenditure below this amount.\n\nFor your information, may we give the following expenditures that have been either incurred or authorized at this school during the current fiscal year:\n\n1.

H. Cairns\"\n\nWHC/SH\nOttawa, October 31st, 1946.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRe: Structural Repairs to Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, Manitoba.\n\nFollowing our memorandum to you of September 5th last and your notation thereon of 6/9/48 in regard to the above, we forwarded to Mr. D.B. Gow at Winnipeg, specifications of the repair work required to be done and also instructed him to arrange for carrying out such work by day labour to the best advantage locally. Precedence was to be given to the roof repairs and expenditures were not to exceed the amount of $3,500.00 provided by Indian Affairs.\n\nIn a letter dated September 26th Mr. Gow stated that he, in company with Mr. W.H. Wallace, Engineer of his staff, and a contractor of Portage la Prairie inspected the School and noted the various repairs required. Mr. Gow stated that whereas we had contemplated stripping off the existing hexagonal roof shingles and resurfacing with new rectangular asbestos cement, or asphalt shingles, he finds that (a) new asbestos shingles are at present unobtainable; (b) the roof boarding and tar paper are defective, and (c) the present shingles are very largely in good condition and could be reused along with an additional quantity of the same pattern, which he has hopes of obtaining, to make a first class roofing job.\n\nHe also stated that it would not be possible to carry out the roof repairs by day labour as he could not obtain the proper labour, or materials, and that no local firms are in a position to carry out the work.\n\nRegarding the repairs to leaky windows, which we had specified to be refitted with new stops and brickmoulds, etc., Mr. Webb states:\n\n\"The matter of repairs to windows has been reviewed and it is now intended to utilize metal weatherstrip. Winnipeg firms are being requested to examine the windows and to quote prices covering such work\".\n\nUnder date of October 17th, Mr. Gow advised that he had arranged with the Peace Weatherstrip Supply Company, of Winnipeg, to install weatherstripping at a cost of $440.00.\n\nWe have now received a further letter from Mr. Gow, dated October 26th, with which he forwarded a tender from the Canadian Rogers Sheet Metal and Roofing Limited, of Winnipeg, Encls. for repairs to the School roofs, copies of which we are transmitting for your information and that of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\n(over)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6274, file 583-5, part 8)\nIn his covering letter Mr. Gow states:\n\n\"We have endeavoured to secure estimate from other firms but have failed to interest any of them in giving us quotations.\"\n\nYou will note that the tender received is for roofing repairs only and that it includes the removal and relaying of the present shingles with renewals, as necessary.\n\nThe amount of $5,500.00 for this work is, in our opinion, high but Mr. Gow has been unable to obtain any other tenders and the matter of repairing the School roofs is an urgent necessity for the preservation of the building, as well as for the reasonable comfort of the occupants.\n\nIt is probable that the other structural work consisting of mastic caulking to the brickwork and window frames, the insulation of ceilings and carpentry work, which is required to complete the weatherproofing of the School building will, under present conditions, involve an additional cost of at least $1,500.00 but this work, although necessary, is not as urgently needed as the first named repairs, and it might be held over until the summer of 1947.\n\nIt is suggested, therefore, that the Indian Affairs Branch be asked whether, under the circumstances, an additional amount of $2,500.00 could be provided to make up a total of $8,000.00 permitting the roofing repairs and weatherstripping to be carried out this year.\n\nIn view of the lateness of the season, it is requested that an early decision be made in the matter of acceptance of the enclosed tender, and we will await your instructions in regard thereto.\n\nWe have received advice from Mr. Gow that the amount of $1,000. allotted by Indian Affairs for one phase of the work required on the heating system will also likely be exceeded, but as the tender submitted required clarification, we have asked Mr. Gow to advise us further before we report on that division of the work.\n\n(Sgd.)

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Revisions and Additions to Heating System, Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of October 31st, 1946, in connection with the above, you are advised as follows:\n\nMr. Gow has informed us that no plumbing and heating firms in Portage la Prairie were interested in the above work and refused to quote. However, he contacted a Winnipeg firm, Messrs. Randall and Company, who were highly recommended to him, and they have offered to do the work outlined in our specification for the sum of $2,704.00.\n\nIn view of the transportation of workmen and materials, and the somewhat complicated nature of the work, this price does not seem unreasonable. It is noted that Indian Affairs allotted $1,000.00 for this phase of the work, a sum which we felt was inadequate, but which we did not feel inclined, at the time to criticise, until estimates had been received from Mr. Gow.\n\nIn the strictest sense, no actual emergency has arisen through existing inconsistencies in the heating system, but it is again pointed out that the amount of radiation is generally 25% low and in some rooms as much as 50% low, which, in addition to causing discomfort, is a potential hazard to the health of the occupants.\n\nAfter thoroughly considering the requirements, it is our opinion that if any part of this phase of the work is omitted the results will be questionable. We, therefore,\nrecommend that Indian Affairs be asked to provide the sum mentioned and authorize acceptance of the Randall tender at once, if the School is to receive any benefit from the work this winter.\n\n(Sgd.)

Randall and Company to do this work at $2704.00 be accepted, is concurred in, but if this is to be done a further amount of $1704.00 in addition to the $2500.00 referred to in your memorandum of November 7th will be required.\n\nPlease advise of your wishes in this matter as soon as possible.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, 18 November 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR SURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Revisions and Additions to Heating System,\nPortage la Prairie Indian Residential School, Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to the above, we approve your proceeding with the necessary revisions and additions to the heating system at the Portage la Prairie School.\n\nThe representative of the Treasury will be requested to transfer to you, an additional amount of $1,704.00.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, 18 November 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nPlease transfer an additional amount of $1,704.00 to the Surveys and Engineering Branch for urgent repairs to the heating system at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, No. 583.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, 18 November 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR SURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Revisions and Additions to Heating System,\nPortage la Prairie Indian Residential\nSchool, Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to the above, we approve\nyour proceeding with the necessary revisions and\nadditions to the heating system at the Portage la\nPrairie School.\n\nThe representative of the Treasury will\nbe requested to transfer to you, an additional\namount of $1,704.00.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, 18 November 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nPlease transfer an additional amount of $1,704.00 to the Surveys and Engineering Branch for urgent repairs to the heating system at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, No. 583.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, 14 November 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENT PURCHASING AGENT\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of March 18, 1946, File 63241-15-7 Man., we enclose an account amounting to $141.00 covering the cost of Marblesium purchased for the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School.\n\nPlease issue purchase order so that the account may be paid.

This hose is very old, and I consider it to be very unsafe for fire hose.\n\nThis has not been done to date.\n\nThe amount required is 400 ft of 2-inch, unlined linen hose, and would strongly recommend that same be purchased and installed as soon as possible.\n\nI am, yours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nFire Chief.\nPortage la Prairie\nManitoba.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\n15th November 1946.\n\nFurther to my letter of October 11th, in which I asked for 50' length of 2\" linen hose, I am now in receipt of the attached report from the local Fire chief, in which he recommends that 400' of this hose should be purchased for adequate fire protection.\n\nJ.

You are aware that we have already supplied 300 feet of hose - reference our letter of Sept. 17 - and when you requested an additional 50 feet, we wrote to Inspector Hamilton on Oct. 21st asking him to purchase the hose either in Winnipeg or Portage la Prairie.

However, after the building of the hydrant house, I requested the Fire Chief of Portage la Prairie to inspect the house and arrange to attach the 300 feet of hose to the hydrant. This was outside hose for the protection of the outbuildings and the outside of the school surroundings. While on the premises the Chief inspected the inside fire hose and found that the hose was badly worn and requested that 400 feet of unlined linen hose be purchased for the inside hydrants. I asked the Chief to submit his report in writing and this was forwarded to the Department under cover of agency letter dated November 15. In the meantime, I requested Mr. Inspector Hamilton to hold up the purchase of the 50 feet of hose until such time as the Fire Chief's report could be forwarded to the Department.\n\nThe Fire chief still maintains that the purchase of this inside hose is necessary if the children are to be fully protected.\n\nJ.

Due to material shortages, I was unable to obtain the required materials. It would be possible\nPORTAGE ELECTRIC\nJOHN BECK AND GEORGE COLLEY\nELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS\n\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba,\n\n-2-\n\nfor you to supply such materials\nand your architect map out\nthe service and parts from\nthe enclosed diagram for that\nsuggested service, together with\n3 Phase 60 Amp. Service 220 Volt\nand to remove present wires to\nfuse panels and replace with 3\nwire 110 to 220 feeders?\n\nYou will see on the drawing\nthe sizes of present fuses consist\nwhich would be satisfactory with\n3 wire system. Also, the Rochester\nElectric Range is powered from\nsuch a great distance that it has\na low power factor. I have not\nmarked lighting, which lamps are\nsomewhat circled in size.\nHowever, their locations are the same\nas in original plan, which I expect\nyou have on file.\n\nYours truly,\nPortage Electric.\n\nRev.

In reviewing previous correspondence it is noted that you request 400 feet of 2\" hose. Please let us know if you require this in one length or in several lengths. If the latter is required, you should state the number of feet required in each length.\n\nWe regret to cause you any unnecessary inconvenience but we have had a great deal of difficulty in securing the proper type and size of hose. We consequently require the additional information requested above.\n\nIt is presume that new couplings will also be needed.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nJanuary 15th, 1947.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRe: Portage La Prairie Indian Residential School, Manitoba.\n\nIn connection with the structural repairs and alterations to the heating system at the above, you are advised as follows:\n\nMr. Gow has informed us that the Canadian Rogers Sheet Metal and Roofing Ltd., are prepared to carry out work in their quotation at a price of $6,500.00. This includes repairs to the roof only, and omits other repairs to the interior of the building, estimated to cost in the neighborhood of $1,500. The Canadian Rogers Sheet Metal and Roofing Ltd., state however, that they will not be in a position to proceed with the work until after the end of our fiscal year, but are prepared to undertake operations at their quoted price next spring, and to complete their work by June 1st. next.\n\nRegarding the heating alterations and additions, Randell and Co. Ltd., of Winnipeg, are prepared to complete the work outlined in their quotation, which is in accordance with our specification, before March 31st next, except that due to price increases since their figure was submitted, $185.00 has been added, raising the total from $2,704.00 to $2,889.00.\n\nWe are arranging, therefore, for the Departmental Purchasing Agent to issue a Purchase Order to Randell and Co. Ltd., for the supply of materials and labour in accordance with their revised tender. When this Purchase Order is issued a copy will be forwarded to Mr. Gow, together with instructions regarding supervision to be supplied from his office.\n\nTo carry out work at the School an amount totalling $8,704.00 has been transferred by Indian Affairs from which items as follows will be met:\n\nRandall & Co. Ltd., (Heating) $2,889.00\nH. J. Denius (Weatherstripping) 472.00\nContingencies & Supervision 343.00\n\n$3,704.00\n\nOn this basis, it will be in order to return $5,000.00 to the Indian Affairs Branch. However, if the balance of the work required at this institution is to be carried out during 1947, Indian Affairs should be prepared to provide funds as follows:\n\nRoof repairs (Canadian Rogers quotation) $6,500.00\nStructural items (Sash, frames, plaster, painting, etc., estimated) 1,500.00\nContingencies and Supervision 700.00\n\nTOTAL $8,470.00\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe: Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, Manitoba.\n\nEnclosed herewith is a copy of a memorandum from our Engineering and Construction Service summarizing expenditures for work in hand at and proposed for the above mentioned school.\n\nIt is indeed unfortunate that it will not be possible to repair the roof before the end of the present fiscal year but it appears that there is no alternative but to postpone this work until next spring. Steps will be taken to transfer to you the $5,000 which will remain unexpended this year.\n\nYou will note that the sum of $8,470.00 will be required to meet the proposed repair programme for this school during the fiscal year 1947-48.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, 21 January 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR SURVEYS & ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School,\nManitoba\n\nWe have your memorandum of Jan. 16th with reference to repairs at the above-mentioned school.\n\nIt is noted that you are arranging to transfer to this Branch an amount of $5,000.00 which will be unexpended during the current fiscal year.\n\nDirector\nJanuary 21st, 1947.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe: Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nYour memorandum of December 31, 1946, and a copy of a letter from the Portage La Prairie electric company, as well as a sketch referred to therein concerning the electrical system at the above school have been carefully studied by our Engineering and Construction Service.\n\nIt is evident from the information available that certain changes in the electrical system will be necessary. However, before definite recommendations can be made it will be necessary for an electrical engineer to visit the school to make a detailed study of the electrical system. We hope to have a man available for this job in about two months' time.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could inform us of any other unsatisfactory conditions concerning electrical systems in buildings in this general area that our engineer might look into and report on when he makes his visit to Portage la Prairie.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, 24 January 1947.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg., Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nIn a letter dated December 18th, Indian Agent Waite forwarded sketches made by the Portage Electric Company of the wiring in the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School.

I would like to see the services continued over a period of seven months; we have our furnace going for the seven months in the year. When the Night-Watchman is on duty the Staff and the Principal rest much better as they know the building is being patrolled, not only to watch for fire hazards but to check on any disturbances outside or inside the building.\n\nThe Salary granted for these responsible services is entirely inadequate. I cannot expect the type of man we need for this work to give his services for $40.00 per month. I am paying $60.00 per month.\n\nMay I therefore ask for an increased grant for Night Watchman from the present grant of $200.00 for the year to $420.00 for seven months services.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the spring the water floods the chicken house and there is no way to drain it. I am proposing to fill this in to a depth of 15 inches.\n\nThe shed for storage of tractor should have a concrete floor put in there. Also the garage floor should be raised 6 inches. To complete the work on these three buildings we shall require:\n\n- 48 yds of gravel\n- 4 yds of sand\n- 150 sacks of cement.\n\nIf the Department could supply this material we will do the work ourselves.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph Jones\n\n(Rev.) Joseph Jones.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nMay 17, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to attach hereto a letter received from Mr Jones, Principal, Portage la Prairie Residential School, in which he asks for an approximate sum of $275.00 for the raising of the floor in the poultry house and a concrete floor in the tractor shed and garage. It is the Principal's intention to again raise poultry and he has at present 150 chicks. This sideline was discontinued by his predecessor. This spring the floor of the poultry house was flooded. The floor is below ground level, with a cement wall approximately 18 inches. This filled in completely with water in the early spring. Most of this water was run-off from the yard. I would recommend that the floor be built up level with the outside, at a cost mentioned above.\n\nThe Principal asked for three oil burner units for the cookstove. He claims that wood fuel is becoming too expensive. He is obtaining prices on these units and they will be submitted to the Department at a later date. On inquiry regarding these units for cooking purposes, I am informed that at present they are not satisfactory.\n\nHe also wishes a built-in refrigerator. At present he has two units, which he claims are not large enough for the purpose required. This is probably true as he now has an ample supply of milk and will find it difficult to keep during the summer months. A price on building this refrigerator will be obtained and later forwarded to the Department.\n\nFire equipment was carefully checked. Was informed that fire-drill is carried out. A number of the soda extinguishers were requiring refilling and a requisition will be forwarded to the Department for material in the course of a few days.\n\nThe fire-escape platform is too small. In the event\nof a fire in the building, the platform would likely be overcrowded and accidents might occur. I would suggest that the platform be extended fifteen to twenty feet along the side of the building. This job should be looked into by an engineer. This matter was taken up with Mr. Gow in Winnipeg, but instructions would have to come from the Department, before he would attend to the matter.\n\nAt the present time gasoline for the tractor is being stored in a shed between the buildings. I informed the Principal that this is strictly against all fire prevention regulations. The building is not even tin lined. I suggested that he obtain costs on a 500 gal. tank and distributor. The tank should be underground. Costs of this will also be forwarded, as soon as received.\n\nMy understanding is, that the school roof, painting and a change in the electric wiring will be carried out this summer.\n\nJ.

Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPORTAGE LA PRAIRIE, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Waite:\n\nWill you give consideration to the following suggestions re improvements to the equipment of this school.\n\nInstallation of 500 gallon storage tank -\nAt present our gasoline is stored in barrels in a wood shed. This I consider a fire hazard. The underground tank with pump will be the safest way to store gasoline. I will secure prices later and submit them to you.\n\nOil Burners for kitchen range -\nOur range has three fire boxes and is fitted as a wood burner. It consumes large quantities of wood and the price of cord wood at the present time is very high. I am having to pay $8.50 a cord for slabs. Oil burners would be very much more economical. These oil burners burn distillate which is not explosive unless heated to a very high temperature. This type of burner has been installed in many households and would be quite safe to install in our range. The approximate price for the three fireboxes would be about $450.00. I will secure definite prices later.\n\nWalk-in Refrigerator -\nAt present we do not have adequate refrigeration for the proper care of our perishable foodstuffs. We have the ideal location for a walk-in refrigerator and I would like to discuss this question with your engineers when they next visit the school.\nSewage connection to Scullery -\nIn the scullery where the children's dishes are washed there is no sewage connection. The waste water has to be carried out and poured down the drain in the kitchen. This method involves a lot of extra labour and is far from satisfactory in every way. Could we have a large sanitary sink installed and connected with the drain? The present equipment in use is far from adequate.\n\nRepairs to steps at Boys' Entrance -\nSome cement work is necessary here which could be done at a cost of approximately $30.00.\n\nRepairs to Maple Flooring -\nThere are many places in the school where the maple flooring is worn through. To patch up these places we shall require about 350 sq. feet of maple flooring. I am well aware that this type of flooring is difficult to obtain at the present time.\n\nPainting in Main Building -\nThe interior and exterior of the two balconies on the west side of the building should be painted.\n\nFire Extinguishers -\nTwo new fire extinguishers, Gardene, made by Pyrene Mfg. Co., 91 East Don Roadway, Toronto.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph Jones\n\n(Rev.) Joseph Jones.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nFurther to my report of the\n17th instant on the Portage la Prairie\nIndian Residential School, I enclose\nherewith a letter received from the\nPrincipal of the said school in which he\nmakes certain requests.\n\nIndian Agent.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nMay 20, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept.

Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage-la-Prairie,\n\nDear Mr. Waite,\n\nThere are quite a number of necessary repairs to the buildings here and I require the materials to carry out this work. I have put in the cement floors in garage, chicken house, and farmers workshop and garage for tractor. Mr. Huston had previously asked for grant for this work; he had ordered sash from Haid's and other materials from Hamilton; the contractor these firms have been too busy to attend to this work. I can get the sash for Farmers workshop and chicken house from Brown & Rutherfords of Winnipeg. I require your sash and four storm sash for the workshop and ten storm sash for the chicken house also for the chicken house I require lumber as follows:\n\nFor nests:\n- 4 pieces 1\" X 12\" X 14'\n- 6 \" 1\" X 12\" X 10'\n- 12 \" 1\" X 6\" X 14'\n- 2 \" 2\" X 4\" X 10' Fir\n\n200 Sq. Ft. of common flooring Spruce (dropping Board)\n200 Lin. Ft. of 2 x 2 x Spruce for roosts\n50 ft. 6\" siding.\n\nFor the chicken House and Farmers Workshop I require fire-proof chimneys. These can be procured from Selkirk Metal Products Co. of Winnipeg at a cost of $38.00 each. These chimneys are cheaper and very much safer than brick chimneys and they are perfectly insulated. They are used extensively by the Hudson's Bay Co. through the North Country. The Department Day Schools ought to be using them in the North.\n\nTen year ago I built a skating rink and it now requires repairing for the approaching season. Next Year it should be rebuilt. For the repair I require:\n- 40 pieces of 1\" X 8\" X 16\" common Spruce\n- 40 \" 2\" X 4\" x 16 \"\n\nI am anxious to complete this work before Winter sets in.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nSome time ago, the Director of Indian Affairs asked us for information in regard to absolutely essential structural repair work at the above school about which there had been considerable correspondence last year.\n\nMr. Hoey also stated that Indian Agent Waite had suggested certain changes to the fire escape landings at the school and it was proposed that we ask Mr. D.H. Gow, District Chief Engineer, Dominion Water and Power Bureau at Winnipeg, to investigate and submit an estimate of the cost of carrying out the Agent's suggestion.\n\nOn October 16th last, we wrote to Mr. Gow and have now received a long letter in reply, which may be summed up as follows:\n\nMr. Gow states that the situation in regard to materials and labour for structural repair work at the school is now becoming somewhat easier, and it may be possible to interest firms in submitting tenders in 1948 in the carrying out of such work.\n\nRegarding Indian Agent Waite's suggestion for changes to the landing of the exterior fire escapes from the upper floors, Mr. Gow states that an examination was recently made and the situation was discussed with Mr. Jones, School Principal, and the Indian Agent. He advised that the escapes are of standard steel construction and that the platforms appear to be sufficiently large for their purpose. Pole fire escapes from the two top floor rear dormitories running through enclosed porches have been replaced by wooden staircases as alternative emergency exits.\n\nMr. Gow criticizes these exits as, being within enclosed porches, they provide in themselves a considerable fire hazard. He states that the provision of slide exits directly from the Senior Boys and Senior Girls Dormitories to the ground should receive consideration rather than any alterations in connection with the two rear staircases.\n\nWe are asking Mr. Gow to submit a definite recommendation covering the emergency escape requirements at the school together with an estimate of cost of carrying out the same, and as soon as we have received such information from him, we will transmit it to you for Indian Affairs.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary,\nSupt. of W.L.Care & Training.\n\nDear Mr Neary,\n\nThe voucher for allowance for the June Quarter for Manual Instructor was forwarded to the local Indian Agent for his signature. I phoned to the office this morning and they are now looking into the matter. I have included this item in the voucher I have forwarded to the Indian Agent this morning.\n\nIn reference to our electric light system a report was sent some time ago by a local electrician, pointing out that a three-wire system should be installed in the place of the present two wire, this latter was adequate when first installed, but now with the increased use of electricity it is insufficient.\n\nThe workshop has been wired for light and power. I want the Hydro to connect direct to their power lines to the shop and this involves a meter at the shop, the cost will be at the expense of the Hydro with the possible exception of the cost of one pole to carry the wire.\n\nI have always been interested in this branch of our educational work and I am anxious to make it as successful as possible. Our Indian boys can be trained in practical subjects as I know from past experience.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph Jones\nIndian Residential School\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba\n\nNovember 26th 1947\n\nMr. J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nCity.\n\nDear Mr. Waite,\n\nThere are several repair items that should receive immediate attention to put our equipment in good shape.\n\nFirst, The water works are wanting to put in a meter for the water we are using in the barn. Up to the present we have been paying a flat rate of $2.75 per month. From the main pipe we have a galvanised pipe which I installed in 1936; this pipe has rusted in places and the City Engineer would not venture to attach meter to this; if this pipe should break it would flood the root cellar and destroy all our stored vegetables; the engineer recommends that we put a lead pipe from the main and shut off at that point to prevent flooding if at any time a pipe should break. May I have authority to have the city do this work.\n\nSecond, The wiring in the chicken house is in very poor shape and dangerous, the pipes are rusted. The present lead-in will have to be replaced by a new lead from the barn connection. The cost will not exceed $65.00.\n\nThird, The Electric Motor driving the fan for the furnace is worn out and is not repairable. May I have this replaced by a new motor? The cost including installation will not cost over $60.00.\n\nFourth, May I have one thousand feet of lumber to build a toboggan slide for the children, you will recall the one I had years ago, this has disappeared during my absence.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The present lead-in will have to be replaced by a new lead from the barn connection. The cost will not exceed $65.00.\"\n\nIn official letter of January 5, 1948, we authorized an expenditure of $65.00 for making the necessary repairs to the chicken house. The account accompanying your voucher covers the cost of lumber and the total is $112.40, while an expenditure of only $65.00 was authorized.

This boiler is nearing the end of its usefulness, and it is felt that the Principal's request for a new unit is not unreasonable.\n\nHowever before an estimate of the cost of the replacement can be furnished, it will be necessary for Indian Affairs to decide, whether or not laundry equipment is to be provided for the school.\n\nR.A.

An hour ago we had a storm of hurricane proportions that has stripped many more tile from our roof. This means that the very bad leakage has been increased.

Hamilton,\nSuperintendent.\nIndian Agent,\nPortage-la-Prairie,\nMan.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI would like to replace the 34 single beds we have in the school with 17 double deck beds (army beds) and mattresses. We find the double deck beds have a great advantage over the single beds as we have more floor space thus making it easier to keep the dormitories clean. The dormitories are very high about 14 feet. With double deck beds we can space the beds and avoid direct draughts from the windows.\n\nI wrote to the Department on June 6th to say that our already leaking roof had been further damaged by the cyclone of that day. The repairing of this roof has been pending for some time. The holiday season is the time to get this done. Will you urge upon the Department the necessity of immediate action in this regard. I understand that the firm of Alexander Murray of Winnipeg are experts on repairing roofs.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This man was sent here by the Johns-Manville Company. You will note, Mr. Bjorkland did spread a couple of rolls of roofing to prevent a flood, should heavy rain occur. This slight repair might even prove useless if a bad storm occurred. The school roof is in bad condition and I cannot estimate the damage possible from a severe storm.\n\nI believe a new roof surface is required. The present roofing shingles have been on for many years and are thin and brittle.\n\nMay I please be advised at once if funds can be made available to proceed with this work. The contract price you will note is $2450.00.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nSuperintendent.\n\nc.c. Mr. R.S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nAttention Mr. Hamilton,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAfter discussing the roof of the Indian School at Portage la Prairie with your Mr. Davis, he asked me to drop you a line explaining the condition of the roof and suggestions as to its repair.\n\nOn examining this roof and checking the shingles that are now existing I would say that the proper thing to do with this job would be to remove all existing roofing and apply a 210 lb. weight asphalt shingle with 1 ply of Asphalt Felt under. In the valleys we would use a Slate Surface Roofing, 2 plys full 36\" wide re-inforced with felt and make sure of no leaks. On the ridges we will put what is known as Boston Hip Capping.\n\nFor this work we quote you a lump sum of $2450.00.\n\nWe will be able to proceed with this work at approximately any given time. Materials we propose to use under these figures will be a Canadian Johns-Manville Thick Butt Shingle.\n\nI made temporary repairs to this roof last week and I hope it held out under the last rain.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSUPERIOR ROOFING CO.

Wood, Regional Superintendent, Indian Health Services, Winnipeg.\n\nThe Principal was not at home and deep drifts covered the whole area so it will be necessary to make another call. Before I left, I visited the Portage La Prairie Clerk and asked him how far the town sewers were laid in the direction of this school. It would amount to about 13 to 15 city blocks and as the water table is high in this city and the gradients are very flat the expenses of connecting in this manner would be prohibitive so it will be necessary for me to confine my report to the sewage disposal plant now in existence.

M. Brickenden, Supervising Engineer, Prairie Region, and addressed to Dr. W. J. Wood. I might state that I have had no complaints from Portage la Prairie regarding this sewage disposal.\n\nI note that he recommends that the sewage disposal from the septic tank enter Crescent Lake rather than the Assiniboine River. As far as I am aware, all the sewage from Portage la Prairie enters the Assiniboine River - and I fail to see how the sewage system affects the health of the Indian children. I also feel that if we have no complaints from the town of Portage la Prairie, we should not go to the expense of putting in a new sewage system. However, I would request that you take the matter up with Mr. Gow, as I understand he is thoroughly familiar with this sewage system, as they did some work on it in 1941 - which, apparently, was satisfactory to all concerned.\n\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nJuly 11th, 1949.\n\nDr. W. J. Wood,\nRegional Supt.,\n522 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg.\n\nDear Dr. Wood:\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal\nIndian Residential school\nPortage la Prairie\n\nIn reference to the above subject may I review what has been done.\n\nWe received copies of Dr. Manly's letters to you regarding the complaints of this sewage disposal plant. Two calls have been made previously by myself and letters have been sent out in regard to this matter. It was brought out in conversation with Dr. Manly that the effluent from these septic tanks enter Crescent Lake rather than the Assiniboine River.\n\nOn Saturday morning, July 9th, along with Mr. McEwan of Dr. Manly's office, a visit was made to this school where we contacted the principal and examined the situation together. We found that there are two lines from the school, one discharging the kitchen wastes, the other discharging from a septic tank and services the basins and toilets. No stable services come this way. Apparently these septic tanks are unrecorded at Ottawa (Mines and Resources) as far as blueprints are concerned. It was also noticed that no breathers were apparent although on the present lakeside of the school there were two manholes.\n\nIt seems to be best for brevity that this matter be reduced to the form of recommendations. It is recommended that a single two cell septic tank be erected on the townside of the school between 75' and 100' away from the nearest school corner. This tank would receive all the liquid wastes from the school except the stable portion.\nProceeding the line from the kitchens there would be a grease trap. This septic tank could be vented on the fence line so that it would not be unsightly and the effluent from this could be chlorinated and passed through a gravel filled concrete channel to discharge into the lake as one line. There should be a gravel filled open topped reinforced concrete \"U\", the gravel to be pea sized to 2\" with no fines. This would act as an aerator and the chlorination would be of considerable assistance in reducing smell and odors. The effluent into the lake might easily be placed in water at a depth exceeding 36\". The frost penetration is at least 5'.\n\nI hope that our remarks here will be of value to you. With best wishes, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. M. Brickenden,\nSupervising Engineer,\nPrairie Region.\nOttawa, July 22nd, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS & DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nRe: Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nAttached for your information is a copy of a letter received from Regional Supervisor Davis, and also a copy of a letter received from F.M.

This suite takes up quite a large space, which space is badly needed for the accommodation of the children. The dormitories in this school are crowded - the children are having to use double deckers in most cases, which is not satisfactory.\n\nA new residence could be erected by the North American Buildings for an amount of $10,000.00 under their 4B plan. Miss Walton has a copy or 4B plan that she could show you.\n\nI would strongly recommend that this proposal be given consideration as the present conditions are certainly far from satisfactory. The newly appointed Principal, Mr. McLean, appears to be very capable and with assistance I am quite sure will improve conditions.\n\nR.S.

I do not consider it necessary for the school to have a bell of the type which the Principal wishes to transfer from the File Hills Residential School.\n\nHowever, I feel that the transfer of this bell would be in order, provided the Church is willing to pay any of the costs involved.\n\nR.

However, if you wish to arrange transportation of the bell, it is to be understood that the cost of its transportation will not be paid by the Department.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal,\nPortage la Prairie Indian Residential School, Manitoba.\n\nReferring to the memorandum from Indian Affairs, dated July 22, 1949, we have only now received the following, under date of September 23rd, from Mr. Gow in reply to our letter of July 28th:\n\n\"This will acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 28 with respect to the above subject.\n\n\"We are enclosing copy of a letter forwarded to Dr. W. J. Wood, Regional Superintendent, Indian Health Services, 52 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, under date of July 29, 1949, which points out the viewpoint of this office with respect to complaints originating through Dr. Manly of Portage la Prairie. These complaints have to do with discharge of effluent from septic tank into Crescent Lake near Portage la Prairie.\n\n\"In 1941, when this office carried out certain works with respect to the sewage disposal system at this school, the matter was gone into very thoroughly with the Parks Board of the Town of Portage la Prairie and it was agreed at that time that the work to be undertaken was all that could reasonably be expected of the Indian Affairs Branch. We do not believe that any further work is necessary at this time but the writer will arrange for an engineer to call at the Institution in the near future to see the conditions that now exist and to report upon the same.\"\n\nDuplicate copies of the letter of July 29th from Mr. Gow to Dr. Wood are attached herewith.\n\nYou will note Mr. Gow's remarks with regard to the cleaning out of septic tanks, and that a report on the conditions which now exist will be forwarded in due course.\n\nChief, Engineering & Construction Division.\n\nAttach.\n\nR.

Wood, M.D.,\nRegional Superintendent,\nIndian Health Services,\n522 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal System,\nIndian Residential School,\nPortage la Prairie.\n\nWe have for attention your letter of July 15th, enclosing report from Mr. F.M. Brickenden, Supervising Engineer, Department of National Health and Welfare. The remarks and suggestions of Mr. Brickenden have been noted.\n\nIn 1941, this office with the approval of Indian Affairs Branch spent approximately $2,000.00 on improvements to the sewage disposal system of this School following complaints from the Parks Board of Portage la Prairie about odors and so forth. The work involved separation of kitchen and laundry wastes from the sewage in the building, the construction of new drains, manholes and septic tank. Plans covering construction details of this work are available in the Indian Office at Portage la Prairie, at Ottawa and in this office. The manholes have air vents and are sufficiently removed from the school as to be inoffensive. The sewage disposal system at this school is not considered to be detrimental to the health of the school inmates; it satisfies the requirements of the Provincial Health Officials and while the drainage from the school and the effluent from the septic tank is discharged directly into Crescent Lake, this body of water is not used for domestic water supply or bathing and receives much surface pollution as well as being connected with discharge pipes from the Portage la Prairie Sewage System.\n\nThe school is over a mile from the town limits and the trunk line of the town sewage system is inadequate to serve the nearest four intervening blocks of the town without resorting to pumping and so no connection with the municipal system is possible. It is not possible to install any sewage disposal system at this school that will not have some offensive odors and we do not believe that the proposals suggested by Mr. Brickenden will materially improve the situation or prevent the complaints being received from time to time from the Parks Board of Portage la Prairie. At the time of construction, the Indian Affairs Branch were informed that catch basins and septic tank should be cleaned out at least yearly. Undoubtedly this advice has not been followed and consequently the system is not working to best advantage. We have again drawn to the attention of Mr. Davis the necessity of advising operators of all Indian Schools where such disposal systems are in use that septic tanks, catch basins and so forth must be regularly cleaned out.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD. B. Gow,\nDistrict Engineer.\n\nCopy of letter typed by Mr. Grant -- copy to be sent to Engineering and Construction Division at Ottawa.\nOctober 3rd, 1949.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nRe: Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School,\nSewage Disposal\n\nEnclosed for your information is a copy of a memorandum received from the Lands & Development Services Branch with reference to the above.\n\nThe Department has always expected the management of a residential school to make certain that catch basins and septic tanks are cleaned out at least yearly. It might be well to bring this matter to the attention of the Principals of all the residential schools in the Province of Manitoba, and when visiting any residential school you should mention the matter to the Principal.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nIndian Residential School\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba\n\nSeptember 23, 1949.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton,\n\nI have studied the enclosed papers and the statement of the account reads as if the van moved my personal property. That is not so. I do not own furniture etc. It should read \"furniture and H.H. effects of the File Hills School.\"\n\nI understood that I had the permission of the Department to move from the File Hills School to the Portage School the furniture, household effects and machinery that would be of most use and value to the Portage school. As you know that is what I did. I moved such things as linens and bedding, children's clothing, furniture for bedrooms, for diningroom, and for living room, a G.E. washer, dishes, tools, Bell-Howell projector, etc. Some of these things are now in use here and others will be used as the need arises.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nLechlan McLean\nLechlan McLean, Principal.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: 583-5 (E.l) September 17th, 1949.\n\nI am returning Agency Voucher No. T796 covering the moving of furniture and household effects from Balcarres to the Portage Indian Residential School.\n\nThis office has no authority to cover the account but I beg to attach a statement received from Mr. McLean explaining why the account is being sent to Ottawa for payment.\n\nA.

It would be much better for us to reduce this requisition to 100 yards of both \"A\" and \"AA\" gauge at the present time, as there is a number of things needed in this school, which are much more important than new linoleum - such as new laundry equipment, which they will be requisitioning for shortly.\n\nWith reference to the sewing machines, I do not think an electric machine should be supplied, as when these children go home they will have to learn how to run a treadle machine.\n\nR.

The nine inch heavily padded steel roll allows a seven inch rub against the hot shoe and will take care of all table and bed linens, etc., etc., to the best of satisfaction.\n\nThe electric ironer has two three heat control switches, high, medium and low, making it possible to heat half the Ironer when only ironing a few things.\n\nThe Simplex Ironer has lots of heat and pressure, which is absolutely essential to ensure good ironing, also, the simplicity of operation makes it possible for inexperienced help to do the work very efficiently.\n\nA \u00bc h.p. motor, belt connected, drives the ironer, which is wired through a fuse box to the main wiring of the Ironer. The same Ironer can be driven by means of a gasoline engine or belted direct to the line shaft, as is the case in manufacturing plants. The same machine is made for gasoline or steam heat where a minimum of eighty pounds of pressure is available.\n\nDATA OF MASTER IRONERS\n\n| Simplex Ironers\u2014for beautiful finish | SIZE |\n|-------------------------------------|------|\n|                                     | 48 inch | 56 inch |\n| Fuel Consumed                        |       |        |\n| Gas, cubic feet per hour             | 33    | 38     |\n| Electric                             | High kilowat hours | 5   | 6   |\n| Med.                                 | \"     | 3.2    | 3.6 |\n| Low                                  | \"     | 1.2    | 1.5 |\n| Floor Space                          |       |        |\n| Floor spaces, inches                 | 62x25 | 70x25  |\n| Floor space, working room, inches    | 62x50 | 70x50  |\n| Shipping                             |       |        |\n| Electric                             | 525   | 575    |\n| Gas                                  | 500   | 550    |\n| Steam                                | 600   | 650    |\nSEWER BOYS SIDE PORTAGE SCHOOL CAVED IN TRAP UNDER FLOOR\nUSELESS WATER BACKING UP ON FLOOR MAY REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE\nEXCAVATION IF LINE IS PLUGGED BEYOND SCHOOL SERVICES OF\nPLUMBER REQUIRED AT ONCE TO MAKE NECESSARY REPAIRS\n\nA G HAMILTON SUPT.\n\nREFERENCE YOUR TELEGRAM SECOND INSTANT DEPARTMENT AUTHORIZES\nEXPENDITURE NOT EXCEEDING THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN CONNECTION\nWITH SEWER AT PORTAGE LA PRAIRIE SCHOOL -stop- IF COST WILL EXCEED\nAMOUNT MENTIONED WIRE FOR FURTHER AUTHORITY -stop-\n\nPP/ST\n\nCHARGE TO: INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nIndian Affairs.

They are made of cast aluminum, buffed, and are of pleasing appearance.\n\nThe top cover is rounded and hollowed out on the inside and provided with water connections. The bowl and the rotating platen are lined with the well known \"Hardt abrasive patented liner\". The bowl is equipped with a 2 in. standard pipe drain.\n\nThe platen is mounted on a vertical shaft with a bronze lined guide and lubricated with a grease cup. The lower end of the shaft is mounted on a ball thrust bearing.\n\nUnder the bowl a cross shaft drives the platen through a set of mitre gears which are well lapped on their working centres. Adjacent to the horizontal shaft bearing, which is supported on a shelf, is the switch-box, waterproof and grounded. The peeler is operated by a \u00bc H.P. motor totally enclosed and splash proof, equipped with a \"V\" belt drive and pulleys. This motor can be seen mounted below on a pivoted support which permits belt tension adjustment. The peeler is easily operated; it is merely filled through the top, the water turned on, and the motor started. The platen rotates and tumbles the potatoes.

Another truck (not Security) carried an extra load costing $200.00 which was paid for by the Principal. This truck load carried goods belonging to the Church.

Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n416 Post Office Bldg.,\nRegina, Sask.\nOctober 20, 1949.\n\nRe: Electrical Inspection,\nAgency Buildings.\nGriswold, Man.\n\nThe buildings at the Griswold Agency were inspected by the undersigned on October 13th and 14th and the requirements for wiring and illuminating the areas involved were laid down.\n\nThe type of wiring and luminaires required for each of the buildings was specified and each contractor was given this information together with electrical working drawings for the school, prepared prior to departure from Ottawa using architectural drawings, Index No. 837. The work involved was thoroughly discussed with each contractor and they were requested to re-tender on the work which was more extensive because of additional lighting and inclusion of items such as alternating current motors and controls not figured on in their original tenders.\n\nThe bids submitted by the electrical contractors were received in the Regina office of the Engineering and Construction Division today and are as follows:\n\na. The Dorval Electric Company .......... $2,746.35\nb. G.T. Smith, Electrical Contractor... $2,665.50\n\nThe bid submitted by G.T. Smith is the lowest received and the work which they list in their tender is in accordance with the specifications laid down. In my opinion the Indian Affairs Branch would be well advised to accept the offer submitted by this firm.\n\nI discussed the tenders over long distance telephone with Mr. C.H. Buck, Chief Architect, this morning and requested that authority be granted\nas soon as possible to have the contractor start this work immediately. This request was made so that the contractor who is located approximately 35 miles from the site may complete the work before severe winter weather sets in.\n\nThe contractors were requested to break down their tenders so that Indian Affairs Branch may separate their educational and agency building charges. The tender of G.T. Smith in the total amount of $2,665.50 is made up of $1,185.00 for the school and $1,480.50 for the agency building.\n\nUpon receipt of concurrence in the above recommendation and of the requested authority to proceed with the work, the contractor will be advised accordingly.\n\nI contacted the Manitoba Power Commission in Brandon and requested that they carry their primary line which terminates at the transformer location for the church buildings, up to the school and install transformers in the locations shown on the attached print rather than feed the school by the existing secondary bus now running between the church transformer and the school, a distance of approximately 600 feet. They were in agreement that the loads, which extend over 1,300 feet, would be better served by transformers located at several locations rather than at one central point. In this connection they have written their Head Office in Winnipeg to make the necessary arrangements for the extension of the primary line to the school and the placing of transformers in the required locations.\n\nEnclosed herewith are tenders received today from Doral Electric Company and G.T.

G. Weir,\nM. P. for Portage - Noepawa, concerning this problem. It reads\nin part as follows:\n\n\"The general understanding I got from these\nmemoranda was to the effect that the sewage disposal system\nreferred to has been repaired, and was generally considered\nto be satisfactory so far as the school was concerned, with\nthe only complaint remaining being the disposal of the sewage\ninto Crescent Lake.

I should therefore be obliged for any additional information you may be able to procure for me.\"\n\nI would suggest that you have Mr. Gow hasten this matter as it seems to be of some concern to the people of Portage la Prairie and there will probably be many complaints this summer in connection with this problem. I note Mr. Gow advises that the situation is not detrimental but he does not state whether there is an offensive odor as reported by the local inhabitants.\n\nIt is very likely that little odor would be noted at the time of Mr. Gow's visit in mid November. However, the situation in the summer will probably be rather unpleasant.\n\nDirector.\nDear Mr. Hamilton:\n\nA week ago we delivered 2 new Singer machines for use at the Portage Indian School.\n\nUpon checking three of the old machines we find them too badly worn to merit repairs. The custom of our company is to allow $10. per machine which would be $30.00 for the three. There is a need for 3 electric irons which with our discount to schools of 25% would be an even transaction. Would you consider the above plan? Please advise.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) C.E. Fines, Manager.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nThe attached letter has been received from the local manager of the Singer Sewing Machine Company.

I am assured by Mr. Gow that the additional radiators that were recently installed in this room will make the heating nearly adequate. I do not think that it will be necessary to spend much on electrical fixtures, but the room should be re-decorated in a lighter colour. The grills should be removed from the windows. Would you consult with Mr. McLean, please, and submit an estimate of the items and costs involved?\n\nIn regard to the outside construction, no money has been voted for 1949-50 and, accordingly, there may be no way to expedite construction. I would like to have a practical builder's opinion regarding the feasibility and probable cost of Plan B. There, perhaps, are features that seem difficult. Without, therefore, committing the Department to any expenditure or promise thereof, would you invite any parties who might be interested in doing the job to study the project and make a tentative (a) bill of materials (b) labour estimate or alternatively bid on the complete job\u2014approximately, of course.\n\nI have not been able to discover any army or air force buildings that we could acquire and move to the grounds.

The local Indian Agent ought, however, to be able to report more definitely whether odours from the school system have given rise to complaint.\n\nA further report is expected from Mr. Gow, which when received can be made the basis for a decision in regard to the work necessary to eliminate any future complaints. It should be noted that chlorination of the sewer effluent is receiving consideration. Such action would no doubt meet with the approval of the officials of the City of Portage la Prairie.\n\nAttachs.\nRe: Sewage Disposal - Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, Manitoba.\n\nWe have for attention your letter of December 16 with reference to the above matter. We note the extract from the inquiry of Mr. W.G. Weir, M.P. for Portage-Neepawa, concerning the sewage disposal system at the school.\n\nOur engineers visited the Portage School in late November, took some additional elevations and soil samples and examined the condition of the cistern basins, septic tank and the drainage system in the school itself. The matter of the treatment of the discharge from the septic tank and school drainage is now under consideration and has been discussed with Provincial Government Officials and local representatives of chlorinating agencies. It is hoped to forward you shortly cost data with respect to two alternative proposals for the treatment of the sewage problem. One will provide for chlorination of the effluent prior to discharge into Crescent Lake while the second will deal with the provision of a tile disposal field.\n\nThe discharge of the school sewage into the City's sewage system would be an expensive but complete solution to the problem. Unfortunately, the City of Portage la Prairie has been unable to provide water and sewer facilities to the westerly seven or eight blocks of part of its residential area and as the school is situated more than a mile west of this district, there is little prospect of any possible connecting of the school with the City's sewage system. The news-item in the \"Winnipeg Free Press\" under Portage la Prairie date-line, as referred to in Mr. Weir's communication, was not based upon any information originating with this office and is apparently not based upon fact. I am informed that the complaints regarding the odors from the school sewerage come mainly from residents with properties fronting on Crescent Lake and situated immediately east of the area now without water and sewers. It could be that the odors complained of originated with the hundred or more less fortunate families that lack city water and sewers and must therefore depend upon outdoor facilities.\n\nCrescent Lake is a fairly large but shallow body of water, probably 2\u00bd miles long and 1,000 feet wide, with neither inlet or outlet but maintained during the summer months by pumping of water from the Assiniboine River. It receives considerable surface pollution as well as some direct pollution from the Portage la Prairie Agricultural Grounds and because of its stagnant water it develops the objectionable odors associated with rotting vegetation and etc. The Indian School is located near the westerly limits of the lake, 1\u00bd miles beyond the city limits and the writer is in full agreement with the Chairman of the Medical Health Unit and also of the Parks Board when he remarked upon the occasion of my meeting with him on November 16 last, that he thought the grounds for complaints were more imaginary than real.\n\nThis office hopes to have the report dealing with the two alternative proposals relating to the sewage disposal problem at the school completed in the near future. At the present time we are instructed to avoid any appropriation press and we are verbally advised by the City of Portage la Prairie officials that such treatment will meet with their approval and will eliminate future complaints.\n\n(Sgd.)

Gow,\nDistrict Engineer.\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DIRECTOR\n\nSewage Disposal - Portage la Prairie I.A.S., Manitoba.\n\nReplying to the memorandum from the Director of Indian Affairs, dated December 9th, on the subject of sewage disposal from the above-named Indian School, we have now received a report from Mr. Gow, dated December 19th, duplicate copies of which are attached herewith.\n\nMr. Gow does not appear to be convinced that the odours which are the subject of complaint, originate from the school sewage system. The local Indian Agent ought, however, to be able to report more definitely whether odours from the school system have given rise to complaint.\n\nA further report is expected from Mr. Gow, which when received can be made the basis for a decision in regard to the work necessary to eliminate any future complaints. It should be noted that chlorination of the sewer effluent is receiving consideration. Such action would no doubt meet with the approval of the officials of the City of Portage la Prairie.\n\nWalter F. Wain\nChief,\n\nAttachments.\nOttawa, January 3, 1950.\n\nMr. R.S.

Gow\n\nRe:- Sewage Disposal - Portage la Prairie\nIndian Residential School, Manitoba.\n\nIn the present system as constructed in August, 1941, the sewage is passed through a septic tank and this effluent, together with the laundry and kitchen wastes, discharged directly to Crescent Lake. To avoid pollution of Crescent Lake with consequent disagreeable odors, the following alternative schemes are suggested:\n\n1. Chlorination of all effluent before discharging to lake.\n2. Construction of Disposal Bed to receive all effluents.\n\n1. CHLORINATION SCHEME\n\nProposed Apparatus and Housing:\n\nIt is proposed to install a small chlorinating system on the 6\" pipe line, about 40 feet from outlet of septic tank, at the junction of laundry and kitchen wastes with the main sewage line. The type of chlorinator most suitable is a \"Manual Direct Feed Chlorinator Control - Orifice type chlorinator\". This chlorinator to be housed in a building 6' x 9' with 7' ceiling, built over a 3' x 3' well. The building would be thoroughly insulated with provision of heating unit for use during severe cold weather in order that the room temperature may be maintained to give the necessary pressure to operate the flow of chlorine. The well to be carried down to a depth of 10 ft. below ground level, giving a minimum depth of 4\u00bd ft. below incoming pipes. It would always be full of liquid at this depth and would constitute the contact chamber (capacity 250 gals.) for the application of chlorine.\n\nChlorine Requirement:\n\nA daily amount of 3,000 gals. of liquid to be treated has been arrived at from the maximum monthly water consumption. However, the rate of flow during the 24-hour period will vary considerably. An assumed steady chlorine treatment of about 25 p.p.m. to the daily effluent of 3,000 gals. is considered satisfactory, but there is no doubt that at times the contents of the contact chamber would be over chlorinated and possibly during periods of high discharge it might not be sufficient considering periods of time of contact. However, the rate of flow of chlorine can be regulated by the manual control during periods of high and low discharge. The suggested treatment of 25 p.p.m. to 3,000 gals. per 24-hour period, would require about one pound of chlorine daily.\n\nElectric Power:\n\nA 110 volt supply for necessary lighting of building and to electrically heat the diffuser element of the chlorinator if required.\n\nMr. D. B. Gow,\nDistrict Engineer,\nDominion Water and Power Bureau,\n532 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nAdvantages of this type of chlorinator:\n\n1. No auxiliary water line is required, as in the case of hypochlorinators,\n2. Heating requirements at a minimum,\n3. Minimum supervision - Only regulation of chlorine control valve.\n\nEstimated Cost of Installation:\n\nChlorinator equipment ........................................ $1,200.00\nChlorinator installation ....................................... 50.00\nDeposit on Chlorine Cylinder .................................. 25.00\nConstruction of chlorinator housing ............................ 700.00\nConstruction of concrete well, setting inflow and outflow pipes ....... 250.00\nElectric Transmission Line ..................................... 75.00\n\n$2,300.00\nContingencies 10% ................................................ 230.00\n\n$2,530.00\n\nAnnual Cost of Operation:\n\nChlorine (in cylinders) ......................................... 60.00\nElectric power ...................................................... 25.00\nHeating ............................................................... 40.00\n\n$125.00\n\n2. DISPOSAL BED SCHEME\n\nThe existing septic tank is not provided with a siphon chamber and due to the elevation of the present effluent being nearly 6 feet below ground, it is not possible to conform to the usual practice of syphoning to the disposal bed. It is proposed to construct an additional chamber at the end of the septic tank to be called the \"Effluent Chamber\", where the effluent from the septic tank and the laundry and kitchen will be collected and this raised to the tile in disposal bed by means of pumping. The size of \"Effluent Chamber\" and \"Disposal Bed\" have been made on the basis of the average monthly water consumption at the school, being 12,000 c.c.ft. (97,500 gals.) and from this the daily average of 450 c.c.ft. (3,380 gals.) has been considered.\n\nEffluent Chamber\n\nConcrete construction 8 ft. wide and 10 ft. long and 6 ft. deep. Elevation of floor to be 90.0 giving a liquid depth of 3 ft. (240 cc.ft. = 1,500 gal. capacity) at time of pump operation under float control. Platform to be constructed above maximum liquid level for the erection of pump. Accessibility to this chamber to be provided by manhole (3' x 3') from ground above. The present main sewage line to Crescent Lake to be connected to an overflow pipe from chamber in event of pump failure at any time, and this means of taking care of the effluent could be used at any time when occasion demands the rehabilitating of the disposal bed.\nDisposal Bed:\n\nLocation of the bed under law in front of school or in the girls' playground is considered satisfactory as regards soil conditions which were found to be 18\" clay loam over 36\" of silty yellow clay to fine or medium sand. The 6\" glass distributor pipe with 4\" tile laterals running at right angles from it to be laid at a depth of 2 feet and the 4\" tile laid open joints at the base level in specially prepared trenches 2 ft. wide with a 6\" deep gravel base. The size of the proposed disposal bed is 13,500 sq. ft., with 3,150 lin.ft. of 4\" tile in the bed. The capacity of the Effluent Chamber being 1500 gals. will give approximately a twice daily loading of disposal bed.\n\nGrease Trap:\n\nA grease trap to be provided in the laundry and kitchen waste line before it enters the \"Effluent Chamber\".\n\nPump:\n\nUnit Type - Vert. Centrifugal Sump Pump - 60 U.S. g.p.m.,\n10 ft. head, 1/2 H.P. motor with float switch.\n\nEstimated Costs:\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Disposal Bed - Excavation and Backfilling | $750.00|\n| Disposal Bed - Laying pipe and 4\" tile    | 250.00 |\n| Disposal Bed - 6\" tile - 3200 feet        | 500.00 |\n| Disposal Bed - 6\" pipe - 140 feet         | 300.00 |\n| Gravel - 120 yds.                         | 360.00 |\n| Effluent Chamber - Labor and Material     | 600.00 |\n| Grease Trap - Labor and Material          | 100.00 |\n| Pump and Installation                     | 300.00 |\n| Electric Power Line                       | 79.00  |\n\n$3,230.00\n\nContingencies 10%                        | 323.00 |\n\n$3,553.00\n\nPlans Submitted:\n\n1. General plan of Existing Sewage System showing location of proposed Chlorinator Housing.\n2. General plan of Existing Sewage System showing proposed Disposal Bed.\n\nW. H. Wallace.\n532 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWINNIPEG, January 19, 1950.\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal - Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School, Manitoba.\n\nAs promised in our letter of December 19 last, we are forwarding a memorandum by Mr. W.H. Wallace of this staff outlining two alternative methods of treating the sewage at the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School. The memorandum outlines the details of the two methods suggested and gives estimated costs for both proposals. The memorandum is accompanied by two plans of the school grounds on which are outlined the location of the proposed new work. Plans showing construction details are in course of preparation and can be brought to completion for whatever method of disposal is decided upon. The memorandum and plans are being forwarded in duplicate.\n\nIt might be pointed out that both methods of treatment outlined are open to criticism. School authorities have not been consulted with respect to the location of the disposal bed and will doubtless look with disfavour upon the idea of their attractive lawn and flower beds being torn up and will also dislike the idea of losing the girls' playground which is an alternative location for the tile bed. On the other hand, the chlorination of the effluent presents problems. There is no steady use of water in the school and since the flow of chlorine gas remains steady, there is bound to be over and under chlorination at times. Furthermore, chlorination does not do away with Crescent Lake being the recipient of the chlorinated effluent and this fact alone will probably be future grounds for complaint, for regardless of whatever method of disposal is proceeded with the disagreeable odors arising from the waters of Crescent Lake in warm weather will continue since the stagnant water of this lake lends itself readily to such a situation.\n\n'sgd' D.B. Gow,\nDistrict Engineer.\n\nEnclos.\n\nMr. C.Victor F. Weir,\nChief,\nEngineering and Construction Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nFurther to our memorandum of December 27th, and in response to the request of the Director of Indian Affairs under date of December 9th, 1950, we are forwarding herewith one copy of a report by Mr. Wallace, accompanied by two copies of the covering letter from Mr. Gow.\n\nThe attached report dated January 19th by Mr. Wallace deals with two alternative schemes for dealing with sewage effluent. They are as follows:\n\nScheme (1) provides for chlorination of the effluent before it is deposited in Crescent Lake, at an estimated cost of $3,530 for labour and materials. This proposal will require maintenance which is estimated to cost $125 per year. While this scheme may seem to be a satisfactory method of eliminating odours from the sewage there is always the possibility that repairs might be required to the chlorinator and in view of the fact that there is no steady use of water in the school and the flow of chlorine gas remains steady there is bound to be over and under chlorination at times. There is also the possibility of shut downs for repairs. So long as sewage is turned into Crescent Lake from the school there will be grounds for complaint.\n\nScheme (2) provides for the construction of a tiled disposal bed in the school grounds and owing to the elevations which exist pumping of the sewage effluent will be necessary. The estimated cost of this scheme is $3,550 for labour and materials. It is proposed to leave the present sewer pipe to Crescent Lake as an alternative means of disposal when repairs are being made to the pump and the disposal bed. The soil is not particularly suited to this type of disposal and an artificial gravel bed will have to be laid. The plans provide for construction of this disposal bed on the lawn immediately in front of the school, with an alternative location on the girls' playground.\n\nIn Mr. Gow's report of December 19th, copies of which were forwarded to you on December 27th, you will note that he states:\n\n\"The discharge of the school sewage into the city's sewage system would be an expensive but a complete solution of the problem. Unfortunately, the city of Portage la Prairie has been unable to provide water and sewage facilities to the westerly seven or eight blocks of part of the residential area and as the school is situated more than a mile west of this district there is little prospect of any possible connecting of the school with the city sewage system.\" In the same report Mr. Gow states that \"the Indian School is located near the westerly limits of the lake 1-1/2 miles beyond the city limits and the writer is in full agreement with the Chairman of the Medical Health Unit and also of the Parks Department when he remarked on the occasion of my meeting with him on November 16 last that he thought the grounds...\"\nfor complaints were more imaginary than real.\"\n\nYou will note from the last paragraph of Mr. Gow's letter that both the above methods of treatment are open to criticism. In the first place the school authorities have not been consulted with regard to the location of the disposal bed, and in all probability will not be in favour of the idea of tearing up their lawn and flower beds or the girls' playground, which is the alternative location. We believe that the school authorities should be consulted before additional work is done on this scheme. Furthermore, if the disposal bed scheme is adopted there is bound to be some pollution of the lake during periods when the disposal bed has to be rehabilitated.\n\nIn view of the fact that neither of the proposals submitted by Mr. Wallace is entirely satisfactory and the ultimate solution to the problem would be discharging the affluent into the river, we are again referring to Mr. Gow to find out from him what length of sewer would have to be constructed from the school to the river and also if there are any particular difficulties to such a scheme. On receipt of Mr. Gow's further report we will advise further.\n\nAtteh.\n\nChief.\nFebruary 10th, 1950.\n\nMr. R.S.

If the back end wall of the classroom were a set of folding doors, a large area would be available for physical education, school assemblies, etc. Do you know this is our school which has no chapel or other assembly hall.\n\nMcLean hopes that two of the small rooms at what would be the west end will be available as dressing-rooms (changing rooms, etc.) Two other small rooms could be combined to become a library-reading room.\n\nThere is a wash-room set-up, but the plumbing fixtures are missing.\n\nBoth furnaces may be necessary.\n\nThe matter of quarters for a teacher is not likely to arise.

Airport at St. James near Winnipeg, Manitoba. The building is approximately 99 ft. in length, and Superintendent Davis has obtained a quotation of $3,000.00 to move the building to Portage la Prairie, from R. Litz & Sons, 277 McPhillips Street, Winnipeg.\n\nThis firm recommend that the building be cut in two halves, and temporary end walls be built at both the openings created by the cutting of the building in order to prevent the side walls from going out of shape in transit. They will also look after obtaining permits for moving the building, and will place it on the site selected by our officials at Portage la Prairie.\n\nThis firm can move the building immediately, and it is pointed out that this a most opportune time to move it, because the roads are firmly frozen and there is lighter traffic on the highway at this period of the year.\n\nOur Building Supervisor, Mr. M. Krawchuk, who is attached to our Winnipeg office, considers that the firm mentioned above are in a position to handle the work in a competent manner. Regional Supervisor Davis recommends that they be employed as they promise to move the building at once. Funds for the moving are available in the current year's appropriation.\nTherefore, I recommend for the Minister's approval, that we accept the tender of R.

Litz & Sons, Winnipeg, wherein they guarantee to move the building from Winnipeg and placed on the site at Portage la Prairie within 14 days from the time they are instructed to do so.\n\nI understand by speaking to their representative this morning that they now consider they can move this building in one piece, which, of course, would certainly be much better.

This involves some difficult manoeuvres on our part but we are willing to expend this extra effort in order to get this building moved in one whole piece to avoid unnecessary expense of connecting the two halves of the building which you will have to do if we moved the building in two pieces.\n\nOther than above qualified, our charges and conditions mentioned in our letter to you of December 23, 1949 remain the same.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

However, a copy of the Crown Assets' Purchase Order, which was attached to the original copy of the voucher, was not kept in this office - and I would appreciate it if you could secure same for me and forward it to me by air.\n\nI was at the airfield this morning and Litz and Company were starting to move the building, and I am not just certain now what we have purchased. There is a heating system in this building with two stoves - which should go with the building. I certainly would not want to see them take these two furnaces or the heating system out. One window has been removed in the front and some at the side; and all the tentest in the ceiling and the back end - which would be about half the building - has been torn down and a little of the insulation taken out.\n\nI did not inspect this building myself before the purchase was made, but sent Mr. Weite over.

We suggest that the building be cut into two halves. Temporary end walls be built at both openings created by the cutting of the building. The purpose for constructing the temporary end walls is to secure the side walls from going out of shape while in transit. The planking and timbering used in the erection of the temporary walls will remain the property of R. Lits & Sons when the job is completed. The building in two sections will be moved from the present location to a site selected by you at Portage LaPrairie. The two sections after being moved will be placed as closely as possible can to make it easier for your carpenters to connect the two halves of the building and close up the cuts made on the roof, floor and sides. We will look after the overhead wires and also the permits.\n\nWe understand from your Mr. Waite that snow and fence around the ice rink at Portage LaPrairie will be removed by your men at your expense to facilitate our operation.\n\nWe would like to have a letter from you to the effect that we are the contractors for moving this building when this project is approved by the Department. We believe such letter will help expedite the granting to us of the moving permits by the authorities concerned.\n\nWe strongly advise you to have the building moved as soon as possible, as this is the most opportune time to move the building firstly because the roads are firmly frozen to insure smooth moving with not much snow to\n\n\"Serving Industry\"\n\nIndian Affairs.

Litz & Sons of Winnipeg, for the sum of $3,000.00. This firm will move the building by cutting it in two and placing it close together, so it can be connected again at Portage la Prairie. This building is about a foot wider than the bridges, therefore, it will be necessary to raise the building high enough on the trucks to go over the bridges. After this building has been moved, it will be necessary, the first thing in the Spring - to clean up the lot where the building stood, as per the Purchase contract. This could be done by calling for extra prices. I imagine the cost would be around $300.00, at least, as there is a cement floor to move and some filling in to do.\n\nBoland Bros. Limited, of Winnipeg, have quoted a price of $3,250.00, but they will only take this building down and move it in sections - then put it up again at Portage la Prairie.\n\nI have had Mr. M. Krawchuk, our Building Supervisor, check the building, and he recommends that the building should not be taken down and moved in sections - but that it be moved in two pieces.

R. Litz & Sons started last Monday morning to raise the building and should be on the road before the end of the week. They are doing their best to move this building in one piece. However, Mr. Litz advised me yesterday that the building was very heavy and they may have to cut it but this would not be done until he was certain he could not move it in one piece.\n\nWhen I was at the Portage School Mr. McLean, the Principal, pointed out to me that Mr. Clark, Educational Officer, wanted the building placed just east of the primary classroom, which is in the yard where the present skating rink is. My opinion is that this would not be a good place as it is too close to the other buildings and as this rink has been used for years the ground underneath would be soft. It would also be hard to get a footing owing to the water sinking in at this spot for a number of years. Mr. McLean has taken up with me regarding the placing of this building just west of the primary room. This would mean it would be back in the yard instead of right out in front. I am of the opinion this would be a good location. Will you please advise me at once where to locate this building as it should be at Portage the early part of next week.\n\nR. S.

This additional wiring has been carried out in N.K., loomex and lamp cord. It is recommended that all loomex, N.K. and lamp cord wiring be replaced with E.M.T. or rigid conduit with proper fittings.

The Principal stated\nthat he could not sleep at night owing to the worry of fire,\nand I firmly believe there is a serious situation in the poor\ncondition of the wiring. The laundry switches should also be\nchecked, as there is a danger of children handling switches\nwith wet hands. A new washing machine has been installed in\nthe laundry. The pulleys were left open without protection.\nI suggested that the pulleys be fenced with wire. The Principal\nsaw the danger immediately it was pointed out to him and I was\ninformed that a fence would be installed without delay.\n\nThe classrooms were crowded. Provision is being made for an\nadditional classroom. The junior teacher had a class of 52 -\n57 on register - 5 boys away on other training in the after-\nnoon and 5 girls out in the morning. The teacher has 33 in\nGrade 1 and 24 in Grade 2. This class is far too heavy for any\nteacher to do full justice towards the children. There are 53\non the register in the senior room - 16 in Grade 4, 18 Grade 5,\n6 Grade 6, 10 Grade 7, 3 Grade 8. There were 39 in the classroom\nthe day of my visit - February 15th. Grades 4 and 6 are in\nschool all day, and 5, 7 and 8 half-day.\n\nMr. McLean made request for twelve (12) double decker beds for\nthe boys' dormitory, complete with mattresses. The double\ndeckers would give more floor space in the dormitories and freer\naccess to the fire-escapes. I would strongly recommend that this\npurchase be made.\n\nLaundry was strung around the girls' lavatory, on heating pipes,\nand in the closed-in verandahs. Mr. McLean asked if I could do\nanything to expedite the delivery of a dryer that apparently has\nbeen recommended. I found the Principal very co-operative and\ninterested in the work. Padlocks were found on the doors of the\ndormitories. He advised that the doors were padlocked during the\nday, but were left open at night. He did express dissatisfaction\nat this arrangements. Several letters had been found in which it\nwas intimated that visits were arranged in the dormitories be-\ntween the older boys and girls. The girls appeared to be the\naggressors. Mr. McLean stated that he would have to install\nan alarm system, similar to the one in use at the File Hills\nSchool.\n\nField Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFurther reference to your letter of February 28, 1950, file No. 563-5 (El) re Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School. I visited the school yesterday and had a meeting with the Principal and the Provincial School Inspector, regarding the manner in which the school should be divided in the interior. Mr. Krawohuk, Building Supervisor, is making a rough sketch, which will be forwarded to you within a few days. It would be impossible to have the building completed before the end of our year. However, I see no reason why we could not obtain most of the material. I am attaching a requisition for the windows, doors, rock wool and as soon as Mr. Krawohuk has the other material figured out I will forward you a requisition for same. If I could receive authority to purchase the material locally I could take delivery at once and make certain that the accounts go forward before the end of March 31.\n\nWould you please have Mr. Clark forward me by air mail the snaps of the inside of the building so that I may check and see if any material has been taken since we purchased the building. The Transport Department took accessories belonging to the furnace but I have since had them returned. However, after checking the classrooms there is still a door missing off the stove and both motors in the furnace that run the air conditioning. I am taking this up with them at once.\n\nWe went over the site suggested in your letter. This site will be satisfactory. Therefore, I will have the building set west of the present junior classroom.\n\nR. S.

Lavatories - Because of the lack of a basement, we think it would be wise to eliminate all plumbing. There is sufficient trouble already with sewage disposal at this school. The space $10' \\times 10'$, which will be saved, can be used as a room for storing equipment, supplies, etc.\n\n2. We suggest that the entrance to the furnace room be made through the fuel room, so as to avoid the entrance from the classroom.\n\n3. Instead of a cloakroom partition in the west classroom, we feel it would be advisable to supply long, movable clothes-horses. The children will only be going from the main building to the classroom in the new building.\n\n4. Is it the intention to use oil as firing?\n\n5. Are we correct in assuming that it is the intention to raise the roof? If so, would a gable roof be\nprovided, and in that event, would it be possible to eliminate pillars marked #1, #2, #3 and #4?\n\n6. The windows on the north side of the new building should be transom type, so that each classroom may have 24' of blackboard along the north wall, as well as 26' to 28' along the west wall.\n\nWe would appreciate an early reply regarding the above matters.\n\nWe are forwarding your requisition of March 4th to the Departmental Purchasing Agent, and you might also forward a requisition for the following:\n\n1. Guarded light fixture for the recreation room.\n2. Fluorescent lighting fixtures for classroom.\n3. Linoleum for the floors.\n4.

Litz & Sons, for moving the building from Stevenson's Airfield to Portage la Prairie Residential School.\n\nI visited this building yesterday, and Litz & Sons have made a real good job of moving this building. However, they had to cut 30' off the building, as they were unable to make a turn at Portage Avenue, owing to the location of the building and telephone poles. They have put the building 3\u00bd' off the ground and lined it up as requested - at the west end of the school. The building has been left well-blocked, well braced inside, and Litz & Sons will remove this as soon as we are able to get the foundation in order to let it down.\n\nLitz & Sons are very anxious to get the work of putting in the pillars for the foundation and also are interested in doing the complete work on the school.\n\nThis firm advised me that they are in need of the money, as business has been slack and they requested that the enclosed voucher be passed as soon as possible.\n\nR.

In a memo dated Feb. 22, 1950, the Minister approved acceptance of the tender of R. Litz & Sons to move the building at a cost of $3,000.00. Please send cheque by air mail.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that satisfactory has been supplied the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada. This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. Army Sig., dated Feb. 25, 1950.\n\nR.S. DAVIS, Supervisor\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6275, file 583-5, part 10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nPlease refer to your letter of March 10th, file 583-5 (E1) relating to the above noted school.\n\n(1) It was not my intention in the first place to have toilets put in the school. However, the Provincial Inspector thought they were necessary. As these children are close to the main building, there is no reason why they cannot use these facilities.\n\n(2) Regarding the entrance to the furnace room being made through the fuel room, I am having Mr. Krawchuk adjust the plans to meet with this request.\n\n(3) Mr. Krawchuk will be drawing a new plan of this building and will see that this change is made regarding the cloakroom.\n\n(4) The furnaces that we got with this building are forced air heat, army type self-feed coal. Therefore, we will be using coal for heating purposes. I have had Mr. Krawchuk go over to Campbell Heating with a plan to get their advice on the best method of putting up these furnaces. I am of the opinion that we can heat the present classroom also, by running a pipe through where the buildings join; and on a very cold day the other furnace could be utilized.\n\n(5) It was not my intention to change the roof in this building, as this would run into a couple of thousand dollars, and a new roof would only add to the appearance of the building. The present roof is a real good one, made of asphalt with rubberoid over the top. This roof will only need to be tarred and sanded, as no doubt it will be loosened from the moving. If a new roof was added, it would still need supports as the ceiling joists and the ceiling are in three pieces; therefore, it would still be necessary to have steel beams under them after the joists are taken down. The steel beams we are considering would be right up close to the ceiling and the beam underneath would be held by a bracket which attaches to the steel beam. In this way it will make a very neat job and the cost of the beams and installing would not be over approximately $500.00 for four beams.\n\n(6) It is our intention to put transom type windows on the north side of the classroom, as we have plenty of room for these windows and the transom windows which are in the building now will be used.\nThe back end of this building has a slope roof, and it is our intention to use it for a recreation room. It has no floor at the present time, as in this part of the building the floor was a cement slab on the ground. On looking over the building yesterday, I feel that we should put a cement floor in this portion of the building as at the Airfield. This will mean building a wall underneath the pillars and insulating it and also across the building. This will give us about three feet more ceiling height, which is necessary for recreation, as the present ceilings, if a floor was put in, would not give enough height for playing basketball, etc.\n\nI would very much like to get your opinion on the above and any other suggestions that you wish to make, and I will have Mr. Krawchuk draw another plan and submit it to you. When this is approved we will submit a list of the materials required or get contract prices on completing this building according to our plans and specifications. I feel the latter method would be better, as we would know where we were at, in place of undertaking the work on a day labor basis.\n\nWe could either complete this building by contracting the work and we supplying the material, or have a contractor supply the material and complete the work. You might let me know which method you feel is the best.\n\nI am attaching herewith a rough sketch, showing the recreation room which will be practically three feet lower than the balance of the building, on a cement floor.\n\nR.

(RG 10, Volume 6275, file 583-9, part 1)\nIndian Boarding School,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.,\nMay 8th, 1913.\n\nSirs,\u2014 I beg to refer to the Department's letter No. 119469/1 dated May the 2nd, 1913, in reference to a suitable site for the new building for the Portage la Prairie Indian Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to enclose a sketch map of what I consider the most suitable property of which I know for school purposes. It is known as the Cummings property and has to be sold this summer. Mr. T.A. Newman, Portage la Prairie, Man., is the sole executer. The portion South of the Canadian Northern Railway contains about 60 acres, is excellent soil, plenty of good water and on it a school could be built facing Crescent Lake almost opposite the Provincial Training School. The balance of this 210 acres is badly cut up by the different railways. Mr. Newman can sell it to the different farms which it is adjoining at $75 per acre. The property is a half-breed script and is, therefore, long and narrow.\n\nThe 60 acres South of the C.N.R. which would be most desirable for school purposes can be purchased at $85.00 per acre. It is one and a half miles from the Post Office which is regarded as the center of the city.\n\nIt is considered very suitable property on which to build a school for the following reasons: 1- The children could walk to Knox Presbyterian church and Sunday School. 2- It is on the road which leads to the Long Plain Reserve and parents coming to the city could easily see their children. 3- It is only about a mile and a half from Parish Lot No. 14 where many of the Sioux Indians have decided to reside in the future. 4- We would be nearer the Sioux Village than we are at present.\nThere is a small triangle \u00a7 A. of three acres, owned by Mr. Lee who is married to a Miss Cummings' and as the buildings on it are of very little value, no doubt it could be bought at a very reasonable price. A better location for a building than this triangle could hardly be imagined.\n\nIf one was to purchase land anywhere within three miles of the center of the city it would cost from $60.00 to $75.00 per acre. The residential portion of the city must move along Crescent Road to the West. They will never go North on account of the Railways. The Provincial Farm cuts off the East, The Crescent Lake cuts off the South. In twenty years this Cummings property will be worth from $500.00 to $1000.00 per acre. It is three quarters of a mile from good residences on Crescent Road at present.\n\nSouth and West of the city is the most suitable location for our work. North and East takes us away from it.\n\nI shall try and get the prices of other property in the meantime.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nSend the following Message, subject to the above terms, which are hereby agreed to:\n\nOttawa, 17th June, 1913.\n\nF.

A. Newman, executor, at eighty-five dollars an acre.\"\n\nIn reference to this purchase I have to ask you to be good enough to examine the property and also to prepare a conveyance from the present owner to His Majesty the King as represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs. When this conveyance is received payment will be made if satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. G.

I note your instructions with reference to searching the title, and as to the form of conveyance.\n\nMr. Alexander Taylor, D.L.S., has made a Plan for me of the acreage included in that portion of the property lying south of the Canadian Northern Railway Co's land. Instead of 60 acres, it only contains 49.78 acres. When reporting to you in connection with the matter, I shall send you Mr. Taylor's sketch.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nF.G.T.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa-Canada.\n\nSir:\n\nRe Your Reference No. 119469/1.\n\nReferring further to your letter of the 20th Ult., I beg to advise you that I have purchased from Mr. Thomas A. Newman, all the portion of Parish Lot No. 51 of the Parish of Portage la Prairie commonly known as the \"Cumming property,\" which lies between the north limit of the Slough Road and the southern limit of the Right-of-Way of the Canadian Northern Railway Co.\n\nAs I advised you in my previous letter, after taking out a public road which crosses this property, the net acreage is 49.78. I have not been able to secure an opinion on the property, because one of the executors is not here. However, I have prepared a Deed which the two executors who do reside here, will execute, probably today or tomorrow. It may be a few days before the other executor returns to Portage la Prairie, while I may have to send the Deed to her in the States to have it signed.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.G.T.\nSir,\n\nIn connection with the purchase of land for the proposed new Portage la Prairie Indian School in addition to that already purchased from Mr. Newman, the Department desires to obtain two additional small pieces adjoining, that marked on sketch enclosed herewith Lee property and William Budd property. I have to ask you to be good enough to obtain an option on the most favourable terms possible on these two pieces of land and report to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

With reference to the purchase of the Cummings property, I beg to advise that I have obtained a Deed of the property from the executors of the estate of Margaret Cummings, and have registered it, and am proceeding with the necessary searches as to title. As soon as these are complete, I shall serve requisition upon the solicitor for the executors, and shall endeavour to get title in shape as early as possible. I imagine, however, that it will not be an easy matter.\n\nBack in the early '80's this property was apparently subdivided and the Plan of Subdivision was never registered, but certain Deeds were issued to purchasers of Lots in accordance with the proposed Plan of Subdivision, and these Deeds are registered in the Land Titles Office here. It will be necessary, of course, to get rid of them in order to clear the paper title. At the present time they are an encumbrance on the property, and there is no way of defining just what portion of it they cover, because I fancy the proposed Plan of Subdivision (if it ever existed) has been lost years ago.\n\nI think perhaps the easiest way out of the difficulty would be to obtain a Torrens title. You might let me know if I have your authority.\nto obtain a Torrens title in case I find it impossible to get a good safe-holding title in any other way.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.G.T.\n\nmemo Scholes:\nYes I think Mr Taylor should be instructed to obtain a Torrens title if he finds it impossible to get a safe holding title in any other way.\n\nE.S. Williams\nOttawa, September 2, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th ultimo in reference to the purchase of the Cummings property at Portage la Prairie for boarding school purposes.\n\nWith regard to your inquiry I beg to say that you may obtain a Torrens title for this property if you find it impossible to get a safe holding title in any other way.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

(RG 10, Volume 6275, file 583-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAugust 14th 1913.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nre sale from the executors of the Cummings Estate to the Indian Department.\n\nI beg to advise you that I shall require the following, in order to make out a good title to the portion of Parish Lot 51 of the Parish of Portage la Prairie, which is now being purchased by the Dominion Government from the executors of Margaret Cummings deceased:\n\nFirst: By registered Deed No. 7556, Thomas Logan and James B. Henderson, who were then the registered owners of the Parish Lot, conveyed to one Samuel Foote, a portion of the Parish Lot described as Lots Nos. 3 and 4, in Block B., according to a Plan thereof made by G.B. Bemister, D.L.S., and registered in the Registry Office for the County of Marquette West. There is no record in the Land Titles Office of any such Plan ever having been registered, and it is impossible, from any registered document which I can find, to locate the property. This Deed forms a cloud upon the title, which will have to be removed.\n\nSecondly: By registered Instrument No. 10271, Messrs. Logan and Henderson conveyed to Frank Forsythe, a portion of Parish Lot No. 51, described as being Lots 5 and 6, in block B., according to the above Plan of Subdivision. My remarks with reference to the prior instrument will apply to this one.\n\nThirdly: The Patent from the Crown issued to Malcolm Cummings, and\nin all the registered dealings which he had with the property, he spells his name with an \"s\" on the end of it, but the Probate of his Will under which the executors of Margaret Cummings make title, simply spells the name \"Cunning\" without the \"s\". We shall require a Declaration to clear up this small discrepancy. I presume there would be no difficulty in getting Mr. Thomas Cummings to make a Declaration which would be sufficient for this purpose.\n\nFourthly: Evidence of payment of the debts of Malcolm Cummings and of Margaret Cummings.\n\nFifthly: Payment of taxes.\n\nIt is just possible that in order to clear away the two Deeds mentioned in my first and second requisitions, it may be necessary to obtain a Torrens title to the property. I dare say it would be impossible now to locate the parties mentioned in them. If they can be located, and Quit Claim Deeds secured, there would be no necessity of getting a Torrens title.\n\nI find on the General Register, two conveyances of land from Thomas Logan et al to Farquhar McLean and Thomas W. Boddy, registered as Nos. 83 and 4976, respectively. I have not yet searched these Deeds, but if the descriptions in them interfere with the title to Parish Lot 51, they would have to be cleared up.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.G.T.\n\nMessrs. McPherson Williams & Ormond,\nBarristers, etc., City.\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba,\nAugust 14th 1913.\n\nSolicitor's Abstract of all that portion of Lot Fifty-one\nof the Parish of Portage la Prairie, in Manitoba, lying between the\nRight-of-Way of the Canadian Northern Railway Company on the north,\nand the north boundary of the Slough Road on the south, prepared by\nMr. F.G. Taylor, K.C., for the Superintendent-General of Indian\nAffairs; the above being the property now being purchased by the\nDepartment from the executors of the estate of Margaret Cummings,\ndeceased.\n\nNumbers below refer to the registered numbers of the\nvarious Instruments, as shown upon the Registrar's Abstract appended\nhereto.\n\nNo. 3307 is a Deed from Malcolm Cummings to the Canadian\nPacific Railway Company, covering all that portion of Lot 51 of the\nDominion Government Survey of the Parish of Portage la Prairie on the\nline of the main track proposed to be built by said Company, as same\nis now staked out across said land.\n\nThe main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company runs\nto the north of the Right-of-Way of the Canadian Northern Railway\nCompany, and never was any further south, and although the description\nin this Deed is very indefinite, I take it that it could hardly\naffect the title to the portion now being purchased.\n\nNo. 6266 is a Deed dated the 18th of January 1882 and\nregistered on the 6th day of February 1882, from Malcolm Cummings, of\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6275, file 583-9, part 1)\nthe first part; and Thomas Logan and James B. Henderson, both of Portage la Prairie, Merchants, of the second part; covering all that portion of Parish Lot Number 51, of the Parish of Portage la Prairie, as shewn on a map of said Parish, dated January 1 1875, signed by John Stoughton Dennis, Surveyor-General of Dominion Lands, and of record in that branch of the Department of the Interior known as the Dominion Lands Office, excepting thereout the land heretofore conveyed by the party of the first part to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company for Right-of-Way, and also a parcel of land containing four acres, upon which the buildings of the party of the first part are situate, and described as follows: Bounded towards the east by the east side line of said Lot 51; towards the south by the Slough Road; towards the east by a line drawn parallel to side lines of Lot 51 and equally distant from; and towards the north by a straight line drawn at right angles to said side lines of said Lot, at a sufficient distance from the said Slough Road to make the land contained within said bounds four acres. The consideration in the Deed is $15,400.\n\nNo. 6267 - Mortgage from Thomas Logan and James B. Henderson to Malcolm Cummings, is sufficiently discharged by registered Instrument No. 11013.\n\nNo. 7556 is a Deed, from Thomas Logan and James B. Henderson to Samuel Foote, of Bethesda Post Office, County of York, Province of Ontario, farmer; dated March 14 1882 and registered on the 29th day of March 1882, covering Lots Numbers 3 and 4, in Block B, according to a Plan of Subdivision made by G.B. Bemister, D.L.S. and registered in the Registry Office for the County of Marquette.\nWest. The land is described as being a portion of Parish Lot No. 51, of the Dominion Government Survey of the Parish of Portage la Prairie, but no such Plan as is referred to in this description has ever been registered in this Land Titles Office, consequently there is no way of locating the property described in it.\n\nNo. 9240 is a Deed, dated 8 September 1882, and registered 9 September 1882, from Thomas Logan and J.B. Henderson to Thomas Cairns of Portage la Prairie, Maulster, covering Lots 28, 29, and 30, in Block 18, as per Plan described in Instrument 7556. I shall further deal with this Instrument when reporting on Instrument 12952 below.\n\nNo. 9241 - mortgage from Thomas Cairns to J.J. Steele, is sufficiently discharged by a Discharge which does not appear upon the Registrar's abstract, but which is filed in application 2638. Refer to my report on that application.\n\nNo. 9247 is a partial release of Number 6267. It is not necessary to report on it, because No. 6267 is wholly released by No. 11013.\n\nNo. 11014 is a Deed, dated 19 April 1883 and registered 21 April 1883, from Thomas Logan and James B. Henderson to Malcolm Cummings, covering the portion of Lot No. 51 described in registered Instrument No. 6266; but containing, however, the further exception of Lots 28, 29, and 30, in Block 18, and Lots 3 and 4, in Block B., as described in registered Instruments No. 9240 and No. 7556 above referred to.\nNo. 11271 is a Deed, dated 27 July 1832, and registered 5 June 1833, from Thomas Logan and James B. Henderson, to Frank Forsythe, of Toronto, Ontario, farmer; covering Lots 5 and 6, in Block E., as per Plan referred to in Instrument No. 7556 above mentioned. My remarks as to the above unregistered Plan in reporting on Instrument No. 7556, will also apply to this Instrument.\n\nNo. 11907 is a Deed, dated 5 November 1833, and registered 6 November 1833, from Malcolm Cummings to Joseph G. Chard, covering a portion of the Parish Lot lying between the Right-of-Way of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and Saskatchewan Avenue, and is a considerable distance to the north of the land now being purchased, so that it is not necessary to report upon the Instrument.\n\nNo. 12582 - Mortgage from Malcolm Cummings to James Cowan, is sufficiently discharged by No. 14098.\n\nNo. 12952 - Deed dated June 3 1834 and registered 12 August 1834, from Malcolm Cummings to Thomas Cairns, covers a part of the land now being purchased, and will be dealt with in my report on Application 2638 below.\n\nNo. 15437 - Mortgage from Thomas Cairns to James J. Steele, is sufficiently discharged by a Discharge which does not appear upon the Registrar's Abstract, but which is filed in Application 2638. See my remarks when reporting on that application.\nNos. 21762, 23495, 28601, 35404, 42912, 42943, 51204, 53433, and Application No. 4461, all refer solely to the portion of the Parish Lot Described in Instrument No. 11907 above mentioned, and do not in any way affect the portion of the Parish Lot now being purchased by your Department.\n\nNo. 2638 is a Real Property Application, made by Mr. George Gosby, covering a portion of Parish Lot No. 51, which is now included in Certificate of Title No. 17461 of the Portage la Prairie Land Titles Office, in the name of William Budd. Negotiations are at present under way for the purchase of this property from William Budd, by your Department. Fyled in this Application, is a Conveyance from Thomas Cairns to the applicant, covering the properties described in registered Instruments Nos. 9240 and 12952, so that the Application clears up entirely the cloud which these two documents would otherwise form upon the title. There is also a Surveyor's Certificate fyled with the Application, to the effect that the property described in it includes the property conveyed to Thomas Cairns by the two registered Instruments last above mentioned. The Certificate is given by the Surveyor who originally made the unregistered Plan of Subdivision for Logan and Henderson. I also find in this application packet, the discharges of the above mentioned Mortgages, registered as Nos. 9241 and 15437, respectively. The Discharges were never abstracted, because the land described in the Mortgages covered nothing more than the land included in the Application.\nNo. 31079 is Patent from the Crown to Malcolm Cummings, dated January 30 1877, covering the whole of Parish Lot No. 51, as shown on a Plan of the Parish of Portage la Prairie, dated January 1 1875, signed by John Stoughton Dennis, Surveyor-General of Dominion Lands, and of record in the Dominion Lands Office.

The Plan shows the Right-of-Way to contain 1.42 acres.\n\nNo. 5110 is a Real Property Application, by Malcolm Cummings, covering Right-of-Way of the Canadian Northern Railway.\nNo. 5110 - continued.\n\nCompany, as shown on Plan 327. The Certificate of Title in this Application issued to the Canadian Northern Railway Company.\n\nNo. 64920 is a Deed from Malcolm Cummings to the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company, covering their Right-of-Way through Parish Lot 51. Their Right-of-Way lies to the north of the Canadian Northern Railway Right-of-Way, so that it would not affect the portion of the Parish Lot being purchased.\n\nNo. 72839 is a Deed from Margaret Cummings and Thomas Cummings, executrix and executor of Malcolm Cummings deceased, to Margaret Cummings, widow, covering all of Parish Lot 51, of the Parish of Portage la Prairie, excepting:\n\nFirst; The Budd property, as described in Certificate of Title above mentioned.\n\nSecondly; The Right-of-Way of the Canadian Northern Railway Company.\n\nThirdly; The portion of the Parish Lot lying between the Right-of-Way of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the Saskatchewan Avenue.\n\nNos. 74147 and 74331 both cover the portion of the Parish Lot lying to the south of the Sleugh Road, so that they do not interfere with the portion to which we are making title.\n\nNo. 72810, shown on G.R. Certificate, is the Probate of the Will of Malcolm Cummings, deceased, granted by the Surrogate Court of the Central Judicial District, for the Province of\nManitoba, on the 20th of October 1908, and registered on the 25th of September 1909. The operative part of the Will is as follows:\n\n\"I give, devise, and bequeath all the property which I may die possessed of, or be entitled to, unto my wife absolutely.\n\n\"I hereby appoint my said wife and my son Thomas Cummings to be the executors hereof.\" The Will appears to have been properly signed, and Probate duly granted.\n\nNo. 82161 on the G.R. Certificate, is the Will of Margaret Cummings, deceased, widow of the late Malcolm Cummings. I have obtained, and am enclosing with my report, a copy of the Probate of this Will. The Will is sufficient to authorize the executors to sell the property, and to enable them to make good safe holding title.\n\nNo. 303 is a Plan of a Public Road running through Parish Lot 51, taking off 1.02 acres. This is the road which you will find excepted from the description in the Deed of the property.\n| No. of Instrument | Instrument | Date of Registry | Date of Registry | GRANTOR | GRANTEE | Consideration or Amount of Mortgage | QUANTITY OF LAND AND REMARKS |\n|-------------------|------------|------------------|------------------|---------|--------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| 3307              | R.P.A      | 24 Oct 1871      | 9 July 1881      | M.

These two certificates cover all the Parish Lot as they are now described, but the descriptions are both by meks and bounds and are rather complex. It would only cost $3.00 or $4.00 to have these Certificates consolidated, and the property could then be described as all of Parish lot lying between the two boundaries on the North and South, with the exception of the Municipal road. The consolidation, too, would do away with any possibility as to errors in the meks and bounds description.\n\nF. G.

Posts can be placed at any distance from 16\u00bd feet to 33 ft. apart, according to lay of ground. Our stiff stays and rigid locks permit the use of fewer posts.\n\nIf exact number of rods with number of Horizontals and Stays and height of fence, are mentioned when ordering, we will send correct amount of material for any particular fence without further specifications.\nFrost Maple Leaf Fence For inclosing Parks, Cemeteries and Lawns.\n\nAn ornamental fence in a class by itself and at a very low cost. Materials shipped in knocked down form for construction on either neatly trimmed or turned cedar posts, or iron posts with pipe top rail.\n\nAn almost endless variety of designs suiting every particular requirement can be built. Both Malleable and Stamped Steel Maple Leaves with galvanized coating are furnished and are securely attached to the Stays when so ordered, or can be supplied in bulk.\nFrost 10 Wire Field-Built Fence\n\nHorizontals of Best Quality Frost Wire, stretched one at a time and spaced as desired.\n\nStyle No. 1 has 10 Wires and 6 Stays to rod.  \nStyle No. 2 has 5 Stays to rod.  \nStyle No. 3 has 4 stays to rod.\n\nSee opposite page for necessary materials to build leading styles.\nFrost Field-Built Fence\n\nIn strength and years of service this fence rivals a stone wall.\n\nMaterials for building this and the Maple Leaf fence illustrated on page 16, are shipped in knocked down form. The Horizontals are Genuine Frost Coiled Wire No. 9. Stays are made from No. 7 Gauge Hard Steel Wire (double the size and stiffness used in machine-made fence), straightened and cut to required lengths, with a loop or ring at the top, and are shipped in bunches. The Metal Locks for securely attaching these Heavy Steel Stays to the Coiled Laterals are cut and formed in automatic presses, then given a good coat of galvanizing. They are sold by the pound, averaging about 85.\n\nFrost Field Built Fence has marked advantages over factory woven fence, and although more time is required to build it than to stretch machine made fencing, the appearance is so vastly better and will give so much longer service that all who continue to build and use this fence feel well rewarded for the extra work.\n\nThis better appearing and more substantial fence is used most extensively along roadsides at the fronts of property where especially neat and substantial fence is desired. The use of Maple Leaf Stays, as on page 16, converts it into an ornamental fence.\n\nOther advantages are, that being put together on the posts, it fits uneven surfaces and is also suitable for stretching through woods and rough country. Any number of wires and stays can be used and spaced as desired.\n\nThe only special tools required for building it are the Block and Tackle with McCluskey Wire Grip, Hand Stretcher, and the Frost Locker for tightening the locks.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nSchools Branch -\n\nPlease take up the question of fencing our boarding school property at Portage la Prairie. It is recommended that a fence similar to the one marked in blue pencil on cut enclosed herewith, would be the proper kind of fence to put up.\n\nD. S. G. I.

I am also enclosing tax certificate showing all taxes paid to the end of 1913, and my certificate as to title.\n\nI also enclose separate accounts covering my commission on the purchase of the property and Solicitor's fees for searching the title etc. This finally completes the purchase of the boarding school property. The part of Parish Lot 52 contained in the enclosed certificate was owned, as I have mentioned above, by the Estate of the late George H. Lee and the transfer which we have obtained was from the administrator of his estate, Before the District\nRegistrar would register the transfer the sale had to be approved by the Registrar General and in the approving of the sale the Registrar General directed that the share of the Estate belonging to the infant daughter, Frances Lee, should be paid to the Toronto General Trusts Corporation in trust for her. The share of this infant amounts to one-ninth of the total estate. For your information I am enclosing here-with duplicate original of the Registrar General's order approving the sale. Before the District Registrar issued the certificate of title I had to give him my undertaking that I would see that this provision of the Registrar General's order was carried out. I will therefore require cheques as follows:\n\n1. In favor of the Toronto General Trusts Corporation for $277.77, being one-ninth of the total purchase money for deposit with them to the credit of Frances Lee.\n\n2.

Thus the fence can always be kept in good repair.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nS.

(RG 10, Volume 6275, file 583-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, September 9, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that a delay has taken place in the payment of your account for the preparation of plans and specifications for arrangement of buildings and ornamentation of grounds in connection with the Indian boarding school at Portage la Prairie.\n\nOn examining your account it is found that it will have to be amended before it can be paid. I am returning the duplicate copy so that you may have the following changes made thereon. The account should be dated and the date of your visit to Portage la Prairie and the length of your stay there should also be given. Details should be furnished in connection with the item of $25.00, which would include your travelling expenses and hotel bill. Vouchers should also be given for the charge of $45.00 for the services of a surveyor to survey the grounds. These details are required for the Auditor General.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. H.

Brodick, Esq.,\nSt. Catharines, Ont.\nIndian Boarding School,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.,\nSeptember 24th, 1914.\n\nSirs:\u2014\n\nI beg to inform the Department that some 300 feet of fencing in front of the new Indian School in course of construction, was left unfenced. The materials for the school are all on the ground and as there is no danger of the fence being destroyed by careless teamsters we can have it erected. It is best to have it constructed now as the frost will not be out of the ground before June and the fence will need to be up in early spring to keep stock out.\n\nI would ask the Department if they will kindly send me specifications for the four brick pillars which will form the two entrances. These were to be stone buttments, brick center and stone caps if I remember Mr. C.D. Chene's suggestions correctly.\n\nI shall be very pleased to hear from the Department as we cannot depend on weather after October the 20th.\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

The ground should be so graded that flood water will readily run off from the building. Provision should also be made for carrying off water from the cistern allowing water to flow on the ground and overflowing in this way after cistern is filled. It is not necessary to make a simple device that the tinsmith could easily make and fit in place.\n\nWith reference to entrance to boiler room in basement, the entrance is at the lower level as well as other entrances on that side, and had this been provided no platform would have been necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The fencing will begin at one curve marked with arrow point and continued to gate curved 50 feet beginning again at gate post carried around curve to roadway 50 feet, being in all $35 ft. of fencing, and two pair of large gates and two single small gates, all of the dimensions specified.\n\nIt is noted in your directions for measurement of fencing that a charge for fencing the space occupied by gates is included and charged for extra to the price of gate. This, however, will not be allowed as the price is based on price per foot for actual iron work in fence exclusive of masonry posts and gates paid for at arranged prices.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nPortage la Prairie, Man., May 15th 1965\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott - 479657\nDeputy Dept. Gen. Indian Affairs Ottawa\n\nMr. Chas Jeffrey contractors places estimated cost of crushed rock roads, granolithic sidewalks grading and removing trees on site of Indian school here at two thousand two hundred and seventy-eight dollars. If any extra sidewalk is required and not obtainable on the site, it will be shown on plan being forwarded today. It will also be built for seventeen and one half cents per square foot. If extra dirt not obtainable on the site is required for grading it will cost fifty cents per yard.\n\nThis price was arrived at after Mr. Hendry had specified according to my instructions just what was absolutely necessary.\n\nMr. Jeffrey will undertake to furnish all labor and materials for the above figure or do it on a basis of fifteen per cent. Kindly wire me Jeffrey instructions as soon as possible.\n\nChas Jeffrey\nJune 12th, 1915.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir;\n\nFrom what I have heard it would appear that the Department has decided, for financial reasons not to construct the broken stone driveway this year.\n\nHave you considered having this work done day's labor, without having it done through any contractor? Labor is very cheap here at present and I think we could get this driveway constructed at a very low cost under present conditions.\n\nMr. Hendry, Principal of the School is quite willing to assist in this work with his Indian Boys and also with his team, so that in this way we should be able to get this work done at a minimum cost.\n\nI have had experience in putting down these driveways and believe that I can supervise and have the work done to the satisfaction of your Department.\n\nIf the Department care to reconsider the matter, I can if you so desire, give you an estimate of the approximate cost.\n\nAs an alternate scheme Mr. Hendry suggests that he grade up the driveway and that this be covered with gravel. The cost for this would be for the gravel, which could be got from the C.P.R. Gravel pit at Marquette, about 30 miles distant; then there would be the cost of heaving up to the school. The work of spreading and leveling could be done principally by the help\nat the school. I have taken it upon myself to get the price of the gravel laid down here, and will advise you of this as soon as I have the information.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. Scott Garrioch\n\nIndian Affairs.

Enclosed drawing shows gates with additional rail, making four rails, extra heavier post, 1\u00bd x 1\u00bd for hinge post, double diagonal braces, for extra size and additional material price will be $50.00 more, this for 2 pair double gates 14ft. wide and single gates 3ft. wide making a total of $160.00. We hope this will meet with the approval of the department, as we want to make gates to suit height and design of posts.

I had a letter from the Munro Steel & Wire Works on Saturday last, the 17th, saying that the gates were being forwarded that day. Mr. Munro, the Manager, suggested in his letter that he should send up an experienced foreman to supervise the erection of the fence, as he said that it was advisable to have it well and properly set up. He also telephoned me to this effect. I gave him to understand that his views coincided with mine as to the desirability of having the fence erected properly, but that I had no authority to authorize the employing of his foreman. Since receiving Mr. Munro's letter however, I have been conferring with Mr. Hendry, and he states that he does not know of anyone here who has been accustomed to putting up these iron fences, and thinks that it would be money well spent to employ Mr. Munro's foreman. If you consider it advisable to do this you might kindly instruct me accordingly, when I will ask Mr. Munro to send his man along. Is\nW. Scott Garrioch\n\nit your intention that I should employ the men to put up this fence.\n\nYou might kindly instruct me as to this. An early reply will oblige.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.

You should note that the height of brick in posts will be reduced by nine inches, to better accord with the gates.\n\nIt is intended that you will also erect the iron fence as it is necessary that these iron fence posts shall be imbedded in concrete. This work can be very well be undertaken by you at the time you are building the gate posts, and should be rushed as rapidly as possible, as I am anxious to have the work completed.\n\nPlans showing the fencing is being sent you under separate cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChas.

S.\n\nThe landscape plans of the Portage la prairie school-grounds does not show any hedges along the driveway or roads, only shrubs and perennial beds.\n\nTwo-hundred and ninety trees were planted last year at a cost of $500.00; these were paid at from $1.50 to $2.00 a piece.\n\nHedges would probably cost about 15\u00a2 per lineal foot. As the number of trees wanted is not mentioned in the principal's letter, no estimate of the cost for completing this work can be made.\nMay 9th, 1916.\n\nDear Mr. Hendry -\n\nI have your letter of the last instant, with reference to the planting of trees and hedges on the grounds of the Portage la Prairie School. I may say that the landscape plans do not show any hedges along the driveway or roads, only shrubs and perennial beds.\n\nI would ask you to be good enough to let me know the extent of the hedge that you would wish to set out with the cost, and also the number of trees that should be replaced with the price per tree.\n\nOur funds this year are very limited but I hope to be able to do what is necessary towards completing the arrangements of the grounds.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.

This would come to about $30.00. There are some 100 trees dead and he will put them in at half price 75 cents each. Ten bush trees on the lawn inside the driveway would make a fine showing in a few years. We could use honeysuckle, wintergreen, and balsam. These would cost $2.50 each. If any part of these can be allowed we shall be very grateful.\n\nI remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nW. A. [Signature]\n\nD. C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy-Minister, Dept., of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nReferring to the request made by the Rev. Mr. Hendry, Principal of the Portage la Prairie Boarding School, for a further supply of trees to replace the ones that died, also for 1500 caragana plants for a hedge along the walk in front of the school and for evergreens and flowering shrubs I beg to say that last year 131 elm and 159 whitewood trees were furnished this school at a cost of $500.50. Mr. Hendry states that all the whitewoods planted last spring are doing well, but a number of the elms are dead, and he asks for 100 trees to replace them. This shows that over 75 per cent of the elm trees died. He attributes this to the hard season and lack of rain during the first part of last summer. The elm is as hardy as the whitewood and such a large percentage of failures can only be accounted for by lack of care in transplanting and, if, it is decided to replace them, I think the Department should require a guarantee from the Highland Park Nursery, who will furnish the trees now asked.\nasked for at a reduced rate, that they will replace any that are not alive next spring.\n\nThe caragana plants requisitioned for are suitable for a hedge in that locality and the number asked for will be sufficient to insure a good thick hedge for the distance given, 450 feet, and the price is fair.\n\nIt will cost $125.00 to buy the stock asked for by Mr. Hendry and, if you are disposed to grant his request, authority should be given as soon as possible, as the season is advancing and the shrubs should be set out.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You may also purchase one hundred elm trees at 75 cents each to replace those that died and ten bush trees, such as honeysuckle, wintergreen and balsam, for the lawn at the cost of $2.50 each.

Edmison,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Edmison:\n\nAt the time the Department purchased the property for the Indian School, it was impossible to get any more land adjoining the present property at a price anything as low as was paid for the Cumming's estate. The only person who owned land adjoining the school was Mr. Edward Stacey. Since then his health has failed and he now wishes to see the 47 acres marked on the sketch map (Demonstration Farm) and also the 28 acres west of the property on which the school is built. It could be purchased at a very reasonable price now, but if it is sold to the farmers on the West whose land it is adjoining it will be difficult to again secure it.\n\nThe Demonstration Farm is in an excellent state of cultivation and is fenced with a fence similar to the one around the school property. The 28 acres is also in a good state of fertilization and has a good fence around it.\n\nI think that the Department should be informed about this land being up for sale as there will likely never be a better opportunity of securing it. Each time the Grand Jury visits the school they strongly recommend more land. I enclose two different reports from the Grand Jury.\n\nI am also enclosing a rough sketch map of the property for sale showing its position in regard to the school property.\n\nTrusting that you will see fit to forward this information to the Department at Ottawa,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. A. Hendry,\nPrinc.\nD. C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nA few weeks ago we received from Portage la Prairie a statement of the report of the Grand Jury that had visited Portage la Prairie School, a paragraph of which reads as follows:\n\n\"The building is scrupulously clean and reflects great credit on the staff. We found 81 pupils all of whom seem very much interested in their work. This institution is a little different to the others as it needs more land to supply the needs of the institution, and we would suggest that the proper authorities be induced to purchase a further 50 acres.\"\n\nI at once communicated with Mr. Hendry, the Principal of the school, and I have a letter from him today, copy of which I enclose.\n\nI have taken up the matter with our Women's Missionary Society, and I find that their Board are also of the opinion that there should be more land in connection with this school.\nI trust that you will give this request consideration at an early date, as it seems an opportune time to purchase. Hon. Arthur Meighen knows the situation at Portage la Prairie, and will be in a position to advise.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJ.H.E.-A.V.\n\nSecretary.\nJanuary 4, 1917.\n\nDear Mr. Edmison,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the 22nd ultimo, with reference to the question of the provision of more land for the Portage la Prairie Indian boarding school, and to say that this matter will be given consideration, though it is very doubtful whether we will be able to get the money for this purchase at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ.

J. D.\nFALL ASSIZES 1917.\n\nPortage la Prairie, November 9th, 1917.\n\nTO HIS LORDSHIP, Justice MacDonald.\n\nMAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP:\n\nWe, the Grand Jury of the Central Judicial District of the Province of Manitoba for the Fall Assizes, beg leave to submit the following report:\n\nWe have had under our consideration ten indictments for all of which we returned true bills.\n\nAccording to your instructions we have visited the various public buildings and report thereupon as follows:\n\nThe Court House.\n\nWe have been pleased to find that the Court House has been renovated throughout and fitted up with modern electric fittings and wiring; The Judge's Chamber and Petit Jury Room have had lavatories installed and telephones have been placed in the room of the Crown Prosecutor and also for the accommodation of the public.\n\nWe think it might improve the Court Room particularly with regard to acoustic qualities and ventilation if it were re-arranged so that the Judge might face south and the public enter and take their seats from two aisles, proceeding from south to North.\n\nThe Provincial Gaol.\n\nWe cannot speak too highly of the excellent effects the gaol produced upon us. The prisoners number at present 17, including one female, and their general appearance reflects the highest credit upon the gaol staff. The ventilation in the lower cell room is somewhat defective and we would recommend that the cells be moved into the part which is used at present as a chapel.\nWe notice in the engine room there is no railing to protect the workmen or the public from falling among the pumps and for their safety this should be done at once. The wooden fence partly surrounding the gaol yard is rather an eye sore. We recommend that it be removed and replaced with a fence rather more in keeping with the rest of the premises.\n\nOne commendable new feature is the root house in which are stored in safety against the frost enough vegetables raised by the prisoners themselves in the gaol garden to last the entire institution through the winter, in addition to which gardening there have been nearly three thousand hours labor of the prisoners spent in various public works.\n\nThe Hospital.\n\nWe were conducted through this institution by the Matron and find it excellent in every particular so far as we were able to judge. The patients number 24, 11 males and 13 females, and a staff altogether number 16, including two graduate nurses.\n\nThe Industrial School.\n\nWe spent a good deal of time in this institution which appears to be making excellent progress under Mr. McKinnon and staff, in turning out men fit to take their place worthily in the world. We examined the excellent stables, the school room, and all the various departments in the main building and found them all very satisfactory. We notice the blacksmith shop has been discontinued and recommend that this be re-opened and the blacksmith work of all public buildings sent to this shop to be done. The bedrooms for the staff here are very inadequate and bear no comparison with those in the Indian School. There is certainly some reason here for re-arrangement and no lack of room. The cattle are well cared for but we think it might be more in keeping with the excellence of the institution if they were improved and made more typical of the breed represented. We also think that a commercial teacher should be permanently employed.\nand this course taught which should enable the boys to take a satisfactory place in business circles. We were pleasantly surprised to learn that the farm connected with the Home had raised over $20,000.00 worth of produce and are glad to call your Lordship's attention to this excellent record. The basement of the stable is filled with scores of tons of sugar beets, potatoes, and other garden produce.\n\nThe number of inmates is at present 64 and the staff numbers 22. The farm in connection is composed of about 300 acres.\n\nThe Indian School.\n\nThis is another institution which merits the highest praise. The Superintendent, Mr. Hendry, informed us that he is the only man living in the building and that all the manual labor is performed by the boys and girls under his charge who number altogether 76, that is 30 boys and 46 girls.\n\nThe children are apparently quite at home and quite happy, and their excellence of their technical work and the progress in education they have shown is a sufficient warrant for the continued support of this Branch of Indian Affairs.\n\nWe strongly recommend that the small farm in connection be increased by 28 acres adjoining, which we understand can now be purchased at a satisfactory price. This would be a purchase which would soon pay for itself as there is ample help to work it.\n\nThe Home for Incurables.\n\nThis is an excellent institution also and the devotion of the nurses and attendants under most trying circumstances is altogether admirable. It would be a libel to state that the world was getting worse when such institutions are provided and maintained by public charity to care for feeble minded and infirm persons. The buildings are scrupulously clean and well cared for and in Mr. O'Brien, the Superintendent, we feel that\nthe Government has a very efficient and capable officer.\n\nThe Old People's Home.\n\nWhat has been said of the Home for Incurables is no less true of the Old People's Home. It was a pleasure to inspect this institution and the cleanly, cheerful and even happy old people should give a lesson in contentment to any observant visitor. The patients' both Homes number 335, and the staff 36. The farm in connection is composed of about 300 acres, all of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nStephen Benson.\nForeman.\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Clerk Brown\n\nIndian Affairs.

A look at the sketch map will show that Parish Lot No. 50 contains 7 acres between the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Canadian Northern Railway, thus on good means of obtaining a cross to Canadian Northern Railway, also 40 acres between the Canadian Northern Railway and Cemetery Road.\nalso 28 acres between Cemetery Road and Crescent Lake Road. All of Parish Lot 50 is exactly the same character of soil as the school property, a light sandy loam with a sandy subsoil. The land is in good condition, clean from weeds and well fertilized. Particularly the 16 acres which was the Provincial Government Demonstration Farm. The lot is well fenced, also no acres having the appearance as the school property.\n\nParish Lot 50a is better land than the school farm, as it is a little less sandy and farther removed from a slough bottom. It is clean of weeds, well fertilized and well fenced.\n\nThe Stacy buildings are on this lot. They comprise a good silo capacity 125 tons and a very large barn capable of sheltering 30 head of cattle. Also a frame house some 25 years old. While the buildings are not good they will save the school building up any future buildings until they can earn the money out of the farm.\n\nThe house would do for the farm instructor.\n\nThe lowest purchase price Mr. Stacy quoted was $130 per acre. The land is good, clean, well fertilized and well fenced.\nMr. Stagg's property adjoins the school property and if allowed to be purchased would give the Department their land in one block. It is the most desirable land possible to purchase.\n\nThe city is growing westward following the east lake, and at present the closest homes are only 50 rods from the Parish Hall to W.E.

When the matter was first brought to the attention of the Department by Mr. Inspector Jackson, it was stated that the property could be bought for $100.00 per acre. I wish you would be good enough to examine the title and at the same time let me know whether you consider the land is worth any more per acre than the sum which Mr. Jackson quoted, and also in the event of the Department having to pay more than $100.00 per acre, to what extent you think any advance would be justified. We, of course, wish to purchase the property at as cheap a rate as possible, at the same time we are willing to pay a fair and reasonable price.\n\nI should be glad to hear from you at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF.G.

Stacey, and as requested have made a Search of the registered title and find that George E. Stacey is the registered owner of both parcels of land described in your letter, under certificates of Title numbers 21137 - 22503, the whole of the land appears to be subject to a mortgage to the Investment Corporation of Canada Limited for $4,500. This is not to be considered a complete Search of the Title as I have only gone far enough to ascertain who is the Registered owner and what encumbrances there are registered, a more complete Search will be necessary in the event of your Department purchasing the land. I note what you say with reference to the price of the land. It is, as you know, situate almost immediately on the outskirts of this City and I should think that if you were about to purchase it for $115.00 per acre you would not be paying too much. Farm lands in this vicinity have been sold recently as high as $100.00 per acre. The particular sale I have in mind is a half section with good buildings. Mr. Stacey's land\nis very favorably situated and if I wanted it for my own purposes I do not think I would hesitate to pay $110.00 or $115.00 per acre. I suppose, however, in the purchase of it you will have to take into consideration the fact that this land is probably necessary for your purposes for the Indian School and that Stacey probably knows that you require it and perhaps some day will have to have it and the question would naturally arise as to whether it would not pay you to allow him a little more than the land is actually worth rather than take a chance of expropriation. However, I do not think you would be paying out of the way at $115.00 per acre.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTaylor & Colwill,\n\nPer.\nAugust 18, 1919.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of August 7, the contents of which have been noted. I have to ask you to endeavour to arrange for the purchase of this property. The Department desires to obtain this land, which is necessary to round out the property of the boarding school and to enable the management to give proper instruction to the Indian children. At the same time, I do not wish to pay more than is necessary for the property, and I have to request that you will endeavour to negotiate for its purchase at the most reasonable figure possible\u2014at $100.00 per acre, or not higher than $115.00 per acre; we cannot offer more than the latter amount.\n\nIf you will kindly report on the result of your negotiations, you will be further instructed.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nTaylor & Colwill\nBarristers, Solicitors, Notaries\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nAugust 23rd, 1919.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have your letter of the 18th instant addressed to Mr. Taylor who is at present on his holidays.\n\nThe writer will interview Mr. Stacey and report the result.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTaylor & Colwill.\n\nPer.

General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of 23rd inst., the writer had a talk with Mr. Stacey on Monday evening without disclosing to him that you wished to purchase his land. He mentioned in the course of the conversation that he would like to sell, and upon being asked his price said he would not take less than $15,000.00, which works out at a little over $130.00 an acre. He went on to say that he would like to reserve the corner on which he has his buildings and garden, which he estimated would contain about three acres. The house is of very little value and the stable is not much good; but there is a frame silo which was only built some four or five years ago. You might let us know whether you want all of the land, or whether you would be willing to have him reserve this portion. If he reserved it, there would be considerable difference in the purchase price. He said that the Department had considered buying his farm before the war, but then the matter dropped.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTAYLOR & COLWILL,\nper:\n\nJ.R.C.D\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6275, file 583-9, part 1)\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Arthur Meighen,\n\nWith your concurrence I took up with Mr. Taylor the question of the proposed purchase of additional land for the Portage la Prairie Indian Boarding School, and I inclose herewith a copy of a letter that I have received from him. This property is owned by Mr. George F. Stacey. Mr. Inspector Jackson reported that this land could be purchased for $100 per acre, but evidently Mr. Stacey will not part with it for less than $15,000.\n\nThis land is required for school purposes, as the agricultural activities at the school are conducted under a disadvantage, owing to the lack of sufficient land. We can provide funds from the general appropriation for these schools if you will authorize the purchase of the land at the figure above-mentioned.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSeptember 8th, 1919.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of August 27th, with reference to the proposed purchase of the Stacey property I have to say that we took up this question in the belief that the property could be purchased for $100.00 per acre. I wish you would advise Mr. Stacey of this fact and inform him that we have never considered the possibility of purchasing this property at any higher figure than that quoted, namely $100.00 per acre.\n\nYou may discuss with Mr. W. A. Hendry, principal of the Portage la Prairie Boarding school, the possibility of excluding the three acres upon which the buildings stand. Mr. Hendry is, I believe, of the opinion that these buildings could be used to advantage by the management.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nF. G.

Mr. Meighen -\n\nIn compliance with your direction, the Department on the 8th instant wrote to Mr. Taylor asking him to negotiate further with Mr. Stacey regarding the purchase of his property for use in connection with the Portage la Prairie Boarding School.\n\nA reply has just been received from the firm which explains itself and which I am sending for your perusal. Will you kindly direct whether we should purchase the property at the advance price of $150.00 or surrender our option and suspend negotiations in the meantime.\n\nWill you kindly return the letter from Messrs. Taylor and Colwill with your instructions.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nSept. 19th, 1919.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant and since its receipt have had a couple of interviews with Mr. Stacey.\n\nPrior to the receipt of your last letter, Mr. Stacey had been in and had made an offer to retain three and a half (3\u00bd) acres in the immediate vicinity of the buildings and it would of course include the buildings, and take $13,000.00 for the balance. This would work out a little more than $116.00 per acre for the land exclusive of buildings.\n\nAfter receipt of your letter of the 8th instant we saw Mr. Hendry, the Principal of the Portage la Prairie Boarding School and he expressed a very strong desire to have the buildings; he did not say that he did not want the land without the buildings but that he would a great deal rather pay $130. per acre for the whole thing than pay $13,000. and allow Mr. Stacey to retain the buildings and the acreage mentioned above, along with them. The writer then saw Mr. Stacey again and had a long interview with him. He wants to sell the place but at the same time he is just as anxious to retain the buildings. He would not, however, consider the $115.00 an acre for the whole thing. When he left the office he seemed inclined to\nallow us to submit an offer of $120.00 an acre and you take everything. We told him if he would do that we would recommend its acceptance but that we of course, could go no further than that and that we would be very doubtful if you would take it at that price. He said he would think the matter over until the next day and see us again. When he came back he told us that he had made up his mind that he would not vary his original proposition, that is:\n\n1. To take $130.00 per acre and sell the whole thing outright.\n\n2. To take $13,000.00 and retain the buildings and 3\u00bd acres of land along with them.\n\nWe told him that we had no idea that you would accept either proposition but that we would submit them for your consideration.\n\nWe have not seen Mr. Hendry since our last interview with Mr. Stacey. I am inclined to think that if he had offered him $115.00 an acre for the property before Mr. Hendry got his option of $130.00, Stacey would have accepted it, but he knows of course, that you want the property and that his is practically the only property you could get which would answer your purposes and in consequence is hard to deal with.\n\nHe asked me to request that if you did not want to accept the option which you already have that you should surrender to him and let him go on with his Fall work. He says he has made no preparation for cropping the land next year, that is in the way of Fall plowing, and that your option is good until the\ntime for doing Fall plowing would be over.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTaylor & Colwill,\n\nPer.\nOct. 22nd 1919\n\nMemorandum\n\nMr. Scott\n\nFrom what information I can get of land sales in Portage la Prairie and district, the $130.00 per acre asked by Mr. Stacey is quite reasonable.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nFarmers' Mutual Fire Insurance Company,\nPortage La Prairie,\nMan.\nSir,\n\nAs no doubt you may have seen in my last report on the Fortage Le Prairie Indian Boarding School, (April 29, No. 2924) a recommendation that the land adjoining the school land, about 100 acres be bought for the use of the school.\n\nI have heard recently that the land wanted, has been bought by the Department, and if nothing interferes, I would like to know if such is the case. If the land has been bought, there are certain changes necessary to the house that is on the farm, so that it may be used as a residence for the Principal.\n\nThe last time I visited the school, Mrs Hendry told me that the strain of the work, living in the school, was such on her that they were now seriously thinking of leaving the work, and moving to British Columbia, where they have a small fruit farm in one of the valleys. During the conversation I suggested that if the land above mentioned was bought, they could have the house on the farm fixed up and move over there to live, and put in a male assistant at the school. This move would be agreeable to Mr. and Mrs. Hendry, and would also solve another problem of the school, the want of a Junior class-room. The partition between the parlour and dining room, now used by them could be taken out at little expense, and the room thus made, about 16 X 32 would make a fine class-room. There is plenty of room for a male assistant without these two rooms, and the cost of fitting up the house on the farm, would be in the vicinity of $1000.\n\nMr. Hendry makes a model for this kind of Indian work, and I would not like to see him leave the service.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nDuncan G.

You might correspond with Mr. Hendry regarding your suggestion that they move to the residence on the farm, a male assistant to be put into the school, and report further.\n\nThere might be some difficulty in administering the school if Mr. Hendry moves out of the building.

Our charge is about two thirds of one per cent. We think perhaps this is the only item in the\nbill which requires any explanation.\n\nIn one of our former letters we forwarded you the surveyor's bill from Mr. Alex. Taylor, P.L.S.

It will be a great help financially in a few years and afford a splendid training ground for the boys. We will have to buy two horses, a double plow, and exchange our drill and binder for four horse out fits and with this little change I believe we can work the extra land.\n\nThe help problem is getting almost impossible in the schools.

R. Bunn of Winnipeg. I was in his office about a month ago and learned that Mrs. Judge Robinson had been consulting with Mr. Bunn as to which school they should ask for and he advised her strongly to center on Portage as it was by far the best school. Mr. Bunn is an Anglican but his sympathies are EVERLASTINGLY Presbyterian. Somehow or other he thought me an Anti and opened up by telling me that he had a visit from my friend Mrs. Judge Robinson but later when he found that I was United all talk on the matter ended.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Ogletree openly told me that the Presbyterians told him that they were putting in a claim for Portage school, and that Mr. Paterson, Manitoba organizer, was going to take the matter up with Commissioner Graham of Regina. They also said that if they did not get the School they would not take the Sioux Village.\n\nNo matter what is done in Regina every detail will have to go to Ottawa and come before the Deputy Minister, D.C. Scott, and the question of where are their children to fill the school will be the deciding factor. Only six children from the Sioux village are in school and there are 98 on the roll and five of these are children of United people, as they signed up for the United Church. One only is Presbyterian, and they have no territory that could be used to help the school. Their case looks absolutely ridiculous.\n\nMr. Macpherson, M.P. is United, was former Methodist but I do not know him very well. I fancy that when the Department look into the case they would see the impossibility. If it went we would build aday school at Long Plain reserve and all the recruiting ground would be cut off.\n\nOttawa should be conversant with the situation so as to be ready should it come up.\n\nYou are perfectly right about Commissioner Graham. I think that all the workers would welcome a return to the old system when we had Inspectors and dealt with the Department at Ottawa more direct and to have the Regina office abolished. It was established over the head of the War Cry Greater Production Movement and I am sure the work would be carried on better if we were more closely in touch with Ottawa.\n\nI am\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(sgd.) W.A. Hendry\nMarch 14th, 1927.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., Litt.D., F.R.S.C.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nMrs. Clark of the W.M.S. wrote Mr. Hendry and asked where he got his information in regard to the desire of the Presbyterians for Portage la Prairie. I am enclosing a copy of his reply. From this it would appear that if they do not get Portage la Prairie, they will not take Sioux Village. I think this is just as well. As a matter of fact, as I intimated to you the other day, we should not have consented to their having Sioux Village. However, the agreement made between Dr. Grant and myself should settle the future of Portage la Prairie and the future of the other Schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJHE/EWS\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hendry, Principal of the Portage La Prairie School, part of which reads as follows:\n\n\"This is just a note to put you wise if you have not already received a hint about it. The Antis are trying to get Portage school through the Department. The work, from reports which I have received, is being carried on between Commissioner Graham and Mr. Patterson, the Manitoba Organizer for the antis. One of course needs to just keep a sharp eye on the matter as it cannot go very far before it must come before the Department at Ottawa and then it can be handled by our people.\n\nHere are a few facts it might be well to have ready etc. We have 99 pupils on the roll and one only is the child of a non-concurring parent. There are seven of the 99 children from the Sioux Village which was allocated to them and six of these children signed to stay with the United Church and still declare that they will continue with us. Their claim for the school must rest on one pupil out of 99 and it is not a large claim to say the least.\n\nKindly let me know if you have had any word of this. I got it from two sources, both reliable, but of course it may not be determined enough to go all the way, but it is better to be ready.\"\n\nI trust that this is only a rumour. I am quite sure\nDr. Duncan G.

The East 49 rods is only an average fence but the corner and gate posts are 12 inch sets in cement. One could not use this wire again and make a fence like the one we have. It would have to be built up as it was in the first place. I am getting an estimate on the cost of replacing the fence and will forward it to you as soon as it reaches me.\n\nThe culverts seven of them would have to be replaced which would cost some $70.00\n\nThere is the old house which is surrounded with very nice trees and the ones in front of the house would be cut away and the house would be only 12 feet from the fence and an eye sore. This house is valuable in case of an epidemic or small Fox or similar disease and for the looks of the place would have to be moved if the road was put through. The value of tearing it down and replacing it in a better place would amount to about $800.00\n\nIf we are to have as good a fence as we had it will have to be put up by ourselves and have the money paid to the Department as one will have little control of things if the Municipality construct the fence. Also the fence should be replaced before they start work so as not to inconvenience the school with their work.\n\nThe price we paid for the land was $130.00 per acre but this is a small matter compared with the difficulties in getting to work while this road is being constructed.\n\nI am, Very truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Rev. Principal of the Indian Residential School has written that the area in question is nearly one acre, which is worth approximately $150. The cost of the land, however, is a small matter, in comparison to the expenses attendant upon replacing the fence, the culverts and a house which would have to be moved in the event the road was widened. Mr. Hendry is securing an estimate of the cost of replacing the fence. Seven culverts would cost approximately $70; to tear down and replace the house in question would amount to approximately $300.

This type of insulator is particularly reliable and will reduce to the minimum any interruptions on this line.\n\nIn addition to the right to erect these towers it would be necessary to include in the easement the right to properly maintain this line. This location has been chosen after very considerable survey and is one which causes the minimum of inconvenience in bringing the line out of the City of Portage la Prairie. The location has been moved to keep the line a safe distance from the day school, and tower on Lot 49 has been brought right up to the edge of the cemetery.\n\nAs the work on this transmission line is scheduled to proceed at an early date it would be appreciated if approval of this easement could be given at an early date.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDLM:Mc\nPower Commissioner.\n\nEnc.

I have to advise you that when a report has been received from the Department's local representative, you will be advised as to the terms upon which the Department will be prepared to grant the privileges you require.\n\nIn connection with the proposed easement I may say that it is the practice of the Department to grant the right to construct, operate and maintain a power line over a certain definite width of right of way and it is noted that your letter nor the blueprint which accompanied it show the right of way which your Commission considers necessary for the proper maintenance and operation and I should like to receive this information, as it is usually the policy of the Department in granting easements to power companies to arrive at the compensation on the basis of a price per acre. The Department of course reserves the right to use the surface of the land in the right of way not actually occupied by towers and poles and that the right of way remain unfenced.\n\nI should like to be advised if it is not economically practicable to locate the towers of this power line along the southerly limit of that roadway N. of the school buildings passing through Lots No. 50, 51 and 52.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.F. MacKenzie)\nAct. Assistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nE.L. McLean Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nManitoba Power Commission\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, 17th March 1930\n\nSir,\n\nAn application has been received from the Commissioner of the Manitoba Power Commission for an easement over a portion of School Lots 50 and 51, and as you will note on the enclosed blueprints it is proposed to erect three towers for their power line on these lots. The application does not state what width of right of way the power commission wishes to have the right to enter upon in connection with this power line and in granting the easement it will be necessary to give them permission to construct, operate and maintain their power line over a certain right of way. The surface of the land within this right of way would of course be undisturbed and be available for the use of the school authorities, except those portions actually occupied by the towers, as the easement would stipulate that the right of way must remain unfenced.\n\nIt must be remembered, however, that the conditions of the easement will allow the Commission to enter at all times upon the right of way in connection with the proper and lawful operation and maintenance of the line.\n\nYou are requested to consult with the Principal of the school as to what compensation should be demanded for the privileges required and forward your report to the Department. Power lines, in arranging with private owners, as a rule prefer to do so on a basis of so much per pole or tower, but it is more usually the custom of the Department to demand a payment at a price per acre. It must be remembered in making your valuation that the privilege requested constitutes a permanent easement and has therefore considerable effect on the market value of the whole property. You're requested to return the blueprint with your report. If the Principal and yourself consider it advisable that the Department should endeavour to get the power commission to change the location of this line, your report should cover the reasons for this attitude and should indicate on the blueprint the approximate position of the alternative route you would suggest.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.J. Waite Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6275, file 583-9, part 1)\nMemorandum\n\nSchools\u2014\n\nI note Deed of part Lot 51, Portage la Prairie, School property, in envelope on file accompanying letter No. 454993, Jan. 22nd 1914 and Certificate of Title in envelope accompanying Letter No. 455351. Should not these be recorded in the Lands Branch Register? The file does not show that Certificate of Title referred to in letter No. 529664, 14th Nov. 1919 was received. Perhaps it is recorded in the Lands Branch but they usually note that fact on the file when they so record it. If we have not received it, I think we should obtain and record it.\n\nChief Surveyor.\nApril 1st, 1930.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nAct. Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of March 17th and with further reference to our letter of March 7th, your File 127-1-9, relating to easement across Lots 50 and 51 in the Municipality of Portage la Prairie, would say that the easement is desired for a 30 foot width of right-of-way 1200 feet long.\n\nAmong other reasons the location along the southerly limit of the roadway North of the School Buildings passing through Lots 50, 51 and 52 was not considered practicable due to the fact that a telephone line is located on this road which would have made it necessary to destroy the very fine grove of trees upon your property.\n\nIn addition to this it would have put a kink in the line which would have added not only to the cost but to the danger of interruption which, for this line, should be kept down to a minimum.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDLM:Mo.\nManitoba Power Commissioner.\nOttawa, 7th April 1930\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 17th ultimo, I have to advise you that the Department is now informed that it is a right of way 30 ft. in width over which the Power Commission desires an easement across School Lots 50 and 51. The Power Commission also states that it was not considered practicable to construct this line along the southerly limit of the road North of the school buildings, which passes through Lots 50, 51 and 52, on account of the fact that a telephone line is located on the road, which would have made it necessary to destroy a very fine grove of trees and would have put a kink in the power line and have added, not only to the cost of construction, but to the danger of interrupted service.\n\nThe report requested in departmental letter above referred to should be forwarded at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.F. MacKenzie)\nAct. Asst. Deputy and Secretary\n\nS.J. Weite Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\nApril 9th, 1930.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the proposed location of the power line, across the property of the Portage la Prairie Residential School.\n\nThe proposed line as shown on the map, would cut through the boys playground, and the erection of a tower at the point shown would be a menace, as it would be practically impossible to stop the boys from climbing the tower. It is also intended to build the Principal's new residence at the point shown on the map, and to move the boys playground fence farther west. It is very necessary that the location of the line be changed, and I have shown on the map the suggested location. The Crescent Lake at this point of crossing is about 100 feet wider than at the proposed location, but the distance between the points marked A and B is a little shorter route than between the points marked A and C, which is the proposed location. The Principal is very worried over the location of the line as shown on the map, and requests the Department to have the location changed to the line suggested, if possible. I have been unable to find out the width of right away required for a line of the nature, but understand that it is 33 yards, the length of the line crossing the property is approximately one half mile. The land cost the Department $130.00 per acre, and this would be a fair valuation at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Ast. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 15th April 1930\n\nSir,\n\nI have to advise you that the Department does not approve of the location of the power line affecting the departmental property of the Portage La Prairie Residential School as indicated on the blueprint which accompanied your letter of the 7th ultimo. There are what the Department considers two serious objections to the location as set forth on this plan, one is that the line as located will pass through the boy's playground and one of the towers would be located within the playground, the other is that the site for the Principal's new residence has been decided upon and is situated about 80 yards to the North of the tower proposed to be erected in Lot 51. I am enclosing a sketch made from your blueprint, on which is indicated the site of the new residence and the position of the present boy's playground and a proposed addition to the playground, as well as a suggested location for your power line.\n\nIn view of these conditions, the Department suggests that the location of your line be changed between points A.D and C. to the one indicated on the sketch as A.B. or B.E.D.\n\nFrom the above you will readily realize that construction according to the present location would seriously damage the Department's property and that the Department is justified in maintaining the attitude that every possible effort should be made to locate the line on the suggested alternative routes or some other route which would not interfere to such an extent with the purpose for which the Department acquired this property.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.L. McLean Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nManitoba Power Commission,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\n(A.F. MacKenzie)\nAct. Assistant Deputy and Secretary\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba,\nApril 10th, 1930.\n\nSir;-\n\nRef. 127-1-9, Ottawa, 7th April 1930\n\nIn answer to the above noted letter, and further to my letter of yesterday's date in reply thereto, I beg to suggest that the land inclosed in the right of way, be measured if the new location, as suggested, is accepted by the Manitoba Power Commission.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs, Branch, Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am writing to you for instruction in the procedure to be adopted in dealing with a case of a serious nature.\n\nMary Atkinson (the daughter of Bitt Atkinson #252 of Roseau Indian Reserve) was allowed home for the holidays on the first of July this year in the care of her parents. I visited the reserve on the 30th day of August and was informed by the Farm Instructor (Mr. J.C. Scott) that the parents of Mary had married her to an Indian of Warroad in U.S.A.\n\nThe marriage is, I understand, a so-called Indian marriage. I have checked up the age of this child and find that the father received the first payment for Mary in the treaty payments in nineteen twenty four 1924 a notation in the book stating \"Girl born\". Mary was enrolled in the Portage-la-Prairie school on the 16th of August and the age given was 7 years. This was in the year 1931.\n\nI have discussed this with the local Agent Mr. Waite, and with the Mounted Police. It is my desire to lay information against the father Bitt Atkinson and the Indian Edward Blackbird of Warroad, U.S.A. The father was well aware that Mary was under age.\n\nThe case is complicated by the fact that Blackbird is a United States Indian. This difficulty is by no means insurmountable. I shall be glad if you would take up this serious case with the Headquarters of the Mounted Police in Ottawa and ask them to forward instructions to the Sergeant in charge at Portage-la-Prairie.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph Jones.\nOFTAWA, Sept. 27, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter received by the Department from the Principal of the Indian Residential School, Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nI am not at all sure what action can be taken by either the Principal or by your Force to prove that the father was a consenting party in this case. I am simply forwarding the communication in the hope that the matter will be carefully investigated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nThe Commissioner,\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Sept. 27, 1938.\n\nDear Mr. Jones:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 20th instant, in which you refer to the marriage of Mary Atkinson, who was until recently a pupil at the Portage la Prairie Residential School.\n\nI had a great deal of experience in dealing with such cases when in charge of the Welfare Department in the province of Manitoba. I am, personally, of the opinion that you will experience a great deal of difficulty in convincing any Court that the father was a consenting party in this case. However, your letter has been sent forward to the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, in the hope that the matter will be very thoroughly investigated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

The investigating officer in a report to his Superior Officer, which has now reached the Department, states:\n\n\"As this alleged marriage ceremony took place in the United States, it is possible that this type of marriage may be legal with American Indians. Should this be the case, then there is very little that can be done about the matter. Should, however, this type of marriage be illegal, then it is evident that Blackburde is guilty of an offence and that the father of the girl, Pitt Atkinson, is also guilty of contributing to juvenile delinquency. I would respectfully request that this matter be referred to the Indian Department with a view to having a further investigation made by the American authorities.\"\n\nIn view of the fact that this alleged offence took place -\n\nReverend Joseph Jones,\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\ntook place in the United States, it is somewhat difficult to know just what action should be taken by the officials here in an attempt to have the guilty parties punished. I have this morning discussed this matter very fully with the officials of this Branch, and it is our opinion that this girl or her mother, or both, should be encouraged to lay a charge against Blackburde before the proper American authorities. If she can be persuaded to do this, I feel confident action would be taken immediately by the American officials to have the matter brought before a court of competent jurisdiction. If however the girl refuses to do this, it will be somewhat difficult for us to take the matter up effectively at Washington, in the absence of any request from the girl that proceedings should be instituted.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you again with respect to this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

Hoey, Esq.\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr Hoey,\n\nRe- Laura Onesides.\n\nThis girl was brought into this school on August 16th 1935, given a number 0253 and reported in the September quarter in the usual way. On the 6th of Dec. 1935 I received a letter from Mr Waite, Indian Agent, stating that Laura's admission was not approved. (Copy enclosed) I replied on Dec. 9th. Again on the 2nd. of Jan. 1936 I made another appeal for this child.\n\nDuring the Summers of 36, 37, & 38, Laura and her mother were pleading with me to take her back to school.\n\nIn Sep. 1938 the Agent received another application signed by the mother and (I believe) forwarded by the Farm Instructor at Swan Lake. The Agent wrote to me on the 6th of Sep. re- this application.\n\nLaura will be 11 years this year, so the earlier she is admitted to a school the better for the child.\n\nMay I here make reference to our pupilage. Inspector Hamilton and Agent Waite are quite satisfied that I can comfortably accommodate 100 pupils (I have had 103 in attendance) this Quarter I have 96. We have ample air space and all our children are in excellent health.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nJoseph Jones\nOttawa, February 8, 1939.\n\nRe - Laura Onesides\n\nDear Mr. Jones:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the first instant and to thank you for the information contained therein. It would appear from the records that the above noted pupil was enrolled at the Portage Residential School and that later an application was sent forward to the Department asking for the approval of her admission.\n\nThe admission of this girl was not approved for the simple reason that the agent intimated that she was the child of an American Indian, that her father had been put off the Lake reserve and that, in view of the number of our own Indians now eligible for admission, the claim of this girl for admission should not be considered. It would appear that the Indian agent had the impression that because this girl was the child of an American Indian she was somehow or other ineligible for admission. Just how he received this impression I am not in a position to state.\n\nIn view of the fact that this girl is now 11 years old and has been attending the day school regularly and has reached an age when she can be useful to her mother, I am not at all sure that she will be unwilling to enroll at the residential school now, nor am I sure that it would be advisable to wait her out this comparatively late date. This is a matter however that can be discussed by you and the Indian agent. Any joint recommendation you may care to make will be carefully and sympathetically considered by the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend Joseph Jones,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\nOttawa, February 6, 1939.\n\nRe - Laura Onesides\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA few weeks ago the Reverend Joseph Jones in a letter to the Department intimated that children of American Indians who may have established residence on Indian reserves in Canada from time to time are ineligible for enrolment at our residential schools. In view of this fact he was of the opinion that legal proceedings should be instituted against an American Indian who had lived for a time with a young Indian girl, formerly a pupil at the Portage School, but who later sent this girl back to her parents on the Rosseau reserve. In an attempt to substantiate his contention, the Principal of the Portage la Prairie School referred to the case of Laura Onesides of the Swan Lake reserve. In my reply to the Principal I stated:\n\n\"I was somewhat surprised and disturbed at your reference to Laura Onesides of the Swan Lake reserve. It has never been the policy of the Department so far as I am aware to deny illegitimate children admission to residential schools simply because the putative father was supposed to be an American citizen. If such a ruling was given by the Department, I should like to have the exact date of the letter and any other information you may care to send forward.\"\n\nThe Principal has now sent forward copies of two letters, dated December 6, 1935, and September 6, 1938, received by him from you, in one of which you state that \"the application of this girl to the Portage la Prairie School has not been approved by the Department.\" In your letter dated September 6, 1938, you state: \"In reply I have to advise that as this girl is non-treaty, regulations do not permit her entering a residential school as a grant-earning pupil.\"\n\nThe records indicate that this girl was refused admission and that this refusal was based on a recommendation contained in a letter received by the Department from you, dated November 27, 1935. In this letter you state:\n\n\"This girl - Laura Onesides - is the daughter of an American National who was removed from the Swan Lake reserve some years ago. I do not recommend the admittance of this girl as the school can be readily filled by children of treaty Indians. The mother is paid under ticket 116.\"\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\nThe Acting Superintendent of Indian Education in his reply dated December 3, 1935, stated in part:\n\n\"In view of the information given in your letter, the Department is not prepared to approve the admission of this girl, and you should so inform the Principal.\"\n\nThe Department has of course the right to admit or refuse admission to pupils applying for enrolment at residential schools at any time. In reaching decisions however we are usually guided by the recommendations of our Indian agents. This particular pupil - Laura Onesides - was refused admission to the Portage School on your recommendation and not because she was the child of an American Indian and certainly not because she was non-treaty. This is the point I want to emphasize.\n\nYou are probably aware that there is a statutory provision in the United States Immigration Act, whereby Canadian Indians are admitted to the United States, despite immigration and quota laws that may exist from time to time. A great many Canadian Indians take advantage of this opportunity in an attempt to secure employment. Canadian Indians seeking entry to the United States have never, so far as I am aware, been refused admission. In actual practice the Canadian Government follows the same procedure although we have no statutory provision granting American Indians free right of entry to this country. No American Indian, so far as I am aware, has ever been refused admission, although an American Indian with a criminal record or suffering from a contagious disease would no doubt be refused admission to this country.\n\nYou can readily grasp therefore the significance of this ruling. If we deny the children of American Indians access to our educational institutions, it would be only rational to suppose that the Americans would deny educational opportunities to Canadian Indians residing in the United States.\n\nIt is fortunate in this case that there is an Indian day school on the Swan Lake reserve and that this girl has been in attendance at this school. If this had not been the case she would almost certainly have grown up illiterate. The returns indicate that she has been attending this school regularly and is now 12 years of age. It is just possible, in view of her age and her usefulness to her mother, that she may not be anxious to enroll at the residential school. This is a case that should be discussed by you with the Principal of the Portage School and all misunderstandings relating thereto cleared.\ncleared up. We simply cannot allow the impression to get abroad that we are denying American Indians educational opportunities in this country.\n\nYou might in your reply explain exactly what you mean by the term \"non-treaty\". More than half the Indians of Canada are non-treaty in the sense that they receive no treaty payment. Do you mean by non-treaty a white citizen who may be referred to as a halfbreed? Such an individual of course is a white citizen and his children are by that very fact ineligible for enrolment at one of our schools.\n\nI am writing to the Principal and intimating to him that you will discuss this case with him in due course.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, February 28, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Jones:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 24th instant and also letter received by you from Superintendent E.C.P. Salt, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, attached thereto.\n\nI can see no valid objection whatever to your going to Warrad in an attempt to secure a conviction against Edward Blackburde.\n\nI can readily appreciate the difficulty the police would experience in securing evidence to prove that an offence had been committed in Canada. I think I reminded you in one of my preceding letters that I had a great deal of experience in handling such cases over a period of four or five years in the province of Manitoba. My experience was that it was almost impossible to secure a conviction in these cases. I heartily agree with you, however, that the difficulties of the case should not deter you from taking action. I regret that there does not appear to be closer cooperation in such matters between the Department here and the Department of Indian Affairs in the United States. There is nothing on file here to indicate that such cases have been referred at any time to the United States authorities.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A.

JONES had called at the Rossau River Lake to collect the children for the Indian School at Portage La Prairie and on going to the home of the above named Frank FUKKINA or EDWARDS, the boy refused to go to school and the boy's father, Edward FUKKINA refused to permit the boy to go to the School. Rev. JONES requested we do something about the matter.\n\n---\n\n**3.**\n\nAs a Truant Officer I served a notice on Edward FUKKINA as per Section 10 of The Indian Act giving FUKKINA three days to have the boy in the School at Portage La Prairie. This notice was served on September 2nd, 1939.\n\n---\n\n**4.**\n\nOn this date I received a telephone message from the Rev. Jones at Portage La Prairie asking what steps had been taken in the matter. He was informed as to what had been done and he stated that if the boy did not arrive at the School he would call again.\n\n---\n\n**5-9-39**\n\nOn this date Capt. Eaton of this Detachment had to make a Patrol to Dominion City to attend to some other Police duties so he was instructed to call at the FUKKINA home and ascertain if the boy had been sent to School. When JEW. EATON arrived at FUKKINA's he found FUKKINA and the boy just leaving for Portage La Prairie. While he stayed there they left for Portage. No further information has been received from the Rev. JONES so the boy will have arrived at the School. Rev. JONES was going to call on the 6th or 7th Sept., if the boy did not arrive, this boy being being returned to the School this File will now be concluded.

Mr. Jones should, therefore, arrange to have these children returned to their parents immediately.\n\nProvided they are physically fit the Department is prepared to favourably consider the admission to the Portage la Prairie school of the 2 children at Sioux Village and Mary Soldier from Swan Lake.\n\nI have reviewed our file and find that the 3 Swain children and the 2 McKinney children were admitted to the Portage la Prairie school on the basis of the former regulation regarding the admission of halfbreeds. As they have been in the school for some time I hesitate to disrupt their class room work by insisting on their immediate discharge. You might, however, advise Mr. Jones that these children should be discharged at the end of June, 1940, and they can be replaced by others.\n\nThe Swain and McKinney children should attend the Swan Lake day school during the academic year 1940-41.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. A.

It has been suggested that I find a place for these three children in the school. I am willing to take them in after I have returned the children to Swan Lake as instructed by the Department.\n\nIn view of the Department's decision re the four children from Swan Lake, I would like some assurance that the Francis children will be admitted as grant earning pupils.\n\nI am well aware that the present authority is for 95 grant earning pupils and although I think that a request for an increase to a pupilage of 100 is quite reasonable, I am not using the admission of these three as a leverage to obtain that increase.\n\nI am merely asking that after we have cleaned them up, re-clothed them and started them out in good sound health, I shall not receive instruction to return them home without ever receiving any grant for them.\n\nI am going over the list of our pupilage with a view of asking for the discharge of those who are not capable of making further progress and thus make a place for others who ought to be in school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph Jones\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nJanuary 10, 1940.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of a letter received from the Rev.

Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nCity.\n\nDear Mr Waite,\n\nI have a report from Doctor Campbell of Dynevor Hospital stating that John Swain and Clifford Johnnie are making good progress and will probably be discharged in the course of a few months. I think it will be disastrous for John to send him home when he comes out of hospital, however it is out of my hands now that the Department have ruled that he must be discharged.\n\nIn Clifford Johnnies case may I point out that the report from the Doctor states \"The Tuberculosis in his chest is not serious and a few months stay will probably be sufficient.\" This boy's father, Ben Johnnie, is a bad tubercular case and therefore it would not be advisable to return the boy home upon discharge from hospital. If Clifford is an arrested case I do not see why he could not be returned to school.\n\nIn reference to Tony Cameron 192. If the parents will give consent and the Department will approve I would like to see Tony go on to high school, he is above the average in ability and would make good use of his advanced training.\n\nJohn Smith 193. I will ask for his discharge in the September quarter. The Senior pupils who are to be discharged should remain in school to help with the work, the farm work is just at its busiest time, row crop work, haying and harvest. I think it is only right that these pupils who have received all the benefits of school life should help the younger pupils in this way.\n\nRe-Clifford Johnnie's Case. The discharge form was filled out here to indicate what disposition had been made of this boy. This should not have been done on the discharge form but on the return sheet. It is evidently our mistake here and I am sure the Department will allow the boy to be returned to school upon the Doctor's recommendation.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It would not be advisable to make this transfer at present as we have one case of measles in the school and any day we may have others.\n\nI understand that the reason for the discharge of these four pupils (apart from providing space for the two incoming pupils) is to supplement the attendance at the Day School. I do not think it will have this effect. To support this opinion, let me give you the names and ages of pupils who were discharged from this school during 1940 to attend Swan Lake Day School; this list does not include the 16 year old graduates.\n\n| No. | Name            | Age |\n|-----|-----------------|-----|\n| 0249 | Betty McKinney  | 14   |\n| 0255 | Vina Swain      | 14   |\n| 0283 | Mabel Onesides  | 8    |\n| 0284 | Laura Onedides  | 12   |\n| 205  | George McKinney | 11   |\n| 242  | Daniel Walker   | 10   |\n| 246  | Alec Contois    | 8    |\n\nNot one of these children attended the Day School since their discharge.\n\nI am well aware of the difficulties of securing attendance at school on the Reserves.

Henzie, patrolled to the school and obtained the following description of the missing boys:\n\nWallace JOHNNIE, age 15 yrs. 5'8\" tall, well built, walks with slouch. Wearing brown windbreaker with zipper fastener, and black boots.\n\nFrank EDWARDS, age 15 yrs. 5'2\" tall, well built, erect carriage, speaks very good English and acts as spokesman for both. Wearing blue brushed wool sweater, black cap, and black boots.\n\n3. The writer interviewed several of the boys at the school in an effort to determine the intentions of the runaways or their probable whereabouts. All that could be learned was that they had intended to board a freight train and look for work in a different part of the province. They apparently had no definite plans other than running away from school.\n\n4. Further inquiries were made at the Sioux Village in this city, where it was found that one Mike PASOHI had been with JOHNNIE and EDWARDS the previous evening, and had left them after they boarded a freight train, preparing to leave for Winnipeg. Nothing further could be learned with regard to their proposed destination, and further inquiries made locally met with no result.\n\n5. Both these boys are from the Roseau Indian Reserve near Letellier, Man., and it appears likely that they will return to their homes there, especially as they were not prepared, in the way of clothing, for the present cold weather. It is therefore respectfully requested that inquiries be made by Emerson Detachment at the Roseau Reserve and this detachment advised if the boys are located.\n\n6.

The expenses of the R.C.M.P. in this connection will amount to upwards of $35.00 which amount will have to be paid by the Department.\n\nIn this connection I should appreciate your advising what action you took to have these pupils returned without cost to the Department. In this regard I would refer you to official letter of May 8, 1941, copy of which is attached. Was a determined effort made by yourself or any other Departmental official to have these children returned without consulting the police? Under present conditions the R.C.M.P. have plenty of other more important matters to look after.\n\nIt also appears from the report of the police that the fact of the pupils truancy was broadcast over Station VIGT, Winnipeg. Our residential school system has been subject to considerable criticism and it is difficult for us to convince ourselves that broadcasting truancy of Indian pupils from an Indian residential school will tend to popularize Indian residential schools either with Indians or white people.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 20th I beg to submit the following:\n\nWallace Johnnie and Frank Edwards left the school with the intention of working on some farms West of Portage. That is what they told the boys, fifteen minutes after they left I discovered their absence, I immediately phoned a description of them to the local Detachment of the R.C.M.P. before proceeding to search for them in my own car. The Police are patrolling the highways nightly and it seems to me they are the logical people to inform. I did not ask them to broadcast the truancy of the boys and I did not know they had done so until you informed me by your letter.\n\nThe boys turned up on their own Reserve at Roseau. I asked if the police could secure them and return them to the school.\n\nI have been in charge here over six years and before that at Ahousaht B.C. at both these schools truancy has been very rare, if you will look up the records you will find that in these more than twelve years this is the first item of expense for truancy you have been asked to pay, I shall be pleased to pay the account myself and thus keep the slate clean.\n\nIn reference to the popularity of the School may I point out that I do not have to ask for pupils, they are brought here by the parents and I have always had a waiting list. At present I have seven over the number of grant earning pupils, similar conditions prevailed at Ahousaht. I have no desire to have the rare cases of truancy broadcast, it was done without my knowledge or consent.\n\nThese are very restless times, the senior boys and girls sense the unrest and want to get into the centres where the soldiers are stationed, they hear stories of the \"thrilling\" times that the girls who have graduated from our schools are having at the army centres. The boys hear stories from the Indian boys who are in the army and want to have the same kind of freedom from restraint.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJoseph Jones\nWinnipeg.

Further to the above and marginally noted, I have to report that during the p.m. of the 5-12-41 one Gilbert JOHNNIE, Roseau River Indian Reserve called at this detachment on other police business, during the conversation the writer enquired as to the whereabouts of the captioned noted, it was ascertained that JOHNNIE had seen EDWARDS that morning on the reserve, and it was thought by him (JOHNNIE) that EDWARDS was again living with an Uncle (Mr. Stick St Pierre).\n\n2. Further enquiries have been withheld in this instance, as it is not known whether accused is to be apprehended, or other arrangements made for his return to the Indian School at Portage la Prairie, Manitoba. It being deemed that if such enquiries were made at this time and EDWARDS not picked up, he would leave his present abode and further expenses would have to be incurred to ascertain his whereabouts.\n\n3.

With reference to the above I have to report that in the P.M. of the above date a phone call was received from Mr. G.H. JONES, Principal of the Indian Residential School, Portage la Prairie, who stated that four boys had run away from the school during the week end. These boys were, John THOMSON, William JOHNSON, Sam MERRION, and Frank EDWARDS.\n\n2. JOHN THOMSON, JOHNSON, and MERRION, have since been returned to the school, but Frank EDWARDS remains still at large. Description of this boy is as follows:\u2014Indian, age 15 yrs., but looks younger, height 5'2\", well built, erect carriage, intelligent and speaks very good English. He is thought to be wearing a black cap, black boots, dark grey overall trousers, and blue brushed wool sweater with slipper fronts. He has probably obtained an overcoat from Indian friends.\n\n3. This boy is from the Moose Indian Reserve near Lotbiniere, Man., and was picked up at the point about a month ago, by Capt. Thorne and Cooper of Emerson Detachment. It is thought that he will again return to this Reserve or attempt to return there via his mother, who is now Mrs. George NICOLAS, and is living at Brockfield, near Lac du Bonnet, Man. The NICOLAS family deal with the Co-Operative Store at Lac du Bonnet, and EDWARDS is known to Mr. HILLS, manager of the store.\n\n4. In view of the above it is respectfully requested that further inquiries concerning EDWARDS be made by Emerson and Lac du Bonnet Detachments, and this detachment advises if the boys are located.\n\n5.

Residential School and felt he would have Department support if he insisted on keeping the children. You will realize that the situation was a difficult one and a compromise with Mr. Jones was made. He was prepared to discharge the children if I would insist on their attending the day school at the Swan Lake Reserve. I have been on this reserve on three different occasions and have not been able to locate Mrs. Martin. Yesterday, however, I arranged with the school teacher, that if the children were discharged from the Residential School he would personally see that the children attended school regularly.\n\nI have asked Mr. Jones to discharge the children under this arrangement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. A.G.

The Swain children mentioned in your letter are evidently intended to refer to the Martin children, No. 109 Clifford Martin and No. 239 Frederick Martin. I understand that some proselytizing Priest is trying to secure these two children for a Roman Catholic School. I feel sure the Department will not consider the demands of the Priest.\n\nClifford has been in attendance in this school for the past six years and Frederick for the past four years.\n\nI am quite willing to transfer these children to a Protestant Day School, the one at Swan Lake providing that some assurance is given by the Department that they will not allow these pupils to be transferred to a Roman Catholic School at any time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJOSEPH JONES,\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. J.

I understand that the policy of the Department has been not to transfer children just because their parents have changed their religious faith.\n\nI certainly object to the suggestion of the transfer of these children. The Reverend Perrault should have been informed at once that his request was entirely out of order. Our Protestant schools are constantly being pestered by such men as the Rev.

(RG 10, Volume 6275, file 583-10, part 1)\nSir,\n\nGeorge Daniels No.191 Long Plain Band, filled out an application dated March 17th 1937, making request that his daughter Lena (Fatsy) be admitted to the Portage Indian Residential School.\n\nThe child at that time was 2 years and 3 months old. Department letter 127-1-10 October 11th 1937 would not permit the admission of the child until she was of age to be placed in a residential school. The Reverend Principal took pity on the child, as her mother was dead and the father rarely at home on the reserve, and took her into school without authority. The child has been in school since that date practically one of Mr. Jones family while she was very young. The father returned to the reserve from the United States last spring and makes request that Lena be placed in a Roman Catholic school as she was baptised by a Priest during the summer recess.\n\nThe Reverend Principal feels that the Indian is being very unfair and I enclose herewith a letter received from Mr. Jones also a letter signed by George Daniels in which he makes request that the child be placed in a Catholic School. This was forwarded to me by the Reverend Father Lemire, Principal of the Sandy Bay Residential School.\n\nOffice copy of admission form is enclosed herewith, the original being forwarded to Ottawa in October 1937. I would not recommend the removal of this pupil from the Portage school and would also request that as the child is now seven years of age and old enough to be admitted as a grant earning pupil, the admission be approved by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEncs.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

These transfers not only interrupt the pupils' studies but must in the nature of things prove to be a source of confusion and perplexity to the pupils who are transferred from time to time.\n\nThe records here indicate that Lena Daniels was enrolled at the Portage la Prairie School on March 3, 1937. The application form was signed by the father, George Daniels, who described himself as a Protestant (United Church). I should like to know when George Daniels became a Roman Catholic. It would appear that this man has been remarried in recent years. Was the ceremony performed by a Catholic Priest or by a Minister of the Protestant Church? Is he a regular attendant at a Catholic church at the present time? The application form for admission to a residential school reads:\n\n\"I hereby make application for admission of the under-mentioned child into the _______ residential school; to remain there under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper.\"\n\nIndian parents should be told that it is not their privilege to transfer their children from one residential school to another simply because they have become temporarily dissatisfied with the principal of a particular school.\n\nIt is noted that the letter signed by George Daniels was sent forward to you by the Reverend Father Lemire, Principal of the Sandy Bay Residential School. I am personally of the opinion that it would be much better for all parties concerned if the enrolment and discharge of pupils at our residential schools were left to our Indian agents and the principals of the schools concerned. I am anxious that you should have a personal interview with George Daniels and secure from him, to the greatest extent possible, the information requested in this letter. The officials here find it difficult to convince themselves, in view of this\n\nMr. J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\np.t.o.\nman's attitude to this child in the past, that he has become a Catholic in anything other than a very nominal sense. When the information requested reaches the Department, the matter will be again carefully reviewed.\n\nI am returning herewith the letter received by you from the Reverend Joseph Jones, Principal of the Portage la Prairie Residential school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEncl.\n\nR.

Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Crerar:\n\nI have been requested by several good farmers of the Portage District to ask you if it would be possible to grant leave of absence from school of the older children in the Industrial (Indian) School at Portage la Prairie. I am informed that many of these children, both boys and girls, are fairly mature and able to perform heavy duty on the farm. It appears that they cannot leave school unless they obtain a Government permit. Now it may be that the permit would have to come through the United Church which institution I believe has charge of the administration of this particular Indian School. You will know the proper procedure in such cases. I think myself the move would be very popular and I think these children would be tickled to death to help the farmers produce food during these wartimes. The order would be better if it allowed these boys and girls to participate in the seeding operations but if that is impossible the move should come as soon as it can be arranged.\n\nThanking you for your consideration and anticipating an early reply, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHarry Leader, M.P.,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nIndian Industrial School -\nPortage la Prairie.\nre: Leave of absence for older children to work on farms.\n\nMr. Harry Leader, M.P., writes the Minister in support of a request of several farmers of the Portage District that the older children in the Indian Industrial School at Portage la Prairie be granted leave of absence to work on the farms.
