We notice that from replies published, the increase in Manitoba will be something over the average of last year. Farmers who have neglected, to say the least, the cultivation of their land, will find themselves in a better position than they would have been had they followed the advice of the Government. Another thing that we are pleased to note is that many of our best farmers are sowing seeds of the most promising kinds of wheat, such as Red Fife, Club, Ladoga, Kukuruz, and Saxonia wheats which are receiving a fair test in this district the present season, and will be fall\u2014oil the season is not all lost. The Red Fife is a very promising variety which is well adapted to our soil and climate. Red Fife was sown largely\u2014if not altogether\u2014last year, and although it ripened well, there was in some localities a great deal of frost,\nA Dead Drop!\n\nPRICES\n\nJ. M.
