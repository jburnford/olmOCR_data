Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Beauval Ind.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Beauval Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: F.X. Gagnon O.M.I.\n\nDated Jan. 3, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nMEADOW LAKE\n\nDated at JAN 12, 1950\n\nNOTE: Principals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 R. 3608\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|-----|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 0856            | Marg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Beaugval Ind.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Residential Ind.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Beauval Ind.

Brother Gautier, all with reference to the purchase of certain materials for Beauval Indian Boarding School.\n\nThe Rev'd. Brother Gautier called at my office in the afternoon of the 3rd instant, and he handed me the list of said materials.\n\nI immediately got busy on the lists in order to get competitive prices. I specified that these prices should be in my hands by noon of the 6th instant, and they were. I then figured them and made an abstract to find out who were the successful parties. I then got Rev'd. Brother Gautier to look over some lines in order that he would be satisfied with the quality, as soon as this was completed I placed the orders on the morning of the 8th instant for immediate shipment.\n\nI had just made inquiry this morning when the goods would be shipped and was informed that the paints were all ready, I told them to ship at once. The other materials will be ready today and will be shipped tomorrow the 12th inst.\n\nI have kept right after these orders as I was aware of the difficulties of transportation that might arise at this time of the year.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n| Item Description | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| Ft.

Paget, Accountant.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Jones & Moore Electric Co., Toronto, re a Generator bought by the Department for our School and asking me to certify the invoice \"correct\" and forward to the Department. Before doing so I want to explain the facts about that Generator.\n\nThe Generator ordered by the Dep. was a 125 volts Generator - And the invoice shows, 125 volts also. Now the Generator they sent here was marked 110 volts and the only instructions sent with same was a diagram marked also \"110 volts Generator\". Then I took advice from electricians and was told that this Generator would not do for our motor which is 125 volts as well as for our lamps which are 125 volts also. I was told too that it would be dangerous to raise the voltage of a 110 volts Generator to 125 volts by accelerating the speed as the machine would be overcharged. Consequently as it was late in the season it was the last chance I had to send the Generator back on account of bad roads I returned it to Jones & Moore Co., explaining their mistake of 110 volts.\n\nThese Gentlemen stooped the Generator in Winnipeg claiming that this Generator was specially built and could be raised to 125 volts by accelerating the speed without any danger for the Machine, and acknowledged \"that\" the Generator was marked 110 by \"Mistake\". Why did they not explain this when they sent the Generator, if they had I would not have returned it. But as I received no instructions, I could not possibly undertake to put it into use, on a 125 voltage, how these Gentlemen expect me to pay the freight occasioned by their mistake. The best I can do is to pay the freight from Big River to Beauval and back-\n\nover.\nBut I think that it would only fair to make them pay the freight on the railroad, at least, as the mistake is all at their account. Just now I cannot say if the Generator is still in Winnipeg or if it has been sent to Big River. Hoping you will use your influence to settle this case in the right way\u2014and thanking you in anticipation.\n\nI remain\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin [Last Name]\nPrincipal.\nBeauval Indian Boarding School,\nBeauval June 21st. 1924.\n\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nMr. P.H. Paget, Accountant.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYours of the 5th instant at hand.\n\nI/ Re; Messrs. Jones & Moore Electric Co. Toronto, I beg to say I think you must have received my letter of June 14th, by this time, explaining the cause of my delay. I am waiting for your answer. I am informed that the generator has been sent back to Big River, but I cannot say how Mr. Olson had to pay for the freight, as he has charge of it. I have informed him to let you know how much he paid, as I told you in my previous letter. I expect Messrs. Jones & Moor to pay the freight by their mistake. However, I will certify the invoice and inclose it to you. Very sorry to have given you so much trouble, and trust you will assist me in having them pay their expenses.\n\n2/ Re; Stephen Co.- I must tell you I have not received any invoice nor shipping bill. But I can ascertain I did receive 25 wash-bowls on which I had to pay $41.17, for freight to C.N.R.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMartin Lajeunesse, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nBig River, Saskatchewan,\n\nApril 29th, 1924.\n\nConsignee - Rev.

We cannot consent to this deduction from our account as it was caused from inexperience and incompetence entirely on the part of the Rev. M. Legouesse who shipped the generator back intending it to be returned to Toronto, when we stopped it in transit at Winnipeg and when we advised him that the 110 volt and 125 volt pressure was equivalent to the same. He instructed us to return the generator to him which we did and we presume that he is operating it successfully at this time.

(RG 10, Volume 6301, file 650-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRe Basement\n\nIt is proposed to have no basement in the building and to build at ground level. Reasons given:\n\n(a) Almost impossible to keep basement clean - the wind brings in so much dust.\n(b) Basements, in these regions, are unsanitary, being always cold and moist. The case at Sturgeon Landing.\n(c) The appearance of the house would be improved if the building were made some seven or eight feet higher.\n(d) If the recreation halls were placed on ground level, they could be made to open on spacious verandahs which would be most useful.\n(e) The cost of the building would be reduced by the suppression of the basement. The digging is very expensive, having to be done entirely by hand shovel.\n\nThe foregoing suggestions of Father Adam are approved by Mgr. Charlebois.\n\nMgr. Charlebois would like to have an early answer to the following questions:\n(a) Is it the opinion of the Department that we should build of brick? If so, of brick veneer or of solid brick?\n(b) Can we suppress the basement and build at ground level?\n\nMgr. Charlebois hopes that a bonus of $25,000 may be granted him (to be put in the fall estimates) to cover in part the expenses to be made next summer in the building of a portion of the School at Beauval.\n\n[Signature]\nRepresenting Mgr. Charlebois.\n\nUniversity of Ottawa.\nfreewill 2\" below finished grade\n4' 2\" used (1) purpose\na shown on sketch submitted\nhis booklet\nMEMO\n\nconcerning the construction of the Beauval Indian School,\n\nfrom Father Adam.\n\nRe brick-making\n\nSamples of clays from Beauval have been tested in the laboratories of the University of Saskatoon. In the report, which was sent to Rev. Father M. Lajeunesse of Le Pas, the following lines appear: \"The clays here reported are among the best that have passed through these laboratories for testing as building brick clays.\n\nThe cost of making the bricks, according to the report, would not exceed $12 per thousand, allowing $3 a day for the laborers and $5.50 for a cord of wood.\n\nThe number of bricks required would be about 400,000 for the exterior of the whole building and the baking ovens.\n\nThe total cost of making the bricks would therefore be about $2,500. This number must be multiplied by 3 if the walls are to be of solid brick, so that the cost in this case would be $8,400.\n\nThe cost of making the bricks at Beauval would be much lower than that at which they could be bought at the nearest prairie brick-yard.\n\nIn order that the new school may be as nearly fireproof as possible, it is proposed to build the walls of solid brick. The plans should be made accordingly. The air-space in the walls not to be forgotten.\n\nAccording to the report from the University of Saskatoon, the cost of the machinery for brick-making would be about $2,000. The machine which we intend to buy is of medium size, weighs 1600 lbs., can make 10,000 bricks per day, can be worked by an 8 H.P. motor, and can mould drain tiles as well as bricks.\n\nRe Reconstruction of School\n\nIt is proposed to build, for the first year, only the central portion of the school and the part behind it which contains the chapel. Reasons given for this proposal:\n\n1.- The work could then be done mostly by the lay-brothers of the school aided by laborers who could be hired at Beauval. The cost of building would thus be materially reduced.\n\n2.- If less work is undertaken at one time, more attention can be paid to the quality of the work.\n\n3.- The Department of Indian Affairs would probably be more disposed to help us by annual grants covering a number of years than by a single heavy disbursement.\n\n4.- The portion of the school which we intend to build would easily accommodate the staff of sisters and 50 Indian girls (the number which we had in the past years). For a number of years the recruiting of boys will be very hard, so many of the boys we had having died in the disastrous fire. If the whole building is put up at one time, a whole wing of it would be useless for some years.\nAugust 27, 1928.\n\nDear Bishop Charlebois:\n\nReverend Father Lajeunesse, C.M.I., has forwarded Your Lordship's request in connection with the replacement of the Beauval Indian Residential School. The question of asking Parliament for a grant next year of $25,000 for building activity will receive consideration upon Dr. Scott's return from western Canada.\n\nI am pleased to note that the University of Saskatchewan reports favourably on the brick-making possibilities of the clays from Beauval. The Department Architect advises that a solid brick construction be used in the event of re-building, provided the cost of making the bricks is no more than estimated by the Reverend Principal. Concerning the basement, Mr. Orr considers the best arrangement is to have the floor level two feet below the finished grade. In the event of construction, it should be used for the purposes shown on the sketch submitted to Your Lordship last April. This arrangement permits of good lighting on this floor.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. O.

This is much too small for their needs, and it will be especially so next summer when a large number of men will be working at the construction of the new building. Father Adam humbly asks the Department to send to him at an early date, so that it can be transported by winter roads, the range which is intended for the new school.\n\nA brick-making machine is to be bought from the United-States. Would it be possible to have it passed free of duty?\n\nJ.A. Lajeunesse, O.M.I.\nMEMO\nfrom Father L.M.

I shall be pleased if you will forward to Mr. Bunn, at the earliest possible date, as full information as possible regarding the range required, also full shipping directions for forwarding the range.\n\nRelative to bringing into the country, free of duty, a brick making machine which you are purchasing in the United States, I have to say that it will not be possible to arrange with the Department of National Revenue to admit this equipment free of duty.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Such a plant would have to be imported from the United-States at a high cost. Now, there happens to be at the Prince Albert Penitentiary a brick-making plant which is the property of the Government. It is still in good condition, but it is not used and will not be used in the future. Could the Department of Indian Affairs secure the loan of this brick-making plant for the Beauval School?\n\nJ.A. Lajeunesse, O.M.I.\nJanuary 9, 1929.\n\nDear General Hughes:\n\nI have been informed that there is a brick-making machine at the Prince Albert Penitentiary, and I am writing to enquire if it would be possible to transfer this equipment to the Department of Indian Affairs. We are about to erect a new main building for the Beauval Indian Residential School, at Lac la Plonge, in northern Saskatchewan, and it is the intention to make brick near the building site. If your Department no longer requires this machine, I should be very glad to learn if you could arrange for its transfer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nBrig. Gen. W.

In this connection I have to inform you that the Department can make no refund of sales tax, as the Government is liable for sales tax on all purchases, the same as in the case of private individuals. The Beauval School would, therefore, be required to pay any sales tax on gasoline purchased for the use of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nO. P.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n\"RE\" Letter No. 132-1-5 of last February the 23rd.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn November the 14th., 1927, \"RE\" your letter No. 132-1-5, you placed an order for one machine. At the beginning of last week, I received from the Singer Sewing Machine Company, a statement reclaiming the payment for one machine, No. 261077 shipped on November the 22nd., 1927. I received that machine at that time. Perhaps the payment would have been forgotten by the fact that they did not send me the account in triplicate and that at that time I may have thought that they sent it direct to the Department. Would you please find out if the Department has paid for it, and if not to honor it. I send you the statements signed.\n\nOn October the 2nd., 1928, \"RE\" your letter No. 132-1-5, you placed an order for two machines. I also received from the Company another statement for two machines, which have been shipped at the beginning of last November. The numbers of the machines claimed for, are: - 354321, - 356784. I received two machines, but the number of the first one, instead of being 354321 is 354326. Although I think that this is only a material error without importance.\n\nOn November the 27th., 1928, \"RE\" your letter No. 132-1-5 you placed another order for one machine. It is that machine that I did not receive, and the Company does not seem to remind that order as no account came for same. I would ask you to look at this matter and to see that this machine be sent and also the account in triplicate.\nI regret that such an error took place for the first item. It is a little easy to understand as that happened right after the fire.\n\nHoping that this matter will be made clear, and thanking you for all the attention you give to it, I am:\n\nYours truly,\n\nL. M. Adam\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa, April 23, 1929.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have to refer to order dated November 14th, 1927, to supply one sewing machine for the use of the Beauval Indian Residential School, Beauval, Sask., also to order of October 2nd, 1928, requesting you to supply two sewing machines, and to order dated November 27th, 1928, for one machine. In a communication from the Principal of the School, he states that he has received the machines covered by the orders of November 14th, 1927, and October 2nd, 1928, but that he has not received the machine covered by our order of November 27th, 1928. He has forwarded accounts covering the cost of the machines which he received, and a cheque in payment will be sent to your agency, 1015 Central Ave., Prince Albert, Sask., in due course.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will take up with this branch office the question of supplying the machine ordered in our letter dated November 27th, 1928. After you have communicated with the agent in Prince Albert, I shall be pleased to hear from you regarding the supplying of this machine and the date it has been shipped.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. H. Paget,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent.\n\nSinger Sewing Machine Co.,\nBank St.,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 23, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, enclosing accounts covering the cost of three Singer sewing machines, supplied for the use of the Beauval Indian Residential School. These accounts cover the cost of one machine ordered November 14, 1927, and two machines ordered on October 2, 1928. The Department is taking up with the Singer Sewing Machine Company the question of supplying the machine ordered on November 27, 1928, which, you state, you have not yet received. It is hoped that you will receive this machine in due course, also the account covering the cost, which you should promptly certify and forward to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzic,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. L. M. Adam, O. M. I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBeauval, Sask.\nThe Dept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 15th inst., re sales Tax on Gasoline supplied to the Indian School at Beauval.\n\nThis gasoline is used entirely for the purposes of lighting plants and sawing wood. There are no cars in that part of the country and no roads to run them on.\n\nAccording to the Act gasoline that is not used for transportation is not subject to the tax. I paid the tax and in turn charged it to the Mission but they consider that this should be refunded as the gasoline is used only for the purposes specified.\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours truly,\n\nO.P. Godin\nOttawa, May 2nd, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo with further reference to sales tax paid on gasoline supplied to the Beauval Indian Residential School. The Department is unable to understand from your letter whether the sales tax referred to is a tax levied by the Province of Saskatchewan or the Dominion Government sales tax. If the former, application should be made to the provincial authorities for a refund. If, however, you refer to the Dominion sales tax collected by the Department of National Revenue, this Department could make no refund as the Government is liable to the payment of sales tax on all purchases, as stated in our letter of the 15th ultimo, the same as in the case of private individuals.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nO. P. Godin, Esq.,\nBig River,\nSask.\nBishop's House, Le Pas, Man., April 13th., 1929.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAttention of Mr. Ferrier.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a letter of recent date, I have been told by His Lordship Bishop Charlebois to forward to you duplicated receipts of Accounts paid in connection with the new School at Beauval.\n\nPlease find herewith enclosed all the accounts I have paid up to date. They include the price of the goods and the freight up to Big-River. As for the freight from Big-River to Beauval, it will take a few weeks before all the accounts be sent.\n\nI may add that all good have been carefully selected and bought at the lowest price after tendres had been given to differents firms. Payments have also been made on time to take advantage of discount when same was given.\n\nWith my best personal regards and wishes,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMartin Lajeunesse\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department is making the necessary arrangements for adequate authority with reference to this activity and I am hopeful that a cheque can be directed to His Lordship Bishop Charlebois in a short time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

MacINNES.\n\nThe main building at the Beauval Indian Residential School, near Lac la Plonge in Saskatchewan, was destroyed by fire in September, 1927. The Oblate Order, under whose auspices this school is being conducted, has offered to erect a new building, provided the Department will give a grant of $50,000 towards the cost. In view of the location of the school, it is considered that the new building should be erected on a day labour basis, under the supervision of church officers. $25,000 is provided in the Main Estimates for Indian Education for the Department's share of this year's building costs, and it is proposed to vote a similar amount for the next fiscal year.\n\nDr. Scott is desirous of securing an Order in Council, authorizing this activity.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6301, file 650-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAttention of Mr. Orr.\n\nThe Principal of the Beauval Indian School intends to buy a dynamo to replace the one which was ruined at a recent fire at the School. This dynamo should be of sufficient power to supply the lighting for the whole school and for the outbuildings. Father Adam would like to have the specifications for this dynamo.\n\nAs Father Martin Lajeunesse of Le Pas will do the buying and the shipping of this dynamo, the said specifications might conveniently be addressed to him.\n\nJ.A. Lajeunesse, O.M.I.\n\nMartin\nLe Pas\nMay 6, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nYour brother, Reverend Father Lajeunesse of the University of Ottawa, called here and asked me to write you with reference to the new generator required for the Beauval School. In this connection I might say that a 110 volt, 10 K. W. generator will be ample size to supply all lights required for the school building and outbuildings. It might be well, however, before purchasing the generator to make sure that you have sufficient water power at Beauval to operate the generator. The firm from whom you intend to purchase generator can give you full particulars if you apply to them and supply them with details as to the power available.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. Gurney O.M.R.,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nRev. Martin Lajeunesse, O.M.I.,\nThe Bas, Man.\nMay 15, 1929.\n\nMemorandum: Dr. Scott.\n\nPlans and specifications have been prepared for the proposed new Indian Residential School at Beauval. The plans provide accommodation for 75 pupils. The building will be constructed of brick manufactured on the premises and heated with a low pressure steam heating system. A complete sewerage system will be installed and all modern plumbing fixtures throughout the building. An electric lighting plant will be provided to furnish the necessary power to light the building. The cost of the building will be approximately $100,000 if erected at a reasonable distance from railway transportation.\n\nIn view of the fact that a large quantity of the materials required will have to be transported from Big River, it is difficult to state definitely what the cost of the building will be erected at Beauval. Part of the cost of transportation will be offset as the Church authorities are manufacturing their own brick at Beauval and also can supply all of the rough lumber required from their own saw mills at this point.\n\nThe most economical way of having the building constructed is by day labour under the supervision of the Church authorities, more especially as they are in a position to supply a large quantity of the materials directly on the site. They will also be able to arrange more economical transportation for supplies brought in from Big River.\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, May 21, 1939.\n\nHis Excellency\n\nThe Governor General in Council,\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report that the main building at the Beauval Indian Residential School, near Lac la Plonge, in the Province of Saskatchewan, was destroyed by fire in September, 1937. The Oblate Order, under whose auspices this school is being conducted, has offered to erect a new building, provided the department will give a grant of $80,000.00 towards the cost.\n\nAn amount of $25,000.00 has been included in the Main Estimates for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, 1939/30, and it is proposed to include a similar amount in the Estimates for 1939/30, for this purpose.\n\nPlans and specifications for the proposed building have been prepared by the department. Accommodation for seventy-five pupils is provided.\n\nThe building is to be constructed of brick manufactured on the premises and heated with a low pressure steam heating system. A complete sewerage system is to be installed and all modern plumbing fixtures throughout the building. An electric lighting plant is to be provided to furnish the necessary power to light the premises.\n\nIn the opinion of the Architect of the department the cost of the building would be approximately $100,000.00 if erected at a reasonable distance from railway transportation.\n\nIn view of the fact that a large quantity of the materials required would have to be transported from the railway line at Big River, a distance of 113 miles, it is difficult to state definitely what the cost of the building will be erected at Beauval. Part of the cost of transportation would be offset by the Church authorities manufacturing their own brick at Beauval and also can supply all the rough lumber required from their own saw mills at this point. It follows, however, that the proposed expenditure by the department represents not more than one moiety of the total cost.\nIn view of the remoteness of the locality it appears inexpedient to call for tenders. It is considered that the most economical way of having the building constructed is by day labour under the supervision of the Church authorities, more especially as they are in a position to supply a large quantity of the materials directly on the site. They will also be able to arrange more economical transportation for supplies bought in from Big River.\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to recommend that the proposed grant to be expended in the manner aforesaid be approved.\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nTo approve a grant of $50,000.00 towards the cost of the erection of a new building at the Beauval Indian Residential School, near Lac la Plonge, Sask., to replace the main wing which was destroyed by fire in September, 1927. An amount of $25,000.00 has been included in the Main Estimates for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, 1929/30, and it is proposed to include a similar amount in the Estimates for 1930/31.\n\nPlans and specifications have been prepared by the department. It is recommended that the work be constructed by day labour under the supervision of the Church authorities as in view of the remote locality it is inexpedient to call for tenders. It is considered that the amount to be provided by the department represents not more than one moiety of the total cost.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 30th May 1929.\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 21st May, 1929, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, stating that the main building at the Beauval Indian Residential School, near Lac la Plonge, in the Province of Saskatchewan, was destroyed by fire in September, 1927. The Oblate Order, under whose auspices this school is being conducted, has offered to erect a new building, provided the department will give a grant of $50,000 towards the cost.\n\nAn amount of $25,000 has been included in the Main Estimates for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, 1929/30, and it is proposed to include a similar amount in the Estimates for 1930/31, for this purpose.\n\nPlans and specifications for the proposed building have been prepared by the department.

Part of the cost of transportation would be offset as the Church authorities are manufacturing their own brick at Beauval and also can supply all the rough lumber required from their own saw mills at this point. It follows, however, that the proposed expenditure by the department represents not more than one moiety of the total cost.\n\nOwing to the remoteness of the locality it appears inexpedient to call for tenders.

MacKenzie, Esq.\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find duplicate receipts covering further expenditure in connection with the replacement of Beauval Indian Residential School. As you will notice, most of these expenditures are for transportation from Big River to Beauval.\n\nFreight.\n\nI may say that this freighting was done at a very fair price. For the 128 miles which separate Big River from Beauval we paid $1.20 and $1.35 per cwt., while here we pay $1.75 per cwt. for freighting to Sturgeon Landing, a distance of not quite fifty miles.\n\nBonus.\n\nIn connection with the freighting, you will notice that a bonus of $63.65 has been given to Mr Fortin. This was occasioned by the fact that the heating plant and plumbing supplies did not arrive until February so that the greater portion of it could not be freighted during the fishing season. The fishing season being over, the teams were freighting only one way, so that no one would undertake to carry freight to Beauval for the $1.35 paid by the Big River Consolidated Fisheries. This is why we had to give a bonus to Mr A. Fortin on the goods conveyed to Beauval after the fishing season. Our bonus was very conservative and we are confident that Mr Fortin made no money on that freight.\nWages Paid.\n\nI beg to give a few explanations in regard to statement of wages paid: Wages shown on Sheets 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are for work done last Fall for digging the foundations. Wages shown on sheets 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16 and part of 17, and for work done in loading and hauling gravel and sand from Lac la Plonge. As there is no sand or gravel available around the Mission, it was easier and more economical to haul it on the Winter Roads than to wait for the opening of navigation.\n\nThe last three items on Sheet 17 refer to the erection of a temporary building required for the construction.\n\nBrick Plant.\n\nYou will be glad to hear that our brick plant is in operation and gives hope of full success. We learn from the last letter received, that they were making an average of ten thousand bricks a day. No bricks have been burned yet, but Mr Phillips, who is in charge of the brick plant, and who has been in that line for years, has no doubt as to the result of the burning. He claims that the clay is of the best quality.\n\nOther work done.\n\nThe sewers are now completed and water pipes to the new building laid in the ground. They are commencing the cement work on the part to be erected this year.\n\nOur good Mr Waddy will be at Beauval in a few days and we have no doubt he will be satisfied with the work being done there.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMartin Lajeunesse\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6301, file 650-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIsle a la Crosse, June 17th, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to report as follows on my visit to the Beauval Indian Residential School on the 14th and 15th inst.\n\nYou probably are familiar with the arrangements regarding building the new school here. I understand it is being built by the church authorities under arrangement with the Department. The rear wing of the new school is to be built this year; all material for the heating, electric fixtures, water system is on hand, also the sand, gravel, cement, lime, lumber etc. The basement is excavated, footings of brick laid, floors up for the basement walls. The whole school is to have solid brick walls, all the brick being made within a hundred yards of the school site. Last winter a brick making machine was brought in from Prince Albert with a steam engine to supply the power. The staff used over 40,000 f.b.m. of lumber to construct the drying racks for the bricks, making sheds etc., and they have the plant in running order now. In the few days it has been operating they have made 75,000 bricks and they were turning out thirty bricks a minute when I was there; on Friday they made over 13,000. After the brick dries for a week a kiln is made and the brick burnt for three days. It is expected that 800,000 will be required. A first class bookkeeper is on the job and he keeps track of every item entering into the construction of the school, keeps a time of the men etc. He was watching the cost of the brick making very closely, and including overhead, cost of machines, transport of same, etc time of expert brick maker, steam engineer and all labor he was down to $20.00 per thousand and is trying to cut this down.\n\nJ. W. Waddy,\nPaying Agent.\nSir:\n\nThere is a set of batteries at the Indian Residential school at Lebret which I thought would be of service at the Indian School at Beauval, Sask. As you are aware the former institution is supplied with light and power by the Montreal Engineering Company, and the Department has gone to some considerable expenditure in providing new equipment to meet the changed conditions.\n\nWhen suggesting the transfer of these batteries to Beauval, the Reverend Father Leonard demurred and appears desirous of retaining them, notwithstanding that I have pointed out that they would only be required in case of a break-down, and, while lying idle for such an emergency, would deteriorate rapidly and become useless. They would be of greater service at Beauval, and I would ask the Department's authority to have them transferred to that point immediately.\n\nI have just received a telegram from the Reverend Principal at Beauval asking me to have them re-charged and over-hauled, and have them sent to Beauval by the first proximo. It would be appreciated if you would telegraph your authority.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 30th, 1929.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nYou may transfer Qu'Appelle School electric battery\nto Beauval\n\nD. C. Scott\n\nIndian Affairs.

We are now burning another kiln of the capacity of the second burning referred to above, and will burn another kiln this Fall. We shall then have three-fourth of the number of brick required for the whole building. The cost of making the brick will be a little higher than we anticipated, as it required 30000 feet of lumber for the sheds, and on account of heavy rains during June a quantity of brick was spoiled and the work delayed. In spite of this, however, the cost of the brick will be no more than the price at the lumber yards. We expect to be able to tell you by the end of the Summer what has been the cost per thousand of these bricks.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott, Deputy Minister,\nDepartement of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI was somewhat surprised to hear, through Fr M.\nLajeunesse, who has lately interviewed you, that the Depart-\nment of Indian Affairs was under the impression that I\nhave undertaken to rebuild the Beauval Indian School provided\na grant of $50,000 would be given, and that an Order in\nCouncil had been passed to this effect.\n\nWhen the question of rebuilding the Beauval School\nwas first discussed with the Department, and when the useful-\nness of that School was doubted, I may have hinted that a\ngrant of $50,000 would probably be sufficient to enable us\nto rebuild the school, having in mind at that time that a\nframe building, and one of small dimensions, was to be erected.\nI am pretty sure that, as far as I am concerned, there are no\nofficial documents showing that there was a definite agree-\nment in the matter. My personal impression, after my interview\nwith you, was that the Department did not deem it wise to call\npublicly for tenders. I understood also that, in order to elude\nthe attention of profiteers, the Department would grant only\na part of the money for the first and the second year, but\nwould eventually refund all the money expended in the construc-\ntion of the School. It was in this sense that I understood\nthe letter in which you advised me that an initial grant of\n$25,000 had been voted for this year, and that a similar grant would be given next year. It never occurred to me that no further grants would be given by the Department for this enterprise.\n\nI was further confirmed in my opinion by the fact that we were advised to follow, in the construction of the School, the plans which would be prepared for us by your Department. This appeared to me as an evident proof that your Department was to take full possession of the Beauval School and to pay all the expenses of construction.\n\nI understand quite well that religious denominations must take a share in the education of the Indians, and I would like to remark that our share in the education of the Indians of the \u00cele-\u00e0-la-Crosse region has been very generous indeed. For nearly half a century the Grey Nuns have kept an Indian School there without any substantial remuneration. It was only when the school was transferred from \u00cele-\u00e0-la-Crosse to Beauval that the grant per capita was given. The first school at Beauval was built without any assistance from the Department, and for over twenty years it has carried on the same work as the schools of the Department. The chief help which the old Beauval School obtained from the Department was the grant per capita, but it should not be forgotten that, according to experts in that field of education, this grant covers only about 70% of the expenses of a residential school.\n\nAs for the construction of the new School, we are ready to help as far as our means will permit. Is it not a great advantage for the Department to be assured that, through our\nco-operation, all monies granted will be spent with the greatest economy, and that every cent of them will enter into the very structure of the building? No charge is made for travelling expenses and for the work incurred in the buying of the materials, for telegrams, for bookkeeping charges, and for the supervision of the work and of the transportation.\n\nIn the interview which you granted Fathers A. and M. La-jeunesse, my representatives, you stated that a further grant for the reconstruction of the Beauval School could not be voted before the acquisition by the Department of the land on which the School is being erected. This is a very reasonable objection, but I think that the matter can be very easily settled. As the land concerned is not yet surveyed, it is impossible to give titles for it, but I am willing to transfer to the Dept. our rights to:\n\n1.- All the land on the north side of the Laplonge river up to the reserve, of which about twenty acres are under cultivation.\n\n2.- The following buildings now standing on that land: one large house for the male staff, a cow-stable, a horse-stable, a pig-house, a poultry-house, a root-house, three small houses for labourers, a grainary, and sheds.\n\n3.- All the agricultural implements: plows, harrows, binder, thresher, tractor, potato-planter, potato-digger, manure-spreader, wagons, &c.\n\nLet me now state frankly what I expect from the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nMr. Orr estimates that the construction of the Beauval School according to the plans furnished by him will cost all\nof $100,000, supposing that the school is not very far from a railway line. Now, Beauval is at a distance of 120 miles from Big River, the nearest station, and it is known that the transportation of certain necessary material, cement for instance, costs more than the material itself.\n\nWe have also made a detailed estimate of the total cost, taking as a basis of our calculation the cost of the part of the building which was put up last summer. As the sum of $29,000 which we have received from the Department this year has covered only a part of the expenses made, we also come to the conclusion that $100,000 more would be needed to cover the total cost of the construction. I would therefore ask the Department:\n\n1.- To bear all the expenses in the reconstruction of the Beauval School;\n\n2.- To give for next year a grant of not less than $75,000 to allow us to continue the construction of the School next summer.\n\nI regret to say that if the Department does not see its way to grant my request, the construction work will have to be interrupted and postponed for an indefinite period. This, I think, would be a misfortune for this part of the country, for the Beauval School has done good work in the past and it gives great hopes for the future.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent-General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr Scott,\n\nPursuant to your communication of November 22nd, 1929 (File 132-1-5), I am glad to hear that $25,000.00 has been placed in the Main Estimates towards the reconstruction of the Beauval Indian Residential School. But as I have already informed you in my letter of October 28th., this amount is not enough to allow us to continue the construction.\n\nWe have already advanced the money to cut and manufacture the lumber for the whole building as well as to install the brick plant and manufacture the brick which has been used in the part already erected. None of this money (which amounts to a large sum) has been refunded. Moreover, wages for the part erected last Summer have been refunded only up to August 3rd, 1929, leaving a large balance which we had to cover. Besides this, the inside of this part is not finished, the plaster has yet to be purchased, freighted and put on, etc. This means that the $25,000.00 will be exhausted when all this will be finished.\n\nIn these circumstances we are obliged to stop the work until further assistance can be obtained. We have tried to raise the money necessary at least to buy and freight...\nthe balance of the material during the freighting season,\nbut this is beyond our means, and with great regret we shall\nbe obliged to let things lie until we can obtain further\nassistance.\n\nNo need to tell you that the fact of not being able\nto buy and freight the balance of the material this winter\nwill have serious consequences, because transportation by\nboat is very expensive and sometimes is not possible when the\nwater is too low.\n\nMay I also mention that if the work is not resumed\nnext Summer the school will not be open before 1932, leaving\nthe children of all the Ile-a-la-Crosse District without\neducation as there is no day-school in that part of the\ncountry. We shall also be obliged, for the same reason,\nto dismiss a crew of good bricklayers and carpenters who\nare ready to keep on working for very low wages.\n\nI understand that it is not in your power to do\nmore at the present time, but as I can rely on your sympathy,\nI feel it advisable to tell you about our difficulties in\nregard to this construction.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n+ O.

The amount over-paid was $25.00, and the Department desires that you will obtain refund to that amount and send the money here.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.A. Paget,\nChief Accountant.\n\nRevd Father Adam,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBeauval, Sask.\nOttawa, January 24th, 1930.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to enquiries in your letter of the 17th instant, regarding a payment made by cheque No 1740 to the Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Keewatin of an account for the Beauval Residential School, and more particularly to a sub-voucher for J.A. Fortin, I beg to say that a letter of today's date is being sent to the Principal of the School requesting him to obtain refund of the over-payment in the case.\n\nI may say further that the service covered was described by the Revd Martin Lajeunesse as follows:\n\n\"In connection with the freighting, you will notice that a bonus of $583.85 has been given to Mr Fortin. This was occasioned by the fact that the heating plant and plumbing supplies did not arrive until February so that the greater portion of it could not be freighted during the fishing season. The fishing season being over, the teams were freighting only one way, so that no one would undertake to carry freight to Beauval for the $1.35 paid by the Big River Consolidated Fisheries. This is why we had to give a bonus to Mr A. Fortin on the goods conveyed to Beauval after the fishing season. Our bonus was very conservative and we are confident that Mr Fortin made no money on that freight.\"\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H. Paget,\nChief Accountant.\n\nChas.

Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nRev. L.M. Adam, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBeauval Indian Residential School,\nBig River, Sask.\nMay 5, 1930\n\nMr. Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe were much pleased to hear, in the course of the interview which we had with you on May the 3rd, that you were in favor of raising from its ashes the Indian Residential School of Cross-Lake and of going on with the construction of the Beauval School. Your kind words have relieved us from many of the sorrows and cares which have assailed us since the sad fires which have destroyed so many lives and so much valuable property.\n\nYour decision of constructing no other but fireproof buildings for Indian Residential Schools is highly commendable for its wisdom and prudence. The recurrence of such calamities as have taken place in the past is to be prevented by all means possible.\n\nWe understand that, for this year, no substantial funds for building purposes can be relied upon. However, we should like to have your directions concerning the work which we might do this summer as a preparation for the building operations of next year.\n\nWe would suggest that an expert be sent to examine the walls of the burned school at Cross-Lake in order to determine whether they can be used in a new building. As far as I could judge, these walls are still in a fairly good condition, and, as the stress in a fireproof building is not so much on the walls as on the inside pillars, I am inclined to think that they might be used to advantage. This of course would save much time and much expense.\n\nActing in accordance with verbal instructions received from your Department, we have made preparations, in the course of winter, for continuing the construction of the Beauval School during this summer. Four car-loads of cement and all the steel necessary for the reinforced concrete have been bought and carted from Big River to Beauval. We find now that, on account of the lack of funds, we will be unable to go on with the construction of the whole school. But, considering that cement deteriorates rapidly in the moist atmosphere of this region, we would suggest that the plans for the new fireproof building to be erected at Beauval be draughted by the architect of your Department as soon as possible, and that a sufficient appropriation be granted us to allow us to build\nthese foundations in the course of the present summer, using for that purpose the cement and the steel we have now on hand.\n\nMay we also suggest that, as the new building at Beauval is to be fireproof, its ground dimensions might be made smaller, and a third story added to it. This would lessen the cost of the foundations and of the roof; while, in a fireproof building, there would be no objection in having the dormitories on the third floor.\n\nHoping that the above suggestions will be found acceptable,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n+ O. Charlebois, O.S.B.\nBishop of Keewatin\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nHe would doubtless like to know what added (footings foundation) materials should be taken into account, in view of fireproof construction.\n| DATE | PARTICULARS          | Folio | CREDIT | DEBIT | BALANCE |\n|------|----------------------|-------|--------|-------|---------|\n|      | 1 only Ramsay Hd.

School.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find an account amounting to $21,854.50, in connection with the construction of Seauval Indian Res. School.\n\nA Summary, in duplicate, of the several sheets will give you an accurate account of the expenses.\n\nAs we are in urgent need of money we would appreciate very much if you could arrange to let us have refund of above amount as soon as possible.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Keewatin,\nPer: [Signature]\nSecretary.\nP. C. 932, dated May 30, 1929, authorizes the Department to give a total grant of $50,000 towards the reconstruction of the Beauval Indian Residential School. Payments of $14,717.22, $9,654.97, less a refund of $80.20, or $9,574.77, $4,661.27 and $12,204.05, or a total of $41,212.49, have been made. This leaves a balance of only $8,787.51, which can be paid on the authority quoted. There is now to hand an account amounting to $21,854.50, only a little more than one-third of which can be satisfied.\n\nFurther, His Lordship's letter of the 5th ultimo, while admitting that the church authorities will be unable to go on with the construction this year, on account of lack of funds, suggests that sufficient be granted this year to allow them to prepare the foundation. His lordship also suggests that the plans be altered to make the building fireproof and plans and specifications in connection with the foundation be sent as soon as possible.\n\nThe Supplementary Estimates for the current year provide no further funds for this school and, unless you instruct otherwise, the only answer to His Lordship is that nothing further can be done until funds are available. In addition to an appropriation, a new order in council will be necessary. Further, approximately $13,000 of the account which is now to hand under cover of his Lordship's letter of the 23rd ultimo will have to remain unpaid for the time being.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nJune 5, 1930.\n\nDear Bishop Charlebois:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 5th ultimo, with reference to the reconstruction of the Beausval Indian Residential School. I regret that it has not been possible to provide any additional funds and no expenditure can be authorized this year. In fact, only $6,787.51 of the account forwarded under cover of Your Lordship's letter of the 23rd ultimo can be paid. Payment of the balance will have to be postponed until funds can be provided by Parliament and until additional authority from His Excellency in Council is secured. A cheque for the amount available is going forward, under separate cover.\n\nI have asked Mr. Orr to change the plans and specifications to fireproof construction. I hope that the work may be proceeded with next year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRt. Rev. O. Charlebois, O.M.I., D.D.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, June 6th, 1930.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nThe Department has received the enclosed account covering the cost of a Singer sewing machine supplied to the Beauval Indian Residential School, Big River, Sask.

I explained that there were no funds to proceed with the work this year, and if the Church authorities went ahead with the scheme they would have to finance it themselves for the time being.\n\nYou will note in Bishop Charlebois' letter of May 5th that it is proposed to add a story to the original plan now that fireproof construction is to be used.\n\nIt may be that there is no urgency in this matter as the Church authorities may not be able to finance the foundation work this year.

This account is dated the 4th of April, last. The number of the machine is 361057. We were unable to find any record of the order placed for this machine, and, on taking the matter up with the Company, we are informed that the manager in charge of the Prince Albert branch states the order was received from you and that you advised him the necessary authority would be received from this Department. After considerable correspondence with the above Company, the Department has paid the account covering the cost of this machine.\n\nI would point out, however, that in future we will be unable to consider payment of accounts of this nature when authority has not first been granted for the purchase and the order for same placed by the Department. I may say, according to our records a total of 6 sewing machines have been supplied your school since the first of January, 1927.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Charlebois sent me a letter that he received from Mr. Scott, in which it was said that he gave you the instructions to change the plans and specifications of the school to a fireproof building.\n\nWould you please let me know what is the intention of the Department concerning the plans. Is it to build it with the same dimensions as it was first decided or to reduce its proportions on the length and the width and to add another story?\n\nIn the first case, if you do agree I would have a few changes to suggest. In the last case I would be very pleased if you could let me have the plans before they go under the last impression, or on the other hand, ourselves we could send a rough sketch to the Department.\n\nI would ask you if possible to send us the specifications for the foundations the soonest you can this summer.

In this connection he forwards a copy of his letter to you dated the 21st ultimo, and states that he sent you his cheque for $42.50 in payment for the machine.\n\nThe Department also forwarded you a cheque, No. 2534, on July 16th, last, for $42.50, which was a duplicate payment for the machine. I have, therefore, to request that you will make a refund of this amount to the Department at the earliest possible date. As the order for the machine was placed by the Principal without reference to the Department, it is considered that he is responsible for payment.

I may say that the Department also forwarded a cheque in payment to the same amount. We are now writing the Agent in Prince Albert and requesting him, as the order was not placed by this Department, to make a refund of the amount paid by the Department.

The work is progressing very rapidly and the making of brick for the new School, although it had not been started when I was there.\n\nThey have this year 125 acres in crop, having broke 25 acres last year. There will be at least seven acres broke this year, possibly more.\n\nThey were unfortunate in having 11 head of cattle go through the ice on the river last winter, leaving now only 70 head. There is 18 head of horses, two being lost through the ice on the river last winter. They also have 24 pigs and 125 chickens; all stock doing very nicely. The saw mill was being prepared for the sawing of lumber for the new school, which will, no doubt, have started before this.\n\nRev. Father Adam would like to have a reserve established along the River, south of La Plonge, so that the people would not have so far to take their children to school.

(2)\nNovember 6, 1930.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSHNELL,\n\nWith reference to the subject matter of Mr. Olsen's letter, which is enclosed, I may say that the main building of the Beauval Indian Residential School, near Lac la Plonge, Saskatchewan, was destroyed by fire in September, 1927. Bishop Charlebois, of the Pas, representing the Oblate Order, offered to rebuild, if the Department would give a grant of $50,000 towards the cost. The Department accepted this proposal, which was approved by P.C. 932, of May 30th, 1929 - the new building to be erected by the Order on a day labour basis. During the past year and a half, this grant of $50,000 has been paid.\n\nA year ago, His Lordship intimated that there was a misunderstanding regarding the financing and, in June, last, he stated that the Oblate Order could not complete the programme without more assistance. I may say that the Department Architect estimated the cost of the building at over $100,000. Bishop Charlebois stated that the building could not be completed unless the Department assumed the entire cost, involving an additional $75,000. In June, he was informed that no further funds were available this year and that, before anything could be done in 1931 or later, the money would have to be voted by Parliament and additional authority from His Excellency in Council secured.\n\nOwing to the present condition of the Appropriation for Indian Education and the desirability of giving the Minister an opportunity to review the whole situation before deciding the future programme or allowing any extensions, it is not yet timely to make any promise in connection with the future building programme.\n\nI know it is desirable to have freighting to Lac la Plonge done during the winter time, but I have to recommend to the Minister that his correspondent be informed that, as yet, there has been no decision concerning the completion of the Beauval School.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nBeauval Indian Residential School, January the 19th., 1931\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLast summer, we had a little trouble by the fact that the time sheets \"RETURN OF LABOUR\" Form No 18 did not give us satisfaction for the secrecy of wages from one employee to another. As we can not have always all the employees of the country to sign those sheets in the order as their names appear; it is really impossible to keep the wages confidential; thus sometimes jealousy arise and makes trouble for us. Of course one man is sometimes worth more than another one, but people from this country do not always understand it.\n\nI thought to ask you if you would accept a monthly time sheet; one time sheet for each employee. This is the only way I think to give entire satisfaction on the secrecy of wages. Would you accept any form of time sheet as long as they will all be the same and bearing the signature of the employee acknowledging that he received payment for his work and also the signature of a Witness as it appears on Form No 68.\n\nI would be pleased to hear from you on that subject by the returning mail. If you accept we could make our own forms which I hope will give you satisfaction and also to us. If you maintain to keep the Forms No 68 \"RETURN OF LABOUR\"; if you please to send us about 500 of them as we are running short.\n\nThanking you for the attention that you will give to this matter, I am:\n\nYours truly:\n\nF.K.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, regarding the preparation of time sheets for the labour employed on the work of erecting the new building at the Beauval Indian Residential School.\n\nIt will be quite satisfactory for you to use the monthly time sheet - one form for each employee - as per the sample which you forwarded. It is noted you will make out these forms. They should be forwarded to the Department in duplicate, a separate form being used for each labourer employed. The total hours employed each day during the month should be shown, also the price paid per hour and the total wages paid during the month. These forms should be receipted by the individual labourer to whom payment was made, acknowledging that he received payment for his work; and also signed by a witness.

MURPHY,\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Charlebois, of The Pas, Man., has been in Ottawa and, among other matters, has discussed the completion of the Beauval Indian Residential School, concerning which I gave Mr. Buskard a memorandum on November 6th, last. I am enclosing a copy of this memorandum and a copy of the Order in Council. His Lordship understands that we cannot authorize any expenditure this early in the year, but he is desirous of learning if the Department will re-affirm its decision to have the work done on a day labour basis, under the supervision of the church authorities. The Beauval School is two hundred miles north of Prince Albert, and it is in the interests of economy that the church authorities be allowed to purchase the materials and to complete the building, themselves. They have a competent foreman and staff for the purpose and are following plans and suggestions of our Mr. Orr. The rear of the building, which is already erected, is a credit to all concerned, as the attached picture will show. May I inform His Lordship that the scheme may be continued when funds are available?\n\nEnc.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 30th MAY 1929.\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 21st May, 1929, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, stating that the main building at the Beauval Indian Residential School, near Lac la Plonge, in the Province of Saskatchewan, was destroyed by fire in September, 1927. The Oblate Order, under whose auspices this school is being conducted, has offered to erect a new building, provided the department will give a grant of $50,000 towards the cost.\n\nAn amount of $25,000 has been included in the Main Estimates for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, 1929/30, and it is proposed to include a similar amount in the Estimates for 1930/31, for this purpose.\n\nPlans and specifications for the proposed building have been prepared by the department. Accommodation for seventy-five pupils is provided.\n\nThe building is to be constructed of brick manufactured on the premises and heated with a low pressure steam heating system. A complete sewerage system is to be installed and all modern plumbing fixtures throughout the building. An electric lighting plant is to be provided to furnish the necessary power to light the premises.\n\nThe Honourable\n\nIn\n\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nIn the opinion of the Architect of the department the cost of the building would be approximately $100,000 if erected at a reasonable distance from railway transportation.\n\nIn view of the fact that a large quantity of the materials required would have to be transported from the railway line at Big River, a distance of 112 miles, it is difficult to state definitely what the cost of the building will be erected at Beauval. Part of the cost of transportation would be offset as the Church authorities are manufacturing their own brick at Beauval and also can supply all the rough lumber required from their own saw mills at this point. It follows, however, that the proposed expenditure by the department represents not more than one moiety of the total cost.\n\nOwing to the remoteness of the locality it appears inexpedient to call for tenders. It is considered that the most economical way of having the building constructed is by day labour under the supervision of the Church authorities, more especially as they are in a position to supply a large quantity of the materials directly on the site. They will also be able to arrange a more economical transportation for supplies brought in from Big River.\n\nThe Minister recommends that the proposed grant be expended in the manner aforesaid.\n\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing recommendation and submit the same for approval.\n\n(Sgd.)

(RG 10, Volume 6301, file 650-5, part 3)\nInspector Murison's Report on the Schools in the Ile a la Crosse Agency:\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the schools in the Ile a la Crosse Agency, which I inspected during my visit to that Agency when making the annuity payments this year.\n\nBEAUVAL SCHOOL:\n\nI visited this school on June the 15th last, and made a general inspection of the buildings, and visited the class-rooms.\n\nSince this school was burned down a few years ago, they have had very little accommodation for pupils, and only 18 girls are kept in residence.\n\nThe staff includes Rev. F. X. Gagnon, as Principal, Brother Beaudion, Carpenter and Engineer, Brother August Duclos as Farmer, and Brother Coulais as general helper. He also has as assistants six sisters of Charity. They include a Superior, Teacher, Nurse, Cook, Girls' Matron and Seamstress.\n\nI visited the class-rooms, and made a general examination. The pupils are divided into three grades, with four in Grade II, Five in Grade III, and nine in Grade IV. They speak up well, understand their work,\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nand appear to be\nand appear to be well up in their grades. The teacher is properly qualified, and has a Second Class Certificate for Saskatchewan. The pupils presented a healthy appearance. A room in the completed part of the new school is being temporarily used as a class-room.\n\nBuildings:\n\nA portion of the new school was completed last year, and the work impressed me as being very well done. The completed wing is 35 feet X 70 feet, and provides in the basement a kitchen, laundry, engine-room, boiler-room, bakery, dairy, machine-room, drier, men's dining room, store-room, fuel-room, bathroom and engineer's room. The upstairs provides a chapel which has been completed.\n\nDuring the past winter, cement and lime were hauled in, but as no money was provided this year, and as the cement and lime would have deteriorated and many hundreds of dollars wasted, the church authorities, in order to safeguard the work already done, and to save this material, engaged a foreman and the necessary workmen, and the work of building the main building was well under way at the time of my visit. I understand that, at the present time, the building is all ready for the roof and I expect that the roof will be completed shortly. I understood from the Principal that it was not the intention to finish the building this year, but simply to close it in, so that the work already done may be protected.\n\nThe walls are of\nThe walls are of brick, which was made on the ground. Brick-making machinery was provided for this purpose. The brick appears to be of very good quality.\n\nThe work is being performed by day labour. The foreman is a lay-brother, and there are five lay-brothers who are brought in from outside, working on the building. They include two carpenters, who receive $5.00 per day, and three brick-layers who receive $5.00 per day, $4.00 per day, and $3.50 per day respectively. Their transportation and expenses in are paid, and they get their board as well. Indians and Halfbreeds are engaged to perform the rough labour. Plumbing and Electrical work in the main building will be done by a lay-brother.\n\nI was informed by the Reverend Principal, that at the time of my visit, they had expended $45,000.00 in excess of the amount advanced by the Department, and it was estimated that approximately $100,000.00 will be required to complete the building. In the meantime the Church is advancing the money to pay for material and labour to complete the walls and put the roof on, and they are naturally becoming very anxious to know when they may expect a refund from the Government of the amount expended. Of course they have done this on their own authority, but it appears to me to be good business, and their action will eventually affect a considerable saving in the ultimate cost of the building, as there would have been a considerable loss had they not used up\n\nthe cement and lime.\nthe cement and lime. I found this school a very interesting one to visit.\n\nAs you already know, some years ago they harnessed the La Plonge River, and all the power required for operating their sawmill, brick-making machinery and electrical lighting plant, is generated by a water turbine. The water supply is also obtained from the La Plonge River, and is pumped to the buildings with a hydraulic ram.\n\nTheir out-buildings include a cow barn, 32 feet X 100 feet, with a loft. This barn is equipped with Beatty Brothers iron fixtures, and there is running water accessible to each stall. They have a horse stable with accommodation for 17 horses, a root cellar, hen-house, pig-pen, warehouse and large cattle pasture.\n\nTheir livestock includes 65 cattle. Fifteen cows are milked regularly. The boys, when at school do the milking, under the supervision of the Brother. They informed me that they would commence teaching the girls to do this. Two brood sows are regularly kept, from which they obtain two litters per year, and they keep about 150 poultry.\n\nFarm:\n\nTwelve sections of land have been reserved for the use of a school, but has not been surveyed. The land comprises a large hay meadow which would provide sufficient hay for their requirements, as well as some farm land, most of which would have to be cleared. The soil is a light sandy loam. Ninety five acres are under cultivation, 65 acres of which\n\nis in grain\nis in grain crop this year.\n\nThey have a large and well-kept garden. Their farm last year produced 225 bushels of wheat, 1200 bushels of oats and 450 bushels of barley. The garden produced 2240 bushels of potatoes and other roots, and vegetables sufficient for their requirements.\n\nThe present principal, Father Gagnon, has only been recently appointed, but he impressed me as being a capable business man, active, energetic and interested in the welfare of his school.\n\nThe pupilage is obtained from Canoe Lake, English River, Clear Lake, Buffalo River and La Loche Lake. It is quite easy to get to English River, Clear Lake, and Buffalo River, as there are no portages, and plenty of water. These are the largest bands from which pupilage is obtained, and as they are from 50 to 100 miles from the school, the Principal has expressed the wish to have a large motor-boat to enable them to visit these points in any weather. Canoe Lake can be reached over land, and is about 30 miles distant.\n\u00c9v\u00each\u00e9, Le Pas, Man., le 7 novembre, 1931.\n\nR\u00e9verend P\u00e8re F.X. Marcotte, o.m.i.,\nUniversit\u00e9 d'Ottawa,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n\u00c9tat de la construction de l'\u00e9cole de Beauval.\n\nMon R\u00e9verend P\u00e8re,\n\nVoici dans quel \u00e9tat se trouve l'\u00e9cole de Beauval vers le 15 d\u00e9cembre prochain:\n\nL'ext\u00e9rieur sera compl\u00e8tement fini.\n\n\u00c0 l'int\u00e9rieur, tous les murs du dehors seront bien pl\u00e2tr\u00e9s et il en sera ainsi des murs de s\u00e9paration des dortoirs, des classes et des parloirs. Quant aux autres murs de s\u00e9paration, faute de ciment, ils ne seront que blanchis avec une composition qui ne s'efface pas.\n\nLe plancher du sous-sol est en bois de bouleau sec (birch) et repose sur une couche de pierres bris\u00e9es d'un pied et demi. Le plancher du dortoir est aussi en bois qui recouvre la dalle de ciment. Les deux autres planchers sont simplement en ciment qu'on a poli le mieux possible.\n\nLe syst\u00e8me de chauffage est d\u00e9j\u00e0 fini.\n\nLe syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9clairage est \u00e9galement fini.\n\nJ'ai oubli\u00e9 de dire que les murs de s\u00e9paration sont en briques.\n\nLe r\u00e9servoir pour l'eau est construit.\n\nLe syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9gout est install\u00e9 et le syst\u00e8me d'eau sera compl\u00e8te, dans toute la b\u00e2tisse, pour le quinze d\u00e9cembre.\n\nLe lavoir est pourvu de machines, m\u00eame d'un sechoir \"home made\".\n\nNous n'avons pas achet\u00e9 de portes pour les s\u00e9parations int\u00e9rieures, nous en fabriquerons en planches l\u00e0 o\u00f9 elles sont absolument n\u00e9cessaires et nous attendrons l'aide du D\u00e9p. pour nous en procurer.\n\nIl y a vingt lits tout mont\u00e9s. Si le D\u00e9partement ne peut pas nous fournir d'autres couchettes, nous en ferons en planches et les matelas...\nseront remplac\u00e9s par des paillasses de paille, \u00e7a suffira durant la crise. Il faudrait des couvertes, des draps et des oreillers pour cinquante lits au moins.\n\nPour la vaisselle, nous pourrons en acheter et d\u00e9biter le D\u00e9p. comme pour tout le reste.\n\nPour les livres de classe, les pupitres et les tableaux, une liste sera envoy\u00e9e plus tard, si on nous permet d'ouvrir. Cependant, pour les pupitres, nous pourrions faire des tables provisoires, si on le juge \u00e0 propos. Nous ne voulons r\u00e9clamer que le strict n\u00e9cessaire.\n\nVoici maintenant quelques explications au sujet de nos activit\u00e9s. Notre premier plan \u00e9tait de construire seulement la charpente de l'\u00e9cole et cela afin d'utiliser le ciment qui \u00e9tait achet\u00e9 et rendu sur place. Apr\u00e8s avoir fait la structure, nous avons pens\u00e9 qu'il ne serait pas sage de laisser cette b\u00e2tisse ouverte \u00e0 tous les vents. De plus on nous a dit que ce serait imprudent de laisser ainsi les dalles de ciments sans \u00eatre appuy\u00e9es par les murs de s\u00e9paration. Or nous nous sommes dit: tant qu'\u00e0 poser les ch\u00e2ssis, tant qu'\u00e0 faire les s\u00e9parations int\u00e9rieures, tant qu'\u00e0 poser le syst\u00e8me de chauffage, il vaut bien mieux finir le strict n\u00e9cessaire afin de pouvoir nous servir de la b\u00e2tisse. Nous avons donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de faire de nouveaux emprunts et de finir.\n\nC'est ce qui explique pourquoi nous avons d\u00e9pens\u00e9 ce qui \u00e9tait mentionn\u00e9 dans le rapport d'octobre. Je crois que le D\u00e9partement ne nous bl\u00e2mera pas, j'esp\u00e8re m\u00eame qu'il trouvera que nous avons \u00e9t\u00e9 bien sages. Le co\u00fbt de la b\u00e2tisse ne sera certainement pas excessif. Nous avons fait tout notre possible pour \u00e9pargner tout en faisant du bon travail. Je d\u00e9sire m\u00eame que le D\u00e9partement envoie un inspecteur pour examiner les travaux, vers le quinze d\u00e9cembre. Cet ins-\npecteur pourra faire un rapport plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9 et d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9.\n\nLe pr\u00e9sent rapport est bas\u00e9 seulement sur les lettres que nous avons re\u00e7u derni\u00e8rement de Beauval. Je suis persuad\u00e9 cependant qu'un inspecteur sera satisfait du travail.\n\nMaintenant, nous pensons qu'il n'y aura pas de danger pour l'humidit\u00e9, au mois de janvier prochain, au point de pouvoir nuire \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 des enfants. Voici pourquoi : Les murs ext\u00e9rieurs et les \u00e9pais planchers sont finis depuis la mi-septembre. Ils ont eu le temps de s\u00e9cher, vu que les portes et les fen\u00eatres \u00e9taient ouvertes. Les murs des s\u00e9parations int\u00e9rieures ne sont pas \u00e9pais et sont finis depuis trois semaines. Ils ont d\u00fb s\u00e9cher passablement. Au sous-sol, il ne peut y avoir d'humidit\u00e9 vu que le plancher est en bois. Il reste encore plus de deux mois avant que les enfants soient pr\u00eats \u00e0 venir. Le tout aura le temps de s\u00e9cher tr\u00e8s bien dans une maison bien chauff\u00e9e. Cependant, si la prudence l'exige, nous retarderons l'entr\u00e9e des enfants.\n\nJe suis tr\u00e8s content de voir par votre lettre que le D\u00e9p. se propose, \u00e0 la prochaine session, de pr\u00e9senter des estim\u00e9es dans le but de nous rembourser. Cela me donne un peu de courage, car r\u00e9ellement, si on nous laissait sans remboursement, nous nous trouverions dans une position tr\u00e8s critique. Nous esp\u00e9rons qu'il n'en sera pas ainsi. Nous comptons sur le \"fair play\" de M. Scott et de M. Ferrier.\n\nVotre tout d\u00e9vou\u00e9,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6301, file 650-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a long and interesting report in connection with the schools in the Ile a la Crosse Agency.\n\nYou are probably quite familiar as to what is going on with regard to the building of the new school at Beauval. I would judge from the remarks of the Inspector that it is the intention of the Church authorities to have the Department take over this building after it is completed, and it seems to me that, if this is done, a very careful account should be kept of the material used and labour supplied in connection with this work, which is, I would judge, going to run into a very considerable amount. I merely suggest this, as I realize that the Department may already have made arrangements with the Church authorities in this regard.\n\nI would say that, from the photograph supplied, the workmanship would appear to be all that could be desired. It is noted that they have a large number of live stock, and that fifteen cows are milked regularly. The quantity of milk supplied must be of great benefit to the health of the children.\n\nThis school seems to be carried on in a very satisfactory manner, and from the little that I know of Father Gagnon, the Principal, I would judge him to be a first class man for that position.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nWith regard to the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6301, file 650-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWith regard to the Lac la Ronge School, it will be noted that the situation of this school is not by any means as favourable as that at Beauval, there being very little land under cultivation, or fit for that purpose. The Inspector points out that some might be obtained if the Department could arrange for the purchasing of same, or for having it set aside. I do not know how this affects the arrangements made with the Provincial Government re setting land aside for the Indians, but would suggest that it be set aside as an Indian Reserve, and the school then allowed to use it. I would be glad to be advised in this connection, and I will then take the matter up with the proper authorities here. We should certainly provide for the growing of hay for feed for the cattle, so that the children could obtain milk as part of their diet.\n\nThe Inspector gives a description of the building in his report. The furnaces that are out of order should be repaired with the least possible delay, and either the Department should provide for this work, or they should see that the school authorities have it done, as a fire at this point would be a very serious matter. The chimney should also be repaired.\n\nI will take the matter of reducing the size of the mesh of nets from 5 to 4\u00bd inches up with the Fisheries Branch, as, in any event, it will have to be dealt with here in Regina.\n\nWith regard to the suggestion that the balcony be floored and ceiled with the material on hand, and with the help of the school staff, I would be glad to have your instructions in this matter. I would say that I think we should act on the suggestions of the Principal, in this connection.\n\nThere has been some difficulty in keeping the children in school at the Day School of the Amos Charles Reserve at Stanley, as the children have to accompany their parents on the hunt, which is their only means of making a livelihood. With regard to the Indian boys and girls being left in charge of an Indian\n\nwoman or man\nwoman or man, I doubt very much whether this would be a satisfactory arrangement. I might, however, suggest that, if there were a large number of children, it would be wise to employ a white man and his wife to supervise these boys and girls. It is so late in the season that it would be practically impossible to complete arrangements for this plan, but I would ask that this matter be given consideration by the Department, so that it might be carried out in the manner which I suggested, probably next summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOctober 28, 1931.\n\nDear Father Marcotte:\n\nPursuant to our conversation this morning, I write to inform you that the Department would like to have a report concerning the progress at the Beauval Indian Residential School. Your intimation, that His Lordship Bishop Charlebois was hoping to admit pupils in January, comes as a surprise. The last information on our files suggests that the building was ready for the roof in October and that it was not the intention to do the interior finishing this year.\n\nTo plaster and finish the building and to have it ready for pupils should not be hurried, as it would be unsafe to have children sleeping in dormitories unless everything had been thoroughly dried out. Further, there is the matter of proper furnishing. As His Lordship understands, the Department has no funds to assist this year, and, before we can consider per capita grant, it will be necessary to have a full report concerning the preparations that are being made.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. F. X. Marcotte, O.M.I.,\nOttawa University,\nOttawa, Ont.\nTranslation\n\nBishop's Palace, Le Pas, May 1st, 1931\n\nRev. Father F.J. Marcotte, O.M.I.\n\nOttawa University\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: State of construction of Beausoleil school\n\nRespected Father,\n\nThe following is a description of the state in which the Beausoleil School will be by the 15th of December next.\n\nThe exterior will be completely finished.\nAt the interior all the outside walls will be well plastered and it will be the same with the separation walls of the dormitory, of the classrooms and the parlors. As to the other walls of separation, on account of lack of cement, they will only be whitewashed with a composition which does not come off.\n\nThe floor of the basement is of dry brick and is laid on a layer of broken stones one foot and a half thick. The floor of the dormitory is also of wood over the cement, while the other two floors are simply of cement which has been polished as well as possible.\n\nThe heating system is already completed.\nThe lighting system is also finished.\nI forget to say that the partition walls are of bricks.\n\nThe water reservoir is built.\nThe sewer system is installed and the water system will be completed through the whole building for the 15th of December.\nThe laundry is provided with machinery, even a homemade dryer.\nWe did not purchase any doors for the inside.\npartitions, we shall make some with lumber where they will be absolutely necessary and we will wait for the Department's help to get proper ones. There are twenty beds completely fitted. If the Department cannot supply us with more beds we will make some with boards and the mattresses will be replaced by straw mattresses which will have to do during the crisis. We will need blankets, sheets and pillows for fifty beds at least.\n\nFor the crockery we could purchase some and debit the Department the same as for everything else.\n\nFor the school books, desks and blackboards a list will be forwarded later on if we are permitted to open. However, for the desks, we could build temporary tables if it is judged proper. We only want to ask for what is strictly necessary.\n\nIt follows now some explanation concerning our activities. Our first plan was to construct only the frame of the school and that so as to utilize the cement which was bought and delivered on the premises. After the structure was up, we thought it would not be wise to leave the building open to all wind. Furthermore we were informed that it would be unwise to leave the cement floors without being sustained by partition walls. We consequently thought that if we had to put in the windows and make the repairs to the interior walls, and also fix the heating system, we were as well to complete what was strictly necessary so as to make use of the building. We therefore decide...\nTo borrow money and complete the work.\n\nThis is what explains the reason why we went over what was mentioned in the October report. I believe the Department will not blame us. We hope that they will find that we have acted wisely. The cost of the building will certainly not be excessive. We have done our very best to economize while we did good work. I wish the Department would send an inspector to examine the work about the 15th of December. That inspector could make a more detailed and disinterested report. The present report is solely based on letters we have received lately from Recruits. I am however convinced that an inspector will be satisfied of the work.\n\nNow we think there will be no danger from dampness during January next, in a way to inconvenience the health of the children. This is why: The exterior walls and the brick floor were finished since the middle of September. They had the time to dry up as the doors and windows were kept open. The interior walls are not thick and were completed 2 weeks ago. They must be fairly dry. In the basement there can't be any dampness as the floor is of wood. There is still two months ahead before the children are ready to come. Everything will have time to dry well in a well heated house. However if it is safer, we will keep the entrance of the children.\n\nI am very glad to see by your letter that the Dept. intends at the next session to present estimates to recoup us. This gives me much courage, because really if\nif we were left without any refund, we would be in a very critical position. We hope it will not be so. We rely on the fair play of Mr. Scott and of Mr. Lefebvre.\n\nYours devotedly,\n\n(Signed) +P. Charlebois, O.M.I.\nApostolic of Steeles\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6301, file 650-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nNovember 16, 1931.\n\nDear Bishop Charlebois:\n\nReverend Father Marcotte, O.M.I., has handed to me Your Lordship's letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the situation at the Beauval Indian Residential School. I believe you have done wisely to complete the building while you had a staff of workers and some of the materials on the site. On the other hand, I feel that, from even the Church standpoint, Your Lordship would be making a mistake if you hurried the opening of the school. Do you not think it advisable to have the building properly finished and equipped and then offer it for inspection in July or August, when you could have the Indians you are serving come for a gala opening.\n\nWe are now considering the Estimates for the coming fiscal year, and I will present your claims in connection with Beauval to the Honourable the Superintendent General. There is, first, the question of reimbursement for this year's expenditure, and, further, provision for next year and the future. I will ask for per capita grant and for sufficient funds to finish the building and to furnish it. I should be pleased if Your Lordship would inform the Department immediately concerning the total expenditure you have incurred this year and indicate what should be done next spring to finish the building. You should also prepare a list of the furnishings that are required. This information is required in connection with the preparation of our Estimates.\n\nI do not consider that to delay the opening for a few months is at all serious, when one remembers that the Indians the school serves earn their livelihood largely by hunting. The extra 6 months' education that the present generation of children would receive by hurrying the opening would be of little consequence. Far better to have everything properly prepared and to commence the second phase of this school's activity with the type of opening which proved so successful and popular in the case of the Guy Indian Residential School at Sturgeon Landing.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nNovember 19, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHONOURABLE THOMAS G. MURPHY,\n\nIn connection with the preparation of Estimates and in order to reply to a recent letter from His Lordship Bishop Charlebois, of The Pas, Man., it is now necessary to decide what further help will be given for the new building at the Residential School, in northern Saskatchewan. In September, 1927, the old building was destroyed by fire, and Bishop Charlebois, representing the Oblate Order offered to rebuild if the Department would give a grant of $50,000. The Department accepted this proposal, which was approved by P.C. 932, of May 30, 1929 - a copy of which is attached. The new building was to be erected by the Order, on a day labour basis. During the year commencing June, 1929, this grant of $50,000 was paid.\n\nIn October, 1929, His Lordship intimated that there was a misunderstanding regarding financing and that the Oblate Order would require considerably more than the $50,000 if the building programme was to be completed. It appeared thought our assistance with plans and specifications announced that the Department was prepared to finance the entire undertaking. I wrote His Lordship that I was unable to state whether or not extra help could be given. Approximately $63,000 was expended by the Church authorities during 1929. Early in 1930, His Lordship, hoping that the Department would be able to make an additional grant, arranged for the freighting of materials for the foundation of the second unit of the building. In June, he was informed that no further funds were available for that year and that, before anything\ncould be done in 1931 or later, additional authority from His Excellency in Council and a Vote by Parliament would have to be secured. At His Lordship's suggestion, I had our Architect change the plans and specifications of the administration, dormitory and classroom part of the building to fireproof construction, and I told His Lordship that I hoped the work might be proceeded with in 1931.\n\nDuring 1930, the Church authorities went ahead with the making of brick, and, in February of this year, His Lordship came to Ottawa to plead for further help. In the first draft of our Main Estimates for 1931-32, I had included an item of $75,000. This had been struck out and His Lordship so informed. He, however, pressed for consideration when the supplementaries were being prepared. He was informed that no expenditure could be authorized at that time, but, as the freighting had to be done before the spring breakup, he asked the Department to reaffirm its decision to have the work done on a day labour basis, under the supervision of the Church authorities. On March 6th, I wrote to him, stating that no expenditure could be authorized this year.\n\nHis Lordship, trusting that the Department would reimburse him sooner or later, went ahead with the main part of the building this year. He is hoping to admit pupils during January, next, but I believe he should postpone the reopening of the school until the summer. At the present time, the interior is not quite finished and it is not completely furnished. I am satisfied the building is a credit to all concerned. It is fireproof and modern in all respects. Further, the cost has been much less than if a contract had been awarded.\n\nBishop Charlebois hopes that the Department will include an item in the Estimates for the coming fiscal year to reimburse the Church for most, if not all, of the expense. From the information on file,\n$75,000 is the figure we should consider. In addition, $5,000 is required in the spring to finish and furnish the building. Further, a per-capita grant for current expenses should be provided. If you decide in favour of a second grant towards the cost of the building, another Order in Council will be necessary.\nThe Catholic Missions Episcopal Committee\nFor the North West and Hudson's Bay\n\nRight Rev.

MURPHY.\n\nIn connection with the preparation of Estimates and in order to reply to a recent letter from His Lordship Bishop Charlebois, of The Pas, Man., it is now necessary to decide what further help will be given for the new building at the Besuval Indian Residential School, in northern Saskatchewan. In September, 1927, the old building was destroyed by fire, and Bishop Charlebois, representing the Oblate Order, offered to rebuild if the Department would give a grant of $50,000.

On March 6th, I wrote to him, stating that no expenditure could be authorized this year.\n\nHis Lordship, on his own responsibility, began construction of the main part of the building this year. He reports that it is nearly finished and urges the Department to allow him to open the school during the coming January. I am attaching hereto some recent photographs of the building, which reached me a day or two ago.\n\nBishop Charlebois hopes that the Department will include an item in the Estimates for the coming fiscal year, to reimburse the Church for most, if not all, of the expense and to provide for furnishing. From the information on file, $85,000 will be required and also $18,000 to provide for 100 pupils at $180. - in all $103,000. If this amount is to be provided, it must be shown as an added increase in our Vote for Indian Education. Our ordinary obligations, with one or two very urgent major improvements, will amount to approximately $130,000 more than the appropriation for\n\n- the current\nthe current year.\n\nI have outlined this matter with some distinctness, in order that you may have the facts before you. As my memory serves me, the Minister and the Department were quite clear regarding the understanding which resulted in the Order in Council of the 30th of May, 1929. Bishop Charlebois gave us nothing in writing, but he held interviews at that time with both myself and the Minister.\n\nWhile in one sense the Department is not responsible for the present situation, it should be remembered that the Beauval School, in the past, was considered a useful institution and that it constitutes, at present, a valuable adjunct to our educational system. I therefore support the provision of funds to reimburse His Lordship and suggest that, if a grant for the whole amount is not possible, three or four annual payments be made.\nDecember 15, 1931.\n\nDear Bishop Charlebois:\n\nReverend Father Marcotte, O.M.I., has handed to me Your Lordship's letter of the 7th ultimo, with reference to the situation at the Beauval Indian Residential School. I have postponed replying until such time as I had an opportunity of discussing with the Honourable Mr. Murphy the Main Estimates for the coming fiscal year. I now write to inform you it is unlikely that there will be any provision in the Main Estimates for Indian Education for new main buildings. As it will not be possible to pay per capita grant from the current appropriation, I think Your Lordship should not hurry the opening of the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRight Rev. O. Charlebois, O.M.I., D.D.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nThe Pas, Man.\nBeauval Indian Residential School.\n\nBeauval, Sask. Dec. (9) 1931.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nDescription of work done on Beauval Indian School.\n\nThe footing began May the 15th and the plan supplied by Cowin, Co., Ltd., Structural engineers, were followed closely for the footings and reinforced concrete. A copy of the plans will also follow to the department to illustrate more closely all the details.\n\nThe four center columns were enlarged from footings to roof to support two horizontal cylindrical tanks 10'x5'. Also for the same purpose, the walls between the four center columns, are made of double bricks laid flat; that is from one foot below the basement floor to roof.\n\nThe bricks walls are 17\" in thickness for basement, ground and first floor, that is three layers of bricks and air space and one brick laid on the side. The walls of the second floor have only 14\" but provided also with an air space. The roof is supported by reinforced concrete columns, girders and beams, but slabs are made of 2x6\" spaced between 20 to 24\" resting on concrete beams. Two layers of Sylotex were laid on the 2x6\" on a shiplaps and one below forming a good air space. Strips 1x2\" laid on the sylotex with a shiplaps and 2\" of dry sand forms the second air space.\n\nThe flat roof, groove and tongue lumber, is supported by 2x6\" resting on posts, thus forming thick air space. A layer of white paper and four layers of tar paper and gravel forms the roof. The roof is provided with two four inches house drain which discharge into 3\" house sewer. The drainage system consists of three main soil stocks, with all vent stocks, cleanout and traps required in modern construction. A sub soil drain is also provided all around the foundation wall.\n\nCool and warm water.\n\nCold water will be supplied by a ram forcing the water into the two\n2.\n\nCylindrical tanks and the house supplied by gravity for cool and warm water.\n\nElectricity:\n\nAll wires are passing through galvanized electrical pipes and the system is all fireproof.\n\nHeating system:\n\nThe heating system amounts about 4200' of radiation. The two boilers supplied by the Vulcan Iron Winnipeg have a capacity of 3000\" of radiation each. It is a two pipe system; the returns from the radiators are returned to boilers by gravity. Steam and return mains are divided respectively in four branches fitted with four valves. This system has already proved very satisfactorily.\n\nPartitions:\n\nAll partitions are made of one layer of bricks laid flat.\n\nFloors:\n\nBasement floor (being short of cement) is made of one shiplap laid diagonally and birch for the finishing. Ground and first floor are rough concrete finishing. Second floor is rough concrete with strips laid on and finished as basement.\n\nPlayrooms:\n\nPlayrooms for boys and girls are well ventilated and lighted. Each room 43x34' has 6 windows. Classrooms are also provided with four windows and will be of the finest appearance when finished. Sewing room the finest for size and light is 43x34 with 11 windows. Boys and girls dormitories are of good size and well ventilated and provided with shower baths, closets and sinks and cloth stores.\n\nAll stairs are reinforced concrete.\n\nExterior walls were plastered with lime and whitewash. All partitions and ceilings are also whitewashed on the bricks only. Half the plumbing only could be made just now, fixtures not on hand but will be finished for January.\n\nSweating:\n\nThere was no sweating on exterior walls in basement and ground floors, very little in a couple rooms of first floor and on both side only. Owing to heating system working...\nonly on south side first. All those rooms are completely dry now.\n\nIt is very regrettable that the school could not be entirely finished at once on account of being short of different materials, although not nicely finished, the school would be ready any time to take up a certain number of children. The building is very healthful, well heated and ventilated and also finished with all the conveniences required for such a building.\n\nAt the present time, as it was hard for the Indians to strive for their life, they are sending petitions or petitions to put their children to the school, but are refused. So I hope that the Department of Indian Affairs will take up the matter into consideration and will accept those children who are well disposed to go to school.\n\nI am:\n\nYours very truly:\n\nF.X.

There is another point that worries His Lordship: will the opening of the school be authorized at least for next August? It is rather urgent to know this as transportation must be done in winter.\n\nI understand that a definite answer on this point is perhaps somewhat difficult, but it would indeed be a relief to His Lordship.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

He has met with a serious financial set back in the rebuilding of the Beauval Indian School in Northern Sask. I am sure you will have on file in the Interior Dept full particulars on the subject.\n\nThe building is about completed, and owing to no provision being made to cope with payments thereon, or to facilitate occupation of the building, His Lordship is greatly embarrassed, and most anxious to obtain government assistance, even to the amount of one third of the cost of the school, and provision for opening of same.\n\nHe has begged me to call the matter to your personal attention, having failed so far in his negotiations with the department.\n\nPersonally I would be glad if you could assist in relieving the situation, although I understand in some measure what great demands and financial difficulties are besetting you at this time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) E.

On the 2nd ultimo, I gave Mr. Murphy a complete memorandum concerning the situation at this school. We decided that I should inform His Lordship Bishop Charlebois that there would be no provision in the Main Estimates for Indian Education for new main buildings. We have not authorized the opening of the school next summer, but I have asked, in our Main Estimates, for per capita grant for the institution. If any reimbursement is to be made to His Lordship during the coming fiscal year on account of the capital expenditure, provision will have to be made in a supplementary estimate.\n\nDuncan C.

This will take a couple weeks with two scrapers. It will cost from $40 to $60.00.\n\nI believe the Department would have no objection for me to keep a man to get the school ready for the opening as we have no benches nor tables; and also as all the other furnitures, such as doors windows have to be fixed.\n\nI do not find any means of getting the school ready without the help of a man besides the brother.\n\nYou would obliged me very much in telling me when to send the invoices to the department. Some of the supply will be here this week; as soon as I will have the invoice, I will O.K. them and send them to the Department.\n\nThank you very much for what you are doing for this school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSigned: [Signature]\n\nMr. A.F.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th ultimo, requesting that you be allowed to incur an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $60 in scraping and levelling off the earth around the new building at the Beauval Indian Residential School. It is noted that you estimate this work will take about two weeks to complete.\n\nThe Department will provide an amount not exceeding $60 in carrying out this work. Please forward an account, in triplicate, in favour of the man who does the work, giving full details as to the number of days or hours employed and the rate paid per day or hour, as the case may be. This you should certify in the following manner: \"Work performed. Charges paid fair and just\", and forward to the Department for payment.\n\nYou should certify and forward all invoices which you have received covering the cost of furnishings supplied for this school. It is hoped that all the furnishings have reached the school before this date.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, the Department is unable to provide the cost of the services of a man in getting the school ready for opening.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

D'apr\u00e8s vos dossiers, vous verrez que ces frais s'\u00e9l\u00e8vent dans les environs de $140,000.00. Un remboursement de $50,000.00 a \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9 par le D\u00e9partement Indiens le 5 juin 1930. Un autre remboursement de $10,000.00 a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait le 28 juin 1932. Le tout forme un montant de $60,000.00 Nous subissons encore les obligations de la somme qui reste due. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats sont tr\u00e8s on\u00e9reux pour nous. De plus nous sommes dans un grand besoin d'argent. Le d\u00e9veloppement de nos missions indiennes en souffrent beaucoup. Nous sollicitons donc avec vives instances qu'un autre remboursement substantiel, sinon complet, nous soit vot\u00e9 \u00e0 la prochaine session.\n\nAinsi, je vous prie d'inscrire dans vos prochaines estimations une somme d'au moins 25 \u00e0 30 mille piastres. Sans cela nous ne pourrons pas faire face aux besoins de nos missions.\n\nJ'esp\u00e8re donc que vous aurez \u00e9gard \u00e0 notre situation et que vous vous rendrez \u00e0 nos d\u00e9sirs.\n\nJe vous prie d'agr\u00e9er l'hommage de mon respect et de mon d\u00e9vouement.\n\n+O. Charlebois, O.M.I.\n\nVic. Apost. du Keewatin.\nTranslation\n\nBishop's Palace, St. Pas, May, Sept. 16, 1932\n\nTo the Acting Deputy\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYou evidently know that the cost of the new construction at the Beauval Boarding School was paid here. On your file you will see that the expenditure reaches nearly $140,000. A refund of $50,000 was completed by the Indian Department on June the 5th, 1932. Another payment of $10,000 was made on the 28th of June, 1932. Making an aggregate sum of $60,000. We are still bearing the obligations of the sum remaining due. The interests are burdensome factors. Furthermore, we are in great need of money. The development of our Indian missions suffer thereby considerably. We consequently solicit earnestly that another substantial refund be made, if not complete, by a vote at the next session.\n\nConsequently, I beg you to include in your next estimates a sum of at least 25 to 30 thousands dollars. Without that we will be unable to meet the needs of our missions. I therefore hope that you will take our situation into consideration and will accede to our wishes.\n\nI beg you to accept the homage of my respect and of my devotion.\n\n(Signed) + P.

Rev. O. Charlebois, C.M.I.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOTTAWA, Ont., September 20th 1932\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI received recently a letter from Rev. Father Gagnon, O.M.I., Principal of the Beauval Residential School, in which he asks if the Department would consider the suggestion of providing the school with a motor boat for the transportation of the Indian children from their distant homes. The Rev. Father shows the advisability of the suggestion in the following lines:\n\n\"Avec l'ouverture de l'\u00e9cole se pose un s\u00e9rieux probl\u00e8me pour nous; celui des d\u00e9penses de voyage pour amener les enfants \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole, et pour les reconduire dans leurs familles pour le temps des vacances.\n\n\"Nos sauvages \u00e9tant tous tr\u00e8s pauvres, ne peuvent entreprendre le voyage n\u00e9cessaire pour venir mener eux-m\u00eames leurs enfants; ils manqueraient de vivres en route, et de plus, pour la plupart, n'ayant que de mis\u00e9rables canots d'\u00e9corce, ou pas de canot du tout, ils n'oseraient pas s'aventurer \u00e0 faire pareil voyage m\u00eame s'ils avaient des vivres en abondance. C'est parce que ces voyages sont tr\u00e8s longs et doivent se faire en majeure partie sur des lacs qui sont de v\u00e9ritables mers int\u00e9rieures; par exemple, le Buffalo Lake et le Clear Lake.\n\n\"C'est donc \u00e0 ceux qui ont la direction de l'\u00e9cole que revient la t\u00e2che d'aller chercher ces enfants et \u00e0 la fin de l'ann\u00e9e de les reconduire.\n\n\"Pour vous faire une id\u00e9e de la longueur de ces voyages et des d\u00e9penses qu'ils occasionnent, allons quelques chiffres: la r\u00e9serve la plus rapproch\u00e9e est celle du Canoe Lake, qui se trouve \u00e0 35 milles d'ici par le chemin d'hiver, mais \u00e0 l'\u00e9t\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire au temps o\u00f9 il faut aller prendre ou reconduire les enfants, il n'y a pas d'autre chemin praticable que celui des rivi\u00e8res en passant par le lac de l'Ile-a-la-Crosse, soit une distance de 70 milles pour s'y rendre. Pour les autres r\u00e9serves, c'est encore plus loin. Il y a 90 milles pour se rendre \u00e0...\nla r\u00e9serve \"English River\", 110 milles pour celle du \"Clear Lake\", 120 milles pour Buffalo River, 200 pour le Portage-la-Loche, et 115 milles pour Water-Men River.\n\n\"Dans un m\u00eame voyage on peut \u00e0 la rigueur prendre les enfants de Clear Lake, Buffalo River et du Portage, mais ce seul voyage donne un parcours de 300 milles environ aller et retour. Quant aux autres r\u00e9serves, pour s'y rendre il faut faire un voyage sp\u00e9cial pour chacune. Et puis, comme je le disais tout \u00e0 l'heure, \u00e0 cause des grands lacs \u00e0 traverser, il n'y a presque pas moyen de s'arr\u00eater \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e de faire ces voyages avec les canots dont nous nous servons pour les besoins ordinaires. Je tremble \u00e0 la seule pens\u00e9e de me faire prendre par un gros temps sur un lac avec une charge d'enfants dans une embarcation quelconque. S'il fallait qu'il arriv\u00e2t quelque malheur dans le transport, quelle responsabilit\u00e9 pour moi! Et pour ce qui est de l'\u00e9cole, il va sans dire qu'il serait inutile ensuite d'essayer d'avoir des enfants.\n\n\"De ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je crois pouvoir conclure que le transport des enfants aux frais de l'\u00e9cole s'impose, et que pour cela il faudrait avoir un petit bateau qui assurerait une certaine s\u00e9curit\u00e9 en cas de mauvais temps pendant les voyages.\n\n\"Assur\u00e9ment cela repr\u00e9sente encore un joli d\u00e9bours\u00e9 pour le D\u00e9partement, mais je suppose que ceux qui s'occupent des affaires indiennes voudront bien admettre qu'il y a l\u00e0 un \u00e9tat de choses auquel nous ne pouvons rien changer........\n\n\"Pour toutes ces raisons, j'ose esp\u00e9rer que le D\u00e9partement nous accordera, pour la prochaine ann\u00e9e scolaire, un petit bateau pour transporter les \u00e9l\u00e8ves, et en plus, un octroi suffisant pour couvrir les d\u00e9penses de voyage.\".....\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. X. Maricotte, D.M.I.\nOttawa, Ont., September 20, 1932.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI received recently a letter from Rev. Father Gagnon, O.M.I., Principal of the Beauval Residential School, in which he asks if the Department would consider the suggestion of providing the school with a motor boat for the transportation of the Indian children from their distant homes. The Rev. Father shows the advisability of the suggestion in the following lines:\n\n\"After the opening of the school a serious problem arises for us, that of the travelling expenses to bring the children to school and to take them back to their families for the time of their holidays.\n\n\"Our Indians being very poor, cannot undertake the necessary voyage to bring their children themselves; the lack of food to undertake that trip and furthermore most of them having only poor bark canoes or none at all, they would not dare to venture on a trip of that kind even if they had abundant food supply. It is because these trips are very long and are done mostly over lakes which are real interior seas; such as, for example, Buffalo Lake and Clear Lake.\n\n\"It is consequently, to those who have the direction of the school that the task of fetching these children, falls on, and also that of returning them home at the end of the year.\n\n\"To give you an idea of the length of these trips and the expense incurred, we will show some figures: The nearest reserve is that of Canoe Lake which is at 35 miles from here in Winter, but in summer, that is to say, at the time when we have to bring and return the children, there is no other practical way than that of the rivers by passing through Lake Ile a la Crosse, that is a distance of 70 miles to reach it. For the other reserves it is still farther. There is a\n\n---distance---\ndistance of 90 miles to reach the reserve of English River, 110 miles to reach that of Clear Lake, 120 miles for Buffalo River, 200 for the Portage la Loche, and 115 miles for Water-Hen River.\n\n\"In the same trip we could, by special arrangement, take the children of Clear Lake, Buffalo River, and Portage, but this sole trip constitutes a round trip of about 300 miles. As to the other reserves we would have to make a special trip to reach each one of them. Furthermore, as I said here above, on account of the great lakes to cross there is almost no possibility of thinking of making these trips with the canoes that we use for ordinary service. I tremble at the mere thought of being caught by a storm on the lake with a load of children in any kind of boat. If there was any accident in the transportation, what a responsibility that would be for me! Concerning the school, it goes without saying, that it would be then useless to try to have any more pupils.\n\n\"Of what precedes I believe that I can conclude that the transportation of the children at the expense of the school is imperative and for that purpose we would need a small boat which would insure security in case of bad weather during these trips.\n\n\"Of course, this represents again certain disbursement for the Department, but I suppose that those who are in charge of Indian Affairs will kindly admit that there is, in this case, a state of affairs which we cannot possibly change.\n\n\"For all these reasons I dare hope that the Department will grant us for the next scholar year, a small boat for the transportation of the pupils, and furthermore a grant sufficient to cover the travelling expenses.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) F. X. Marcotte, O.M.I.\nOttawa, October 1st, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo, regarding the request of Reverend Father Gagnon, O.M.I., Principal of the Beauval Indian Residential School, to provide the school with a motor boat to be used for the transportation of Indian children to and from their homes.

L. Leagon (signature)\nPrincipal\n\nM. A. F. MacKenzie, Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE\nW. REGINA, SASK., 2nd Sept., 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Murison:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the schools which I inspected during the time I was Paying Officer for the Ile a la Crosse Agency.\n\nBeauval School\n\nI visited this school on June 11th and remained at Beauval till noon of the 12th.\n\nThe Staff of this institution are as follows:\nReverend Father F. X. Gagnon, Principal; Brother Beaudoin, Carpenter and Engineer; Brother August Duclos; Sister Superior Chevrifils; Sister Eidelin, teacher grades 1 to IV, inclusive; Sister Carrier, Matron; Sister Robinson, Nurse; Sister Hurtubise in charge of kitchen; Sister Roy, in charge of sewing and laundry.\n\nThe Reverend Father Gagnon impressed me as being an outstanding man, conscientious, keen, and apparently very capable in supervising this institution. He informs me he has a fine staff of employees here. I found them apparently working in harmony and giving co-operative and conscientious service.\n\nOwing to the fact that the new school was not finished inside there were only 19 girl pupils present at the time of my visit. These were given examination in the various subject, pertaining to Grades 1 to IV. I found they appeared to have a good grasp of and were well advanced in their respective grades, spoke up well and seemed keenly interested in their work. These pupils were nicely dressed, appeared to be a well nourished clean, healthy, and happy lot of children. These - children -\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\nchildren are also instructed in sewing, knitting, fancy work, cooking, laundry work, milking cows, and attending poultry.\n\nThe Reverend Principal informed me this school would be opened about the 1st September and expected a total attendance of one hundred pupils. The boys receive a training (in addition to their studies) in the following, carpentry, blacksmithing, electric and steam engineering, saw mill work, and grain and stock raising.\n\nBuildings\n\nAs you are aware the material and work performed on this building was supplied by the Oblate Fathers. In my opinion this building has been well constructed and in a manner to make it 100% fire proof. The basement is divided into the following;\u2014boys' recreation room, girls' recreation room, Sisters' room, Fathers' room, Senior boys' room, Junior boys' room, kitchen, pantry, laundry, dairy, main dining room, machine room, boiler room, fire room, boys' toilet and girls' toilet. These rooms are all floored with birch. On the first floor there is reception room, private parlor, three rooms for visitors, three classrooms, workshop and dispensary. One classroom is floored with birch and the balance of the floors are rough cement finish. The second floor is divided into sewing room, girls' infirmary, boys' infirmary, with a separate room joining each of the infirmaries for the Sister in charge; Sisters' community room, five rooms for Staff, one store room for school supplies, one Sisters' bathroom, toilet and baths for girls, toilet and baths for boys. There are two rooms on this floor with birch flooring. The third floor is divided into boys' dormitory, capacity fifty beds; girls' dormitory, capacity fifty beds, with sleeping room adjoining each of these for attendants. All floors in this storey are birch. These dormitories are equipped with shower baths and toilets. In the attic there are two water tanks with a capacity of 2,000 gallons each. This building, although not finished...\nnot finished inside, is fit for use. The Reverend Father Gagnon estimates that it would require the employment of ten men for a term of two months to finish same. The walls of the rooms are rough brick and whitewashed inside and covered with a mixture of lime and sand outside. Other than the rough cement, there is no flooring in any of the hallways, as there was not sufficient cement to make a smooth finish. The Reverend Principal informs me that there is still floor space of 74,240 square feet to be finished. Of this area 6,570 feet is in hallways. He requested that this institution be assisted by the Department in procuring sufficient flooring for the hallways. Adjoining this building is the Church Chapel, 30 x 60 feet. However there is no danger of fire ever reaching the school from the Chapel. All other outbuildings are placed some distance from the school. These are as follows; Father's residence, warehouse, cattle barn, horse barn, pig barn, chicken house, route house, saw mill, machine shed, and ice house. I noticed this institution has no fire fighting apparatus in the school building, but I am quite satisfied that the building is absolutely fire proof. The only wood used in the construction of it is in the beams and joists, which are timber but well covered with cement. In the event of the floors that are covered with birch catching fire, this would not in any way endanger the safety of the building, as the walls are all solid brick and finished as heretofore mentioned.\n\nThis school has the following live stock; 1 Shorthorn bull, 15 milk cows, 33 beef cows and steers, 12 calves, 18 horses, 5 colts, 2 brood sows, 9 pigs, and 1 Yorkshire boar. In addition they have 125 head of poultry. All this stock appear to be of a good type. The Principal informs me that they have difficulty in procuring hay for their cattle and horses. Apparently high water effects these meadows to the same extent - as it does -\nas it does others throughout this North country, and the Principal was seriously thinking of dispensing with the milk cows and introducing goats to take their place. While here I visited all the crop fields and found them well cultivated and the crops well advanced. These fields were seeded to oats, wheat, barley, potatoes, and tubers. Last year they yielded 1800 bus. of oats, 300 bus. of wheat, 450 bus. of barley, 700 bus. of potatoes, and 800 bus. of tubers from an area of 65 acres. This year they have in crop the following areas; 6 acres of grass for pasture purposes, 40 acres of oats, 6 acres of wheat, 10 acres of barley, 3 acres of tubers, and have cleaned a further four acres for future use.\n\nIn going over the buildings and grounds at this institution I found that all buildings were in a good state of repair, clean and tidy within. The grounds were well kept and were being further improved by the planting of flowers and shrubbery.\n\nI found the Principal of this school very appreciative of the help this institution has already received from the Department. He was very modest in asking for further help and requested that, if the Department were allowing money grants to the Residential Schools in Canada this year, he be given further assistance in procuring some covering for the hall-ways of the new school. Owing to these hallways not being hard finish, they are beginning to show wear and the Father informs me that the footwear of the staff and pupils lasts but a very short time on this account. I found that through the efforts and sacrifices of the members of this institution, they have accomplished something that this whole North country is proud of, in that they are the only institution North of Township 54 that can give the children of this country an education and training equal to that of institutions only found in the larger settlements of the west. In view of this, I would recommend that further assistance be -\nAssistance be given them if possible.\n\nLac la Ronge Church of England Residential School...\n\nI arrived at this school on the night of July 6th, remaining here until leaving for Stanley on July 12th.\n\nOwing to the school being closed for the summer vacation and rainy weather, the Reverend Mr. Fisher, Principal, allowed me the use of one of the classrooms for the purpose of making annuity payments and holding Band meetings.\n\nI found the Reverend Mr. Fisher conscientious and keen in his service to this institution. This was reflected in the general atmosphere of keen co-operation apparent between this man and his staff, which are as follows: Miss E.V. Williams Matron, F.E. Simonson, 1st teacher, Mr. Crozier, 2nd teacher, C. Poney, Girls' Supervisor, B. Baird, Boys' Supervisor, E. Smith, Kitchen Matron, D. Mathews, Laundress, N.L. Patrick, Nurse, A.C. Hastings, Engineer, T.A. Mills, Farmer, and C.C. Brown, Fisherman.\n\nOwing to the school being closed as already mentioned, I did not examine the class work of the pupils. However, during the payment here and at Stanley I came in contact with many of them. In addressing these I found them well mannered, clean, tidy, neatly dressed, and apparently well nourished, and I found they would join in conversation more readily than many Indian pupils I have met. They expressed a keen interest in their school work and seemed very loyal to the institution.\n\nI found the school and other buildings pertaining thereto clean and tidy within and the grounds without very nicely kept.\nThe Reverend Principal informed me there were about 2000' of lumber left over after using that authorized by the Department. This surplus is being used to good advantage, mainly in building partitions in the upper dormitory for the girls, which will accommodate ten small beds and a staff room. Partitions are also being built to separate the smaller boys from the larger, and any surplus lumber will be used for general repairs to buildings. The floors and ceilings of the upper balcony were not completed. I was advised they will be this fall. The Principal requested that wire screening 5' x 65' be provided for this. It could then be used for isolation cases during the summer months.\n\nI found the chimney of this building has been repaired, but does not draw well at times, resulting in soot overflowing and running down it; and on these occasions the building becomes smoky and the inside walls thereof are stained. I also noticed the basement joists have been protected with asbestos from the heat of the furnace pipes, also a new fire box installed in one of the furnaces. In checking over the fire Protection equipment I find further protection can be given by supplying a 50' x 5/8\" garden hose and placing it in the upper dormitory to be used in case of chimney fires, also that recharges are necessary for the following fire extinguishers, 24 recharges Guardene Fire Ext. No. A 606201 capacity 2\u00bd gals., 12 recharges for Pyrene No. P 204607 1 quart type.\n\nThe interior of the school building should be redecorated in that many of the walls are stained, and paint worn off some of the floors and part of the wood-work. I also noticed moss growing between the crevices of the shingles on the roof which should be stained or repainted. My attention was also drawn to the fact that some of the dormitory beds need replacing badly, whereas a little enamel paint would improve the appearance of others.\nThe farm stock consists of 4 milk cows, a team of horses, and 36 hens. These are not adequate to supply the general demand made on them. I find the nature of the land here is not adaptable for cultivation and the Principal informs me that it is only with some effort on the part of this institution that enables them to maintain what little stock they have. In this I concur.\n\nIn going over the land I was forcibly impressed with the fact that this institution will never support its staff and members by any produce derived therefrom, regardless of the amount of labour expended in any attempt to do so. While here, I was questioned concerning a further grant of land to them.\n\nApart from the requirements already mentioned, I find this school require the following:\n\n- New Rear Start for Fairbanks Morse 32 volt Lighting plant.\n- 2 toilet bowls with flush tanks (as replacements)\n- 1 wash basin with fittings as there is only 1 toilet room for students in this building.\n- 2 Doz. beds and mattress 6 x 2\u00bd for replacements\n- 1000 shingles for repairing roof.\n- 50 gal. roof paint - green or creosot.\n- 1 gal. white enamel paint for bedsteads.\n- 15 gal. floor paint - grey for dormitory floors.\n- 3 gals. turpentine.\n- 6 lbs. dry burnt water.\n- 7 gals. floor varnish for halls and dining room.\n- 3 furnace door linings for McClary Famous Magnet furnace No. H10 A.\n\nIn view of the effort involved by this institution in an endeavour to carry on the good and only work of its kind in this section of the North, I would respectfully request they be given special consideration in grants the Department may be considering for these institutions.\nStanley Day School\n\nI visited this school on July 15th, and found 29 pupils present with Mr. T.W. Gilmore as teacher. The pupils appeared clean, healthy and well clothed.\n\nIn taking the classes in their various subjects I noticed some of the pupils were much further advanced than the majority, in spite of there being little or no difference in their ages. In questioning Mr. Filmore regarding this he informed me the backward pupils were those who attended school during the summer months only. He also advised me that owing to the fact that these children attended school for three or four months, and then lived with their people during the balance of the year, resulted in them forgetting what they had learned at school.\n\nIn view of this it would appear to be a wasted effort in trying to teach these children under those conditions. However I found the children who had attended their classes during the winter months well advanced in their studies. These appeared keen and interested in their work, and all seemed anxious to return to their school this winter.\n\nThe Chief and members of this band are very anxious to keep this school open during the yearly school term, and have voted the sum of $600.00 to be taken from band funds for that purpose. Dispensation of same as follows:\n\n$50.00 a year for housing, cooking & washing for girl pupils.\n$50.00 a year for \" \" \" \" for boy pupils.\n$50.00 a year for labor to supply fuel and fish to the above.\n$200.00 a year for food supplies from Revillon Freres Trading Co., Stanley.\n$250.00 to ship in the following: 5 sacks flour, 100 lbs. pot barley, 100 lbs. rolled oats, 50 lbs. sugar, 25 lbs. tea, 36 lbs. lard and 200 candles.\n\nThese people advised me that if they could be assured this school was to be kept open the year round they would guarantee to increase the yearly average daily attendance.\ndaily attendance from 24:01 to 45. In so doing the provider of each family would be able to give more time to his hunting and trap lines during the winter months.\n\nI am attaching hereto the resolution, signed by the Chief and Head Men, which was witnessed by me, and would recommend it be given favorable consideration.\n\nThe foregoing report is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.H. Simpson.\nPaying Officer.\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward a report on the schools included in the Ile a la Crosse Agency submitted by the Paying Officer for this year, Mr. S. H. Simpson.\n\nBeauval School\n\nIt is interesting to note that the new residential school building at Beauval has been well constructed and is apparently a fire proof building. It will be noted that there is still some finishing to do and the Principal has requested assistance in connection with flooring for the hallways. There is no flooring in any of the hallways, except rough cement. The report deals quite fully with conditions at the school and speaks for itself.\n\nLac la Ronge Res. School\n\nThis report gives a general idea of conditions and sets out in detail the requirements as presented to him. You will note on Page 7 he mentions that he was questioned regarding a further grant of land to them. I took this matter up quite fully last year, looked over the ground, and made a recommendation regarding land which might be set aside. This is a matter which I think should receive some attention before it is too late to secure suitable land. There is very little fit for cultivation in that whole area and it is important, if this school is to be continued, that sufficient arable land be secured upon.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nsecured upon which to grow the feed requirements of the stock belonging to the institution.\n\nStanley Day School\n\nThe report in connection with this Day School is not encouraging in view of the living conditions of the people. As these people derive their living by hunting and trapping, it is absolutely impossible for them to reside continuously at Stanley. Their means of livelihood takes them considerable distance from that point and it is obvious that, unless residential facilities are provided for the school children to enable them to remain at Stanley all the year round, we cannot expect a regular and satisfactory attendance. It will be noted on Page 8 of the report the Paying Officer states that the Chief and members of this Band are anxious to keep the school open during the term and have voted the sum of $600.00 to be taken from their Band funds for that purpose. I question the advisability of doing this. The funds of the Band are very limited and after all the granting of this money would only be a temporary expedient, as, if the funds are to be used from year to year for this purpose, they would soon become depleted and we would be confronted with the same situation as exists at present. In view of the resolutions having been passed, I am submitting them herewith.\n\nThe foregoing is respectfully submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Morrison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\n| Item Description                                      | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| 3 Doz.

Charlebois, I wish to say that a certain list of hardware has been overlooked when tenders were taken last July.\n\nIt seems that the purchase of this material is authorised by your letter when you say that an expenditure of approximately $1,750.00 may be incurred in connection with the plumbing, the inside doors, and hardware necessary for completion of the building.\n\nThe cost of the plumbing amounted to $914.56 and the cost of the lumber was $265.00. This leaves good margin for the hardware overlooked.\n\nIn order to avoid all misunderstanding, I have the pleasure to submit to your approval different quotations received in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\nOttawa, November 18, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing quotations which you received for the supplying of hardware, fencing material, etc., for use at the Beauval Indian Residential School. As stated by you, authority was granted by official letter of May 20, 1932, to incur an expenditure of approximately $1750.00 in connection with the plumbing, supplying inside doors and hardware necessary to complete the building. By official letter of July 15th, last, you were authorized to place an order with Crane, Limited, Saskatoon, for the plumbing materials required to the amount of $914.58, and with W. H. Cushing, Limited, Saskatoon, for the lumber, doors and windows, at their price of $285.00.\n\nAs there is a margin still unexpended from the amount authorized, the Department will approve of you placing an order with the Mannville Hardware Company, Limited, Prince Albert, for the supplying of the hardware, wire fencing, etc., required, at their quotation of $270.10, F.O.B. Big River, Sask., plus their charges for supplying 60 dozen japanned sash bolts.\n\nPlease obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost of these supplies. This account you should certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Martin Lajeunesse, O.M.I.,\nSecretary, Bishop's House,\nThe Pas, Man.\nJanuary 12, 1933.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. MCGILL.\n\nRe: Beauval Indian Residential School.\n\nIn connection with the preparation of Estimates for 1933-34, regarding a grant to reimburse the church authorities for the expenditure incurred in the erection of the new building at the Beauval Indian Residential School, in northern Saskatchewan - for which a grant is included in our Estimates - I beg to report as follows:\n\nIn September, 1927, the old building was destroyed by fire, and Bishop Charlebois, representing the Oblate Order, offered to rebuild if the Department would give a grant of $50,000. The Department accepted this proposal, which was approved by P. C. 932, of May 30, 1929. The new building was to be erected by the Order, on a day labour basis. The land on which the school is situated is owned by the Department. During the year commencing June, 1929, this grant of $50,000 was paid. Approximately $63,000 was expended by the church authorities during that year.\n\nIn October, 1929, His Lordship intimated that there was a misunderstanding regarding financing and that the Oblate Order would require considerably more than the $50,000 if the building programme was to be completed. Early in 1930, His Lordship, hoping that the Department would be able to make an additional grant, arranged for the freighting of materials for the foundation of the second unit of the building. In February, 1931, His Lordship came to Ottawa to plead for further help. No financial assistance was given him by the Department at that time. On his own responsibility, however, he began construction of the main part of the building, and an additional grant of $10,000 was paid the church authorities by P. C. 1326, of the 13th June, 1932.\n\nHis Lordship, in a communication dated September 16th, last, states that the total expenditure in the erection of the building was approximately $140,000, towards which the Department provided the sum of $60,000, as stated above. He strongly urged that a further substantial refund be made in our Estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nI have outlined this matter, in order that you may have the facts before you. The Minister and the Department were quite clear regarding the understanding which resulted in the Order in Council of the 30th of May, 1929. Bishop Charlebois gave nothing in writing but he held interviews with both the Minister and the late Mr. Ferrier.\n\nWhile in one sense the Department is not responsible for the present situation, it should be remembered that the Beauval School in the past was considered a useful institution and that it constitutes at present a valuable adjunct to our educational system. I would therefore support the provision of funds to further reimburse His Lordship to an amount of at least $10,000.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHon. Thomas G. Murphy -\n\nI am enclosing for your information a memorandum from Mr. Sutherland in connection with the cost of erection of the Beauval Indian Residential School.

Instead of $65,000.00, only $25,000.00 were included in 1934 estimates and paid.\n\nI wish very earnestly to be informed if we can expect that the balance $40,000.00 will be refunded this year.

Plowing and spading was in progress all over and a new septic tank on up-to-date plans, with complete drainage and ditching was under construction, generally it was a busy place.\n\nThe Water Power which operates everything at the school, had been doubtful during low water seasons, so this year a Dam was constructed at the mouth of the river near Lake La Plonge and a second one at the Power Plant, this was all done at a heavy expense to the school and it was well done on regular engineering plans and will assure a steady supply of water. A further report on this and the septic tank will be sent to the Department as soon as full particulars are available.\n\nThe new buildings as usual are in perfect condition and the whole premises are clean and orderly, some of the old buildings are being renovated, and the Rev. Principal has regular Plans of the whole layout made to scale, some of the old buildings out of place on the plan are being moved to allow for roadways and in future every addition or move will be according to plan and as they can and do produce all their own building materials including shingles and excepting cement, every new building will be a credit to the school.\n\nThe Live Stock are all in fine condition and of good quality, many of the cows are Holstein strain and bred to Shirthorn and they have fine Registered Bull purchased recently. The work horses are all heavy averaging about 1600 and well conditioned, even after a heavy season of work, and a trip through the barns, pastures and fields, leaves you convinced of good farming ability, good management and supervision and shows that the Rev. Principal als past and present have been on the job.\n\nS. L.

As you are aware, payments were made, from time to time, in reimbursing His Lordship for the expenditure incurred by him, to a total amount of $133,763.86. The cost of the building greatly exceeded the original estimate, and it was considered when the payment of $40,000 was made to you, that this was in final settlement.\n\nI regret it will not be possible, at the present time, to consider payment of the amount of $1,000, which you claimed to be still due on the cost of the construction of the building. In any event, we have no funds available in our Appropriation to pay this amount. I beg to suggest, in view of the large amount that has already been paid, should it be definitely ascertained that there is a further balance remaining unpaid, that your Church will absorb the amount.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRight Rev.

As stated, their original main at this point was one inch pipe and where they have now started to dig this they found that much of it is burst from frost, and have decided to take up the whole line which is nine to ten feet underground. The Principal has made a request that he be assisted in the purchase of pipe to replace this. If the pipe were delivered to Big River, he will transport it from there and pay all expenses of installing.\n\nThe following are required:\n\n- 1200 ft. of 2-inch pipes.\n- 2 doz.

Prince & Son, Battleford, Sask., for Piping etc. for Beauval Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 132-1-5 dated July 30th, 1936.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 518\nBeauval Indian Residential School,\nBeauval, Sask.,\nJuly 2nd, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Macdonald,\n\nI did not wish to trouble you with my requests during your recent visit to Beauval. But what a number of things I could have presented to you, that I could have discussed with you!\n\nDuring the past year, the Episcopal Corporation of Keewatin has had to bear very heavy expenses for the maintenance of the School: 1-Construction of two dams, to insure at all times sufficient water power for electrical purposes and for domestic purposes. In previous years, when low water occurred, there was no water at all for a period of about three months. 2-Reconstruction of Septic Tank. 3-Making of articles of furniture indispensable to the school. Taking these items only, we get the following figures:\n\nLaPlonge Lake Dam --- $1500.00\nLaPlonge River Dam and dredging river 2200.00\nSeptic Tank --------- 900.00\nFurniture --------- 225.00\n\n4825.00\n\nAll these projects were done at our own expense, since even though you approved of them you could not promise immediate support, and we, on the other hand, had a pressing need of these improvements.\n\nI allow myself to make a brief exposition of these things to remind you, what otherwise you have already credited us with, that we certainly do our part for the maintenance and good functioning of our school.\n\nBut in spite of what has been done in the past, there is still a great deal to be done. And some items are of an urgent nature. Expecting that through your personal influence the ministers of the Department will readily come to our assistance, I briefly expose our most pressing needs.\nFrom now on we are assured of a permanent water supply. We would like to solve a dual problem, source of heavy expenses and difficulties, that can only be well understood by one who has been through them day after day.\n\nThe two main items are: Our pumping system, our electrical system. Both of them are far from being powerful enough, even when functioning at their best, which happens very seldom, and only a few days in succession. This comes from the fact that ever since the opening of the school, five years ago, we have tried to get along and keep things going, by using various means of fortune and fixing things temporarily. But this cannot last any longer, and at least for the winter of 1937-38 it is absolutely necessary for us to be provided with new equipment to furnish us with light and water.\n\nWe have always also been without a workshop for blacksmith and shoe repairs. So we have thought of asking for authorization to build a shop where we would have all machinery necessary for electric light, pump, blacksmith, carpentering and shoe repairing. All this would be operated by a hydraulic turbine.\n\nNow, let me clearly explain what we expect from the Government. Knowing the scant resources that the Indian Department can affect to such improvements in schools, I have endeavored to come to conditions, which I confidently hope, will prove acceptable.\n\nFirst, I would ask that in all this, the material only would be granted us. After consultation with Bishop Lajeunesse, for costs incurred in transportation from terminal as well as for construction of workshop and installation of machinery, I would gladly take the responsibility. This is to show you that we wish to collaborate with the Department and also to obtain if possible, that we receive help in bringing an immediate solution to these problems.\n\nIn short, here is what my request amounts to:\n\nAbout 1000 bags Cement\nA few thousand lbs. Sheathing Iron\nTin covering\nOne Hydraulic Turbine\nOne Pump\nOne Dynamo\nA big metal Pipe to carry water to Turbine about 250 ft. long.\nWe have already sent in our request for sufficient\n\n1200 ft. of 2\" steel pipes and fittings required for pump.\n\nSo the above would be the Government's contribution to this project, while ours would consist of transportation charges, construction of shop, installation of machinery, all lumber needed, besides bricks, lime, sand and stone.\n\nUnder separate cover, you will find detailed information concerning machinery, proposed construction, and site of same.\n\nBy what precedes, it is quite clear that our request is very reasonable, besides being absolutely urgent. So we earnestly hope, that with your sanction, this project will receive the approval of the ministers of the Department.\n\nI beg to remain, as always,\n\nYours gratefully,\n\nMr. S. L. Macdonald,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nSeptember 3rd., 1936.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith a letter from the Rev. Victor Bleau, Principal of Beauval School, wherein he asks assistance for necessary machinery, Dynamo, cement etc. for required improvements at the Beauval School. It will be noted from his letter that he was to have forwarded details of the machinery under separate cover, and his letter was held back pending this information, and it has not yet come to hand. As soon as these details are received they will be forwarded to the Department.\n\nAnything that could be done in this line to assist this school would be much appreciated, as the improvements anticipated are really required, and the efforts and work already done to improve their place justify any assistance that the Department could give.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nl enc.\nSIM/\u00c6L.\nOttawa, September 11, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant, enclosing a communication which you received from the Principal of the Beauval Indian Residential School, requesting that building material, dynamo and turbine be supplied.\n\nRegarding this request, I have to say that the Department will have no funds during the present fiscal year to cover the cost of supplying the equipment asked for by the Principal.\n\nI would request that you forward further details of the machinery, etc., and an estimate of the cost of each item. When our Estimates for the coming fiscal year are being prepared, consideration will be given to including an amount to supply certain of the Principal's requests. It will be necessary, however, to have full particulars as to the cost involved in the case of each item of equipment required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nSir:\n\nFurther re., Material required at the Beauval School and in reply to Department Letter #132-1-5, Sept 11th, it has not been possible up to this date, to get details of the Turbine etc., but an Estimate of the Cost has been given.\n\nThe Principal made a trip to Regina, after considerable correspondence with the Allis-Chalmers Co. and finally their Engineer advised that they did not manufacture the small Machines required, but firms in Ontario did and they have forwarded the Plans and Specifications to them and it is hoped something definite will be to hand, before the purchasing is necessary.\n\nThe Estimate of Cost of Material F.O.B. Big River is as follows.\n\n| Item                        | Cost   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| 1 Turbine                   | $1800.00 |\n| 1 Pump                      | $250.00 |\n| 1 Dynamo                    | $500.00 |\n| Steel Pipe to carry Water to Turbine | $200.00 |\n| 2240 Sq Ft Metal Shingles   | $239.50 |\n| 1200 Bags Cement            | $1194.00 |\n\nThe Price submitted for Metal Shingles is from Messrs B. Prince & Son, Battleford.\n\nThe Price Submitted for the Cement, is from the A.F. Macdonald, Lumber Co., North Battleford.\n\nIt is noted from Department letter, that Funds are not available to purchase or supply this material this year, however if it is at all possible, the Cement should be shipped to go by Winter freight, as there is always a heavy loss in this from water damage, when summer shipped by Scows.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6301, file 650-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 10, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, stating the equipment required to install a water system and lighting service at the Beauval Indian Residential School, also the metal shingles and cement required.\n\nIn reply I have to say the Department has given favourable consideration, in the Estimates for the coming fiscal year, to the supplying of a turbine, pump, dynamo, steel pipe and metal shingles. There will be no funds, however, to supply the cement. I am not aware, at the present time, if the Treasury Board will approve of the funds for the above purposes. There will be no funds available in the current year's Appropriation to supply any of the above mentioned equipment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nSir,\n\nWhile at the Beavertail School a few days ago, the Principal requested additional desk parts, stating that these have been ordered previously, and on going over our records, I find that the requisition, August 31st, 1934, requested these desk parts. As the pupilage of this school has now been increased, I would ask that the following be shipped to the Principal via Big River, Sask.\n\n2 No. 202 Preston Desk rear seats\n3 No. 203 Preston Desk rear seats.\n\nI would request that if possible these be shipped at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We feel that a further consideration of these circumstances by the Department would convince them of the advisability of making this further grant; and would ask you to again bring the matter to their attention.\n\nThanking you, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nV. Bleau, o.m.i.\n(Principal)\n\nS. L. Macdonald,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nBeauval Indian School,\nBeauval, Saskatchewan,\nJune 21st, 1937.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 25th last, I have been gathering information about our needs. The 20 H.P. Turbine is about what we want. We need as well a dynamo developing twelve kilowatts; and a water pump, for which the specifications would be: two-inch pipe, distance from intake to tank about 800 feet or run with 120 feet of head level. The tanks hold about 5000 gallons, which is approximately the average daily amount used.\n\nDrawings are enclosed showing the place where turbine is to be installed. There are two places where the channel may be built from the dam to the turbine: one leading off above the dam, and running underground to the turbine, and the other much shorter and running on top of the ground directly from the dam. There would be a difference in level of about 1\u00bd feet from one end of the pipe to the other. The drop of the turbine well will be at least 15 feet and could easily be arranged to obtain as much as a 16-foot drop.\n\nIt is most important that we have the main shaft of the turbine going all the way through the working shop, with pulleys or drive belts for the dynamo, water pump, and for other machinery.\n\nI would like you to send me, with the smallest possible delay, your definite price for this equipment: the turbine, dynamo, water pump, and the proper steel pipe, with leads and fittings, for the channel to the turbine.\n\nI think it would be advisable for us to have one of your engineers to supervise the installation, in case we should agree with your prices; the installation would be made in June or July of 1938, the machinery being freighted in to this point during the coming winter. It is necessary to submit your answer to the Department of Indian Affairs, and I am very anxious to hear from you as soon as possible. Any advice you can give will be much appreciated.\n\nKindly return the enclosed drawings when you are finished with them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nV.

Macdonald,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources.\nBIG REASONS WHY\nPatented Removable Liners\nSAVE MONEY for WESTCO USERS\n\n1. Lifetime service from Pump Casings.\n2. Less metal required for alloy construction.\n3. \"Stand-by\" pump protection available at about \u00bc usual cost.\n4. Capacity of pump can be increased and decreased.\n\nPUMP users throughout industry have been quick in voicing their approval of Westco's new patented Removable Liner feature. It is a welcome improvement on a pump that has made a name for itself by proving its superiority on thousands of different applications both in this country and abroad.\n\nJust as the name suggests, Removable Liners are simply a lining for the Westco pump casings proper. They form the liquid channel and are quickly and easily removed from the pump casings. To every pump user, we believe the valuable advantages of this feature will be of great interest.\n\nLifetime Service from Casings\n\nSeldom, if ever, need the Westco Pump casings be replaced. This is a statement of fact because, in this modern pump, all interior surfaces which are subject to wear and deterioration are incorporated in the Liners.\n\nAs explained in the following paragraphs, the cost of these Liners is so much less than the cost of the complete casings that real savings can be effected if reconditioning is ever necessary in the years to come.\nThis job can be done without disturbing the installation of the pump or piping connections. No need for returning pump to the factory. By following simple instructions, it is possible, in a few minutes' time, to interchange new Liners for the old.\n\nCuts Cost of Alloy Construction\n\nLiners and Impeller which direct and pump the liquid can be economically made of alloy metals for it is in and around these parts that the velocity of the liquid is greatest and, consequently, corrosion most rapid.\n\nOften, this allows cast-iron or bronze casings to be used with complete satisfaction and, of course, considerable saving of money. This is possible because the amount of comparatively high cost alloy metal required to make the Liners and Impeller is about 73% less than the amount required for casting the complete pump casings.\n\n\"Stand-By\" Pump Protection\n\nAn extra set of Liners and Impeller may be carried on hand for possible use in emergencies. This practice furnishes \"stand-by\" pump protection at a cost about \u00bc the usual price of an auxiliary pump.\n\nALL Westco Turbine Pumps have a double-suction Intake which creates a perfect hydraulic balance. Ingenious design of vertically split casings permits ready removal of Liners, Impeller-shaft unit and bearings (complete disassembly) without disturbing suction or discharge piping connections.\n\nOn those duties where service interruptions would prove expensive and the cost of auxiliary pumps is an important factor, this feature will be of real interest to the pump buyer.\n\nCapacity Can Be Varied\n\nRemovable Liners in a Westco Turbine Pump enable the capacity and head to be readily increased or decreased within reasonable limits. This is accomplished by simply interchanging a different size set of Liners and Impeller.\n\nSuch flexibility of capacity further insures maximum return on your investment in Westco Turbine Pumps, because they can be shifted from duty to duty without sacrificing efficiency when different capacities and heads are required.\n\nFIG. 1. Belt Driven WESTCO TURBINE PUMP, Type BR, equipped with two Ball Bearing Pedestals for supporting the pulleys.\n\nFIG. 2. WESTCO TURBINE PUMP, Type BR, showing design of all pumps with 3\" suction or larger which have flange connections. Notice that pump casing has covers at BOTH ends. This feature allows ready removal of Liners and Impeller-shaft assembly from either end.\n\nFIG. 3. WESTCO TURBINE PUMP, Type BR, showing design of all pumps with 2\u00bd\" suction or smaller which have screw connections. Note compactness and rugged construction. All Type BR pumps can be quickly changed from right- to left-hand rotation or vice versa.\nHOW WESTCO WORKS\n\nThe multivaned, bronze impeller is the ONLY moving part in a Westco Turbine Pump and it operates without metal-to-metal contact. Think of it \u2014 metallic friction is entirely eliminated. The result is trouble-free performance throughout an exceptionally long service life.\n\nThe liquid enters the Westco Pump at the suction intake where it finds its way to the bottom (or inlet) of the impeller vanes and by centrifugal force the direction of flow is through the vanes to the periphery of the impeller where it enters the pump channel.\n\nWestco's multivaned Impeller reenergizes the liquid thereby producing a multistage effect. This is accomplished with only one Impeller. The result is considerably less velocity of the liquid and, consequently, less churning and erosion. When necessary, Westcos develop high pressures in single-stage construction that would require a multistage, conventional centrifugal type pump. This means less friction, simplified construction and greater economy of operation.\n\nFigure 4 briefly illustrates the flow through the vanes while the liquid is traveling around the pump channel in the direction of rotation of the impeller.\n\nBy this explanation, you can readily see how each vane on the impeller is a pump in itself\u2014each imparting its proportional share of energy to the liquid in its travel around through the pump channel. That is why Westco is often described as being \"100 Pumps within a Pump\".\n\nSELECTION TABLE for TYPE BR WESTCO TURBINE PUMPS\n\nTable shows size pump and H.P. motor required for various capacities and head conditions based on 1750 R.P.M.\n\n| Capacity | G.F.M. | 20 or less | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 80 | 100 | 125 | 150 | 175 | 200 | 250 | 300 |\n|----------|--------|------------|----|----|----|----|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| For Water | 100-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 |\n| For Brine | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 |\n| For Water | 1400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 |\n| For Brine | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 |\n| For Water | 1500-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 |\n| For Brine | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 |\n| For Water | 1500-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 |\n| For Brine | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 | 400-1/2 |\n\nNOTES:\n- Above table is based on Brine of 1.0 Specific Gravity.\n- Reference indicates Size Pump and H.

above table and for suction lift not exceeding 20 feet. \u2014 State on your purchase order operating conditions as to capacity and head required. \u2014 Curve data are furnished upon request; also Performance Data Sheets Nos. 1439 and 1440 R. P. M. Two pumps may be connected in series and driven by one motor. Capacity is doubled by doubling the head and dividing the B. H. P.\n\nTo Obtain Pump Efficiency:\n\n\\[ \\text{G.P.M.} \\times \\text{Weight of Liquid per gallon in pounds} \\times \\text{Total Head in Feet} = \\text{Pump Efficiency} \\]\n\n**TOTAL HEAD = Suction Lift + Discharge Head + Friction Head + Velocity Head.**\n\n*Note: 1 U.S. gallon of water weighs 8.33 pounds.*\n\nLIQUIDS OTHER THAN WATER \u2014 Westco Pumps will deliver the same volume of other liquids as long as their viscosity is the same as water. The horse-power requirements for other liquids will be approximately the same as water. Liquids having viscosities greater than water such as kerosene or heavy oils of 1.25 sp. gr. will require 20% greater B. H. P. than the figures stated in the above tables.\n\nPumping head will not be accurately calculated. Simply estimate roughly the maximum head which you are sure will not be exceeded and select pump and motor for that condition. If decrease in head lessens power required and increases capacity only slightly.\n\nAs long as B. H. P., shown in table, does not exceed 10% overload of the 40\" standard rated motor B. H. P., the unit may be recommended and sold for continuous operation.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

Westco engineers have had many years experience designing corrosion-resisting pumps for widely varying applications. You are cordially invited to draw upon this source of knowledge by submitting your pump problems to our engineering staff. There is no obligation incurred.\n\nFEATURES THAT MAKE WESTCO THE FAVORITE PUMP ON THOUSANDS OF DUTIES\n\nNO Belts \u2014 NO Valves \u2014 NO Pistons \u2014 NO Pounding Gears \u2014 NO Springs \u2014 NO Leathers \u2014 NO Hammering\n\nWIDE OPERATING RANGE \u2014 Westcos automatically adjust themselves to changes in the operating condition. Simply select pump and motor for maximum head you know will not be exceeded, and water will move less than this. The head may actually be increased; the pump will deliver only a slightly increased capacity and the power required will decrease with the head. Thus, efficiency is maintained and changes for increased capacity are easy.\n\nACCESSIBILITY \u2014 Westco Turbine Pumps are easily disassembled without disturbing suction or discharge piping connections. Makes cleaning a quick, simple task.\n\nQUIET OPERATION \u2014 A distinguishing characteristic of all Westcos, Humless, throbless, and no vibration.\n\nTROUBLE-FREE OPERATION \u2014 Will operate for months with but a single filling of grease and adjustment of packing glands.\n\nHIGH PRESSURE IN SINGLE STAGE \u2014 Westco's simple, sound turbine type of pumping enables them to deliver multistage performance in single-stage construction at moderate speed of 1750R.P.M.\n\nDOUBLE SUCTION DESIGN \u2014 Liquid entering the pump chamber is equally distributed to BOTH sides of the impeller. Thus, a perfect hydraulic balance is created.\n\nPERFECT HYDRAULIC BALANCE \u2014 Eliminates all end thrust at bearings. Wear and consequent maintenance expense are thus minimized.\n\nLOW POWER REQUIREMENTS \u2014 A remarkable fact when Westco's high efficiency is considered.\n\nLOW COST \u2014 Westco offers all the advantages in design of double-suction horizontal split case pumps plus improved efficiency, wide operating range and longer service life at a price far less than you are asked to pay for another pump. Westco's simplicity of construction, design and manufacture \u2014 Westco's extreme simplicity allows them to be economically constructed from noncorrosive or acid resisting metal alloys.\n\nMINIMUM HEAD ROOM AND FLOOR SPACE REQUIRED \u2014 Westcos occupy only a fraction of space which is usually needed for pumps of comparable capacity.\n\nNO METAL-TO-METAL CONTACT \u2014 There is no metal-to-metal contact in the interior of a Westco Pump to require internal lubrication. Therefore, Westco Pumps will handle nonlubricating liquids without friction or wear and maintain years of dependable service without impairing efficiency or loss of capacity.\n\nBALL BEARING CONSTRUCTION \u2014 Impeller Shaft rotates on two selected outward ball bearings. This assures smooth, quiet operation and perfect alignment.\nWESTCO Self-priming TURBINE PUMPS\u2014Type SR\n\nThese Westco pumps possess all the well known and valuable Westco features described on the first six pages of this catalog. In addition, they are self-priming without continuous recirculation or the use of complicated mechanisms.\n\nSelf-priming Westcos are widely used for water system service on farms, estates, country clubs and in greenhouses, schools and small industrial plants where the source of water is within suction lift such as pumping from shallow wells, lakes, streams, cisterns, etc.\n\nWestco\u2019s pumping action automatically clear the pump of gas, air or vapor, thereby insuring delivery of full capacity. This valuable feature recommends these pumps for handling highly volatile liquids, hot water, etc. Dairies, Chemical Plants, Refineries, Breweries, Wineries and Distilleries find Westcos ideal for Transfer and Filtration Service. Portable units either electric motor or gas engine driven are available.\n\nThese pumps are popular for Sump and Drainage service because the pump itself is installed above the water level thus facilitating complete inspection and quick cleaning. Sump units are completely automatic. No foot valve necessary.\n\nPERFORMANCE and SELECTION TABLE for WESTCO SELF-PRIMING PUMPS\n\nWhen operating at full load speed of standard 1800 R.P.M. motors and pumping clear water at normal

Equipment for Beauval Indian School\n\nWe have been requested by Mr. V. Bleau of the Beauval Indian Residential School to quote you direct on the above and take pleasure in submitting the following proposal:\n\nReiffenstein Turbine:\n\nFor - One (1) only #10 Reiffenstein Turbine, designed to develop 20 H.P. when operating under a net effective head of 13.5 ft. at a speed of 340 RPM, including driving pulley and oil pressure governor.\n\nOur price will be FIFTY NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN DOLLARS ($5915)\n\nThe unit will be as shown on enclosed blueprint of our Drawing #C-4818, and will include a plate steel casing, a cast iron runner, a steel shaft, two anti-friction bearings, a cast iron pulley, a cast iron draft tube elbow, a plate steel conical draft tube, a steel regulating gate, a self contained Woodward oil pressure governor with belt driven centrifugal head and belt driven rotary pumping unit.\n\nShipment - fourteen (14) to sixteen (16) weeks.\n\nGenerator:\n\nFor - One (1) Type ASI-7246, 8 pole, 15 kw-a., 12 kw., 0.8 p.f. 50\u00b0 C. rise, 900 RPM 125 volt, 60 cycle, single phase alternator with pole face winding, suitable for waterwheel drive (85% overspeed).\n\nOne Sliding base\nOne pulley\nOne Generator field rheostat\nOne 125 volt direct connected exciter and exciter field rheostat.\nMr. McDonald\n\nOne (1) Switchboard for use with the above Alternator, consisting of:\n\nOne (1) 36\" x 16\" x 1\" panel on 64\" pipe supports, mounting the following equipment -\n\nOne (1) AD6 Ammeter\nOne (1) AD6 voltmeter\nOne (1) Concentric rheostat operating mechanism.\nOne (1) D.P.S.T. 250 volt, DL2 lever switch with fuses.\n\nOur price will be ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED & FORTY DOLLARS ($1,540)\n\nShipment - six (6) to eight (8) weeks.\n\nSLUICE GATE:\n\nFor One (1) 42\" diameter sluice gate, with hand-stand and operating mechanism,\n\nOur price:\nONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED & THIRTY DOLLARS ($1,330.00)\n\nShipment twelve (12) weeks.\n\nThe general arrangement of the above gate is shown on blueprint of our Sketch A-16774-B, three blueprints of which are enclosed herewith;\n\nPUMP:\n\nMontreal state that as your capacity is about 5000 gallons and this being your average consumption per day this would work out to a rate of 3.5 g.p.m and it seems unlikely that you would install such a small pump. 800 ft. of 2\" pipe will carry 10 g.p.m. with loss of head of about 10 ft. and we take pleasure in quoting you on a pump of this size as follows:\n\nFor One (1) only 10 I.G.P.M. No.515, 1-1/4\" \"Westco\" Turbine Pump, 1850 R.F.M., 120 ft. head; mounted on cast iron sub-base; complete with tight and loose pulleys.\n\nPrice - ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS ($175.00)\nMr. McDonald\n\nThe above pump is described in the attached Bulletin from Micro-Westco Inc., and will require about 1 H.P. for its operation.\n\nPIPING:\n\nYou show a 42\" pipe about 163' long but Montreal advise us that a pipeline 3' diameter will carry the water required to develop 20 H.P. under 13.5 ft. with loss of head about one ft. in the 163' of pipe. We are, therefore, quoting you an alternative on this length of pipe.\n\n163 ft. of 42\" pipe made from 1/4\" plate supplied in eleven (11) pieces with flanged angle connections complete with gaskets for bolting in the field\n\nOur price TWENTY TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DOLLARS ($2270.00)\n\nAs a guide to you we may say that for each right angle elbow or equivalent required in this pipe there would be an additional cost of approximately...\n\nTWO HUNDRED & SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS ($265.00) per elbow.\n\n24\"\n\n163 ft. of pipe made from 1/4\" plate in eleven (11) pieces with flanged angle connections complete with gaskets and bolts FIFTEEN HUNDRED & TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS ($1525.00)\n\nFor each right angle elbow or equivalent in this pipe there would be an additional cost of approximately ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS ($120.00)\n\nFor 35 ft. of 48\" pipe made from 1\" plate in three (3) pieces with flanged angle connections complete with necessary gaskets and bolts for field connections - SIX HUNDRED & FORTY EIGHT DOLLARS ($648.00)\n\nFor each right angle elbow or equivalent in this pipe there would be an additional cost of approximately TWO HUNDRED & SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS ($264.00)\n\nThe only piece of equipment missing from this equipment is 24\" gate should you decide on this size of pipe. This, however,\nMr. McDonald\n\nAug.23-1937.\n\ncan easily be obtained at a later date.\n\nWe notice there is some reinforcing in the machine shop foundations on which we are pleased to quote a price of FIVE DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS ($5.75) per 100# net.\n\nAll of the above prices are for the material and equipment f.o.b. cars Beauval, Federal Government Sales Tax of 8% only being included, no Provincial Tax.\n\nThis quotation is based on conditions and prices for materials current at this date, and is subject to confirmation by the Company at the time order is placed.\n\nWith regard to the field assembly we could send a Supervisor and would charge you a nominal rate per day for his services while this work is being carried out.\n\nWe sincerely hope that the above prices and information will be of service to you and that we may have the pleasure of hearing favorably from you in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDOMINION BRIDGE CO.LIMITED,\n\nPer: E.A.

The 42\" sluice gate on which we have quoted will include a cast iron frame with brass seats, cast iron gate, a steel rising stem, cast iron hand-stand with bevel gear and hand-crank; twelve (12) 1\" diameter foundation bolts will also be supplied.\nSir:-\n\nFurther re Department letter #132-1-5, Aug 9th and my letter of the 20th.\n\nI beg to forward enclosed Plans and specification and they are apparently far above the Estimate made by the school Principal, but as I am not in any way qualified to judge on this material, there are no comments that I could make but the Department nodoubt have qualified Engineers or advisers to deal with it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept Mines & Resources.\n| Item          | 42\"       | 24\"       |\n|--------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Turbine      | $918.00   | $918.00   |\n| Generator    | $340.00   | $340.00   |\n| Slings (set 42\") | $330.00 x | $100.00 x |\n| Penstock 42\" | $270.00 x | $1525.00  |\n| Elbows 42\"   | $30.00 x  | $40.00    |\n| Pipe 48\"     | $49.00    | $40.00    |\n\nTotal: $233.00 | $10620.00\nOttawa, September 14, 1937\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo enclosing plans, specifications and a quotation from the Dominion Bridge Company, Winnipeg, in connection with proposed equipment at the Beauval Indian Residential School for lighting and pumping systems.\n\nThe estimate of the Dominion Bridge Company is approximately $14,000.00. This is considerably higher than the quotation contained in your letter of November 4th, 1936, and it is apparent that if the request of the Reverend Principal is granted, the expenditure will be extremely heavy.\n\nBefore making a definite decision the Department requires considerable additional information as follows:\n\n1. Is the Beauval Residential School wired for electricity, and have the school authorities been developing electricity from the present water power?\n\n2. Before expending any money on the water power development did the school authorities have the advantage of expert opinion? If so, you should state who was consulted at that time.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\n3. What is the head of water in the lake as the result of the erection of the dam mentioned in the Reverend Principal's letter?\n\n4. Have the school authorities carefully considered the fact that if the new machinery suggested by the Dominion Bridge Company were supplied it would require a great deal of water to operate it and, as a result, the quantity of water available for other purposes might not be sufficient?\n\n5. Have the school authorities considered the advisability of generating their electric current by means of a steam plant or a Diesel engine? Information that the Department has received indicates that either system would be much cheaper than the proposed water power installation. Of course, to operate a steam plant successfully it would be necessary to have plenty of wood available for some years to come. Is this available in the vicinity of Beauval? To operate a Diesel engine plant would it be possible to obtain the necessary fuel oil at a cost that would not be prohibitive?\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to the Principal of the Beauval Residential School, and the Department would appreciate an early reply both from him and from yourself. You can understand that when such a large amount is involved it is felt that very complete information should be available before proceeding on any plan that might prove unworkable in the future. It may even be necessary to send a qualified electrical engineer to Beauval to survey the situation, but a decision in this regard will not be made until your reply is received.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Residential School,\nBeauval, Sask.\nSeptember 21, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have a copy of your letter to Mr. S. L. Macdonald in connection with equipment for the school here, and am pleased to have the opportunity to answer the Department's questions.\n\nThe estimate made by Father V. Bleau, c.m.j., in a letter to Mr. Macdonald written last November, proves to be very much lower than the quotation made by Dominion Bridge Company. It was made in good faith, but without an adequate knowledge of the probable cost of the equipment required. It did not, moreover, include freight charges to Beauval, which is a part of the Dominion Bridge quotation, and must amount to perhaps $3000 of the total cost.\n\nThe school itself, and the buildings in connection with it, are all wired for electricity. The school authorities have been developing electricity from the water power of the La Plonge river at this site since 1908; and have been using the water power to run a sawmill at the same site for as long a period. The generator and turbine used now for the development of electricity are those originally installed in 1908. They no longer develop enough power for the needs of the school, and the building itself is falling down and must be replaced.\n\nThe site has not been inspected by a qualified engineer; but Mr. J. A. Burnouf of Beauval, who installed the original equipment, was consulted, and also Brother Beaudoin of the School staff, who has been working in water power since his youth in Quebec, and has had here at Beauval a continuous experience of 14 years using the water power of the La Plonge river; and also Brother Gauthier, who installed the water power development at McIntosh School. Although these men are not qualified engineers they have had a great deal of experience with water power and their opinions could be relied on.\n\nThe dam at Lake La Plonge, four miles from the School, was built to keep a surplus of water in the lake for power development at the school during dry years. The dam at the school provides a fall of 14 feet, which could easily be made 16 feet if it were necessary, according to level instrument.\n\nThe dams were built to keep a head of water for use in generating electricity, and this has been done at considerable expense. The only other purpose for which the power is used is to operate a sawmill during about ten days in the spring of the year, when seepage from the surrounding muskegs provides enough water to operate the mill and the\nGenerator both, at a time when the school is only using light for about one hour at night. There has been no trouble due to insufficient water. The piping to the generator in use now is 24\", and we would suggest that 24\" or 30\" piping be used in the new equipment, between dam and turbine.\n\nDevelopment of power by both steam plant and Diesel engine have been considered, but these methods had numerous disadvantages. The cost of buying, freighting, and installing a boiler would be large; its operation would require the continual services of an engineer, and would be an ever-present source of danger in the hands of an inexperienced or careless man. Cordwood is available in the vicinity of the school but quantities of it are used yearly for fuel, and there is no long-time assurance of a supply of it because of the simple fact that, as during the present year, forest fires are continually laying waste thousands of acres of timber through the north and at any time may destroy our own supplies. Hauling and cutting of cordwood would also be a continual expense. It was also the opinion of the school authorities that a steam plant would not last as long as a turbine.\n\nAs for the Diesel engine, this would again entail the yearly expense of an engineer qualified to run it, and the cost of fuel oil would be prohibitive, since the school is situated 120 miles from railhead at Big River by winter freight road, or 200 miles by waterways, and freight charges would be from $1.25 to $1.75 per hundred pounds.\n\nIt is possible that the turbine may cost more than either steam or Diesel power to install, but we believe that it will be both safer and less expensive in the long run. We do not see any reason why it might prove unworkable in the future. The Episcopal Corporation of Kaswatin has spent money to build up dams to provide a sufficient head of water, and they have long been ready to cooperate with the Department on this matter. You can be assured that the matter has been thoroughly considered. It would be advisable to send a supervisor to take charge of the installation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. B. Saguenay, M.D.\nF. A. Gagnon, C.M.I.\n(Principal)\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nHowever as the Expenditure is so large, I certainly would not like to be responsible for any error in either Equipment or Installation and I do not think there is anyone at the school qualified, they have some good Mechanics but this is specializing and I would certainly recommend that a qualified Engineer be sent there to verify or correct any chance of errors, before any definite action is taken and this should be at an early date or before freeze up approximately Oct 20th, after which all plane traffic is tied up till Skees can be used, also while there is open water he would have a better chance to measure the flow. There is a considerable Drop from the lake to the school and all of 30 feet more at plant and into the Beaver River.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Department letter 132-1-5, Sept 14th 1937, re Equipment for the Water Power at Beauval School. The Estimate as sent in by the Principal was as I understand based on prices he had received from some manufacturing Co and is certainly far the figures of the Dominion Bridge Co.\n\nNo.1. The School is all wired and has been operating from Water Tower for years.\n\nNo.2. No expert was called in to my knowledge and I am under the impression that the requirements were made by the School Mechanic and Principal with the help of Mr Bourneuf and Ex-brother and also Mechanical Expert who installed the present System.\n\nNo.3. No Head of Water I could not give, but La Plonge is a large lake and they have a Dam built last year at the mouth of the River about 3 Miles from the School and another at the Lower Plant, I do not however think that there is any possible fear of water shortage and they have used this for all Purposes including a Mill for over 25 years to my knowledge.\n\nNo.4. Covered in above.\n\nNo.5. An Oil burning outfit up there would be costly, as transportation costs are heavy. There is unlimited wood, however with the perfect supply of water tower which once installed, runs practically at no cost, and within 100 yards of the buildings, any other system would be out of Place.\n\nThe Church Authorities have just transferred the Rev Fr Bleau to Cross Lake, Man., and Rev F.X.Cagno, former principal has again taken over, but apparently intends to go ahead with the plans from a letter just received from him. I am leaving for Beauval and Canoe Lake on Sunday Sept 26th and will take this up further while there.\nOttawa, October 21, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department received your letter of September 24th, also Reverend Father Gagnon's letter of September 21st in connection with the water power plant at the Beauval Indian Residential School. The contents of both these letters were very carefully considered, but, in view of the large expenditure that is necessary, our engineers consider that it is undesirable to take any action without first sending an engineer to look over the whole situation.\n\nFrom the information contained in the latter part of your letter it is now considered too late in the year to send an engineer. Arrangements will, however, be made to send an engineer early in the Spring. Please let me know the earliest date in the Spring that weather conditions will likely permit an engineer reaching the Beauval school. It should be understood that we wish this officer to be at Beauval when the lake is opened in order that he may obtain water levels and other necessary data.\n\nProvision is being made in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1938-39 for necessary funds in order that, in the event of our engineer reporting favorably, money will be available.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nS.L.

The Beauval School is wired for electricity and the electric plant at present in use is being operated by water power.\n\nAlthough several letters have been written both to the Indian Agent and to the principal we have been unable to secure sufficiently definite information regarding exactly what is required to improve the lighting system at this school. I understand that we\nshould have information regarding the present capacity of the lighting plant and the additional amount of electricity required. It is also important to know if the head of water in the lake is sufficient to operate the plant which the school management has been requesting the Department to supply.\n\nI believe it is advisable to have a competent person visit this school and report fully on what is required and I would appreciate if you would arrange to have one of your officers go to Beauval at an early date for that purpose.\n\nI understand that he can fly from Prince Albert. I am informed that there is open water at Beauval about May 15.\n\nDirector.\nThis plant is entirely too small for the load connected, and could not be used in conjunction with a new plant. At best it could be repaired and used as a standby in case of a shut-down in the new plant.\n\nThe dam at the proposed power site is of concrete, and quite suitable in its present condition for the proposed power development. A head of twenty feet can be obtained with a penstock three hundred and forty (340) feet in length and with this head, and the water available, the power required for the school can be developed.\n\nThere are 76,000 acre feet available with a one foot draw off and this amount of water would operate the plant for five years; or, if the lake should increase its elevation approximately two inches during the summer months, there would be sufficient water to operate the plant for one year and still maintain the present elevation.\n\nThe only doubtful factor is the possibility of freezing of the outlet at the lake, but Father Gagnon assured me that this did not happen, and the danger of this happening could be eliminated by deepening the channel.\n\nI am satisfied that the hydro-electric plant would be the most satisfactory installation, and that the expense of operating and upkeep would be very small for this location.\n\nAs an alternative there is the Diesel electric plant. The cost of installing such a plant would be much less, approximately $5,000.00, but the cost of fuel at the plant makes this almost prohibitive. The cost of Diesel fuel at Prince Albert is about 2\u00bd per gallon, and the cost of transportation to Beauval would be at least 10\u00a2 per gallon. To this would be added the cost of non-returnable drums which would bring the cost of the oil to at least 35\u00a2 per gallon winter transportation. This would be 50% higher in summer, or 45\u00a2 per gallon. This would bring the cost of fuel to operate a Diesel plant twelve (12) hours a day to about $1,500.00 a year.\n\nAnother alternative is the steam plant. The cost of installation of such a plant would be higher than the Diesel and would require the services of an experienced man continually. The cost of operating this type of plant would be higher than the Diesel plant.\n\nPresent connected load at Beauval Residential School:\n\nSchool and Chapel ........................................... 200 - 60 Watt lam\nFather's Residence, barns, chicken-house,\nworkshop and store houses ......................... 100 - 60 \" \"\nPresent connected load, about 24 H.P.\n\nMotors required-\nWashing machines .......................... 2 H.P. motors\nCream separator .............................. \u00bd H.P. \"\nDough mixer .................................. 1 H.P. \"\nWork shop ..................................... 5 H.P. \"\nPump motor .................................... 5 H.P. \"\n\nThe total connected load will be about 38 H.P.\nThere is no solid rock for foundations at the power house site\u2014mostly earth and boulders.

E. Smith\nChief Operator, Cascade Power Plant\nBanff, Alberta,\nJune 21st, 1938.\n\nREPORT ON PROPOSED HYDRO ELECTRIC PLANT\nAT BEAUVAL, SASKATCHEWAN.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been to Beauval, Saskatchewan and inspected the site of the proposed Hydro electric plant there.\n\nThe source of water supply for the proposed plant is Lac la Plonge, elevation 1476, with an area of approximately 120 square miles.\n\nThe supply of water to this lake is from surrounding muskeg and some small creeks. Some years ago this lake had its regular spring floods, but for the past three years, on account of the dry seasons experienced in the North, there has been no spring flood of any account. When the school authorities noticed this they constructed a dam at the only outlet, La Plonge Creek, to control the flow, and have been successful in maintaining the present elevation for the past few years.\n\nNo raise in the water level of the lake had been recorded this year up to June 2nd, but Father Gagnon claims that with some rain and warmer weather the water level of the lake should become somewhat higher this season.\n\nI installed a gauge at the dam and they will take readings from time to time and report what is happening.\n\nThe approach to the outlet has a depth at present of at least three feet, and could easily be increased to four feet at small expense. This, I was assured, would be taken care of by the school authorities. The dam at the outlet is well constructed - concrete piers in the main stream with earth approach, and the flow to the creek is controlled by a well constructed sluice gate. Conditions at the present time would allow at least one foot of water to be drawn from the lake. Beauval Residential School is situated on La Plonge Creek about four and one-half miles downstream from Lac la Plonge, and the school has constructed a second dam to form a suitable fore-bay for the operation of the present plant.\n\nThe present plant consists of a small vertical type water wheel belted to a 3Kw. D.C. generator operating at a head of fourteen feet; there is no governor to control the speed, the voltage being very irregular, and the lights poor.\n\nThis plant ..........\n\nC.M. Walker, Esq.,\nSupervising Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Service,\nBanff, Alberta.\nJuly 9, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle,\n\nRe - Beauval Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to Dr. McGill's memorandum of April 29th last on File I.A. 132-1-5 herewith, I am attaching two copies of Chief Operator Smith's report on the proposed hydro-electric plant at Beauval, Sask.\n\nIt will be noted that the project is considered to be quite feasible and that the generating plant and a centrifugal pump can be installed at an estimated cost of a little over $9000.00. While the capital cost per H.P. is higher than would be the case with a Diesel or steam installation, the annual operating costs would be much lower and if prices tendered on this equipment are in reasonable agreement with Mr. Smith's estimate, I would recommend that the hydro-electric type of plant be installed. Since only $4000.00 has been provided for this purpose, the availability of additional funds would also be a controlling factor.\n\nAnother question that arises and has not been included in Mr. Smith's estimate is the motors, of which there are five varying from \u00bd H.P. to 5 H.P., but possibly the School Authorities would be willing to supply and install these at their own expense. However, Mr. Smith is being asked to furnish an estimate of the cost of these motors installed and of any additional switchboard equipment that may be required to operate them. This information will be forwarded to you as soon as it is available here.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nT.G. Mills\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nJuly 12, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nRe - Beauval Indian Residential School.\n\nI am forwarding herewith a copy of a memorandum from the Chief Engineer, together with a report prepared by Mr. E. Smith, Chief Operator of the Power Plant at Banff.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Smith recommends the installation of a hydro-electric plant at a cost of something over $9,000; also that the alternatives of a Diesel or steam installation, although entailing a much lower initial expenditure, would call for heavy annual upkeep. It is also noted that a sum of $4,000 has been provided this year, and I should be glad if you would advise if further funds are available should you decide on the hydro-electric installation.\n\nYour file covering Beauval Residential School is returned herewith.\n\nDirector.\n12th August, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Beauval Indian Residential School.\n\nFurther to my memorandum of the 12th ultimo with which a copy of a memorandum from the Chief Engineer was forwarded giving particulars of the report of Mr. E. Smith, Chief Operator of the Power Plant at Banff, on the Hydro Electric Plant at Beauval, it was stated therein that details of the cost of the motors installed would be forwarded to you when available.\n\nWe have now received a report giving the costs as follows,\n\n| Description                          | Cost   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|\n| 2 - 2 H.P.

The closest railway station is Big River, Saskatchewan, which is 150 miles from the school.\n\nRight Reverend M. Lajeunesse, O.M.I., Bishop of Keewatin, in whose diocese the Beauval School is located, has brought to the Department's attention on several occasions during the last two or three years the necessity for making improvements to the Hydro electric plant. This was originally built by the school management but has now worn out and as a result is of little use.\n\nIn our appropriation for the current fiscal year an amount of $4,000.00 was provided for new electrical equipment. From the correspondence that we had received it was difficult to decide exactly what was required and consequently arrangements were made with the Surveys & Engineering Branch to have a qualified man proceed to Beauval. I enclose a copy of Mr. Wardle's memorandum of July 12, also the report of Mr. E. Smith who visited Beauval in June.\nYou will note from this report that he states that an expenditure of $8,150.00 will be necessary to ensure complete satisfaction. As stated above $4,000.00 is specifically provided in the current year's appropriation for this work and the balance necessary can be obtained from the item in our estimates providing for unforeseen expenditures.\n\nUndoubtedly immediate improvement of the lighting facilities at this school are necessary. The Beauval school which has always done good work is situated in an isolated location where a proper electric system is very necessary. I would, therefore, appreciate receiving the authority of the Honourable the Minister for the expenditure recommended by the engineer of the Surveys & Engineering Branch. For your information I also enclose a copy of Indian Agent Macdonald's report regarding his inspection of the school on June 1.\n\nActing Director.\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, the drainage area is approximately 400 square miles and with an average run-off of 0.3 c.f.s. per square mile the supply should be more than ample for the proposed development.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 20, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Beauval Indian Residential School\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your memoranda of July 12 and August 12 in connection with the proposed installation of a Hydro electric plant at the above-mentioned school.\n\nWe have now received the approval of the Honourable the Minister for the expenditure that you report in your memoranda is necessary. As you are able to give the necessary detailed information to the Purchasing Branch I would appreciate it if you would arrange for the purchase of the equipment that will be required.

It appears from Mr. Smith's memorandum that the Reverend Principal will supply, without cost to the Department, all labour required on the job.\n\nEven though it is too late to do any actual work in connection with the foundation for the powerhouse I trust that you will arrange for the purchase of all the equipment as we wish to pay for it out of the current year's appropriation.\n\nThe nearest railway station to the school is Big River, Saskatchewan.\n\nDirector.\n3rd October, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Beauval Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 20th September in which you list materials required for the hydro-electric plan at Beauval residential school and in which you ask to have the equipment purchased and whatever work can be done arranged for as soon as possible in order that it may be paid for from this year's appropriation, I am advised by the Chief Engineer that he has forwarded a request to his Banff office asking for specifications for the equipment and information as to whether or not any work could be undertaken this year. As soon as a report has been received you will be advised.\n\nDirector.\nNovember 13, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nRe - Beauval Indian Residential School.\n\nThere are certain points relative to the proposed hydro-electric installation at the above School which should be cleared up before the equipment is purchased. The specifications have been completed and a requisition has been sent to the Purchasing Agent asking him to call for quotations.\n\nThe use of water from Lac la Plonge and from the La Plonge Creek for hydro-electric purposes would, if the project were entirely new, be subject to the approval of the Natural Resources Department of the Province of Saskatchewan. It is noted, however, that a dam was constructed some time ago at the lake outlet and that the School has already constructed another dam, with forebay, on La Plonge Creek in the vicinity of the School buildings. Will you kindly advise me if any authority was obtained from the Province for the erection of these two dams and under what financial arrangements they were erected. If the dam at Lac la Plonge was erected prior to the transfer of natural resources, the School authorities may have obtained the permission of the Federal Government, although there are no records in this connection in our Dominion Water Power Bureau.\n\nThe estimated cost of the list of equipment contained in Mr. Smith's report, exclusive of motors, is $9,150. It is noted that no specific mention is made of the cost of the necessary surge tank and if this has not\nincluded in Mr. Smith's estimate, the estimated cost, at the present time, would approximate $9,500. However, Mr. Smith's estimated cost for the wood stave penstock seems liberal and possibly the cost of the surge tank is included in this figure.\n\nWhile Mr. Smith mentions in his report that Father Gagnon assured him that the School would supply all labour and material for the foundation work, laying of penstock, etc., and in fact all labour required, I think it essential that you communicate with the School authorities and have confirmation of this arrangement in writing. Father Gagnon should be advised that the work to be done will include the installation and erection of all equipment, including turbine, generator, penstock, etc., and that this represents a very considerable amount of labour, some of which must be highly skilled, particularly in regard to the installation of turbine, generator, switchboard, etc. We will arrange to supply an Engineer to supervise the installation and will expect the School to provide him with board and accommodation. According to our understanding, all other assistance, including foreman, skilled labour and common labour, together with necessary construction equipment, will be furnished by the School authorities. A suitable hand-operated derrick or crane will be necessary to handle the heavy castings of the turbine and the generator, etc.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would communicate with Father Gagnon on the above points as these matters should be definitely settled before any order is placed.\n\nIt is noted that the Department will assume the cost of freighting the equipment from Big River to Beauval and which will be undertaken in the winter months.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Beauval Indian Residential School\n\nOn receipt of your memorandum of November 18 with reference to the proposed hydro electric installation at the above school I immediately wrote to the Principal.\n\nI am now in receipt of the following reply dated December 10, 1938:\n\n\"I am sorry, I could not answer your letter of the 24th ultimo any sooner, for the simple fact that after freeze up, the first mail was received only on the 6th of December. However, wishing to co-operate with you to install the new hydro electric plant in Beauval, I am giving you the following information:\n\n\"1. Dams.\n\nThe first dam, on the La Plonge Creek, with a forebay was constructed in 1904, by the Beauval R.C. Mission, therefore having the rights of the first occupant.\n\nThe second at the outlet of La Plonge Lake was erected in 1935 with the authority of C.J. McGavin, chief engineer of Water Rights, Department of Natural Resources, of Regina, Sask. This dam as well as the first one was erected by the R.C. Mission at Beauval and all expenses were paid by the said Mission. The use of the...\"\ndams will be for the school. Therefore, there will never be any trouble arising from it. This is a friendly co-operation between the Church and the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\n2. New electric plant.\n\nThe report made by Mr. E. Smith is O.K. The management of the school is ready to co-operate with the Indian Affairs Branch for the construction as well as for the installation of this plant.\n\nThe school will provide the engineer with board and accommodation. I would appreciate very much, if Mr. E. Smith would be given a chance to come and supervise the work.\n\nAlso, the school will provide foreman, skilled labour, common labour, together with the necessary construction equipment, including a suitable hand-operated derrick.\n\nOnce more, I take the liberty to thank you very much for your co-operation in making it possible to have a new electric plant in Beauval, which was badly needed since the destruction of the former shop.\"\n\nI trust that the above is the information you require and that immediate arrangements will be made to purchase the equipment in order that it may be shipped to the school early in 1939 which will permit us to pay for it out of the current fiscal year's appropriation.\n\nDirector.\nIndian Residential School.\nBeauval Sask., Jan. 2 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFile no. 24567-15-20-1\n\nPlease find enclosed 5 copies of the invoice from Singer Sewing Machine Co. covering the purchase of a sewing machine which was kindly bought for the Beauval Indian School.\n\nThe invoice is certified correct by myself.\n\nMay I tell you that I appreciate very much this gift, which will be a great help to the Rev.

Ostrander,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will find enclosed three copies of an invoice from the C.A. Dunham Co. of Toronto, covering the purchase of thirty-eight radiator traps, which were bought for the Indian Residential School at Beauval, Sask., and I kindly ask you to forward these invoices to the Indian Affair Branch for payment for the following reasons:\n\nWhen the heating system was put up at the school, it was late in the fall, at a time when communications were absolutely impossible. Then the contractor noticed that these traps were short, so he simply had to complete the work without them. Things went on since, but the residents of the most remote rooms from the boiler room were always complaining about cold, while in the center it was too hot.\n\nThis fall, I just happened to meet a steampipe fitter to whom I exposed my problem and after having examined the heating system, he simply told me that I had to get these traps in order to regulate the heat.\n\nSo I purchased same immediately to permit him to finish the work before leaving. He even made 5 floats and thermostatic traps at the end of the mains, thus saving the Indian Affair Branch about $400.00.

While the order was placed by the Principal of the School and has apparently been billed at retail prices, this account is payable from Dominion Department of Mines and Resources funds. We find the prices you have charged on your invoice #177 high, as on plumbing supplies and other equipment, wholesale houses usually allow our Department a substantial discount or wholesale prices. We would suggest your favourable consideration of our request that you submit to this office revised invoices (5 copies) billing the goods at wholesale prices, or at a discount of at least 20%.\n\nIf you can see your way clear to do this, we will be pleased to arrange for prompt payment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.J.

(RG 10, Volume 6301, file 650-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nBattleford, Sask.,\n6th July, 1943.\n\nI beg to submit my report on the reserves of treaty 10 and treaty trip made to those reserves during the month of June, 1943.\n\nBeauval Indian Residential School\n\nA day was spent at this school and, as usual, everything was in the best of order. The children are healthy, happy and receiving an excellent training for their future lives. There are the very best kind of teachers in the three class rooms and the children make wonderful progress under their tuition. The writing, reading and rapid calculation of the boys in the older room would put most white boys to shame; the other rooms are almost equally good. The school has a large herd of well-bred Shorthorn cattle, which are used for both meat and dairy products. There is milk and butter in abundance for the use of the children. A large garden provides vegetables throughout the year. The school farm produces wheat, oats and barley, all used on the premises. The oats and barley for cattle and hog feed and the wheat for feed and for making flour, which is done on the premises with a flour mill operated by the school. The whole management of this school reflects honour upon the Principal, Reverend Father Gagnon.\n\nFather Gagnon is a great missionary, but he is, in addition, a great business man, with vision and imagination, willing to try anything which promises to promote the best interests of the school and the welfare of the Indian children. A large herd of cattle, hogs and horses receive daily care by the Indian boys, who also assist in operating the flour-mill, saw-mill and all farm machinery, in season. The lighting plant is operated by water-power, as is also the saw-mill, and the cost of operation of each is almost nothing. There is a large flock of chickens which keep the school supplied with fresh eggs. These, also, are under the care of the boys of the school.\n\nThe girls are taught cooking, baking, sewing, knitting, carding, spinning and weaving, as well as bead-work and silk work for ornaments of their own choosing. I notice an air of happiness and good will amongst the children and between the children and the school staff, which speaks well.\nof their relationship at all times.\n\nThe school buildings are in good repair. The main school building is almost completely fire-proof. An evidence of this is shown by the fact that lightning struck the school last year and came into one of the rooms at night. The scorched wall was found in the morning and can still be seen, but no fire resulted.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Residential School,\nBeauval Sask., August 3, 1943.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nTwo years ago, the district manager of the Singer Sewing Machine Co. of Battleford, Mr. Joseph Dowling, while visiting his district, dropped at the school and looked over all the sewing machines, repaired some but four of them were not worth repairing.\n\nUp to now, I have been unable to secure any new machines through the proper channel. Therefore, I am sending my request directly to you, hoping it will receive better consideration.\n\nSo, in order to keep up the training of Indian girls, we need:\n\n4 only Singer Sewing Machines style 15-88.\n\nWith the war on, it has become almost impossible to get any repairs for the school and farm machineries for the following reasons: slow mail service, lack of communication at certain times of the year, great distance from the end of the rail, war restrictions, scarcity of repairs.\n\nTo obviate all these inconveniences, I would require one Electric Welder, capable of cutting 1\" steel boiler plates, complete with accessories, rods, etc.\n\nWe have free electricity and a good mechanic. The generator is A.C., 25Kva, 110-220 volts, 60 cycles, 3 phase. I hope this request will be taken into consideration, as it would be a great benefit to the school and also in helping to solve partly the food shortage situation, by repairing trucks and tractors used to haul fish in winter time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.X.

It was a Gaar-Scott, 25 H.P., type L.T.\n\nAs mentioned, in my previous letter, the new boiler would not have to be so powerful, one 15 to 20 H.P. would take care of our present needed power to supply steam to the laundry.\n\nHoping these informations will be satisfactory, I conclude by saying that the Rev.

You should also state if a vertical or horizontal boiler is preferable. We also wish to know the size of the room (three dimensions) in which the boiler will be placed. Will any fittings be needed? What would be the distance between the boiler and the chimney?\n\nIn your letter of March 6 you stated that the Saskatchewan Boiler Inspector had requested that the present boiler be discarded. We do not appear to have received any copy of his report in this regard and I should appreciate it if you would forward it to me. This will assist us in pointing out the necessity for supplying a new boiler at the present time. You realize, of course, that these are very difficult to secure under present conditions and consequently any recommendation from the Boiler Inspector is very important.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. F.X.

As the safety valve, water gauge and injector from the discarded boiler are still good, no fittings would be required.\n\nYou will also find enclosed herewith a letter from the Saskatchewan Boiler Inspector advising us to discontinue the use of this boiler.

This condition has existed approximately from December 15, 1942, to May 15, 1943, and also during the period December 15, 1943, to May 15, 1944. As a consequence there is no water to operate the turbines which supply the electrical power for the school.\n\nThe Department feels that it is important to have an engineer visit this school at the earliest possible date, with a view to determining if anything can be done to overcome the condition mentioned above. It would, therefore, be appreciated if you would arrange to have one of your engineers visit the school as soon as possible and submit a report regarding what action he considers could be taken.\n\nIn connection with the power plant at this school, I would refer you to your memorandum of August 31, 1938, and correspondence previous to that date.\n\nDirector.\nBattleford, Sask.\nMarch 29th, 1944.\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources, Indian Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\nTreasury Office.\n\nReferring to your letter No. 132-1-5 of the 10th inst.\nRev. Father F.X. Gagnon, Beauval, writes me as follows:\n\n\"As to the returnable drum to Sherrin Williams Co., Ltd., re Voucher No. 316 dated October 28, 1942, which was not returned. I may say that I still have the drum and as it is not empty so far, I could not return it. However, as soon as we could get hold of another drum, I will have it emptied and returned.\"\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 28th, 1944.\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Beauval Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of May 18th and on looking over our files in this matter, it would appear from an earlier report of Mr. E. Smith, Chief Operator of the Cascade Power Plant, who installed the turbines, electrical equipment at this school in August 1939, that the school is situated on the creek which flows from Lac La Plonge about 4\u00bd miles downstream from the outlet of the lake.\n\nMr. Smith reported that the approach to the outlet of the lake where there is a dam had a depth of only 3 or 4 feet. He considered that conditions would permit of, at least, one foot of water being drawn from the lake. He made no report on the 4\u00bd miles of creek between the outlet of the lake and the school.\n\nMr. Smith foresaw the possibility of trouble arising from freezing at the outlet of the lake but Father Gagnon assured him that this did not happen.\n\nHowever, it would seem possible, particularly if the outflow from the lake has diminished considerably, that in a severe winter either the outlet of the lake or shallow stretches of the creek may freeze solid to the bottom,\n\n(over) .......\nand this could cut off water supply to the turbine. To correct this, it would be necessary to investigate the entire length of the creek between the lake and the school and wherever necessary, deepen it to five or six feet, which might prove to be a major undertaking.\n\nWe had not planned to have an Engineer in that area in the near future, but this matter will be borne in mind so that if opportunity should occur, an investigation will be made.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nMay 30, 1944.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWith reference to the Beauval Indian Residential School, the Surveys & Engineering Branch was written on the 18th instant in connection with the difficulty of operating the turbines during the winter. We are advised that, while they had not planned to have an engineer in the Beauval area in the near future, they will keep the matter in mind and as soon as opportunity offers an investigation will be made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

It took considerable time to reach me, because it went to Regina first they returned it to me at Prince Albert.\n\nRe: Your Gear Scott Boiler #6119.\n\nFrom your explanation in your letter I would say that it is impossible to do anything with a welding torch as the expansion and contraction is so great that you can't keep it from cracking. I have had several boilers like that of late that went the same way and had to be discarded. So my advice to you is to discontinue the use of same, as we would not like to have anything happen in the way of explosions.\n\nIf you are stuck for a boiler, there are quite a lot of good second hand boilers that can be picked up pretty reasonable and could be freighted in during the Winter months. The boiler could be stripped down which would make it easy to handle.

(RG 10, Volume 6301, file 650-5, part 5)\nDuring the past three winters the power for the School and Mission has been generated from a belt connection to a diesel tractor which the mission have on hand. I understand from Father Cegnon that this was barely satisfactory and involved a number of difficulties other than depriving the mission of the use of the tractor. The domestic supply during the first two of the last three years was obtained by hauling it from a spring located below the pump house. Lac Winter's concrete well was constructed into which the spring flowed, and the water was pumped from there to the storage tank at the school. This tank has a capacity of 2000 gallons and in case of fire, this arrangement would not be adequate; also there is evidence at present of the spring drying up to some slight extent.\n\nDismissing the idea of piping the water from above the upper control dam as either too costly or not dependable, there appears to be only two other solutions to the situation which has developed.\n\nThere is the possibility of creating a reservoir above the power dam with sufficient pondage to operate the power unit and meet domestic requirements during the four months when the supply from Lac Le Plonge is cut off. I do not believe it would be good policy to raise the level at the present dam with this in mind. This scheme, therefore, even if otherwise practical, would involve the prospect of building another dam, also the water thus impounded may not prove suitable for domestic supply.\n\nThe only scheme that seems practical and which the writer would recommend at the present time, would be the installation of a diesel unit. While the transportation difficulties that exist here would make the problem of bringing in fuel rather expensive, it would only be necessary to resort to this source of power for four months of the year. The diesel would also be on hand for emergency operation during other periods. The problem of domestic supply during the winter months, while barely adequate, could be managed. There is also a good prospect of the situation remedying itself later.\n\nI have secured all the necessary field data required for the plans in connection with the issuing of a Provincial License, and will send the plans as soon as they are completed.\n\n(Sgd.) K.B.Andre,\nK.B.Andre,\nAssistant Engineer.\n\nT.S.Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Service,\nOttawa, Ont.\nJasper, Alberta,\nAugust 25th, 1944.\n\nRe - Investigation Beausel Indian Residential School.\n\nThe situation that currently exists during the winter months at the Beausel School and Mission is a lack of water for both the domestic requirements and the hydroelectric development. This situation has existed for the past three winters, and has been caused by freezing at the outlet of Lac Le Plonge, thus cutting off the water which previously found its way down River Le-Plonge.\n\nThe freezing is by no means a purely local condition and occurs not only at the outlet, but also for some considerable distance out into the lake. The freezing usually commences several hundred feet out from the outlet and gradually works in to the control dam which is approximately quarter of a mile down the river from its junction with the lake.\n\nThese conditions did not exist until three years ago, up until which time the water in Lac Le Plonge was at least 2\u00bd feet higher than it is at present. As a result of this lower water level there is now no depth of water greater than 2\u00bd feet within 1500 feet of the outlet into River Le Plonge with the result that this whole area freezes solid during the cold weather. It is not a case of a sandbar or other obstruction impeding the flow and alterations in the construction at the control dam would not remedy the situation. The lowering of Lac Le Plonge can in no way be attributed to the negligible amount of water which is allowed through the control dam down River Le Plonge, as the sluice gate at the control dam is kept constantly closed except in the spring and on the other brief periods during which the sawmill is in operation. River Le-Plonge has a few small feeder streams and these supply sufficient water for both power and domestic supply. They cannot, however, be depended upon during the cold weather or very dry seasons.\n\nThe only remedy the writer could suggest for this freezing condition would be to pipe the water from the deeper portion of the lake past the upper control dam to a point where the bed of the river assumes a gradient sufficient to allow the water to flow freely. The upper section of River Le Plonge in the vicinity of the control dam is, in places not less than 5 feet wide and one foot deep. This remedy would not, in my opinion, be a very feasible engineering operation. It would require a minimum of $2000 for the pipe and disregarding the difficulties involved and expense attached to such an undertaking, there is no assurance that the level of Lac Le Plonge will not recede still farther, thus rendering the scheme useless. Lac Le Plonge has not a large drainage area, and forest fires in recent years have exposed most of the surrounding country. This may account partially for the lowering in the lake level, although precipitation in this district during the past three years has been subnormal. As an alternative to laying a pipe, there would be the prospect of digging an open channel out to deeper water. It would be impractical to attempt this without equipment which I am certain could not be brought in to this location.\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Beauval Indian Residential School\n\nIn reference to your notation on Dr. McGill's memorandum of July 20th last regarding the water supply at the above school, we are attaching two copies of a report prepared by Mr. K. B. Andr\u00e9 following an inspection made during the period August 11th to 18th, 1944.\n\nMr. Andr\u00e9 states that until three years ago, the level of Lac La Plonge was at least 2\u00bd feet higher than at present, and that there is now no depth of water greater than 2\u00bd feet within 1500 feet of the outlet into La Plonge river. This area freezes solid to the bottom in winter cutting off the flow to the river and to the hydro-electric plant.\n\nThe lowering of the lake level is said to be due to sub-normal rainfall and not to any wasteful operation of the control dam, as the sluice is only opened when the sawmill is being operated and in winter. At other times there is a sufficient flow from some small streams entering the river below the control dam, but these cannot be depended on in cold weather or very dry seasons.\n\nThe excavation of a channel to deeper water in the lake is not feasible owing to the expense involved and the difficulty of taking suitable equipment over the road from Meadow Lake to Beauval, nor does the raising of the dam at the power plant to create sufficient storage to operate during the winter appear to be an attractive proposition.\n\nDuring the past three winters when this low water condition has obtained the school authorities have operated the generator by a belt drive from their Diesel tractor. In this way they were able to carry on, but at the loss of the use of the tractor for other purposes.\n\nUnder the circumstances, Mr. Andr\u00e9 recommends that a Diesel engine be installed to operate the generator when the water supply is insufficient during the winter or in emergencies during other periods. We concur in this recommendation, and would suggest that, as was done at the McIntosh school when the penstock was being replaced, a used truck or automobile engine together with the necessary pulleys and belting be purchased, and installed by the school authorities. At McIntosh, the Department paid $60.00 for the pulleys and belting, and $100.00 for a used automobile engine. The school purchased the engine and installed it.\n\nEnclos:\nJ. H.

Andre of our engineering staff from August 11th to 13th last and I am forwarding herewith, for your information, a copy of Mr. Andre's report of August 25th and a copy of a memorandum, dated September 15th from Mr. Mills in which he summarizes Mr. Andre's findings.\n\nYou will note that the basic trouble is the lowering of the water level in Lake La Plonge to the extent that the maximum depth of water within 1500 feet of the outlet into the river is only 2\u00bd feet. As a result this section of the lake freezes solid in the winter months cutting off the flow of water to the river and to the hydro-electric plant. Any works directed to obtaining a greater depth of water would be too costly for consideration and the best solution seems to be that recommended by Mr. Andre and mentioned in the last paragraph of Mr. Mills' memorandum. This is an installation of an auxiliary engine to deliver 30 h.p. and which will drive the generator over the winter months when no water is available for hydro-electric operations. You will note from Mr. Mills' memorandum that a used automobile engine will be satisfactory if a suitable one could be obtained.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 27, 1944.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Surveys & Engineering Branch have reported regarding Mr. Andre's inspection of the water supply at your school. The report reads in part as follows:\n\n\"The lowering of the lake level is said to be due to sub-normal rainfall and not to any wasteful operation of the control dam, as the sluice is only opened when the sawmill is being operated and in winter. At other times there is a sufficient flow from some small streams entering the river below the control dam, but these cannot be depended on in cold weather or very dry seasons.\n\n\"The excavation of a channel to deeper water in the lake is not feasible owing to the expense involved and the difficulty of taking suitable equipment over the road from Meadow Lake to Beauval, nor does the raising of the dam at the power plant to create sufficient storage to operate during the winter appear to be an attractive proposition.\n\n\"During the past three winters when this low water condition has obtained the school authorities have operated the generator by a belt drive from their Diesel tractor.

At McIntosh, the Department paid $50.00 for the pulleys and belting, and $100.00 for a used automobile engine.\"\n\nYou will note from the above that the Surveys & Engineering Branch recommend an expenditure of approximately $150.00. It is possible that you may have to pay slightly more than this amount. In any case I think it would be preferable for you to arrange the purchase of the automobile engine locally and also secure the pulleys and belting necessary. The season is advancing and local purchase will enable you to secure the items at the earliest possible date and have them installed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

At McIntosh, it was for a short period, while at Beauval for the last 3 winters, from the middle of November to the end of April, we had to use the Diesel tractor and this year the water level is still lower than the previous years. Therefore, I think that it would be pretty expensive to run a truck or automobile motor for such a long period.\n\nIn the meantime, I have tried to locate some used Diesel tractor engines that were discarded by farmers some years ago, but until now I have not been able to locate any.\n\nHowever, I was told that the Department of Fisheries at Ottawa had some idle Diesel engines at Coronation Island and Churchill and also with the closing of Air Training Centres, your purchase agent might be able to locate one of these Diesel engines.\n\nIn the meantime, I take this opportunity to thank you very much for the attention given to our request.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.X.

It would be preferable to have the generator slightly over-powered rather than under-powered and the used engine mentioned by Principal Gagnon may, or may not, be capable of delivering its rated horse power, all depending on the condition in which it has been maintained, of which we have no knowledge.\n\nWe concur in the suggestion in the Principal's letter of October 27th last to Mr. Hoey that it might be well for the Departmental Purchasing Agent to attempt to location a suitable Diesel engine if possible.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.

As a result of lowering the water level a section of the lake freezes solid in the winter months, cutting off the flow of water to the river and consequently to the Hydro Electric plant. As a result, no electricity is available at the school during the winter months.\n\nAn official of the Surveys & Engineering Branch has carefully investigated the situation and has recommended that we install an auxiliary engine to deliver 30 horse power. This would drive the generator over the winter months when no water is available for Hydro Electric operations. We have taken the matter up with the Principal of the Beauval School and he states that he has located a good, used, Diesel 40 H.P. motor, which can be secured from Alex Colleaux, 334 - 13th Street West, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, at a price of $600. On receipt of this information from the Principal we again submitted the matter to the Surveys & Engineering Branch and I enclose a copy of their reply. You will recall that we purchased a second-hand steam boiler from the same person in August last -- see your purchase order No. 26061.\n\nAs it is essential that the electric power be available at this school during the winter months\nand as the only way to operate it is by use of an auxiliary engine, we recommend purchase of the Diesel motor mentioned above.\n\nActing Director.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Your suggestion that a second hand automobile motor and generator be purchased and installed to meet the deficiencies of the hydro plant has been considered and found inadequate besides being expensive to operate. It must not be forgotten that discarded automobile motors are all gasoline operated and, on that account, their cost of maintenance is very high. At best, they are only a makeshift. The case of McIntosh to which you refer in your letter cannot be compared to that of Beauval because in the former the interruption in the Hydro service was very temporary as it only lasted a little over two weeks.\n\nThe Beauval situation is quite different because the low water level has now occurred every winter for the past several years and nothing indicates that there will be a change in these conditions in the near future. Consequently, what we have to provide for Beauval is an auxiliary plant on which the school can depend and which will be economical in operation. Only a Diesel power plant can meet these requirements and we sincerely hope that you will consider its purchase favorably. I am sending a copy of this letter to His Exe., Bishop Lajeunesse and you may consider the present request as coming from him personally.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, December 16, 1944.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the lighting plant at the Beauval School.\n\nAs stated in your letter, the Surveys and Engineering Branch originally recommended the use of a second hand automobile motor. Following a letter to the Principal to this effect, he replied along the same lines as your own letter and stated that he could secure a good used Diesel motor from Alex. Colleaux, Prince Albert, for the sum of $800. We submitted this proposal to the Purchasing Branch and they requested that more detailed information be secured regarding the motor suggested by Father Gagnon. Consequently, he was written on December 6 and I enclose copy of this letter, for your information.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J. O.

The best promise of delivery that we can obtain is 48 weeks after receipt of approval and priority rating from the U.S. War Production Board. There is no guarantee that we can secure the latter approval, although we are endeavouring to do so.\n\nHowever, you will note from the above that even though the requisite approval is obtained, it will be nearly a year before the engine would be available.\n\nWe are very anxious to co-operate with you, but, in view of the above circumstances, it occurred to me that possibly some other action could be taken during the summer. I understand that this engine is mainly required during the winter months, when the water level is low. Is there anything you can suggest that we could do to help you?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend F.X.

We both think that it will be hard to find any arrangement this summer. And have no other suggestion to make except that we would use our own tractor for another winter.\n\nThe lake is still low and as we are in the rainy period there is no hope to have water for the coming winter for the turbine. In summer time so far the engine is not needed. There is a fair amount of water.\n\nIf anything would develop during the summer, I will let you know.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. X.

But with the commercial fishing and the extinction of wild meat, the need of a good frigidaire has become a necessity to keep fish during the summer months and also a good supply of good and clean meat.\n\nTherefore, I am asking if at all possible to supply us with a good Frigidaire this summer. And to show you how bad it is needed, his Excellency M. Lajeunesse says that we would be ready to supply the building material and the labor for the job.\n\nTo this effect you will find inclosed herewith a copy of a letter from the J.H. Ashdown Hardware Co., Ltd of Winnipeg, Man., giving the price and specifications of the whole equipment.\n\nI would appreciate very much to receive a favorable answer to give us enough time to put up the building before freezing.\n\nThanking you in advance.\n\nYours very truly:\n\nF.X.

To accomplish this, Frigidaire engineers developed an exclusive design which permits operation at higher temperatures, thereby decreasing moisture removal from the air.\n\nThe design of the \"Moistemp\" cooling units provide extra fin surface at the top where warm air first comes in contact with the fins. This is accomplished through the use of exclusive diamond shaped fins which eliminate all ineffective heat absorbing surface.\n\nAutomatic defrosting during the off period of the compressor is improved due to reduced fin surface at the bottom of the cooling unit, the point where ice or frost accumulation is usually experienced. The shape of the fin with the diamond points downward also aids in faster frost removal from the fins during the defrosting cycle. An additional defrosting aid results due to improved air circulation through the cooling unit.\n\nThe operating efficiency of the Frigidaire \"Moistemp\" cooling units is further improved by the use of the \"wet expansion\" principle of refrigeration. This method assures the entire internal refrigerant tube surface being \"wet\" with liquid refrigerant, thus insuring unusual efficiency in heat removal and economical operation.\n\n| SERIES | Width | Fin Spacing | Cooling Unit Lengths |\n|--------|-------|-------------|----------------------|\n| WX7    |       |             |                      |\n|        | A     | 27-48       | 39-70                |\n|        | B     | 21-55       | 29-77                |\n|        | C     | 17-45       | 24-64                |\n|        | D     | 16-41       | 21-56                |\n| WX11   |       |             |                      |\n|        | A     | 40-72       | 59-106               |\n|        | B     | 31-81       | 43-115               |\n|        | C     | 26-68       | 36-96                |\n|        | D     | 23-61       | 32-85                |\n| WX14   |       |             |                      |\n|        | A     | 54-96       | 79-142               |\n|        | B     | 41-109      | 58-154               |\n|        | C     | 34-91       | 49-129               |\n|        | D     | 31-82       | 43-113               |\n| WX18   |       |             |                      |\n|        | A     | 67-119      | 99-177               |\n|        | B     | 52-137      | 73-192               |\n|        | C     | 43-113      | 61-161               |\n|        | D     | 39-103      | 53-141               |\n| WX21   |       |             |                      |\n|        | A     | 80-143      | 119-212              |\n|        | B     | 62-164      | 87-230               |\n|        | C     | 52-136      | 73-194               |\n|        | D     | 47-123      | 64-170               |\n| WX25   |       |             |                      |\n|        | A     | 94-168      | 139-248              |\n|        | B     | 73-191      | 102-270              |\n|        | C     | 60-159      | 86-226               |\n|        | D     | 54-144      | 75-198               |\n\n*Maximum and minimum capacities are given for each cooling unit, based on performance when installed in accordance with Frigidaire Engineering Standards.

The ends of tubes are joined to upper and lower manifolds, resulting in a maximum tube area being in contact with liquid refrigerant at all times. This \"wet expansion\" principle increases capacity and provides uniform cooling unit temperature as well as lower operating cost. A special baffle in the upper manifold increases heat absorbing ability by maintaining cooling unit in a flooded condition. Baffle feature also reduces possibility of refrigerant line sweating.\n\nMultiple Tube Construction\u2014Refrigerant travel is through several individual tubes rather than one continuous tube. Cooling is faster because less time is required for heat laden refrigerant to pass through the cooling unit to the compressor.\n\nCorrosion-Resisting Tubing\u20143/4\" copper tubing is used to give faster cooling. Electro tin plated to prevent corrosion. Larger diameter of tube reduces frictional pressure drop and improves overall efficiency of the cooling unit. All units are thoroughly cleaned, dehydrated, and sealed to remove moisture and foreign matter which later would affect operation of control valves.\n\nSilver-Soldered Joints\u2014Only silver solder is used on the refrigerant joints of the gravity type cooling units to eliminate the possibility of leaks due to corrosion or electrolytic decomposition. Silver-soldered joints have proved to be stronger than the copper tubing itself.\n\nImproved Circulation\u2014Proper air circulation through the cooling unit is provided by adequate spacing between fin rows. This prevents choking of air circulation and improves the operating efficiency of the cooling unit. Defrosting is also aided by the larger volume of air in contact with the colder, lower portion of the fin.\n\nHydraulic Tube Expansion\u2014A tight metal-to-metal bond between the copper tube and fin is obtained by hydraulically expanding the refrigerant tube into the \"Effect-fin.\" This positive bond assures rapid heat transfer from the fin to the refrigerant filled tube.\n\nIn addition to the \"Moistemp\" Gravity Air Type Cooling Units, Frigidaire also offers a complete line of \"Moistemp\" Forced Air Cooling Units ranging in capacity from 60 pounds to 8 tons of refrigeration per day.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6301, file 650-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n### SPECIFICATIONS\n\n**Frigidaire Low Temperature Vacuum and Hold-Over Plates**\n\n#### HORIZONTAL\u2014SHELF TYPE\n**VACUUM FREEZER PLATES**\n\n| Model | Width | Length | Charge (lbs.)

We submitted this to the Purchasing Branch\nbut in reply they write us as follows:\n\n\"For our assistance in securing competitive\nprices on the refrigeration plant for Beauval, I suggest\nthat engineering advice be obtained with a view to\nsecuring a neutral specification for a plant of suitable\ndesign and capacity.\"\n\nThe dimensions of the room that could be used\nin the Beauval Residential School are as follows:\n\nLength - 23 ft. width - 12\u00bd ft.\nHeight - 9 ft.\n\nElectrical power available - 220 Volts,\n60 cycles, 3 phase, A.C.\n\nIn view of the fact that both Fish and Meat\nhave to be stored, it has been suggested that the\nrefrigeration unit should comprise three compartments -\none for fish, one for meat and one for other articles.\nThe room available is in the basement and I enclose a\nrough sketch showing its location as compared with\nother rooms in the basement.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nNovember 19, 1945.\n\nRe: Refrigeration Plant for Beauval Indian Residential School.\n\nIn accordance with the request from the Director of Indian Affairs in his memorandum to you under date of November 9th, 1945, we are forwarding herewith, six copies of a specification covering the proposed refrigeration plant for the above, for the use of the Departmental Purchasing Agent, in obtaining tenders.\n\nIt is pointed out that if such a plant had been visualized when the building was originally planned, a more convenient location of the Walk-in Cooler Room could have been obtained.\n\nUnder the circumstances there appears to be no alternative to using the space suggested. The mechanical unit of the installation however, must occupy space outside of the refrigerator and it is suggested that a corner of the Pantry near the outside wall, be cleared and used for this purpose.\n\nFrom data submitted in the memorandum, it is evident that a unit having approximately 1 ton of refrigeration capacity will be necessary. This would require a 1 or 2 horsepower motor, depending on the design of the equipment.\n\nThis specification calls for the equipment to be based on the following operating conditions: maintain an inside temperature of 35 degrees F. with an ambient temperature of 85 degrees F. and 80 degrees F. condensing water, the accepted standard for this type of work.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n1. SCOPE OF WORK:\n\nThis Specification is intended to cover the supply and installation of a complete Refrigeration Plant for a Walk-in Cooler Room which is located in an allotted space in the Basement. This equipment shall include a Condensing Unit, Cooling Coils, Piping, Drainage, Automatic Controls, etc. Machine capacities shall be determined on an operating time of not more than 16 hours per 24 hours, so as to permit a proper defrosting cycle.\n\nThe approximate dimensions of the room to be converted into the Walk-in Cooler Room are 12'-6\" x 25'-6\" x 9'-0\".

I understand that you need all these copies in order to obtain quotations. I have not kept a copy for our files, therefore, I would appreciate having one copy returned for our records.\n\nEnclosed also is a quotation from the Ashdown Company.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEnclosure:\nIndian Residential School,\nBeauval Sask., Dec. 12 1945.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring our recent talk where it was mentioned of finishing the Beauval Indian Residential School, I could not give you the number of yards to be plastered. Since, I got the information.\n\nThere are 4423 yds of walls and ceiling to be plastered at the cost of about $1.50 per yard including the purchase of plaster and transportation and labor. = $6,634.50\n\nI am sorry to mention that I have actually no brothers handy for the job.\n\nThere are also 520 yds of cement flooring to be finished. This would have to be done only after plastering. To do the job about 300 bags of cement would be needed. 300 bgs at 1.65 = $495.00 if transported in winter time.\n\nSo the gross estimates would be around $8000.00. This amount would permit me to finish the school and at the same time, give work to some of our Indians who will be in great needs next summer as trapping and fishing will be poor this year.\n\nIn closing this letter, may I mention that I appreciated your kindness in my first visit to your office.\n\nYours very truly:\n\nF.

Unfortunately, I could not find exactly what was required for us. The only one available was:\n\n1 Engine Caterpillar diesel model D.4400.\nGasoline engine starter. Panel on framework. All new and apparently in good condition. The generators are connected up to the switchboard for one phase, 115/230 volts. By changing connections, 115 volts, 3 phase, and 230 volts, 3 phase can be obtained.\n\n19 of these are available at General Supply Co. Plant at Ottawa. The Price is $3150.00 4600 lbs.\n\nThe original price is $4871.10\n\nThe Generator is a 22.5 KVA, 20 KW at .9PF, 1200 RPM, 60 cycle, 1 phase, 115/230 volts with wires brought out for 3 phase operation if required. Known as R.M. Louis Allis Generator.\n\nI believe this outfit would work with our plant and there would be a spare generator in case of trouble. As to the amount involved, likely your purchasing agent could have a reduction.\n\nThis is only a suggestion.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.X.

It is quite possible that the installation on which the firm quoted is worth the money requested, but the expenditure involved would be much higher than we anticipated.\n\nUnder separate cover, a requisition is being forwarded to you for a refrigeration unit for the St. Philips Residential School. A similar installation would be satisfactory at the Beauval Residential School.

You will recall that we had considerable correspondence about this matter during 1945, but at that time we were unable to secure the equipment desired. As I have not heard directly from you about the matter since receipt of your letter of July 6, 1945, I was hopeful that conditions had improved. However, from my conversation with Father Plourde, it appears that this is not the case.\n\nThe equipment required for your school is still difficult to obtain. However, it is possible that we may be able to secure it, but before requesting our Departmental Purchasing Agent to act in the matter, I thought it advisable to again write to you.\n\nWe recently purchased an auxiliary unit for the Grass Lake School, as follows:\n\n1 only Diesel Engine, twin cylinder, overhead valves, developing 16 H.P. at 1200 R.P.M., the Lister C.E. or equal, tank cooled model, fuel tank capacity 7 gallons, bore X stroke 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" x 4-3/8\", Flywheel dia. X face 23\" x 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\", Pulley X Face 10\" x 9\", water tank capacity 170 gallons, water tank dia. X height 30\" x 66\".\n\nPlease let me know as soon as possible if the engine mentioned above, or equal, would be suitable for your requirements.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend F.X. Gagnon, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBeauval, Sask.\nIndian Residential School,\nBeauval Sask., June 14th, 1946.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nFile 132-1-5\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just received yours of the 6th instant regarding the auxiliary unit for the lighting plant at the Beauval School.\n\nUnfortunately, this equipment is still required and will be for some time, according to the weather.\n\nI think that the auxiliary unit supplied to the Gross Lake School would be a little small for our need. I would prefer one 20 or 25 H.P. if possible. If not possible to get the above, well I think we will have to satisfy ourselves with the 16 H.P. mentioned in your letter.\n\nFor the other specifications, it would be all right except the pulley, as the generator pulley is for V belts.\n\nSo, the pulley on the engine should be 8 groove size C for 8 Cogbelts 1031.\n\nI think this will cover all the informations asked for in your letter. May I take this opportunity to thank you for the attention given to my requests.\n\nYours very thankfully:\n\nF.K.

The condition mentioned in the first paragraph of the Acting Director's memorandum has not improved. As a matter of fact, it has become worse owing to volume of water demand and consequently freezing occurs early in the Fall. It is essential that the order be secured this summer if at all possible and the information given on this purpose order has been obtained from the Principal of the School. We recommend the same type of engine as ordered for the Cross Lake School - see Purchase Order 10339. The engine for the latter school was 16 H.P., but the Principal at the Beauval School states that they require an engine of either 20 or 25 H.P.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Departmental purposes only.

My engineer will try it some time today. It should be working good, as everything seems to be O.K. We expect to have to use it in a few days as the cold weather we are having is pretty hard on our water supply for the turbine and on top no snow to protect the ice.\n\nI am very thankful to the Branch for this engine which will save lot of troubles.\n\nMay I take this opportunity to extend to you my best wishes of the Season.\n\nYours very truly:\n\nF.X.

Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies, to whom I had shown the Tubs told me order them right away, as they were falling into pieces and then send the invoice through you for payment.\n\nThis item was put with my early request but as it was urgent, I had to go direct and make the purchase myself. Hoping this will be satisfactory.\n\nYours very truly:-\n\nF.X. Gagnon O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, 2 January 1947.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nThe attached voucher No. 694 has been received from the Battleford Agency.\n\nFrom the Principal's letter it appears that purchase of the equipment mentioned on the voucher was authorized by you as an emergency measure. Under these circumstances it would be appreciated if you would sign the voucher and return so that payment can be arranged.\n\nBernard F.

Bell,  \nIndian Agent,  \nBattleford, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFile 132-1-5 W.T.1\n\nI just received a copy of a letter from Mr. Bernard F. Neary, Supt. of Welfare & Training about the requisition.\n\nAs to the inquiry about the washing Machines, I have already forwarded to you the invoice as I could not wait any more. The machines were all fallen into pieces.\n\nAs to the household range required, something like the one found in Eaton's Catalogue from Winnipeg, fall and winter 1946-47. Cat. no 56-L124 the Marlboro, Wood Firebox type or even Cat. no. 56-L26 - Master Climax for wood - or by the enclosed leaf of the J.H. Ashdown Hardware Co. Limited.\n\nI know also that it has not been the practice to supply a potato peeler. But I think you will admit with me that little girls who have to spend an hour or so peeling potatoes, would be better playing outside in the open air or be employed in more important work where they could learn more.\n\nThe Indians in their grievances are mentioning that their children are doing too much chore work so I thought that a potato peeler would help in this line to improve things a little and with my own experience I have notice that it is not advisable to have local help for the chore work. It is ordinary a great source of troubles.\n\nHoping that my request will be taken into consideration,\n\nI am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"F.X.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFile 132-1-5 (W.T.1)\nRe: Purchase Order no. 11211.\n\nLast January, you inquired about the refrigeration unit which was ordered for this school on May 23, 1946.\n\nIn May of this year, I have received the unit with the exception of two items: The 1 H.P. electric motor and the automatic switch which were missing.\n\nSince I have notified the Keyes Co. Ltd of Ottawa and they pretend to have shipped the unit all complete and they also mentioned that if these two things are missing I would have to inquire with the Transportation Companies, which I did but without any results.\n\nThis motor was supposed to be bolted on the unit with the automatic switch. Instead, we found only one fan bolted on the unit where the motor was supposed to be bolted on. I have mentioned this to the Company but I did not have their answer yet.\n\nOn the purchase order, the electric motor is mentioned but on their invoice, there is no mention of same. So far, I have not queried the invoice. I frankly believe that the motor has not been shipped as they claim, because the paint shows absolutely no sign of a motor being bolted on this unit.\n\nI have received only last month the instructions as to install same, and I notice that the dimensions mentioned are far from being the ones I have asked for.\n\n\"Two adjoining rooms are to be erected each measuring approximately 4 x 6' in floor space with a ceiling of 8'.\"\n\nThe dimensions I had suggested for the room that was available was: The freezing room height 9'9\" x length 13' and width 12\u00bd'. The cooling room adjoining: 9'9\", length 10', width 12\u00bd'. You will see the difference.\n\nto be continued.\nMr. Bernard Neary. Re Purchase order no.11211.\n\nSo today, I am quite doubtful if I should go into the expenses of erecting this frigidaire, as I do not think it will be satisfactory. Such a small frigidaire for a school of 100 pupils and so far away from rails, 116 miles, where we have to store meat, fish and vegetables.\n\nI would not have dared to mention this if it had not been for the Dietitian at Lebret who is reported having said that she was to recommend to the Indian Affairs Branch to have large frigidaire installed in the schools according to locations.\n\nI think this remark would apply to this school as large amount of food have to be stored for months on account of great distances from supply houses.\n\nMay I mention also, that we raise all the vegetables needed for the whole year. We have also enough berries locally; blueberries, strawberries and raspberries; we also have our meat, beef and pork, but the only drawback is to keep all that food stuff the whole year around. I think you will admit with me that a larger frigidaire would be needed here to give a well balanced diet to the children.\n\nSo before going ahead with this frigidaire I will wait for your decision.\n\nThanking you in advance for your kindness.\n\nYours very truly:\n\nF.X. Gagnon O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, August 19, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCOLONEL NEARY.\n\nRe: Purchase Order No. 11211\ndated May 23, 1946.\n\nWhen checking with Keyes Supply Company, Ottawa, regarding the refrigeration unit for the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, I was informed that a further check is being made with the factory to ascertain whether or not the motor and the automatic switch went forward with the remainder of the unit.\n\nThis information is expected to be available within the next few days.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nKB/HH.\nOttawa, August 21, 1947.\n\nRev. F. X. Gagnon, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBeauval Indian Res. School,\nBeauval, Saskatchewan.\n\nRefrigeration Unit\nBeauval Residential School\n\nReverend Father:\n\nI sent part of your letter of August 7 with one of our officials to the Keyes Co., Ltd., in Ottawa. They promised to check with the factory to check concerning the motor and automatic switch.\n\nThe dietitians are recommending large refrigerators, but these are not for the storing of fruits and vegetables as you mention in your letter. The specifications for this refrigeration unit were prepared by our Surveys and Engineering Branch and have been reported on satisfactorily in other schools. You will not be storing berries and vegetables there as it is presumed you have a root house and storage pantry.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. Welfare & Training.\n\nBFN/EEF\nIndian Residential School.\nBeauval Sask., August 24th, 1947.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFile: 132-1-5.\n\nI have yours of the 13th instant regarding the refrigerating unit purchased by the Department for the Beauval Residential School.\n\nThis unit was received in May and as it was not complete, I have notified the company about it advising them that I could not sign the invoice unless it was complete.\n\nAt that time, the electric Motor 1H.F.A.C. 110/220 volt, 60 cycle with automatic switch with the instructions regarding the erecting, insulation, finishing of the cold rooms and also instructions as to the installation and operation of this equipment. Since, I have received the instructions, but the motor and automatic switch is still missing.\n\nFurthermore, all the copper tubing is missing, but this item is not mentioned in the purchase order.\n\nThe electric motor and the switch was supposed to be mounted on the unit and the Company Keyes Supply pretended that something had happened on the way and that we had to put a claim at the transportation companies. After a close check, we see that no motor has been bolted on the unit, as there no mark on the paint.\n\nOn August the 11th, The Keyes Supply Co. have mentioned in their letter: \"We are trying to trace the missing motor from the shipment of refrigeration equipment that was made some time ago.\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot give you an immediate answer as to what happened but you may rest assured we will do everything possible to see that you receive this motor as soon as we find out exactly what happened.\"\n\nThis is about a resume of the correspondence I had with the Company about the missing articles.\n\nOver.\nAfter I received the instructions regarding the erection, insulation and finishing of the cold storage rooms, I was a little surprised at the size of the rooms. I quote:\n\n\"Two adjoining rooms are to be erected each measuring approximately 4x6' in floor space with a ceiling height of 8'.\"\n\nWhen I saw that these rooms were so small and far from being the dimensions given in request to the Department, I again asked the Company if their refrigeration unit they had sent me could be used for larger storage rooms and here is the answer.\n\n\"We note that you intend to use two rooms of quite a size and these rooms do not agree with the original size of rooms for which the equipment was specified. The cooling room you mention is 10' x 12' 6\", would require the machine which you received, plus another cooling unit to handle this room alone. The freezer which you mention, being 13' x 12' 6\" would require an air cooled machine and would be best served by an electric defrost type blast cooler.\n\nWe are sorry to advise that the machine you received is not capable of handling both these rooms and as such, some decision will have to be reached before work is progressed too far\".\n\nI think the above is self explanatory. If I have been communicating direct with the firm, it is because I thought it was up to me now to see that everything be O.K. before signing the invoice and as to the size of the rooms, I also did it on good faith to spare you more troubles.\n\nAs I can see it now from your letter, there must have been a mistake somewhere about dimensions of storage rooms. I had given the freezing room dimensions as for two rooms, one for fish and the other for meat and also the dimensions for the cooling room. Any way just now I hesitate in going into the expenses of putting such a small storage rooms which I think will not be satisfactory for the amount of peoples here and the amount of food stuffs to be stored owing to the great distances from the rails, specially after the recommendations made by the diatitian made the cooks at the Lebret school this summer.\n\nI hope you will understand my position and I am sorry to give you so much trouble but I would like to do things right.\n\nYours very truly:\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

When this is received we would appreciate it if you would install the equipment.\n\nWhile it may not be as large as you expected, it is to be of steel.

Phelan.\nRe: Beauval Indian Residential School.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nThe Beauval Indian Residential School is a fireproof building. The floors and walls are either of cement or brick. Unfortunately, the interior, with the exception of a few rooms was never plastered.\n\nThe principal is very anxious to have the plastering done during the coming fiscal year. The estimates vary from fifteen to twenty thousand dollars and I therefore ask that this amount be placed in the 1949-1950 estimates.\n\n1: The floors in the whole school were never well finished and offer a sorry sight to any visitor. The Principal desires to cover them with linoleum and he would appreciate that a large quantity of some kind of linoleum be supplied during the coming year. Personally, I think that you should begin by supplying five hundred yards of linoleum. I leave the color and kind to your good taste. The kitchen floor is in a very poor condition and he would like to have, immediately, a sufficient quantity of tile to cover it. This kitchen measures 24' x 40'. Any color of tile would do but he would prefer that it be of the color of white marble.\n\n2: The oven now in use is a \"Daoust\" model and is almost completely worn out. As the pupilage is over one hundred, he would like to have a new oven with hundred loaves capacity. This oven should be supplied, if at all possible to do so, in the very near future.\nOctober 16th, 1948.\n\n3: The following quantities of paint are also needed:\n\na) 15 gallons of Aluminum paint.\nb) 25 gallons of outside white paint.\nc) 15 gallons of paste primer paint.\nd) 25 gallons of red shingles stain.\n\n4: Four sewing machines all to be tailor, if at all possible to get them. The machines used in this school are all very old. Four of them have already been sent to North Battleford, but no word has been received as to their conditions. I hope that you may be able to supply the above.\n\nI thank you in anticipation, and remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOctober 25, 1948.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nLaurier Avenue East,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWe have your letter of the 16th instant regarding the amounts which you request be included in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1949-50 for the Beauval Residential School.\n\nYour request will receive further consideration when we are preparing our estimates.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

April 8, 1949.\n\nMr. J.A. Davis,\nSuperintendent,\nMeadow Lake Agency.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of a letter from the Canadian Westinghouse Co. Ltd. giving me some quotation on a voltage regulator which would be very useful to our electric plant here.\n\nThe school electric plant consists of a 25 kilowatts generator with a water turbine and an oil governor. The function of the oil governor is to open the gates or to close them, depending on the amount of power required to start a motor or when more lights are required. Thus regulating the amount of water required to maintain the same voltage.\n\nThis oil governor is working well but is too slow; starting a motor or using electric welder brings the light very low, thus making it quite hard on the eyes and also on electric motors if too slow to start. Furthermore, the stopping of a motor or cutting lots of lights at the same time causes the voltage to raise, thus burning the lights. I am using a big case of lights every month.\n\nAfter many consultations with electricians, I was told that the only way to overcome this would be to install a voltage regulator to draw the right amount of voltage as required by the sudden overcharge.\n\nWith the nice plant we have, I think it advisable to add this improvement. Therefore, I am asking you to recommend this purchasing of this voltage regulator to the Indian Affairs Branch to complete the unit and as an electrician will be on the spot next summer, it would be the right time to have this regulator installed.\n\nHoping to have an early and favourable answer.\n\nYours very truly, sgd.

Would submit the following estimate for the removal of the cement paint:\n\n8000 yds. at 60\u00a2 per yard...$4,800.00.\n\nThis makes the total estimate $13,951.70.\n\nI remain, yours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCharles Ransom\nPlastering Contractor.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to Department letter of the 9th of April, File 650-5 (E.1), in connection with the appropriation of $5,000.00 for plastering the interior of the Beauval Indian Residential School, Indian Superintendent J.A. Davis, of the Meadow Lake Agency, recently visited the school, accompanied by Mr. Charles Ransom, a plastering contractor. Enclosed is a copy of the letter which Mr. Ransom has given to Mr. Davis in connection with the cost of plastering the whole building.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Ransom estimates an amount of $4800.00 for removing the waterproofing cement paint from the walls before they can be plastered, and that the cost of plastering thereafter will be $9,151.70, otherwise an amount of $13,951.70 for the completed job.\n\nIf only $5000.00 can be made available this year I would recommend that nothing be done to the interior of the building at the present time other than the removal of the waterproofing cement paint, and that an appropriation be made available for the coming fiscal year for the whole of the plastering job at the estimated price given.\n\nPlease instruct me in this connection.\n\nJ.P.B.

Neary.\n\nAn explanation is due as to why we underestimated on our requisition for the installation of fire escapes at the Beauval R.C. Indian Residential School, No.650.\n\nWhen Mr. Clof Lidfor submitted his estimation it was included in a total quotation of $7,195.00 which amount included the proposed additions to this school as quoted on our 1950-51 Estimates, also tables, benches and cupboards. When making out the requisition we took the figures as shown for the fire-escape installations and included the 10 percent as Mr. Lidfor's commission as this was the percentage quoted on the entire estimate. Unfortunately we did not consider the fact that it is far cheaper to install one thing when your crew is already on the job working on a larger project than it is to just take crew and materials from Meadow Lake and go all the way to Beauval for one small job. When Mr. Lidfor pointed this out we definitely could see what he meant but had previously been of the opinion that his estimate was so based that any amount of the work could be completed at that portion of the estimate without hardship to any party.\n\nIn future we will definitely watch all such items and in this way avoid these misunderstandings.\n\nJ.A.

Being authorized by His Excellency Martin Lajeunesse and Mr. J.A. Davis, Supt., of the Meadow Lake agency I have decided to write you direct in order to save time.\n\nThe Principal's or Fathers' house:\nThis house, formerly a student's house, was built by the Episcopal Corporation of Kashegan. The first floor, in 1910 with two subsequent additions to it in form of a square, one part of the square is about 30' x 42' and the other part is about 26' x 48'. It is a frame building built on the sand without any foundation. The sills are rotten, which would mean that in order to jack it up, false beams would be required and I don't think that the building itself would stand as the walls are starting to bulge. Also brick siding would be required to make it more comfortable in winter time. This building would cost too much to be repaired and as it has the inconvenience of being 500 yards away from the school which means lots of walking back and forth to do our work, I believe it would be better to wreck it down and salvage all the lumber we can, to build a machine shed, which is greatly needed and also lot of material such as sinks, toilets, water pipes, radiators and furnitures could be used in the new building.\n\nNew Father's house required:\nSo instead of repairing this old house, I would suggest that an addition be added to the Indian Residential School to serve as the Principal's residence and offices. The present heating system of the Indian School could easily take care of these additions and it would mean great savings for fuel and labor and would also be more convenient.\n\nSketch:\nFor your convenience, I inclose a sketch showing the proposed additions to the Indian School. On the boys' side, full basement 30' x 42' inside measurements for toilets, urinals, bathrooms, dressing room, special room for the grown up boys and also cloak rooms.\n\nOn the first floor right above this basement would be the Fathers' residence as shown on the sketch.\n\nOn the girls' side, a full basement, 30' x 42', for toilets, shower baths, dressing rooms with a special room for the grown up girls.\n\nAbove would be two class rooms as I have to take the boys' and girls' infirmaries from the second floor to the first to give more room to the Sisters so using one actual class room as a girls' infirmary.\n\nBuilding Material:\nThe Indian School is a fireproof building built with cement and bricks. I would like very much to have the additions built out of the same material.\nAs I have been advised by a Meadow Lake contractor, reinforcing steel will be hard to get next Summer and also the transportation of bricks would be pretty expensive. (Beauval School being 116 miles north of the end of rail and the roads are in bad conditions with no hope of getting them repaired in the near future. Winter time would be the best time to have some material transported to Beauval; it is cheaper and easier.)\n\nSo I would suggest a full cement basement, the height as the rest of the building and for the first floor wooden frame with brick sidings, one layer of asbestos paper, one layer of shiplap, rockwool or similar material in the walls and ceiling, 2x6 studs, with plastered Gyprock inside. The floor could be made of fireproof tiles. The roof gravel and tar. This would make it practically fireproof and quite warm.\n\nI expect to be able to send you the estimates on the cost of labor and material in about ten days' time, in order to have the estimates figured for this coming fiscal year and have the material transported in Winter time.\n\nIf the sketch is not clear enough, although I am quite busy, I would be prepared to take a trip to Ottawa. In the meantime, I will appreciate an early reply to this request.\n\nYours very truly:\n\nF.X.

Gagnon, O.M.I., Principal of the Beauval Indian Residential School, has written a letter to the Director of Indian Education, dated October 4th.\n\nI am not acquainted with the contents of the letter but understand they deal with the finishing of this School to be done by next summer and the building of two additions for the staff. The Minister has received representations endorsing the suggestions from Father Gagnon, so I would appreciate a report on this matter for the information of the Minister.\n\nJ.G.

Harrison, M.P., telephoned this morning with reference to a letter from the Principal of the Beauval Indian Residential School.\n\nI promised him that we would give the letter every possible consideration when we are preparing our Estimates for 1950-51, and we would advise him later exactly what provision we found it possible to make.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nOttawa, October 17, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nBeauval Indian Residential School.\n\nI have received Mr. Levy's memorandum of October 11 referring to a letter of October 4 sent to the Superintendent of Education.\n\nPlease find attached a copy of the letter sent by Father Gagnon, the Principal of this School. You will note that Father Gagnon is requesting the following changes to the Beauval Residential School:\n\n(a) The dismantling of the present Principal's residence and its replacement by an addition of 30 by 42 ft., extending the boys' side of the school;\n\n(b) A similar extension of 30 by 42 ft. to the girls' side of the school.\n\nBoth these additions would have full basements and extensive plumbing arrangements would be necessary. You will note also that both these additions will have to be made of cement and bricks, with reinforcing steel required also.\n\nAs this school is 116 miles north of the end of rail at Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan, it would be necessary to have all these supplies shipped in during the winter. No funds are provided in our present Estimates for this project and it is the first intimation which we have had that such additions are required.\n\nTherefore, before proceeding with Father Gagnon's\nrequest, it will be necessary for us to take the following action:\n\n(a) To have our Educational Survey Officer proceed to this school and submit an inspection report as to the need for these additions.\n\n(b) If his report is favourable, then an engineer will have to be sent to prepare plans and specifications for the work outlined by Father Gagnon.\n\nOur experience with similar requests has been that we must proceed cautiously and only upon professional advice.\n\nYou will note for example that Father Gagnon makes the following statement: \"The present heating system of the Indian school could easily take (care) of these additions\". We have heard similar statements made previously when additions to residential schools have been proposed by principals and church authorities. Usually some local furnace man is called in to advise on a heating problem which can only be handled by a professional engineer. In a year or two we are then advised that the new section of the building is cold and before long are faced with a heavy bill for the installation of an entire new heating system throughout the school.\n\nTherefore I would recommend your approval for the action which I have indicated above before any further consideration is given to Father Gagnon's request.\n\nDirector.\nOctober 17, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\n\nBeauval Indian Residential School.\n\nPlease find hereunder a drafted reply to Mr. Levy's memorandum of October 11.\n\nMr. Phelan advises me that Mr. J. A. Harrison, M.P., has also telephoned with regard to this request of Father Gagnon. It would therefore seem evident that pressure is being applied to have these alterations pushed through immediately.\n\nI hope you agree with the tone of my drafted reply.\n\nBernard F.

Their father and mother are half-breed and therefore not annuitant. But according to your decision in September last, I was authorised to take these children; this was done through our representative in Ottawa, Rev. Father F.A. Mercotte.\n\nTherefore last fall I wrote to their father to advise him that his children were accepted and to bring them. But being away from home the season was too advanced when he got my letter. After that there was no way of communication, so at Christmas he brought his children along after 5 days traveling with dogs sleigh.\n\nSo, I could not refuse according to the instructions received last fall and also according to the Indian Act:\n\n\"While it was not considered that the children of half-breeds proper to Manitoba and the Prairie Provinces should be admitted into Indian Schools and paid for by the Department, it was conceded that all children, even those of mixed blood, whether legitimate or not who live upon an Indian reserve and whose parents on either side live as Indians, even if they are not annuitants, should be eligible for admission to the schools....\"\n\nAs I do not abuse of this act and that preference is always given to treaty children, and considering too that these children are living on the English River reserve, and live the Tehapweyan mode of life are eligible for admission to this school.\n\nFurthermore, their father although...\nhalf-breed claims that he never got the scrips and he is willing to take treaty any time. He already made application Mr. Murison from Regina on his paying treaty trip a year ago last summer, took all the informations about his case and he was promised to be advised, but unfortunately, he never got a word about it.\n\nSo, for these reasons, I sincerely believe that these children are children to whom the law applies and therefore eligible to be admitted as grant-earning pupils.\n\nYours very truly:\n\nF.X.

These forms were sent only as certificate of Health and not as admission, as all these children were approved by you. Refer file I32-I-IO, October 20th, 1932.\n\nIn your file to you will find a letter covering explanation why I asked the admission of these three boys although of mixed blood; they are eligible for admission to schools according to the Indian Act.\n\nHoping these explanations will be satisfactory I can assure you that I am making special effort to have only Treaty children only.

It is only in August that I heard about her death and I told my secretary about it, but as her name had to appear on the September Report, my secretary kept her name on the list for the report and also for the December Return by mistake.\n\nBeing very busy around New Year's, I did not check the report very closely, unfortunately and on the March return, that name was not on the list.\n\nAs we received a grant on the December Return for 92 days after her death, I would ask you to kindly deduct this amount on the next return or if you wish a cheque will be mailed to the Department for this amount.

In the case of those whom you consider should remain for a further period, permission should be requested. The Department realizes that there are often very good reasons for keeping certain pupils in a residential school after they reach the age of sixteen years, and representations in this regard made by yourself will receive the careful consideration of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev.

In receiving the Grant for September Quarter and comparing the same with the Grant for June 1934 there was such a difference that it was obvious that a mistake had been made. I therefore asked Father Principal to send me the copy of his September Quarterly Return and I found out that in the Aggregate No. of Days pupils in residence during the quarter he did not include the days granted for vacation.\n\nYou will find herewith a copy of the September Quarterly Return as it should be and if you do compare it with the one of June it will prove correct. I therefore kindly ask the Department to pay us the balance due on the last September Quarterly Return.\n\nI wish to point out also that the same mistake has been made on each September Quarterly Return since 1930. If it is not too late to put up a claim I would be very glad to submit to you a duly copy of the above mentioned Quarterly Returns.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nVicar-Apostolic of Keewatin.\nOttawa, February 11, 1935.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo, enclosing an amended return for the Beauval Indian Residential School for the quarter ended September 30th, last.\n\nArrangements are being made to allow the balance which you claim for the September quarter of 1934, but it will not be possible to consider making payments for the other September quarters.\n\nThis matter emphasizes the importance of extreme care being taken in preparing the quarterly return. The September quarter return, in particular, should be carefully watched and grant should be requested for each pupil for the actual number of days such pupil is in residence during the September quarter, plus the forty-three (43) days' holidays for which grant is allowed. For instance, if a pupil is allowed home on holidays on July 1st and returns on August 13th, grant should be requested for 92 days. If, however, a pupil allowed home on holidays on July 1st does not return until September 1st, grant should be requested for such pupil for 73 days (30 days in residence during September plus 43 days' holidays). In cases such as the latter, a note should appear opposite the pupil's name in the column provided for that purpose, stating the reasons for the absence.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRt. Rev. M. Lajeunesse, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nBishop's House,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, October 23rd, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the September quarter return of the Beauval Indian Residential School.\n\nIn preparing this return, the names of all the pupils admitted during the September quarter were placed on the last page of the return. This was a mistake as the names of the new girls should have followed the names of the other girls on the return, while the names of the new boys should have been placed on the last page of the return.\n\nAs a result of this mistake, the pupils are wrongly numbered and, therefore, on future returns, the pupils admitted during the September quarter should be numbered as follows:\n\n| No.   | Name                      |\n|-------|---------------------------|\n| 50    | J. D. Lemaigne            |\n| 51    | Louis Mauraye             |\n| 52    | J. L. Piche               |\n| 53    | Ambroise Stevenson        |\n| 54    | Bruneau Ernest            |\n| 55    | William Ernest            |\n| 56    | Emile                     |\n| 57    | Alex Dawatsace            |\n| 0220  | M. C. Dawatsace           |\n| 0221  | Christine Dawatsace       |\n| 0222  | M. Therese Piwapiskus     |\n| 0223  | M. Daroule                |\n| 0224  | M. Gakokew                |\n| 0225  | Christine Piwapiskus      |\n| 0226  | S. Mongrand               |\n| 0227  | J.D. Eleonore Lemaigne    |\n\nApplication forms and certificates of health should be forwarded for the sixteen (16) pupils mentioned above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Victor Bleau, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBeauval, Sask.\n\nPP/O'M.\nSir:\n\nApplication has been received from the Rev. Principal at Beauval School, for the discharge of the following pupils.\n\nNo. 0152 M. Pewapiskus age limit\n0175 S. Est'Aldhenen \"\n0177 C. Enezheyonce \"\n0199 F. Montegrand \"\n0203 G.

Marguerite is 18 years old. She is an orphan; both parents dead; no close relations. Good character; she exercises a beneficial influence on others. Last winter, she was ill; she is not yet very strong but is gradually gaining in strength. As she is, she is not in a state to be married; and she would be compelled to do so if she were discharged from the school. We hope the Department will grant her the well-deserved favor of remaining with the Sisters for another year.\n\nSarraigne MacIntyre No.0159; this case also approved on July 26th 1934 (Ref.132-1-10). Sarraigne is in her 18th year. Very talented girl, serious, of excellent behavior, and inclined to devote herself for the welfare of others. The Principal in accord with the Sisters of the School, hope that later on when she has returned to her reserve, she could be of valuable assistance in post-school activities which they propose to organise and which shall be explained to you later. Another year at our School would enable us to prepare her for this purpose. So, for the sake of our cause, I solicit your permission to keep her, as a special favor for this child of rare endowments.\n\nC. Lariviere, No.0166; 16 years. Good character. She is an orphan, and quite destitute. In these grounds, we request that she remain at school for another year.\n\nM. Piwapiskus No.0135; 16 years old. Good girl; poorly endowed; much room for improvement. No opportunity for early marriage. She also is an orphan. We therefore request that her stay at school be prolonged another year.\n\nP. Grandfather No.0193; 16 years old. Good moral character as shown by previous reports. Not ready for married life, because of a state of general weakness, which is steadily improving. Another year at school would be very beneficial to her, and we trust the Department will grant us this.\n\nM. Dor\u00e9 No.0195; 16 years old. She has attended school very little on account of ill health. But now, according to the Doctor's testimony she is in a state to attend, and would greatly benefit by another year at school.\n\nAwaiting a favorable reply to these requests, we beg to remain\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMr. S.L.Macdonald,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI have an application from the Principal of Beauval School, to keep the following Pupils now of Discharge age for another year,\n\nNo. 0143, Marhuertie Mispumace\n0159, Sarrazine MacIntyre\n0166, C.

Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nPP/O'M.\nOttawa, April 14, 1936.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nReferring to conversation with Your Lordship during your recent visit to the Department, regarding the age limit for the discharge of those boys who are 14 years of age from the residential schools conducted under our auspices, in order that they can be returned to their parents, to acquire a knowledge of hunting, trapping, etc., I have to say that this meets with the approval of the Department. The Indian Agents at The Pas, Norway House, and Battleford are being informed and requested to advise the Principals of the Guy, Cross Lake and Beauval Indian Residential Schools accordingly.\n\nIt is not intended that all the boys, upon attaining 14 years of age shall be granted discharge, but only those cases which the Principals consider to be in sufficiently good health to accompany their parents on their hunting and trapping trips. It is thought that Indian boys should have acquired sufficient education for their future needs by the time they reach 14 years of age and that it would be to their future advantage to acquire a knowledge of hunting and trapping, on which their future livelihood will, to a great extent, depend.\n\nI would suggest that Your Lordship discuss the matter with the Principals of the above named schools and advise them that careful selection should be made by them of the boys whose discharge they would recommend at 14 years of age.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRight Rev. M. LaJeunesse, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, April 14, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Lajeunesse, during a recent visit to the Department, discussed the matter of the age limit for the discharge of the boys from the Indian Residential Schools conducted under his auspices. He recommended that those boys who are in good health should be given their discharge when they reach 14 years of age, in order that they can be returned to their parents or guardians, with a view to acquiring a knowledge of hunting and trapping, which will be the main source of their future livelihood.\n\nThe Department considers that it would be in the interests of the boys to be granted their discharge at 14 years of age, as they should by that time have acquired an education sufficient to meet their future needs. You may, therefore, inform the Principal of the Beauval Indian Residential School that, when he considers that a boy, upon attaining his fourteenth birthday, should receive his discharge, he should make application to the Department, through your office, in the usual manner.\n\nIt is not intended that all boys upon reaching 14 years of age are to be discharged, but, as stated, only those who are in sufficiently healthy condition to accompany their parents or guardians in order to acquire a knowledge of hunting, trapping, etc.\n\nI would request that you advise the Principal accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nS. L.

But he is certainly a Treaty child.\n\nOur assurance that he belongs to the Treaty, and also the fact that we have boarded and clothed him during the term, would seem to entitle us to receive the grant allowed every Treaty child. However, owing to the irregularity in the information legitimately required in this child's case, we do not press or urge payment of grant, but would be very grateful if you would consider this boy as a grant-earning pupil.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

But I had thought that, as far as the pupils who had died were concerned, the report which Dr. Laviole forwarded to the department on their deaths would be a notice of their discharge from the school. On receipt of your letter I made a special trip to Isle a La Crosse and ascertained from the Doctor that these reports had been forwarded. As for pupil no. 0193 P. Grandifran\u00e7ais, 0206 E. Aubichon, and 13-Francis Bell, application for their discharge was not sent in due to a mistake of my clerk, since I thought it had gone in after the March report, as I had instructed at that time.\n\nPupil no. 67, Ernest McCallum, was shown on the March report but was wrongly numbered 68. This boy, as a matter of fact, has been at the school all year.\nI enclose discharge forms covering these pupils who have died or been dismissed. I would appreciate information as to whether this is the proper procedure in case of death of pupils.\n\nI trust this explanation is wholly satisfactory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nV.

I trust that the Principal will arrange to have the returns more carefully prepared in future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,  \nChief, Training Division.\n\nS.L. Macdonald, Esq.,  \nIndian Agent,  \nBattleford, Sask.\nBeauval Indian Residential School,\nBeauval, Sask. Dec. 6th 37.\n\nMr. S.-L. Macdonald,\nIndian Agency,\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe September Quarterly return.\n\nI have yours of the 17th November, including copy of the Chief Training division, about the quarterly return. And I take this opportunity to thank him for the remarks he kindly made to me. I hope the next quarterly return will be completed in the proper manner. Lack of information was the cause of this trouble.\n\nDischarge of pupils:\n\n0192 C. Couillonnour, needed at home, mother sick.\n0280 M.E. Dawalsare, died at home during holidays from the consequences of the epidemic.\n0239 Pauline Didzere, sick at home, very poor health.\n22 J. Lariviere, Limit age reached.\n38 A. Mongrand\n42 J. Darazel Died during epidemic\n43 J.-A. Lemaigne, needed at home limit age reached.\n5 E. Piwapiskus, limit age reached.\n14 A. Grandfaraud Died during epidemic.\n16 N. MacIntyre limit age reached.\n46 Ars\u00e8ne Pich\u00e9, limit age reached.\n\nMiscellaneous.\n\n44 J.-E. Lemaigne is present and was supposed to be on the September return. He came late to the School on 21st of October. So his attendance should be 62 days. I would appreciate very much if the Department would refund me, as I paid...\nhis fare to Mac. from La-Loche to Beauval.\n\n59 Elie Red Iron, is absent and being over 150 miles from the school and not being able to come himself. I cannot pay his expenses for transportation as it would cost me at least $40.00\n\n0173 C. Est'aldhenen, was discharged on October 15, 1936. At the time of her discharge she was sick and not expected to recover. Today, she is better than ever and being a neglected child I would ask the Department to cancel the previous discharge. It is only after sending the return that I noticed she was discharged.\n\nHoping these informations will be satisfactory, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. X. Gaynor, M.S.\nPrincipal.\nBattleford, Sask.\nDecember 10th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter no. 132-1-10 or the 13th ultimo, enclosed please find letter received from the Rev. R.A.

Lemaigre, No. 44, it is not possible at the present time to pay the school grant for the period he was not attending during the September quarter. You may, however, advise the Principal that when he is preparing his December return, he should request a grant for this boy for the period October 21st to December 31st, plus 62 days not previously allowed in the September quarter.

Very careful consideration was given to this account and although we had previously decided to only allow $200.00 I agreed with Rev. J.O. Flourde, O.M.I., that an amount of $250.00 would be paid. A cheque for the latter amount will go forward.\n\nWhile the Department is only paying a portion of the expense incurred we are concerned with the very heavy amount expended for transportation as shown by your letter. In the interests of both the school management and ourselves it is desirable to keep all expenditures as low as possible. This is especially true at the present time due to conditions of which you are aware and which make the future rather uncertain.\n\nIs there no other method of transporting the children which would reduce the expenditure by a substantial amount? It is felt that the parents should be sufficiently interested to come to the school and take their children home for holidays. It is realized, of course, that it might be necessary to incur an expenditure for returning them to the school. As intimated above it is doubtful what amount the Department will be able to allow next year for transportation costs. It is, therefore, necessary that all Principals should give this matter very serious thought. Children from more distant Reserves might be kept at the school all summer unless the parents are sufficiently interested to come to the school and take the children home without cost. I should appreciate hearing from you when you have had an opportunity of reviewing the whole situation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. F.K.

Ostrander,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nIndian Residential School.\nBeauval Sask., Jan. 22 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th ultimo, regarding the transportation of children to and from the school and I take this opportunity to thank you for the kind interest shown to the school in sending a cheque to the amount of $250.00, which is very appreciated.\n\nAt the same time, I am pleased to assure you that the transporting expenditure will be reduced next summer and I expect to reduce it more before a couple years.\n\nAt present, I believe it is almost impossible to change the transporting method of children, as, no doubt, you are aware that the Indians of the North do not yet understand the benefit of education as well as their brothers living in the prairies and too radical a change would mean that these Indian children will be without education.\n\nFurthermore, the Indians do not have the proper equipment to undertake such a trip on big lakes and I am of the opinion that it would cost the school more by feeding or supplying the Indians with provisions for the return trip than the present system, which saves me lot of trouble.\n\nAs already mentioned, this I expect to save on the amount as well as on the cost of fuel by using a new kind of motor on my barge. By using Bishop Breynat's plane I will also reduce the cost of air transporting of children.\n\nAnd likely, this season will be the time, I need a plane for this purpose as new roads actually under construction will permit to adopt a cheaper way of transporting the children.\n\nFor this year, I would be satisfied to receive the same amount as last year for this purpose.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

Gagnon O.M.I.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan.\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nOttawa Ont.,\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nFebruary 1, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo with reference to the cost of transporting children to and from the Beauval Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that you hope to reduce the expenditure for this service but that for the year 1940 you will be satisfied to receive the same amount as last year; namely, $250.00.\n\nYour request will be kept in mind but at the present time I am not in a position to state whether or not such an amount can be allowed. Due to present conditions it is inevitable that our appropriation will be reduced and consequently matters have reached a stage where everyone interested in Indian education must do everything possible to reduce expenditure. The question of funds at our disposal for the fiscal year 1940-41 is still further complicated at the present time on account of the recent dissolution of Parliament and it will be several months before we will be in a position to definitely state what amount will be available for transportation during the summer of 1940.

Ostrander,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am just back from the North to pick up the children to school, as usual, I have encountered many difficulties. First of all, I had made arrangements with the C.P.R. Air Line to bring the children from White Fish and La Loche. In the meantime, the company has closed Prince Albert Air Base. So these children could not be transported.\n\nAt the other points some parents have been kicking about the school, complaining about a few things, but in all this I found out that those who were complaining did not want to let their children go to school.\n\nWith all the expenses occurred in this trip I have only 60 children in school. I expect a few more at a later date. The Indians are showing great indifference towards the school, or they do not force their children to go to school. In other words, the children are their own masters. If they want to go to school, it is alright, if not, it is still all right with them. Most of the time, just at the time, that a child would start to learn something, they do not send him back to school. Thus, the Branch is spending money for very little result.\n\nSo on account of this, I believe that something should be done to put in force the Indian Act regarding compulsory attendance. I am sure if this would be done once or twice, there would not be any more difficulties about recruiting children in the future. So I wish you could do something in that line.\n\nI am enclosing a list of pupils that are not coming back to school and also of those who are of school age to help you.\n\nBefore making any attempt to get the children from La Loche I will wait for an answer. So I do not make any useless expenses.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) P.E. Gagnon, O.M.I.\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find copy of letter received from the Rev. Father P.A. Gagnon, of the Beauval Indian Residential School, regarding compulsory attendance at his school.\n\nAs the area covered by this school takes in a large territory, I would not be in favour of going to any great expense in compelling children to attend. However, I am leaving the matter in your hands so what action you would suggest should be taken.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nMines and Resources,\nIndian Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 11, 1942.\n\nRe: Irregularity of Attendance -\nBeauval Residential School\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 3rd instant and also copy of a communication relating to the marginally-noted subject, received by you from the Reverend Father Gagnon.\n\nIt is scarcely possible to overemphasize the importance of having the accommodation provided at our residential schools occupied to the fullest extent in a period as critical as the one in which we find ourselves. It is important, also, that the average pupil's course of study should not be interrupted until he has gained mastery of the subjects to which he has been devoting his attention. It is a sheer waste of human energy and money to permit an Indian pupil to attend school for three or four years and then allow him to abandon his studies and proceed to forget everything he has learned. The Department is aware, of course, that there is this year acute labour shortage in the province of Saskatchewan and that 't may be difficult to arrange for the return of the senior pupils on the first of September. However, we are anxious that you should do everything humanly possible to assist the Principal in securing his full quota of pupils. If Indian parents are deliberately ignoring the appeals that have been made to them from time to time to encourage their children to attend school, the desirability of imposing the penalties for which provision has been made in the Act should be carefully considered. The Department will be governed largely by your recommendations.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J.P.B.

It appears that these children were regularly enrolled at the Thunderchild School and were allowed home on holidays and, instead of returning to Thunderchild, they went to Beauval. I feel certain that you were not fully informed of all the circumstances, or you would not have accepted them at Beauval. I think you will agree that it is impossible to handle admissions to Indian schools if parents, instead of returning children to the school where they were enrolled, place them in some other institution. Certainly it has not been our practice to sanction such methods. Under the circumstances it would be appreciated if you would return the children to the Thunderchild School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. F.X.
