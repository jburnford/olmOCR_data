Neglect of this important matter may result in terrible tragedy. Investigate the WESTeel Potter Tubular Fire Escape, the only fire escape approved by National Board of Fire Underwriters.\n\nThe WESTeel Potter Fire Escape has actually saved hundreds of lives. (See inside pages).\n\nWESTeel Potter Fire Escapes are Made in Canada\nHere are proofs of the value of WESTEEL Potter Fire Escapes\n\n200 CHILDREN SAVED\n\nIllustration at left shows the burning of the Harrah Public School. 200 children on the second story got out of the burning building through the tubular fire escape. No panic, no loss of life\u2014not one of them received a scratch.\n\nHOSPITAL PATIENTS SLIDE TO SAFETY ON THEIR MATTRESSES\n\n24 patients of the Lutheran Hospital, Bemidji, Minnesota, were safely removed on their mattresses through the tubular fire escape. Not one of the patients suffered any ill effect. The outside temperature was over 30 degrees below zero when this fire occurred.\n\n80 CHILDREN ESCAPE\n\nThe school building shown at left was entirely gutted by fire. 80 children escaped from the burning building through the tubular fire escape without injury.\n\nIllustration below shows the installation of a WESTEEL fire escape on a hospital building. At the left of the photograph is shown the ruins of the old hospital building destroyed by fire from which about 25 bedridden patients were removed in the nick of time to avert a horrible death. After this experience in removing patients with a slide escape the authorities were convinced that the tubular fire escape method of removing bedridden patients is the best and most practical.\n\nWESTEEL Potter Fire Escapes are Made in Canada\nGive the people in your care a chance for their lives\n\nA very heavy responsibility rests upon those whose duty it is to provide proper fire escape equipment for schools, hospitals and public institutions.\n\nARE YOUR SCHOOLS SAFE?\n\nFire records show that panic has been the cause of great loss of life in school fires. Every building can be made perfectly safe by the installation of WESIEEL Potter Fire Escapes.\n\nINSIST ON PROPER EQUIPMENT\n\nSafe Orderly Exit\nNo Panic - No Loss of Life\n\nFire has no mercy for helpless patients\n\nWeak, bedridden hospital patients, the aged and infirm, should have every facility provided for quick escape in the case of fire. Experience has shown that the ordinary type of fire escape is useless where helpless people are concerned. WESIEEL Potter Tubular Fire Escapes (hospital type) are built large enough to accommodate a patient on the regular hospital mattress. Patient on mattress can be carried to the tube and removed in safety. Two persons on the ground below take care of the patients as they arrive at the end of the fire escape. This method is quick, safe and does not injure the patient in any way.\n\nEquip Your Buildings with\nWESIEEL POTTER FIRE ESCAPES\n\nThe WESIEEL Potter Tubular is the only fire escape of any kind approved by the Underwriters' Laboratories for use on hospitals.\nWidespread Approval of WESTEEL Potter Fire Escapes\n\nFire Chiefs of Canada in Annual Convention at Shawinigan Falls, Quebec, 1931, passed a resolution approving the WESTEEL Potter Fire Escape. Provincial Fire Marshals and Public Officials all over Canada have endorsed this modern escape.\n\nWESTEEL Potter Fire Escapes on a building are recognized as symbols of safety. We have on file hundreds of letters which testify very strongly in favor of this modern safe exit.\n\nCopies of testimonials gladly furnished.\n\nWESTEEL Potter Tubular Fire Escapes\n\nRECENT CANADIAN INSTALLATIONS\n\nWESTERN PROVINCES\n\nVancouver, B.C.

Indian Residential School.\n\nI note from your letter that you already have fire escapes and every effort should be made to keep these in as good condition as possible. As you are aware an allowance is made for a night watchman and the Department will depend on you to employ a competent man for this very important work.\n\nNo funds are available in the current year's appropriation for the expenditure that would be required to supply the new fire escapes recommended in your letter and under these circumstances favourable consideration cannot be given to your request at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. L. Beuglet, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nWabasca R.C. Indian Residential School,\nDesmarais, Alta.\nNovember 30th 1938\n\nMr. M. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Agencies,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLast Summer I have had the chimneys of the Wabasca R.C. Indian Res. School demolished and new ones made by a competent bricklayer. By so doing I think that I have somewhat minimized fire hazard to life.\n\nThere still remains to improve fire escape facilities. At present, there are wooden stairs at each end of the School from the top floor to the ground with exits from each storey; fire drills are being practised via these stairs very often but the building being high and consequently the stairs long, the building, in my opinion, can not be evacuated as quickly as one would wish.\n\nTo facilitate quicker evacuation of the building, I thought that the installation of a tubular galvanized iron fire escape on each side of the building with exit from the dormitories which would run directly to the ground would greatly reduce the danger of loss of life by fire.\n\nWhile in Edmonton, I called at the Western Steel Products Corporation Limited and asked these people to quote the price on the installation of two fire escapes and I am enclosing the manager's letter as well as a circular illustrating the fire escapes which I wish to have installed at our School.\n\nIt is my constant endeavour to improve the equipment for fire protection of the Wabasca R.C. Indian Res. School and, in my opinion, our fire protection will not be adequate until fire escapes of the type referred to are installed.\n\nYou will please give this matter your kind attention.\n\nI remain,\nyours very truly,\n\nL. Beuglet, a.m.j.\nPrincipal,\nWabasca R.C. Indian Res. School,\nDesmarais P.O. Alberta.\nEDMONTON,\n\nNovember 30th, 1938.\n\nRev. L. Beuglet, C.M.I.,\nO/c Oblate Fathers,\nEDMONTON, Alberta.\n\nReverend Father;\n\nFollowing interview in our office yesterday relative to a tubular fire escape for your Mission at Wabasca.\n\nWe are attaching hereto a circular illustrating our \"WABASCA\" Potter Fire Escapes which we manufacture in our Edmonton factory.\n\nThis fire escape is of a special manufacture and is the only fire escape approved by the National Board of Fire Underwriters, coupled to the fact that Fire Chiefs, Provincial Fire Marshalls and Public Officials all over Canada have endorsed this modern fire escape. Please note on the back page of the enclosed circular the installations which we have made all over Canada.\n\nAt your Wabasca Mission where you have the custody of hundreds of children the question of fire protection is no doubt one that is of all importance to you and to all those who are responsible for your institution. We are confident that with the erection of a Potter Tubular Fire escape you will have solved your fire protection problem. We call your attention to the method of operation which becomes a pleasure to the children using the fire escape.\n\nFor school installation we supply a tubular escape \"3\" in diameter. We will supply and install the two tubular fire escape on your building which will be approximately sixty-six feet long with a height of about 36' from the floor of the upper story to the ground. We to supply the entrance doors, bolts, hardware, supports, concrete bases etc.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6379, file 768-5, part 2)\nEDMONTON.\n\nTo Rev. L. Beuglet, O.M.I., - November 30th, 1928.\n\nIn our estimate we have figured on using the airplane, flying from Edmonton to Wabasca as we believe this to be cheaper than train to Slave Lake then to Wabasca.\n\nWe will install the two fire escapes for the sum of TWENTY SIX HUNDRED AND THREE DOLLARS, ($2603.00). If one escape is installed the price to be THIRTEEN HUNDRED NINETY SIX DOLLARS, ($1396.50), sales tax included.\n\nWe appreciate the opportunity of quoting and hoping it will be our pleasure to serve you, we are\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWESTERN STEEL PRODUCTS CORPORATION LIMITED.\n\nA.J.

BAILEY\n\nIn the appropriation for the fiscal year 1939-40 provision has been made for certain expenditures at the Wabasca R.C. residential school. Among other items required there is the following lumber:\n\n12 pieces 6\" x 8\" x 12'\n25 \" 3\" x 8\" x 12'\n150 \" 2\" x 4\" x 12'\n85 \" 2\" x 12\" x 12'\n54 \" 2\" x 6\" x 17'\n\n2000 sq. ft. siding\n3000 \" v joint\n6700 \" shiplap\n2000 \" flooring\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Rev. S. Lajoie, O.M.I., Administrator of the Diocese of Grouard, in which this school is located, reading as follows:\n\n\"As transportation of the above lumber from Slave Lake to Wabasca would cost approximately $15.00 a thousand feet I request authorization for securing the lumber from the saw mill at Wabasca owned by the Episcopal Corporation of Grouard. The price will run from $24.00 to $30.00 a thousand feet according to the kind of lumber. As soon as notification is received that this proposal is accepted work will be started in order that the lumber will be ready early next summer.\"\n\nSlave Lake is the closest railway point to the Wabasca R.C. school and you will note that if the lumber is shipped to the school the freighting from...\nSlave Lake to Wabasca will be a considerable amount. Under these circumstances I feel that the price quoted by the Episcopal Corporation of Grouard is reasonable and it would be appreciated if you would authorize us to complete arrangements with them for the quantities of lumber mentioned above.\n\nR. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 3, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th ultimo enclosing list of material required for the Wabasca R.C. school in connection with the erection of a carpenter and blacksmith shop you may purchase the following:\n\n- 16 windows 10 x 12 x 12 lights\n- 16 storm windows for above windows\n- 6 doors 6'8\" x 1\u00be inch thick\n- 2 camp stoves 38\"\n- 20 squares corrugated galvanized iron for rafters 17 feet\n- 54 feet galvanized ridge cap for same\n- 108 \" drip starter\n\nThe other articles are being secured by our Purchasing Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

BAILEY\n\nRe: Requisition, January 31, 1939,\nDesks for Wabasca R.C. Indian\nResidential School.\n\nWith reference to your phone message this\nmorning in connection with the above I may say that\nRev. S. Lajele, O.M.I., Administrator of the Diocese\nof Grouard, visited the Department this morning and\nI ascertained from him that the winter freight rate\nfrom Slave Lake to the Wabasca R.C. school never\nexceeds 2\u00a2 a pound.\n\nThe summer freight rate is either 5\u00a2 or 6\u00a2 a\npound.\n\nYou will note from the above that the difference\nbetween the summer and winter freight rates is at\nleast 3\u00a2 a pound.\n\nI believe that in the shipment of desks to\nthe Wabasca R.C. residential school there would be\nan approximate aggregate weight of 3000 pounds. (60\ndesks at 50 pounds each). It is, therefore, evident\nthat the summer freight rate would exceed the winter\nfreight rate on this shipment by approximately $90.00.\n\nR. A.

Indian Residential School, Wabasca, during last\nseason. Labour sheets and receipted bills attached.\n\nAs pointed out in previous correspondence,\nthe material was bought last winter in order to profit\nby snow for the hauling. Transportation is far cheaper in\nwinter than in summer, one cent and a half against five or\nsix.\n\nAn accident having happened to the old elec-\ntric engine, a new one had to be bought without any delay.\nIt was out of question of leaving the Mission without light\nand power for several weeks. It was a case of emergency.\nWe did our best to face the situation.\n\nAt last, we have had some moisture, a light\nsnow, but enough to remove the danger of fire.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. S.

Lajoie, O.M.I., Administrator of the Diocese\nof Grouard, visited the Department this morning and\nI ascertained from him that the winter freight rate\nfrom Slave Lake to the Wabasca R.C. school never\nexceeds 2\u00a2 a pound.\n\nThe summer freight rate is either 5\u00a2 or 6\u00a2 a\npound.\n\nYou will note from the above that the difference\nbetween the summer and winter freight rates is at\nleast 3\u00a2 a pound.\n\nI believe that in the shipment of desks to\nthe Wabasca R.C. residential school there would be\nan approximate aggregate weight of 3000 pounds. (60\ndesks at 50 pounds each). It is, therefore, evident\nthat the summer freight rate would exceed the winter\nfreight rate on this shipment by approximately $90.00.\n\nR. A.

Hoey, Supt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSEP 23 1940\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nRe: Fire Escapes,\nWabasca Residential School.\n\nI have succeeded in getting specifications for the proposed fire escape at our Wabasca Residential School. These are enclosed.\n\nLet me point out that according to the proposition of the Western Steel Products Corporation, the mounting of the escapes were to be performed at the school, the solder and the rivets being supplied by the firm. Please refer to the letter from Western Steel Products attached to my letter of Aug. 16th. As far as I remember, the material was to be purchased and the assembling would be left to the school. Transportation would be far easier if the pieces are not assembled.\n\nAs to the opportunity of supplying the school with fire escapes, let it suffice to point out that there is no outside exit in case of fire. Fire proof exit I mean. Wooden stairs are far from being safe.\n\nEnclosed a letter of the Principal, Rev. P. Daigle, O.T., explaining the situation.\n\nShipment has to be made at the following address: Wabasca R.O., Indian School, Slave Lake, Alta.\n\nHoping that the specifications supplied will allow any firm to understand what is needed, I remain,\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6379, file 768-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nWabasca R.C. Indian Res. School,\nDesmarais, Alta.\nOct. 12th, 1938.\n\nReverend Father S. Lejeune, O.M.I.,\nCroward, Alta.\n\nDear Father,\n\nIt has been my constant endeavour to improve the equipment for fire protection of the Wabasca R.C. Indian School; hand fire extinguishers have been placed at strategic places of the school, but I think that those extinguishers are not in sufficient number and I am asking you to have a few more forwarded to us. During Summer we have had the chimneys demolished and new ones have been made with flue lining by a competent bricklayer. By so doing, we believe that we have greatly minimized fire hazard to life.\n\nThere still remains to improve fire escape facilities. At present, there are wooden stairs at each end of the School from the top floor to the ground with exits from each storey; fire drills are being practised via these stairs very often, but the building being high and consequently the stairs long, the building, in our opinion, can not be evacuated as quickly as one would wish.\n\nTo facilitate quicker evacuation of the building, I would suggest that a tubular galvanized iron fire escape be installed on each side of the building with exit from a window of each dormitory, which tubular escapes would run directly to the ground and would be supported by braces along the rear part of the building.\n\nEnclosed herewith a photograph of the Wabasca R.C. Indian School on which I have traced in ink where these tubular fire escapes could be most advantageously installed; from the dimensions of the buildings given, an expert in this matter will be able to judge amount of tubing required.\n\nI believe that the danger of loss of life by fire would be greatly reduced, if these tubular fire escapes were installed.\n\nWould you then kindly bring this matter to the attention of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, August 21, 1940.\n\nRe: Fire Escapes,\nWabasca Residential School.\n\nDear Father Lajoie:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 13th instant, in which you express the opinion that fire escapes should be purchased for the Wabasca School.\n\nI have read your communication very carefully and also the statement sent forward to you by the Western Steel Products Corporation, Limited, of Edmonton. It is just possible that the price quoted by this firm was a price that applied only to goods delivered immediately following the date of their letter of May 20.\n\nI have discussed the question very fully with the Purchasing Agent and he has expressed the opinion that the officials at the Minister's office will insist upon having us call for competitive tenders. I have been wondering, therefore, if it would be possible for you to obtain, at the earliest possible date, the actual specifications of these fire escapes from the Principal of the School. The Principal should state why it may be necessary to install two fire escapes and he should also state definitely the materials that may be required, such as bolts, solder, etc., to install the equipment when it arrives at the school. In other words, the Purchasing Agent is anxious to secure the information necessary to call for competitive bids. Your immediate attention to this matter will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. S.

The season has not been so dry this year and the water has raised in the lake. The Rev. Father would like to study the question more closely before going in any expense on this matter.\n\nDetails would be discussed when they will be ready to do the work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. S.

Indian Residential School at Washasco.\n\nThe question of having fire escapes for the Wabasca Indian Residential School has been discussed often. We have decided not to wait any longer.\n\nRev. F. L. Beuglet, the Principal, having talked of the question with Mr. Maure, Manager of Western Steel Products Corporation at Edmonton, I received a quotation from this firm. It appears that Mr. Maure has all the information needed for the making of these escapes, too. Should your Purchasing Agency decide to call elsewhere for quotations, specifications could be obtained from the Rev. Principal.\n\nLet me tell you that the installation can be made by our hired men at Wabasca. It will save the trip of a man of the firm supplying the escapes.\n\nPlease find enclosed Mr. Maure's letter and quotation. It explains the question plainly.\n\nThanking you, dear Mr. Phelan, for the attention you will give to this matter,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. S. LaJoie, O.M.I.,\nGrouard, Alta.\nOttawa,\nAugust 7, 1940.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Father Lajoie:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo with reference to the water system at the Wabasca R.C. School.\n\nI note that you consider a more powerful pump should be secured. Please let me have detailed information regarding the size and type of pump required and purchase will be made by our Purchasing Branch.\n\nWith reference to the 50 foot crib to be built into the lake to protect the water pipe you might let me know what material you require in order that it can also be secured by our Purchasing Branch. At the same time you might give me an approximate idea of the cost of the labour so that an accountable cheque may be sent to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. S. Lajoie, O.M.I.,\nAdministrator,\nGrouard, Alta.\nGrouard, Alta., July 30th, 1940.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey, Supt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nWhen Rev. F. Heuglet came to Grouard lately, I discussed with him the question of the water system at the Wabasca R.C. Indian School. The Principal is of the opinion that it is not necessary to send an Engineer to Wabasca, for they are not confronted with the same difficulties there as it was the case for other schools of the Vicariate.\n\nAt Wabasca, there is no question of drilling a well. The school is located close to the lake where an abundance of good water is available at a short distance of the shore at all times. The Rev. Father Principal explained that all that is necessary to do is to install a sheltered pump at the shore of the lake which would pump the water from the lake and force same into a pressure tank which has already been installed in the basement of the School and which has a capacity of 1000 gallons.\n\nA few years ago, a small automatic electric pump had been installed close to the pressure tank inside the school which pumped directly from the lake and forced the water into the pressure tank successfully, but in recent years, the level of the lake lowered and the water pipe had to be extended further into the lake. Of this action, resulted a considerable reduction of the capacity of the pump.\n\nIf a more powerful pump was secured and installed at the lake shore instead of being placed close to the pressure tank inside of the school and a 50 feet crib built into the lake to protect the water pipe from frost, this would solve the problem of the water shortage at Wabasca.\n\nThe crib suggested could be built in September when, as a rule, the lake is at the lowest point. Any direction given will be followed.\n\nYours truly,\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nSeptember 30, 1940\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Wabasca R.C.

Indian School, a sum of $600.00 will be absorbed by the Fire Escapes already ordered, leaving a balance of $900.00. We would like to use this for a set of Batteries.\n\nWould you please order a set of Batteries, 56 cells, 110 volts, of a capacity of at least 300 Amp. Hr., delivered at Slave Lake, Alta.\n\nAddress: R.C. Indian School, Wabasca,\nStation: Slave Lake, Alta.,\na/c Jos Gagn\u00e9.\n\nAccording to catalogs I have in sight, we could get from:\n\n1) Bruce Robinson Electric Co Ltd., set of 50 cells Batteries, W.R. 15 plates, 304 Amp.

Hr. $770.00 net, F.O.B., Edmonton.\n\nI take the liberty of giving these figures just to illustrate what we want. If the Purchasing Agency deems it advisable to deal with any other firm, let it be understood that we don't intend to object.\n\nMay I add that the old jars could be forwarded to the firm favored with the order if a fair allowance was made for.\n\nAs these batteries have to be hauled...\nninety miles out of the Railroad, there is a danger of freezing if they come at very low temperature. The best time would be between the 15th and the 20th of March. Please request the Company to communicate with me as soon as the order will have been received.\n\nAny supplementary information will be given if requested.\n\nThanking you in advance for the attention you will give to this matter,\n\nI remain,\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.

Residential School. Before submitting this request to the Purchasing Branch I should appreciate receiving definite information from you regarding the condition of the present batteries. They were supplied in the spring of 1935 at a cost of $491.40.\n\nIt is noted that the batteries which you now require will probably cost nearly $700.00.\n\nI presume that you are requesting a larger set than was previously supplied. It is also noted that you state in the latter part of your letter that if the new batteries are ordered they will be used for supplying electricity to St. Theresa Hospital as well as to the other buildings.\n\nI regret that favourable consideration cannot be given to batteries sufficiently strong to light the St. Theresa Hospital. We can only supply the type of battery that is required for lighting the Wabasca School. Please keep this in mind when replying to this letter as possibly a cheaper set of batteries than that mentioned in your letter of the 7th instant would be sufficient.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. S.

Hoey, Supt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nRe: Set of Batteries for\nWabasca R.C. Ind. School.\nAnswering yours of Dec. 18th, I beg\nto state that a large set of batteries has been applied for\nat the advice of experienced men in electricity. The heavier\nthe batteries, the cheaper the service.\n\nI admit that the present batteries have\nnot lasted very long, about six years. To appreciate the\nservice they have given, we have to keep in mind that the\nline has been extended to most of the buildings where arti-\nficial light is needed: cow-barn, chicken-coop, shops, etc.\nThe authorities have thought advisable to do so to minimize\nto the limit the danger of fire. There is no proof-fire\nbuilding at Wabasca. Would the fire start anywhere when it\nwinds, that it could sweep all the buildings in a few hours.\nExperience has proved that the best protection against fire\nis safety.\n\nMay I point out that the winter days are\nfar shorter in the North than in the South. For three months,\nthere is but a few hours of daylight. It requires more arti-\nficial light.\n\nAs to the lighting of the Hospital, ____\nSt-Martin's Hospital, not St-Theresa's as written previous-\nly ___ the service is not given free. The Mission is indem-\nnized for the service. In fact, the Hospital is not charging\nfor the hospitalization of the children of the School when\nthey need nursing. It means an appreciable service.\nI have no objection to a lighter set of batteries. The essential is to get one, the old one being run down. A keen study of the question has convinced me that on the long run we are better to get heavy batteries. Transportation cost is about the same and the service is better. Transportation of batteries to Wabasca is so serious a problem that I am aiming to reduce this work as much as possible. There is no summer road to Wabasca and batteries can not stand very temperature. It is why I have requested you to have the batteries shipped in the beginning of March when very severe weather is exceptional.\n\nThe firm getting the deal could be requested to take the old jars. An allowance of seventy five cents a piece is generally given for these jars. On 50 jars it would reduce the price of the new set by $42.00.\n\nPlease request the firm supplying the batteries the five copies of the bill to Grouard to be receipted. The batteries having to be shipped only in March, the invoices will not be back for the 1st of April if they are directed to Desmarais, Alta.\n\nLet me profit by the coming of a new year to thank you, Mr. Hoey, for the interest you pay to our problems. Your last letter proves to what extend you are devoting your energies to the cause you are working for. Be sure of my most complete cooperation.\n\nWith the best wishes of the season, I remain,\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. S.

In reviewing these accounts it is found that each of them shows the same number, namely, 150951. As all sewing machines are given a different number the Department would appreciate it if you would let me know if the two machines that you received are the same number and if not you should give me the correct number of each of them.

Ltd. to furnish you a complete description of the Wasner they supplied with our Wabasca School in 1938. This information should reach you without delay.\n\nMay I add that the Company informs me that \"after the present supply of material for making these machines is used up, no more will be available until after the War.\" It means that immediate booking would get a chance to pass through.\n\nThe rain keeps on. No threshing done yet. A true disaster. Most of the vegetables in the field and it is impossible to pick them up. The prospects are not bright. If we cant thresh, we will have to dispose of most of the cattle and pigs.

Ltd. Co. in connection with the Washing Machine for Wabasca. Let me point out that these people do not seem to have understood my request. I never asked them to send a tender; I only requested them to furnish to the Department a complete description of the machine they sold us a few days ago. They have not even answered the most important point, I mean the diameter and the length of the drum. I am writing back asking them to answer at the point.\n\nThe situation is not getting better here. It keeps on raining and snowing. Would the winter set in for good, we would be without any grain and fodder for pigs and cattle. Gathering the children has been a costly problem, too. It has been out of question of using a car for over a month. Our horses are exhausted; two will not recover.\n\nBelieve me, Dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. S.

We did not have the information at the time.\n\nThe inside dimensions of the inside cylinder are 34 inches diameter; and 38 inches length; the overall length of the washer is 65 inches, and the overall diameter, 37 inches, and the required floor space is 37 x 65.

If so, would you please let me know the price paid for this machine. I need these figures to prepare a report on special allotments for Wabasca.\n\nAs expected, we have lost a part of the crop, and what has been threshed is of a very low grade.

School. As you are aware, a specific amount is provided for each of the Church-owned schools and we cannot exceed that sum without securing an Order-in-Council. In the case of the Wabasca School an amount of $1200.00 was included in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment. The following expenditures have already been made:\n\nAthletic equipment ........................................... $39.30\nManual training equipment .................................. 67.10\nWashing machine ................................................ 607.00\nRefills for fire extinguishers purchased by Principal and refunded to him ........................................... 100.67\n\nTotal expenditure $814.07\n\nThis leaves a balance of $385.95. You will immediately see that we cannot pay in full the account which you have recently submitted. However, we are issuing a cheque for $304.10 covering the wages in connection with the sewage system for the week ending July 12 and the week ending July 19. We do not wish to apply for another Order-in-Council at the present time as we will likely have to apply for one later in connection with other schools and we wish to include all the transfers in one Order-in-Council.\n\nRev. A. Lajoie, O.M.I.,\nAdministrator,\nGrouard, Alta.\nAbout February 1 you should re-submit a voucher for $288.05 covering the balance of the wages for the sewage system and the erection of the chicken coop. When this is received an endeavour will be made to transfer funds from some other school which has not spent its full allotment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nGROUARD, Alta.,\nDecember 1, 1941.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nParliament Bldgs.,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nPlease find enclosed statement re: special allotments for Wabasca R.

Phelan, Chief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Department,\nParliament Bldgs.,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nDecember 22, 1941\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nAnswering yours of December 11th, I beg to state that I was not aware of the fact that a part of the allotment for the Wabasca R.C. School had been spent by the Department for equipment and extinguishers. Otherwise, I would not have presented the account for $592.15.\n\nWhile what you propose to square the difference could be done, I take the liberty of making another suggestion. I have withdrawn a sheet showing wages of $66.95 which is pretty close to the balance submitted. I am making the correction required to coincide as closely as possible to what is left. Should the Department agree to pay the amount submitted, $81.75, the account of Wabasca would be closed for the fiscal year 1941-42.\n\nMay I ask you to submit what has been paid for the other schools as I cannot draft an accurate account before knowing this.\n\nLet me point out that I had understood that the Department was to supply athletic and Manual Training equipment as well as fire extinguishers through a special fund allotted for these purposes. This will affect our finances. Though the amount is not considerable, when one has difficulty in balancing the budget, every dollar counts. It is to be hoped that the Department will find its way clear to assist the Schools facing the situation caused by the increase in the cost of living.\n\nI was accused of pessimism two years ago when I stated that our expenses would be increased by 12% to 15% within a year or two. I was far from expecting that the revenue would be decreased by 7.76%. As a matter of fact, our revenue has diminished by approximately 22%. In view of the crop failure, financing is a serious problem for us. We trust that the Department will realize that the situation has to be remedied in some way.\nI take this opportunity to thank you for what you are doing for our schools.\n\nWith the Compliments of the Season, I remain, Dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nYours truly,\nFather S. Lajoie, O.M.I.,\n\nGROUARD, Alberta.\n\nN.B.

It now appears that due to present conditions, limiting the use of metals for any purpose other than the war, it will not be possible to provide a metal cylinder. A wooden cylinder will be substituted. It is hoped that Beatty Bros. will be able to supply this machine at a very early date and as soon as they do you should certify the account and forward it to the Department in order that payment can be made from funds provided in the appropriation for the current fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

I am now advised by the Principal of the Wabasca R.C. School that when the equipment reached the school he found that a used motor had been supplied rather than a new one. He states that the used one has been returned and you have been requested to supply the proper motor. I should appreciate your advising me immediately if the new motor has been shipped to the school and, if not, when it will be delivered.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nBeatty Bros. Ltd.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa,\nMarch 16, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant with reference to the washing machine. I wrote to Beatty Brothers yesterday in regard to the motor and I trust you will receive one in the near future. However, as you are no doubt aware, such equipment is difficult to obtain and there may be some delay. If by any chance the motor does not reach you by the end of March, you should certify the account and forward it to Ottawa and we will deduct from it the cost of the motor. My reason for suggesting this is that the funds are available in the current year's appropriation and our fiscal year terminates on March 31.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. B. Rainville, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nWabasca R.C. Indian Residential School,\nDesmarais, Alta.\nEdmonton, Alberta, March 19, 1942\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nAnswering yours of March 17, your file No. 131-9-5, and to the attention of R. A. Hoey.\n\nThe reason we were obliged to supply a slightly used half horse power, 110 volt direct current motor with the washing machine shipped to the Indian School at W. house, was because no brand new, half horse power motor, 110 volt direct current was available at the time and we could get no assurance as to any possible delivery date. However, before we supplied the motor which we did, we took it to the expert electricians of this city, namely the Electrical Industries and had the motor checked and tested in every possible manner. The motor did not require any repair parts whatever, because it has been only slightly used, and therefore it was shipped out with the same guarantee mechanically, as a new motor.\n\nKindly note that this motor was not supplied by the manufacturers in Winnipeg of the washing machine. The motor specified of course was 110 volt direct current, and the manufacturers stated that the proper motor to operate their machine was a half horse power, and as we had that in stock and as the manufacturers of the washer advised us that it would be many weeks before they could secure a half horse power motor of those specifications, we decided, rather than to keep your customer waiting to supply this motor, but before doing so we did what we have stated above. The motor had been used very little in a town where it was necessary to supply. First of all, a direct current motor until such time as the 60 cy system was installed and then the change was made and during which short time the motor was in use, no injury whatever was done to the motor.\n\nover please\n\nPLEASE ADDRESS ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO THE COMPANY AND NOT TO INDIVIDUALS\nWe think therefore that the Principal of the school made a mistake in sending back the motor without first taking the matter up with us to get this assurance, and possibly we made a mistake in not advising him at the time the motor was supplied. However, he returned the motor before getting in touch with us, and then he wired us not to ship any motor because he was coming to the city and would discuss the matter with us.\n\nWhen he arrived, he expressed the preference for a 3/4 H.P. motor as he believed the 1/2 H.P. motor was hardly sufficient to operate the washer to capacity. This of course, was not in accordance with the specifications of the manufacturer. He said however, that they would gladly pay the difference between the cost of a 1/2 H.P. and a 3/4 H.P., if we could secure a 3/4 horse motor.\n\nWe immediately air mailed our factory at Fergus, Ontario, asking if they could supply a 3/4 H.P., 110 volt D.C. motor, and they replied that they did not have any in stock but had phoned the motor manufacturers who said they did have one and would hold it for three days, giving us an opportunity to order by wire if we decided to have it brought through. This we did and our understanding is that this 3/4 H.P. motor is now on the way to us and it will be forwarded to the Mission immediately on its arrival here.\n\nWe trust this information will be satisfactory and that everything will now be all right.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBEATTY BROS. LIMITED.\n\nPer: [Signature]\nEdmonton Manager.\nOttawa,\nMarch 26, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 6th instant and my reply of the 18th instant with regard to the washing machine supplied to the Wabasca R.C. School by Beatty Bros. Limited. I am now in receipt of a letter from them in which they state that they hope to have the new motor within a reasonable time.\n\nIt appears from a letter received from the firm that you have recently been in Edmonton and arranged to change the motor from \u00bd H.P. to \u00be H.P. It is extremely difficult for the Department to handle these purchases if Principals do not state exactly what they require. Once the order is placed you have no authority to change it, even though you are prepared to pay the difference from your own funds.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey\nSupt of Welfare & Training\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI just received your letter dated March 26,\nFile no. 131-9-5, regarding the Power Washing Machine\nyou supplied to our school. -- It seems that there is\na great deal of misunderstanding in all that which I\nwould like to help clarifying.\n\nYou state in your letter:\n1- \"It is extremely difficult for the Depart-\nment to handle these purchases if Principals do not\nstate exactly what they require\". -- In this very case\nof ours, my requisition, I believe, was plain enough:\nplease refer to your Purchase Order no. 9908, file no.\n15-20-1, dated the 14th of November 1941, which reads:\n\"One only Beatty Washing Machine, One Compartment,\nMetal Cylinder Type, capacity 50 lbs. or 30 Bed Sheets\nper load, equipped with 110 volt D.C. Motor\". This\nALL METAL Machine is equipped with \u00bd H.P. Motor.\n\nBut you advised that during the war it was\nnot possible to supply us an ALL METAL Washer and then\nthe Department substituted the ALL METAL by a WOODEN\none; this was perfectly all right with me.\n\nBut apparently, the WOOD CYLINDER TYPE Washer\nrequires a \u00bd H.P. Motor to operate. As a question of\nfacts, the Motor shipped with the Washer could not\nrun the Machine properly: it was a used motor and\nover-heating.\n\n2- You stated also: \"Once the order is placed\nyou have no authority to change it\". -- I am very sorry\nif I did interfere with your authority and please accept\nmy sincere apologies. When writing to Beatty Bros., my\nsole intention was to tell them that the motor\nshipped was not in proper order. And later when I met\nMr. Sterne, Mgr. in Edmonton I explained him (and he\nadmitted it) that \u00bd H.P. Motor was for a ALL METAL\nWasher and not for a WOOD CYLINDER TYPE which appa-\nrently wants more power.\nThere are the facts. Now I leave to you to see who should pay the difference between the two motors.... but I sincerely believe that I should not have to pay it from our own funds, as sufficient allocation have been provided for the Washing Machine and THE PROPER MOTOR to run it. Once more I do not ask for 1 H.P. or 3/4 H.P. Motor, but for the PROPER Motor to run the Washer that the Department have been good enough to grant us.\n\nI did not yet recieve the motor; if I do receive it, before using it, still I will wait hearing from you, making sure that everything is clear.\n\nI regret very much to give you all that trouble, but writting you I expect to help straighting up the matter.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. B. Rainville, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\nWabasca R.C. Indian Res. School\nDesmarais, Alberta\nApril 2, 1942\n\nMr. R.A.

Edmonton.\n\nHere inclosed you will find the invoices requested in your letter. I could not send them before as your letter reached us today.\n\nOnce more I would like to advise that I did not receive the motor, although I have been notified by Beatty Bros. that they were going to check on the matter.\n\nThanking you for the attention,\n\nI remain yours truly,\n\nRev.

An amount of $253 is available in our present year's appropriation for the purchase of the cement. The amount mentioned, of course, would have to include both the cost of the cement and the cost of its transportation to Slave Lake. The Principal wired today requesting that the order be placed at the earliest possible date, so that cement may reach Slave Lake before the snow roads are destroyed. When the snow is gone delivery from Slave Lake to the school is much more difficult.\n\nWhile the cement should be shipped to Slave Lake, Alberta, the account should be forwarded to the Principal at Desmarais, Alberta.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

However, there is an amount of approximately $253.00 unspent in the amount specifically provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at this school.\n\nImmediately on receipt of your telegram, I took up the matter with our Purchasing Branch and I was assured by them that they would place an order by telegraph for the amount of cement to be procured for $253.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. L. Beuglet, O.M.I.\nBishop's Residence,\nMcLennan, Alberta.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM REV. L. BEUGLET, O.M.I.,\nMcLennan, Alberta, dated March 7, 1945.\n\nWhile in Edmonton, I sent you a telegram asking you to let me know how matter stands regarding order for 400 sacks of cement for the Wahasca R.C. Indian School for the construction of a root-cellar, but received no reply as yet; if the Department has not ordered same, I would suggest that you permit me to handle the matter so I can hasten delivery before the snow roads go. Apparently it appears as though we will have an early Spring. Therefore, the matter is urgent. You will remember that I discussed this project with you during my recent visit to the Department.\nOttawa, March 12, 1945.\n\nDear Father Beuglet:\n\nYour letter of March 7 was received subsequent to my letter to you of March 6. As intimated in that letter, there was not sufficient money in the appropriation to provide 400 sacks of cement. However, the Purchasing Branch informed me on Saturday that they had bought cement to the value of approximately $253.00 and that arrangements have been completed for this amount to go forward immediately.\n\nIf you require additional cement, to bring the quantity to 400 sacks, please let me know and a subsequent order will be placed, but owing to the money situation it will not be possible to ship this until after the first of April.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend L.

Residential School; this is quite satisfactory however that was not the understanding when I was at your office. I asked you to ship 400 sacks of cement to the Wabasso R.C. Residential School for the construction of a root cellar and the amount was to be taken from the 1945-46 appropriation and I was to present accounts for the amount of $753.00 being the amount unspent in the current year's appropriation. You made a note of it on your desk but I suppose that same was misplaced. However, as your Purchasing Branch has now placed an order of cement for the amount of $753.00, this is quite satisfactory to us, and I will place order for the balance to make up the total number of 400 sacks required to make the job.\n\nWould you kindly advise me where the Purchasing Branch has placed the order so I can follow the shipment and hasten delivery; Apparently Spring will be early and I must see that this cement is delivered quickly so it can be freighted before the winter roads disappear, as otherwise I could not have it delivered to Wabasso before next Winter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL.

Beauglet, O.M.I. at McLennan, Alta., Sept. 13, 1948.\n\nRe: Wabasca\n\nFather Guimont called at the Bishop's House last night and explained that the floor of some of the rooms were in very bad condition and worn out, and required to be replaced. I believe that the sum of $1500.00 would cover the cost of replacing these floors and covering them with linoleum. I shall get in touch with the Principal and ask him to let me know the amount of flooring and the number of yards of linoleum required for the job, and shall give you this information as soon as it is available. If you will arrange to have the sum of $1500.00 available for these repairs, I believe that it would cover this expenditure. I understand that the flooring could be obtained locally at Wabasca but the linoleum would have to be secured by your purchasing branch.\n\nI believe, Mr. Neary, that the above requisitions are legitimate and trust that you will give them your very careful consideration.\n\n(Sgd) Rev.

School.\n\nWe have this amount provided in the current year's appropriation and you should forward as soon as possible a requisition for the flooring and linoleum.\n\nIt is noted that the flooring can be obtained locally and you may obtain a quotation and advise us at what price the lumber can be secured and the name and address of the person from whom purchase can be made.

By her application at domestic science she sets a splendid example to the younger ones. For this reason, I earnestly request that the Indian Dept. permit her to remain at school until she gets married.\n\n2) Veronique Gladu is a crippled and an orphan girl. Having neither relatives nor friends with whom she can go and live, the girl would greatly appreciate the favor of remaining at school until such time as someone will solicit her hand; Veronique is well pleased with the Sisters and is engaged in domestic science.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL.

Before any action is taken in this connection it is being referred to you for your opinion. A patrol into the Calling Lake district at this time will be quite difficult and in addition to the time it will take to make the patrol, the expense incurred will be considerable. There is also the possibility that this Indian will have his children in school for the opening of term. I hesitate to incur the expense of a patrol without the sanction of the Department.\n\n2. Will you please advise what action your Department wishes taken in this matter.\n\nEdmonton\n23-8-35\n\n(W. F. W. Hancock)\nA/SUFT. I/C C.I.B.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 35K 128-100 of the 23rd instant, attached to which was a report from Constable S. L. Grayson of Kinuso detachment regarding an Indian by the name of Gambler, from Calling Lake, taking his two daughters from the R. C. School at Wabasca against the wishes of the Rev. Principal. I am glad this matter was brought to the attention of our Department before any action was taken, as I am aware that the expense of getting these children back into school would be considerable. As I understand it now, the road from Athabasca to Calling Lake is practically, if not altogether, impassible, as sometime ago I intended to go up to Calling Lake and was advised against going at that time. Besides, when the policeman arrived there Gambler might not be there, and if he were it would then be a matter of taking the children from there to Wabasca, which is a long distance, and no doubt the only means of transportation would be by boat.\n\nThere is a merchant at Calling Lake by the name of Jas. H. McIntosh with whom I have had considerable correspondence from time to time, and I am directing a letter to him today pointing out what Gambler did and asking him if the Indian is there, and if so, requesting him to advise Gambler to take his children back to Wabasca. Personally I believe this is all we can do at the present time, and later on, if our Department at Ottawa wish to go to the expense of having the children back if the father has not already done so, the necessary action will be taken. I am submitting your report and a copy of this letter to our Department, and shall again communicate with you in the matter in due course.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Officer Commanding,\nR. C. M.

C. School at Wabasca, and it appears that before the holidays, Gambler was at Wabasca and took his two daughters out of the school without the permission of the Principal. If Gambler is in your district at the present time I would deem it a great favour if you would advise this man to return his children to the school immediately. The opening date is, I believe, September 3rd. I would ask you to please advise me in this connection at your convenience. This Indian's Treaty ticket is No. 105.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

Indian Res. School,\nDemarais, Alberta.\n\nOctober 14th, 1935.\n\nHis Excellency Bishop Guy,\nBishop of Grouard,\nMontreal, P.Q.\n\nDear Bishop Guy,\n\nEnclosed herewith statement of Jean Baptiste Yellowknee which you will kindly pass along to the Officials of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYou will remember the claims of the different Schools at Wabasca regarding the admission of Theodore Yellowknee, son of Jean Baptiste Yellowknee. In April last, I was advised by the Indian Agent at Driftpile that the above child was admitted at the Wabasca Church of England Indian Res. School on the strength of an affidavit signed by the father of the child, whereby he expressed the wish that his son, Theodore, be given institutional care at the Anglican School at Wabasca.\n\nThe father of Theodore thinks differently now; he regrets the steps that he has taken regarding the education of his son; he now expresses the wish that all his children, including Theodore, who is at present at Wabasca Church of England Indian Res. School, receive institutional care at the Wabasca R.C. Indian Res. School.\n\nIt has already been pointed out to the Department Officials that Jean Baptiste Yellowknee, his wife and all his children belong to the Roman Catholic Church; it is then not surprising that he regrets the steps that he has taken to have his son, Theodore, brought up in the Wabasca Church of England Indian Res. School.\n\nJean Baptiste Yellowknee requests that his son, Theodore, be transferred from the Anglican School to the Wabasca R.C. Indian School, where he should have been admitted in the first place, as the family is Catholic \"all through\".\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nBishop's Residence\nGrouard, Alberta\nCanada\n\nNovember 12th, 1935.\n\nMr. Harold W. McGill M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nReluctant as I may be I must again bring to your attention another affidavit in the matter of the education of children at Wabasca, Alta.\n\nI have told you many times and emphatically that the course initiated by the Department this year in accepting affidavits for the admission of children in different schools was a most disastrous one. My experience of 22 years with the Department vouches for such assertions. During the tenure of office of the Honorable Mr. Murphy I would not mention you a course followed by the Anglicans who would always call on the Minister in the face of any difficulty in order to obtain their point. I knew it was useless to discuss indefinitely such matters. I never agreed to the decisions and manner of acting of the Department. All I did was to protest against the manner of seeking admission for Catholic children in the Protestant school at Wabasca and the wholesale acception by the Department on the face of affidavits who in my estimation had and still have no value. I hope that Mr. Crerar, being a Presbyterian, will not be as popular with my Anglican friends and therefore the latter will not call on him for above matters. I have never treated such matters with Cabinet Ministers on account of their religion and I may say to the credit of the Honorable Charles Stewart, former Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, that he was never biased or prejudiced in his direction of Indian Education by his religious allegiance.\n\nI repeat what I have said before. The Anglicans have practically no children in their schools which rightly belong to them. If you were investigating you would find the majority to be Catholic or of Catholic origin. Let them work where they have someone to look after without trying by all possible means to drive Catholic parents from sending their children to their own schools.\n\nPlease give immediate consideration to Mr. Yellowknee's request and act accordingly. The answer may be sent to me and Rev. Fr. Beuglet at Desmarais.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Grouard.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gallagher, Commissioner for Oaths, on October 11th, 1935, in which he states that he rejects the affidavit which he previously made and expresses his desire to have all his children, including Theodore, educated in the Wabasca R. C. Residential School.\n\nPlease interview Yellowknee at once, and if he wishes his son, Theodore, removed from the Wabasca C. E.

According to the certificate of Health of Joseph, it is stated that the boy has broken glands on the neck, but as the disease is at an early stage, it is expected that it can be checked with constant medical attention.

C. Indian Residential School.\n\nAm I correct in presuming that the father of Augustin and Joseph Stuart was a White man? If so, do you consider the Department would be justified in accepting these children as grant-earning pupils? You know that, when we assume responsibility for these children, we often are obliged to incur considerable expense in future years.\n\nThe others appear eligible but two of them, viz., George Auger and Marie Anne St. Sauveur, are only four and five years old, respectively. There seem to be reasons why these should be admitted but they are really rather young. Possibly, you might have a chance to discuss their cases again with Father Beuglet. The admission of Charlotte Houle and Paul Loonskin is approved.\n\nThese cases bring out what we have previously discussed, viz., the advisability of concentrating recruiting efforts on Treaty Indian children. I think you will agree that this is the correct policy as, then, no one could question their eligibility, whereas, when children whose fathers are White are accepted, there is always the possibility of future inquiries and other White parents considering that their children should be admitted.\n\nI trust you reached home safely and found everything in good shape.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRt.

Lately, a surviving sister of William Stuart showed a paper upon which the father of Augustin and Joseph had written, when on his dying bed, that it was his wish that she look after his children after his death. Thus, she was appointed guardian of these children; this woman, as well as her husband, belongs to the Wabasca Bigstone Band and is paid the Indian annuities; their treaty number is 107. When the academic year is over, Augustin and Joseph are to spend the holidays with their guardians. Therefore, all reasons militate in favor of these children being admitted as grant-earning pupils.\n\nThere still remains to discuss the cases of George Auger and Marie Anne St. Sauveur. As I have already explained, the guardian of George Auger is Marie Anne Beaver, ticket no. 79, of the Wabasca Bigstone Band. As the child was only four years old, it was not without great hesitation that the School staff decided to admit the child to School. Being aware of the fact that Marie Anne Beaver was in the last stage of Tuberculosis and little George being in danger of contamination, the school staff thought it advisable to admit the child to school without further delay, and the staff were earnestly entreated to do so by the guardian herself.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6379, file 768-10, part 1)\nWith regards to the case of Marie Anne St. Sauveur, she was brought to school along with her brother by her mother about a year ago; the admission of the boy has already been approved by the Department. When the mother, Adelaide Crow, no. 25, of the Wabasca Bigstone Band, brought the children to school for institutional care, she explained that her husband was crippled and helpless and that she was in great straits. Little Marie Anne is in the kindergarten, is doing well, and is quite happy; it goes without saying that the Department are rendering a helpful hand to the afflicted parents in providing shelter, food, and education to these poor children. The fact that Marie Anne's mother is the daughter of Martha Emily Capstair Crow, ticket no. 26, aged and nearly blind, headman of the Wabasca Bigstone Band, explains well enough that the parents are living the Indian mode of life and would justify the Department in accepting Marie Anne as a grant-earning pupil.\n\nI remain Your Excellency's Obedient Servant.\n\nL.

With regard to the last paragraph it has been ascertained from the Department of Civil Aviation that the plane owned by Mr. Macintosh is a Curtis Robin machine and is not licensed to carry more than four persons, irrespective of size, which does not allow four children, and the Constable.\n\n2. Transport by team to Gelling Lake and Babask appears prohibitive in view of the cost and time necessary. The best solution appears to be to approach one of the aerial transport services, whereby we may have a plane in the vicinity in the near future, Gelling Lake being only a few miles to one side of their regularly travelled route between Fort MacMurray and Edmonton.\n\n3. Another point for consideration is that the children will not be equipped with clothing or bedding for trail travel of several days' duration at this time of the year.\n\nEdmonton\n4-11-36\n(D.C.P.

It is further noted that, should these children be taken by plane, the expenses incurred would be less than if the patrol were made by road and, of course, the time occupied would be very much shorter. The question of suitable clothing for the children would also have to be considered. The cheapest mode of transportation would be by Mackenzie Airways at a cost of approximately $90.00.\n\n4.

That I reserve the right to look after my children. During my absence my children were put at the Anglican School without my permission.\n\nI belong to the Roman Catholic Church, married in the Roman Catholic Church, and all my children have been baptized in the Roman Catholic Church, including Mary Agnes who is at present at the Anglican School at Wabasca. It is my wish that my children be brought up in the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nI never received money from the Indian Department for my children. When Mary Agnes, my daughter, who is now at the Anglican School, she was put at that school without my permission, during my absence in 1931. Afterwards my wife tried to take her out of school. When we got married, it was my wife's intention of putting any Agnes into the Roman Catholic School. My other children are not Treaty and I do not wish them to belong to Treaty. I am able to support all my children. During my absence my mother is unable or looking after my children. The R.C.M.P. have warned my wife and told her to behave herself and return to me and not misbehave herself anymore. I am taking her back.\n\nI have asked for protection against my wife taking the children away again.

Indian Residential School, even though she had been baptized in the Roman Catholic Church, as well as her daughter.\n\nI then stated that as Christine Beaver (Nanimahoo) was now married to me, I became the legal father of Marguerite Edith, which ipso facto conferred upon me the right to direct the religious faith in which she was to be brought up.\n\nAdditionally, I expressed the wish that Marguerite Edith be transferred from the Wabasca C.E.

Il n'y aura pas d'inconv\u00e9nient \u00e0 attendre jusqu'\u00e0 l'an prochain pour faire la \"septic tank\"; car l'on peut pour l'instant se servir de l'ancien syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9gout, et l'an prochain l'on compl\u00e9tera le travail.\n\nLes bonnes s\u0153urs se trouvent mieux avec leur nouvelle sup\u00e9rieure; tout le monde est \u00e0 son aise; il y a ga\u00eet\u00e9, bonne humeur et entrain.

Le D\u00e9partement, qu'a-t-il fait de ce document? on l'a mis au panier, je suppose. \"please investigate\".\n\n6) Johnny Cat a sign\u00e9 un affidavit, demande qu'on retire de la mission anglaise sa fille, Violet, car dor\u00e9navant il veut faire \u00e9lever ses enfants catholiques, vu que lui et toute sa famille appartiennent tous \u00e0 la religion catholique.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department does not consider that it should be called upon to provide per capita grant for pupils of the age of these two girls and we are not prepared to approve of their admission. As it would involve hardship to send them home during the winter months, they may remain in the school until the end of June, next, when arrangements should be made to have this family brought together and Hilda and Rose returned to their care.

A great dissatisfaction prevails among the Indians regarding J.B.Gambler's children, of Calling Lake, who have been stolen away from school by their parents. It was pointed out at the meeting that since the Gambler family was not compelled to respect the law and the school Principal, there would be several other families who would follow the same policy. Jean-Baptiste Gambler has threatened to shoot anybody interfering with his children. I would respectfully recommend that the Department give me authority to go and take the children back to school.

At the end of April of the same year the parents returned to the school asking to see their children; after having visited with the children the parents stated that they were homesick for their children and wished to take them home. Father Boulet, the superior, explained to them that they could not be able to take the children back with them, upon which the parents simply picked up the children and walked off with them.\n\nSub-Division:\n\n(3) Father Boulet called in Magistrate George Arnold, a special constable was apparently sworn in and the Father Mr. Gamble was brought up before the magistrate, where he simply told the magistrate and Father Boulet that he was not returning his children to school, and that it would be too bad for anyone attempting to take the children back, saying by words and signs that anyone attempting it would surely be shot; he apparently got away with this threat as nothing further was done and the children has been truant ever since.\n\nDetachment:\n\n(4) When the Indian Agent Mr. L'Heureux arrived in Wabasca to pay Treaty I interviewed him about this particular case, he informed me that the Indian Department has already paid $50.00 in holding these children back to the school.

Ist., during the Winter 1937-38 the\nR.C.Father Rainville from the mission Wanakow and told him\nto return the child to school, the father was told however\nthat no one was to take her back to school, and she has not\nreturned.\n\nDetachment\n(3) When attending the Indian Treaty Payments in\nWabasso this month I interviewed the Indian Agent Mr.E.F.\nL'Heureux, who stated that he wants this child returned to\nschool this fall Sept. Ist., as I understand that the Indian\nwas living on the Calling Lake reserve I obtained a written\nnotice directed from the Agent to Francois Cardinal, with\ninstructions for him to return the girl to school, I find\nhowever that this Indian has removed to a settlement on\nMoose Lake (known as Smith Lake on map.) about 20 miles\nNorth of Smith Lake, and I was therefore unable to serve the\nnotice on him, both Wanakow and Alphonse Beaver, another\nIndian family, I understand are usually employed as fisher-\nmen at Moose Lake, there is a road in from Smith that can\nbe traveled by car as the fish is freighted on by truck,\nand this Indian could be given his notice by driving in\nfrom Smith.\n\nP.

Upon our arrival at Moose Lake, enquiries were made for the above, and I was informed that this man had moved his family, and was now living some 20 miles north east at Island Lake. Enquiries made revealed that the only means of getting to Island Lake was on feet, as a horse could not get thru the deadfall. I later learned that this man came to Moose Lake at the first of each month for his old Age Pension cheque, that Mr. Forsland was trusted for same. He stated that he would arrange the above mentioned. I came to Smith on Sept. 8th. and received his notice from the writer regarding the matter of getting the child into the school at Wahsenea. Patrol returned to Smith where we arrived at 7.45 PM of same date.\n\n3. In speaking to the Indian Agent at Driftville re this matter, I informed him that up to the present time I had not been able to make any visits, but would do so on Sept. 16th. and he suggested that I advise this man that he would be given one week in which to get the child into the school, failing which action would be taken under the Indian Act.

Having no record of the boy's age at the Mission, for I think that he was baptized at Little Red River, and believing that he was sixteen years of age, I discharged him in September. The boy now claims that he is only 14 years old and asked to be taken back to school.\n\nThis is the boy that was badly beaten by Elzear Ominayak, treaty number 111 Whitefish and against whom Constable Brown asked permission to prosecute.\n\nThis boy is a brother of Elzear Ominayak's wife; he was being brought up by his brother-in-law. The boy's ticket number is 335 Wabasca Band.\n\nI believe that the boy's best place to stay is at school and I will keep him till he is sixteen, that is, until such time as he can earn his own livelihood, as he is being ill treated by his sister's husband.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) L.

C. Indian Residential School. The name of this pupil is shown on the March quarter return, and it would be very greatly appreciated if the usual application for admission and certificate of health form could be completed and submitted for our file.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Residential School.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith the application for admission which I had withheld from the quarterly return of the above school.\n\nThis child is the son of Peter Savard also known as St Sauveur and also Savoie, a halfbreed of Wabasca, and of Adelaide St Sauveur #225 Wabasca Band. These people are not married and have been a source of trouble to this Department and to the Provincial Department of Public Welfare.\n\nUnder date of November 10, 1936, Mr. M. Christianson then in charge of the Inspectorate, produced a Departmental ruling, possibly emanating from the Department of Justice, regarding parental ownership of illegitimate children and acknowledging our responsibility for the welfare of Adelaide St Sauveur and her children.\n\nOn September 2nd 1937, I received instructions from Mr. Inspector Schmidt, who had also investigated the case, to endeavour to place the children of this woman in a school as they became of age. The admission of Salomon St Sauveur is in keeping with these instructions.\n\nFurther investigation was made by Constable Brown, R.C.M.P. last January and as a consequence this woman has returned to her father on the Reserve and the man has left the district.\n\nI am of opinion that these children should be accepted not only to school but be made treaty Indians, members of the Wabasca Band. The Band itself has no objection to this. The children are aged 7, 5 and 3.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN. P.

Voici donc ce que je crois devoir satisfaire \u00e0 vos questions.\n\nLa raison principale, donn\u00e9e par les parents au principal de l'\u00e9cole St. John, qui d'un air de m\u00e9pris les accusait de le bafouer en mettant leur enfant \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole catholique, est que leur enfant leur appartient et qu'ils ont le Droit de mettre leur enfant dans l'\u00e9cole de leur choix. En cela de fait, ils ne font que jouir du droit naturel de l'homme de disposer de ses enfants en mati\u00e8re d'\u00e9ducation. Aussi ce droit des parents de choisir l'\u00e9cole de leurs enfants existe de temps imm\u00e9morial, comme le confirment feu M.l'Honorable Lomer Gouin et M.l'Honorable Ernest Lapointe, tous deux Ministres de la Justice, dans leurs lettres dont vous gardez copie dans les archives de votre bureau.\n\nDonc en somme cette raison devrait \u00eatre suffisante pour ratifier l'admission en question, de Georges Russell Auger.\n\nCependant, puisque vous tenez toujours \u00e0 venir \u00e0 la question de religion, dont la loi civile devrait faire abstraction; car en bonne v\u00e9rit\u00e9 si un individu manque \u00e0 ses devoirs de conscience, elle n'a pas la charge de lui faire rectifier ses actes; mais peu importe, venons-en \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9.\n\nIl est prouv\u00e9 d'apr\u00e8s les documents ci-inclus et les t\u00e9moignages de sa femme, que Augustin Auger a \u00e9t\u00e9 baptis\u00e9 dans la religion catholique et qu'il n'a jamais pratiqu\u00e9 la religion protestante, qu'au contraire qu'il a toujours affirm\u00e9 aux insinuations de sa femme, qu'il consid\u00e8re la religion catholique comme la vraie et que c'\u00e9tait sa foi. Si toutefois il a failli \u00e0 l'un ou l'autre de ses devoirs, comme cela peut arriver malheureusement \u00e0 chacun de nous, en fait r\u00e9paration en faisant b\u00e9ni son mariage devant un pr\u00eatre catholique le 4 f\u00e9vrier dernier et en faisant une d\u00e9claration avoir la conscience en paix, si surtouts, un avenir prochain il doit compara\u00eetre devant Dieu; et le m\u00eame motif il a pris la d\u00e9cision de faire \u00e9lever ses enfants dans la religion catholique, qui est celle de son bapt\u00eame et de son enfance.\nCertificate of Baptism\n\nTHIS IS TO CERTIFY\n\nThat Joseph Henry Auger\n\nChild of Augustin Auger\n\nand Gurty Alok\n\nborn on the 24th day of July 1906\n\nwas BAPTIZED\n\non the 8th day of August 1906\n\nAccording to the Rite of the Roman Catholic Church\n\nby the Rev.

I have approached them two or three times about putting their son George Russell in School, but each time they have said they would like to wait a little longer, as the father is very often sick and the boy is a help at home.\n\nAbout the middle of January August was taken to the hospital at Desmarais, and his family has been staying there with him. Not long ago Gertie came to see me, and she told me that the priests at Desmarais had been asking her to put the boy George in School there. If the boy is to be put into School, I certainly feel he should be put into the Church of England School at Wabasca. Until the time that the family went to Desmarais, when August was taken to the hospital, there had never been any question that George would enter the Church of England School at Wabasca.\n\nThe eldest son, Joseph, is a registered pupil of this School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

School.\n\nAs August Auger had declared to me at the 1939 Treaty that he was a Protestant and as he has an older son in the Protestant School I have asked the principals of both schools to give theirs and the parent's reasons for sending his child to a school other than the protestant school.\n\nI am now in receipt of the principals' letters which I enclose for your information.

If he is in a residential school you should arrange to have him return to his parents immediately.\n\nAbout the middle of August you should interview the father and ascertain what religion he is recognized as professing and advise the Department. When this information is received further consideration will be given to the religious auspices under which Georges Russel Auger is to be educated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. N.

I heartily recommend her admission at Grouard.\n\nBy the way, I may say that the Indian lads are doing very well in their farming operations at Wabasca. Five are now married and believe me, their young brides are proud of their homes furnished by the Department. The boys are now busy putting up plenty of hay in store for next winter. They will soon begin cutting their first crop of oats. Next winter, instead of buying oats which they usually paid one dollar per bushel to freight merchandise from Slave Lake to Wabasca, the boys are now realizing the great saving growing their own oats means to them.\n\nAs the lads do not have a machine to thresh their crop, I have arranged with them to do their threshing at the school, but it is hoped that they will be given one for next year, even though, it be only a small second hand one. I will discuss the matter with Mr. Agent L'Heureux first opportunity.\n\nWith every good wish and best regards,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.

Residential school.\n\nI wish to report that I have interviewed the child's father on June 15th last. He was sick and looked at death's door. Doctor Conroy was in attendance.\n\nIn answer to my questions, August Auger stated definitely that he had returned to the faith of the Roman Catholic church in which he was born. There were exterior signs in his teepee showing that he was professing the Roman Catholic faith.\n\nHis wife, Gertie Alook, stated that she had been born and brought up in the Protestant Church, but that to comply to her husband's desire she herself had become a catholic rently.\n\nAugust Auger reiterated the desire to have his children sent to a Roman Catholic School and that his son Joseph, aged 12, presently in the Wabasca C.E. School, be discharged from that school and transferred to the Catholic School at Desmaraies.\n\nThere appears no possibility of returning either of these two children to their family which is destitute following the lengthy illness of their parent. I have found it necessary to authorize the full complement of sick and iron rations and according to the doctor this man will not regain his health before many months.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nN. P.

Residential School.\n\nShe has already attended that school for four years, her roll number was 0147. Last year her health broke down and as a consequence she was discharged. As her health has improved and is apparently normal it is desired to have her reinstated to her old number.\n\nReferring to the physical examination report for that child I find that it has been made by Sister Denis D'Alexandrie, the school nurse, and find that it lacks indication as to her previous illness.\n\nI take this opportunity to say that the Department has at Wabasca a paid resident Nurse in charge of a health unit. I am of opinion that the examination of prospective pupils should be made by her, not by the school nurse.\n\nAs regards this child, Eliza Auger, I am not satisfied. My information was that she showed signs of mental deficiency at the time of her discharge and I am submitting the application with the recommendation that admission be postponed until her examination has been made by Nurse Hamas.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nN.

L'Heureux, agent at Driftpi. I forwarded according to your desire the applications for Admission at our School of Charles Gullion, No. 168 and of Catherine Houle.\n\nI enclose a copy of them, which have been sent back with a note of the Agent. I thought that at an interview given to Rev. Father B. Rainville in your office, it was said that those children were eligible for admission in our Boarding School. So I was quite surprised of the answer we got from the agency, which has not the knowledge of what was decided then.\n\nSo I will appreciate very much, you can fix the matter for the best interest of all the parties concerned.\n\nWith my thanks, I am Yours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nP/S. Perhaps you will be interested to read a letter received by the staff from England, and written by an ex-pupil of the St. Martin's Indian School, and who is serving in the Oversea Canadian Army.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa,\nOctober 13, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to applications that you have submitted for Charles Gullion and Catherine Houle. The Department has been unable to locate the letter of August 20 which you state was written to Mr. L'Heureux.\n\nHowever, while we requested application forms for the two children in our letter of July 27, this was only a routine request due to the fact that the names had been shown on the June quarter return without any applications having been submitted. The Department was not in a position to decide if the children were eligible for admission until we had reviewed the application forms.\n\nAs you are probably aware, the Department has deferred final decision regarding the discharge from Indian residential schools in your district of pupils whose parents are not now recognized as Indians. This decision does not apply to new pupils admitted within the last few months and whose applications have not been considered. In the cases under review the Department has decided that George Gullion and Bernard Houle cannot be recognized as Indians and consequently their children are not eligible for admission to an Indian residential school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

School. As you have previously been informed, it is not our intention to discharge children this year whose parents have been refused Treaty, if approval of their admission to a residential school had been approved previous to June 30, 1942. Under these circumstances it is not necessary to take any action regarding pupils 157, 160, 0181, 0136 and 0153.

Mines & Resources, OTTAWA, Ont.,\n\nI am in receipt of a request from Treaty No. 111 Cree Band at Whitefish Lake, Mrs. Elizab Omizayak, to have two of her children, Theresa and Bella, transferred from the R.C. Indian Residential School at Wabasca to the R.C. Indian School at Grouard. The reason for this request is that at the present time the children are so far away from the parents that they cannot visit them. I have enquired into this request and it would seem to be of a reasonable nature and the parents are willing to pay the cost of this transfer. I have discussed this matter with Rev. Father Serrand of the Joussard School and he advises me that the Missions have no objection to such a transfer where the circumstances warrant it. Unless this is prohibited by Departmental regulations I believe that this would be beneficial in this case.\n\nI have advised the parents that I am submitting their request to the Department for approval.\n\nW.B. Skead\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe two girls in question are 0134 and 0143 at Wabasca (St. Martin's) school.\n0134. Theresa Wanolah\nAge: Full Aug. 1935\n\n0143. Bella Wanolah\nAge: Full Apr. 1936\nOttawa,\nOctober 28, 1943.\n\nThe Acting Indian Agent, Driftpile, Alta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 21st instant, the Department approves the transfer of pupils 0134 and 0143 from the Wabasca R.C. Residential School to the Grouard Residential School. You should so inform both Principals.\n\nThe admission of the following children to the Wabasca R.C. School is approved:\n\nLouis Gambler\nMalcolm Joseph Auger\nPaul Lucien Beaver\nMarie Rose Auger\n\nAs the Department only requires one copy of each application form the duplicates are returned.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n### DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | Name                  | State of Education | Grade |\n|-----|-----------------------|--------------------|-------|\n|     | Helen R.

Demers,\nIndian Agent,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI'm forwarding you three applications concerning girls over sixteen years of age but who have previously attended our school here.\n\nAccording to the indigence of their family, it is quite hard for the parents to support these girls and keep them at their home and feed and clothe them.\n\nSo the parents asked me if I could take them at the Mission and give them work.\n\nI would appreciate very much if the Department would consent to give the grant for these special cases, as we are keeping the girls here and at the same time we teach them the post-course of Household science.\n\nLast year we have kept them during seven months, and this year again their parents asked me to take them and since the month of June the girls are here at the Mission.\n\nAs you know the mode of life of our Indians here in Wabasca, it is a protection for these girls to get a special attention from the Sisters and at the same time to increase their knowledge in domestic training.\n\nHoping that you will give your attention to this demand, and that the Department will give its approval as he did before regarding similar cases,\n\nI remain sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal,\nWabasca R.C. Indian School,\nDesmarais, P.O.; Alberta.\nOttawa, 2nd November, 1945.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th ultimo, it is extremely difficult to approve the paying of a per capita allowance for girls of 18 and 19 years of age. The time must come when they are obliged to make their own way in life. It is simply impossible to keep children in school at such a late age if we are going to have accommodation for younger pupils reaching the school age.\n\nHowever, we will make a special exception in these cases and will allow a grant for them until June 30th, 1946, provided they are within the authorized number for which a grant is allowed at the Wabasca R.C. School.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend Benoit Guimont, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nWabasca R.C.

SCHOOL\nDESMARAIS, P.O., ALBERTA.\n\n16th February 1948\n\nMr. Phillip Melan\nChief Training Division,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMay I beg your attention on the following matter.\n\nOn the eleventh of December 1947 the Indians held a meeting under the presidency of the Indian Agent of Slave Lake Agency. There were many complaints against the Principal of the Church of England School at Wabasca, concerning the discipline, food and the way the children were treated at the above mentioned school. The parents are not satisfied.\n\nOn the next day of the meeting four Indians came here to ask me if I would take their children at our school. I told them to wait if there would be a change after that the Anglican has been advised of these complaints.\n\nOne of the Indians, George Car, tr: 154 waited two weeks and felt that there was no change for the better so he decide to bring his children here; he went to get them with his wife and brought them over here.\n\nWhen Mr. Gooderham came in January, this case came up; Mr. Gooderham had a feeling that those children should be taken back to the Anglican Mission; but the father and mother of the children will no agree to do so, as they are perfectly satisfied the way the children are cared here and want them to stay here.\n\nThis family is recorded as protestant, but I understand the situation of whose parents whose desire is to have their children well brought up and well cared; and I believe that they have the natural right to do so towards their own children; this according to a letter from the Honourable E. Lapointe dated 23rd Nov. 1936 to our Principal of the time, also in a previous letter sent to Grounded by the Honourable Lomer Gouin on 7th Dec. 1922.\n\nI cannot understand why these children could be forced to go back to a school where they do not receive the proper treatment.\n\nThe three children are in our school at present, and I am waiting on your decision before making any application for their admittance.\n\nI remain sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nFebruary 25, 1948.\n\nDear Father Guimont:\n\nWe have your letter of the 16th instant with reference to the children of George Oar.\n\nI understand from your letter that the Oar family are recognised as Protestants. Sub-section (2) of Section 10 of the Indian Act reads as follows:\n\n\"No Protestant child should be assigned to a Roman Catholic school or school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices and no Roman Catholic child should be assigned to a Protestant school or school conducted under Protestant auspices.\"\n\nIn view of the section of the Indian Act just quoted, the Department is not able to approve the admission of the Oar children to the Wabasca R.C. School as grant earning pupils and their names should not be included on the quarterly return.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nRev. B.

He also says that for the time being, he is not taking any interest in them.\n\nIn this connection, Reverend Father Guimont wishes to bring to your attention the case of the Johny Cat family concerning which there was considerable correspondence in November 1944. At that time Mr. Hoey ordered the Protestant Minister to dismiss the Cat Children who were to be registered at and attend the Wabasca R.C. Indian Residential School. This Reverend Gentleman paid no attention to Mr. Hoey's letter. The two eldest children of this family were baptized Catholic and the third one Protestant. Moreover, the three youngest children were also baptized Catholic. The children of this family are in the Wabasca Anglican Indian Residential School.\n\nReverend Father Guimont also wishes me to bring to your notice the case of the Harvey Alook Family. It is true that the father was Protestant but he was married to a Catholic girl in the Catholic Church. Their first seven children were all baptized Catholics. They were brought to the Church for that purpose by their parents themselves. Moreover when one of these children died, a few years ago, the parents asked the Catholic Priest to attend the funeral service. These children are at the Wabasca Anglican Indian Residential School.\nThe above two cases are mentioned to illustrate the local difficulties.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nDecember 3, 1948.\n\nMr. G.S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nHigh Prairie, Alta.\n\nWe are in receipt of a letter protesting against the attendance of Johnny Cat in the Wabasca C.E.

Demers was advised that we were not prepared to approve the admission of Joseph and Johnny Cat to the Wabasca C.E. Residential School.\n\nWe have recently been informed that the children are still in that school in spite of the instructions contained in the letter to which we refer above. Please investigate the matter and let us have a report.\n\nWe also have a protest regarding the Harvey Alock family. We have been informed that their first seven children were all baptised Catholics and at the time one of the children died the funeral service was conducted in a Catholic church.\n\nPlease investigate the circumstances regarding this family and advise us.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJohnny, who became of school age at that time was also admitted to the R.C. School but was later removed by his father to the C.E. School.\n\nIsabel began school at the C.E. School.\n\nReverend A.L. Davies stated that he was informed by Mr. Landry that Johnny and Isabel were to attend the C.E. School.

Since school opened on Nov. 4th we have had the entire care of 10 children, besides giving a good dinner to the 6 or 7 day scholars that attend. Being quite single handed here I was fortunate enough to secure the services of a lady teacher. So considering the many extra expenses we are incurring, I sincerely hope that you will be able to give me the entire grant of $200.00 for the present fiscal year.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.) W. G. White (Revd.)\n\nHon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOTTAWA, 23rd March, 1904:\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of your letter of 14th January last in which you ask that you may be allowed the entire grant of $300.00 for the present fiscal year as teacher of the Whitefish Lake school at St Andrew's Mission, Athabasca, I beg to say that the Department regrets that it cannot meet your wishes as it can make no payment covering any time prior to the opening of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary\n\nRev. W. G. White,\nSt Andrew's Mission,\nWhitefish Lake, Athabasca.\nvia Edmonton,\nAlta.\nThe Rt. Honorable\n\nThe Minister of the Interior.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to make application for a per capita Grant for fifteen pupils at our school, Episcopal, at Whitefish Lake, near Lesser Slave Lake.\n\nWe have just put up a new building which though not quite completed has been made comfortable for the winter, and I am informed by the missionary in charge that there were 17 children, 12 boys and 5 girls, in residence, besides day scholars.\n\nAs the expense of keeping these children in addition to the salaries of the master and matron is very considerable I shall be very thankful for as large a Grant as you can make.\n\nWishing you all the Compliments of the Season, and with great respect,\n\nI am\n\nvery faithfully yours\n\nW. D. Reeve\nBishop.\nThe Rt. Honorable\n\nThe Minister of the Interior.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe are much in need of school material - Reading Books, Copy Books, Slates, Pencils, very simple Grammars, and Arithmetics, and also Geographies, at several of our Schools, Chipewyan, Kapuskaw, Whitefish Lake, Christ Church Mission, and Spirit River.\n\nIf you could kindly send a good supply to me here I could distribute them as they are severally needed, and thus save some trouble and expense probably to your Department.\n\nAsking you kindly to take this into favorable consideration.\n\nI am\n\nvery faithfully yours,\n\nW. A. Rees,\nBishop.\nOttawa, December 31, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nIn connection with the application of the Right Reverend W. D. Reeve, Bishop of Athabasca and Mackenzie River, for a per capita grant for the Church of England school at Whitefish Lake, I may say that on my last visit to this point, in September, last, the Rev. D. G. White, in charge of the mission there, had erected a very suitable building for a school; though not very large, it is large enough to accommodate 30 or 40 pupils, and it is, in my opinion, a very suitable place for a boarding school.\n\nFrom the correspondence received you will see that the Bishop has expressed a wish that the Department grant a per capita allowance for 15 pupils. He claims in his letter to have 17 children on the roll, 12 boys and 5 girls, besides day scholars; and I think the attendance would, probably, another year be over 30.\n\nI would recommend the Department to grant substantial aid to this school, as it is the only school in that section of the country.\n\nInspector, Treaty 8.\nOttawa, January 3, 1907.\n\nRight Reverend Sirs\u2014\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 16th inst., applying for a per capita grant for 15 pupils for the Whitefish Lake Boarding School, which is conducted under the auspices of the Church of England, and in reply I beg to say that the same will be dealt with when the supplementary estimates are under consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nRight Reverend Sir,\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Right Rev. W. D. Reeve, D.D.,\nBishop's House,\nAthabasca Landing, Alta.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6380, file 769-1, part 1)\nOttawa, January 3, 1907.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 18th inst., asking for a supply of school material for the several schools conducted under the auspices of your Church in your diocese, and in reply I beg to say that, if you will be good enough to forward separate requisitions for each school named on the forms sent you under separate cover for that purpose the same will be attended to and the material shipped to your address.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nRight Reverend Sir,\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D.

I have sent a copy to each of the schools in question, so that the teacher himself may fill it up according to his requirements, and they shall be forwarded to you in due course.\n\nI am very faithfully yours,\n\nW.

HALSON\n268 Albany Avenue\nToronto, Ont.\n\nTo the Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am forwarding you receipt receipt\nand enclose list of sales sent to Boarding Schools\namounting in all to $140.81.\n\nTwo appeals have come to the Woman's Auxiliary from Principals of Schools which the Society has not been able to respond to. I venture to lay them before you as both would be beneficial to the work being carried on. Rev. W. G. White of Oshawa asks for a wagon for conveying goods to the school from lesser slave lake. Rev. R. Holmes of Christ Church Peace River asks for help in the shape of farming implements etc. There is quite a lot of land belonging to the Mission which if it could be worked would be a source of revenue to the School or also a means of instruction in farming to the pupils. Would it be possible for Mr. Dept. to give any assistance toward these needs?\n\nI am Sir your obedient servant,\nKate E. Halson\nGen. Sec. Can. Soc. Rev.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6380, file 769-1, part 1)\nOttawa, August 28, 1907.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd inst., asking for assistance for the Whitefish Lake and Christ Church schools in the way of farming implements, etc., and in reply I beg to say that as these schools are only recognized by the Department as day schools, not boarding schools, and are paid only the usual day school grant, it regrets that it is unable to accede to your request, as there is no provision for expenditure of this class in connection with day schools.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMiss Kate E.

The receipt of it was acknowledged, and I was told that it would be brought forward in due course; but I have heard nothing more about it.\n\nI shall be thankful to hear from you re the above as soon as possible, and am,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nW.H.Reeve,\nBishop.\nOttawa, March 16, 1896.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 4th inst., and in reply to that portion which deals with your previous application for a per capita grant for a school at Whitefish Lake I beg to say that the whole Indian school question is at present under consideration by the Department and until a settled policy is arrived at, a definite answer cannot be given you with regard to a grant for the school referred to.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nRight Reverend Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. W.D. Reeve, D.D.,\nThe Alexandra,\nUniversity Avenue,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, April 27, 1908.\n\nOn April 37, inst., the Indian Commissioner was informed that the grant for the Lesser Slave Lake (C.E.) Boarding School might be transferred to the Whitefish Lake school, as requested by His Lordship Bishop Holmes in a letter dated April 3, 1906.\n\nSee File 12295-4\n\nA.F.M.\nOttawa, March 4, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nOn February 25, last, a circular letter was addressed to you, asking you to forward the usual report on your school for publication in the annual report of the Department.\n\nIn addition to the information asked for therein, which is largely of a statistical nature, the Department would be pleased to receive from you, for its own use, a special report on the Indians in the neighborhood of Whitefish Lake and the educational work you are doing among them.\n\nThe wish of the Department is to have on record complete and reliable information on the whole situation in your district to which it may refer when matters pertaining to Indian work in that part of the West come up for consideration.\n\nThis report should deal with the character and habits of the Indians and the nature of the pursuits they follow and should state whether any of them are permanently located. With reference to the educational work you should say\n\nRev. C. D. White,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Andrew's Mission Boarding School,\nWhitefish Lake, Alta.\n\nVia Athabasca Landing.\nsay where the children are recruited and whether those in\nthe school are continuously in residence and along what\nlines your efforts with these children are directed.\n\nThe Department would also like to know whether\nanything is being done to improve the condition of the\nIndians themselves with whom you come in contact in\nrespect to their methods of living, sanitation, etc.\n\nThe foregoing will give you some idea of the nature\nof the information desired by the Department and anything of\ngeneral interest that you can add will be gladly received.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nFrank Bedley Esq.,\nDeputy Sect. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSo far we have only had a monthly mail in this country, as our P.O. Office is Lesser Slave Lake, 40 miles from here, we do not get our mail in time to answer by the returning mail. This was the case with regard to the circular sent to me dated Feb. 25 asking for my Report. I am sending by the first mail it was possible to send after receiving the circular. I would mention that in addressing letters to St. Andrews Mission White Fish Lake, we have in the past had letters very much delayed, as there is another White Fish Lake near Edmonton so we drop the White Fish Lake and put Lesser Slave Lake or put via Lesser Slave Lake.\n\nI remain Sir,\nyours truly,\nC.D. White\nOttawa, May 31, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th inst., and in reply I beg to say that your directions with reference to your address have been noted.\n\nOn March 4, last, you were asked for a report in connection with your work at the Whitefish Lake school. Up to the present time no reply has been received, and it may be that the letter has been delayed. If not received, kindly advise the Department by return mail.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. C.D. White,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Andrew's Mission Boarding School,\nLesser Slave Lake, Alta.\nHon: Sir,\n\nThe Bishop of Athabasca, desires respectfully to lay before you the position of affairs in the Indian schools.\n\nHe assumed office in the Diocese last April, and has since personally visited, and on the spot gone most carefully into the conduct and upkeep of the following schools:\n\nre Napiskam School -\n35 scholars were supported, educated & clothed in this school during the year ending June 30th last.\n\nThe staff maintained was sufficient for this number.\n\nHe found a sum of $1000 deficit on the working expenses of the school for the year ending June 30th last. This is accounted for mainly by the fact that the per capita grant was for 16 children only.\n\nThis manifestly is inadequate, and he begs the Department to increase the grant to the number of 25.\n\nWith such a grant he conceives the possibility of maintaining the school in a state of efficiency.\n\nre White Fox Lake School -\n20 children were supported, educated & clothed in this school during the same period. The staff was sufficient.\n\nHere he found a deficit of $500. This is largely accounted...\nfor by the fact that the per capita grant is for 15 children only. Non-Treaty Children could be admitted if the grant might be increased to allow of this.\n\nThe Department are aware that the Missionary Society of the Church of Canada absolutely declines to give any assistance towards the expenses of Indian Schools.\n\nThis is the only occasion on which any appeal has been made by the Bishop for help to meet such deficit.\n\nHe therefore appeals with the greatest confidence under these exceptional circumstances, and hopes for the assurance that these increased grants will be made, and also generous assistance will be sent towards removing these deficits.\n\nHe will undertake that in future the expenditure shall not exceed the income.\n\nI am, Honorable Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Rev) E.J. Robins\nDiocesan Treasurer.\n\nRe: Hon. Frank Oliver.\n\nP.S. I understand that the grant for the Indian Boarding Schools, west of the Great Lakes is now $100 per capita, instead of $72. Will you please verify this?\nOttawa, 4th October, 1908.\n\nRev'd Sir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd September, addressed to Supt. General, Indian Affairs dealing with the financial position of the Indian Boarding Schools at Wapuskow and White Fish Lake. The requests made by the Bishop of Athabasca will receive careful attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev'd E. F. Robins,\nAthabasca Landing,\nAthabasca.\nA Report on the Indians in the neighborhood of Whitefish Lake and other matters\n\nSituation\nWhitefish Lake lies north of Lesser Slave Lake, as the settlement of the latter lake is at its west end, the trail runs in a north-easterly direction to Whitefish Lake; for the first 13 miles it passes through a growing prairie, the soil of which is good, and capable of producing all kinds of cereals and roots, the rest of the trail runs through a bush country.\n\nNearly all the houses in this settlement are built on the East shore of the small Whitefish Lake, size about 34 miles by 15, it is joined to the big lake which is about 21 miles distant by a small river named Whitefish River.\n\nSituation\nThese lakes are well known to all Indians, other lakes Long Lake lies 17 miles N.W. from Whitefish Lake, Fish Lake 15 miles from Whitefish Lake, Prairie Fish Lake, Lake and Buffalo Lake about 50 miles N.W. of here, two Otter Lakes, in the same direction about 110 miles from here, Fish Lakes about 125 miles N.W. of Whitefish Lake, Peace River is about 150 miles from Fish Lakes, Trout Lake 70 miles due East of Whitefish Lake, Cranberry Lake 50 miles N.E. from here, Lune Lake 50 miles North of here, Ghost Lake 6 miles West of here, another small Whitefish lake about 20 miles S.E. of here, there are a number of other smaller lakes besides these.\n\nSoil\nThe soil on the shores of this lake is fairly good, a dark loam but shallow, when manured is capable of producing a good garden, some\nSoil:\nof the higher land the soil is deeper though of a lighter character, will stand more cropping without manure. At Prairie and Buffalo Lakes the soil is the best in this district, here some of the Indians have ploughed up small patches and put in potatoes and garden seeds, the produce of which I have seen, considering the time they were put in, they were very good crops.\n\nHay Lands:\nThere is an abundance of hay of a good quality found on the shores of the big Whitefish Lake, especially in a dry season on the small one there is a limited amount only found on one side. At Prairie and Buffalo Lakes the hay is plentiful and of a fair quality.\n\nTimber:\nIn the vicinity of Prairie and Buffalo Lakes a considerable amount of good sized Spruce timber is to be found.\n\nFish:\nWhite fish are not found in all the lakes in this district; in the three Whitefish Lakes they abound, and are of a fine quality, there are also many other varieties found in these waters, some white fish and other kinds found in Ghost Lake, no fish in Buffalo or Prairie, they are shallow lakes, no white fish but all other kinds at Long Lake, white fish are found at Fish Lakes, but of a smaller size than those at Whitefish Lake; some Trout at Cranberry Lake, no white fish at other Lakes.\n\nOccupations of Indians:\nAll the Indians in this district are engaged in trapping during the winter, some occupy all their time, others a part of their time, those who own horses and sleighs, have the...\nopportunity of doing some freighting or other work with their teams, while they are not engaged in looking after their traps.\n\nIn the Spring most of them put in a small garden of potatoes and vegetables, we impress upon them the importance, and the benefit from so doing (they are beginning to realize it now) we always have a good garden ourselves and provide them with a few seeds in the Spring so that they may follow our example, they are very fond of certain kinds of vegetables.\n\nThe haymaking season is quite a busy time with our Indians, it begins the latter part of July through August into September, they put up hay for their own stock, and thus the opportunity of making money by putting up hay for sale.\n\nThe next busy season which is a very important one, starts just before the freezing up of the rivers and lakes, during this time they catch their winter supply of fish. The exception to this rule, are only Indians who do not keep to this rule of fishing, are those on the shores of fish lakes, they begin their fishing through the ice about Christmas time.\n\nThe biggest settlement of Indians is on the shores of the smaller of the two Whitefish lakes, the Indians here have permanent log houses which they use in Winter close to their buildings they have their garden plot, and some a couple of acres of wheat, barley or oats, all fenced in.\n\nWe strongly encourage each family to have...\nOccupations of its separate house, and we approve of the Indians and open fire place apart from a stove they may have, as this provides a constant ventilation, otherwise they would their houses unbearably hot and close, when an Indian is sick his one great idea is to keep his house as hot and close as possible.\n\nAt Fish Lakes there are about 30 Indians they have dwelling houses, and are permanently stationed there, as whitefish are found in these lakes it ensures it as a dwelling place for Indians, these people here are especially noted for their industry. There are about 25 Indians residing at Prairie Lake, as there are no fish in this lake, they do not stay so permanently as at other places where the whitefish abounds, as the people at this lake have a few cattle and horses they put up what hay they need to feed their stock during the winter months.\n\nLong Lake is a place where Indians stay during the winter, and often visited in summer time. At Cranberry Lake there are a few houses which are used by the Indians in winter as this is one of their hunting grounds. There are about 50 Indians residing at Trout Lake. At Ghost Lake there are about 15 people, here they permanently reside, cultivate gardens and put up hay.\n\nThe Indians as a whole are fairly industrious, they build their own houses, make their own tents, canoes, dog sleighs, snow shoes, etc.\n\nWe employ women to do our washing scrubbing etc., very often young ones who have been...\nOccupations of former pupils of the Home.\n\nIndians and places of residence.\n\nSanitary conditions etc.\n\nWe enforce upon our Indians the necessity of clearing and raking round their houses every Spring and burning up old rubbish that in this way gathered up; they attend to this now regularly. We also encourage the whitewashing of their houses in and outside with a natural white mud which is to be found in certain parts of the big lake; it acts as a fertilizer.\n\nAs soon as the Spring sets in, the natives leave their houses for their tents where they live in until late in the Fall, up to the first heavy frost; they prefer the tents to their houses, and during Summer time, there is no doubt that they are better for them.\n\nEducational work\n\nThe different subjects we teach our children are the following: Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Geography, English, Drawing, Recitation, Singing, Cooking, Ethics, General Knowledge, and Religious Instruction.\n\nWe lay much stress on the necessity of them being industrious, learning cleanliness, neatness and truthfulness encouraging them to take a pride in doing their part to keep the Home clean. The girls are fond of cooking when they leave the Home we visit them when we can, and try and help them carry out what they have learnt. We can do this more effectually when they have houses of their own which method as I have before mentioned, we strongly enforce upon them. We make the boys do all kinds of outside work.\nWhere children, our Indians have three separate reserves, we are permitted to gather the most of our children from the reserve on the shores of this lake, as the greatest number of the Indians reside here; last winter we had one child from Prairie Lake, we have only one child in continuous residence.\n\nC.D. White (Principal)\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reference to your letter above mentioned as it went astray I did not receive it until a late date, my place as Principal of St. Andrews Indian Boarding School Whitefish Lake, is in the meantime being taken by a lady until my return in the Spring. Therewith enclose \"A Report on the Indians in the neighborhood of Whitefish Lake\" this I understand you require as a reference account. I am Sir,\n\nyours truly C.D. White\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6380, file 769-1, part 1)\nDear Mr. Copper,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your address of Nov. 26th. I am thankful for the grant of $500 towards the Lesser Slave Lake School which will about cover the support of the number of treaty children admitted.\n\nRe your remark about day schools, viz., \"I may say that it is not the present policy of the Dept. to enter into the boarding school system but to enlarge and extend the usefulness of the day schools.\" This may apply to some parts of the Dominion but I think that you know as well as me that to apply it to such districts as Whitefish, Wapiti, means no school and no education. How many children would you find within reach of a day School in Athabasca? I can assure you that the Dept. to replace the boarding schools by day schools, but to do it in the present condition of the Country simply means closing down altogether. This said, he willing to do, for a time, if applied to the Roman Catholic as well, but it never will.\n\nThe refusal to increase the number of children to gain the per Capita Grant is a very serious matter. I have already stated that it is impossible to go on paying our Staff with only a per Capita grant for 30 children. The same Staff would\nRequired for 30 would be sufficient for twice that number. I have paid for provisions and other necessaries alone, apart from salaries, for 1907 over $2000, and the total of grants, including the teacher's grant of $200, does not amount to more than $1100. I do not mean to say that it shall cost $2000 for support in future, but as you know they had 34 children, boarders, in all districts. This abnormal number was no doubt due to the poverty of the Indians, who knew that they could not be able to feed and clothe their children. So it amounted to this, that the Council had the responsibility of feeding, clothing, instructing Indians. There are places where you, as Inspector, are well acquainted with, and I believe, we rely upon you to make them known to the Minister of the Interior or other Officers in the Dept.\n\nMy aim is to try to reduce the number of Boarding Schools as soon as possible, but the most hopeful place will be those where the Indians are chief wards of the Court will not, in our day, be able to send their children to a day school; and for the support of these, I do think the Council ought to bear the lion's share of financial responsibilities.\n\nI humbly beg you to persevere in this matter, as the matter concerning the industrial moral welfare of the Indians under your charge\u2014my appeal to the Dept., as you know, a very reasonable one\u2014a modest in the extreme. We are not disrespectful.\nFor all the Government leave due for the Indians. On the contrary, we are most thankful. But our grants from all missionary societies are rapidly diminishing, and it is already impossible to allow large grants as hitherto towards the support of these schools.\n\nMeeting that you may yet be able to influence the Dept. in favour of an increase in the per capita grant at the future places. The Rev. R. Wilson & Peace River wrote that the Chief has bought four treaty children who had already been. Now what would the Dept. advise in this case? ought we to refuse them? If the Dept. are unable to make any allowance there will be no alternative. Also to do this is practically driving our own people from our doors to seek admittance elsewhere. Kindly excuse me writing at this length but the business is urgent.\n\nWith kindest regards & best wishes for the approaching Yule tide.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nGeorge Athabasca\nOttawa, December 27th, 1909.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nThe letter underneath was received by me from His Lordship the Bishop of Athabasca.\n\nI quite agree with His Lordship that day schools at White Fish Lake and Wabiskaw are impracticable at present and will be for sometime to come. They have boarding schools at each of the above mentioned points which are doing good work, but they are only allowed a per capita grant for fifteen pupils at each. The cost of maintenance at these outlying points is extremely high and it is practically impossible to finance a school with such a small number of pupils. I am of the opinion that they should have a grant for 25 or 30 pupils at each of these schools. There were in residence at Wabiskaw last year some 35 pupils and 20 at White Fish Lake school.\n\nI understand that the Department has under consideration the question of an increased grant to boarding schools and no doubt if such an increase is made the schools in Treaty 8 would share in the benefit.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6380, file 769-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nBishop Holmes, of Athabasca, has renewed the request for an increased grant to the Church of England Boarding Schools at Wabiskaw Lake and Whitefish Lake, Treaty 8, and for a day school grant at Peace River.\n\nWe have lately made them a day school grant at Lesser Slave Lake and in 1904-05 a grant of $300.00 for the Peace River school was voted. No returns were received from December, 1907, till December, 1909. The latter was received a few days ago and payment has been made.\n\nWhile I would not recommend making an exception in favour of these two boarding schools in the matter of per capita grant I am of opinion that the question of an increase in the pupilage is worthy of consideration.\n\nThe returns from the Wabiskaw school show that in the June quarter, last, there were enrolled 27 pupils and in the December quarter 19. His Lordship claims that this reduction was made because they could not afford to keep any in excess of the number for whom the Department will pay the grant; not because of any lack of pupils. There has also been a reduction in the number maintained at Whitefish Lake.\n\nThere are several arguments that might be advanced in favour of an increased pupilage at these points.\n\nIn the first place the same staff is required to conduct a school for 15, the number now allowed, as for 25, pupils, the number asked for.\n\nThe\nThe cost of supplies in these outlying posts is very high, caused principally by the excessive freight rates.\n\nDay schools are and for sometime will be impracticable in this district, as the Indians will depend upon the hunt for their living for years yet.\n\nThey have accommodation for the increased number asked for.\n\nThe earnings of 15 pupils are evidently not sufficient to finance a school. The Bishop states that last year he expended $4000.00, collected by him in England, in paying deficits that had accrued. The deficit at Wabiskaw for the year ended June 36th, last, was said to be $1000.00. I may here add that the Roman Catholic school at Wabiskaw Lake receives a grant for 25 pupils.\n\nMr. Inspector Conroy has reported very favourably on the work being done by these two schools and I would recommend that provision be made in the supplementary estimates for a grant of $72.00 to 10 additional pupils each at Wabiskaw and Whitefish Lake.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, March 2nd, 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith Agreements, in duplicate, between Your Lordship and His Majesty the King, represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, for the future maintenance and management of the Waboscow Lake (St. John's Mission) and the Whitefish Lake (St. Andrew's Mission) Boarding Schools; and I have to request that you will be good enough to sign these documents in the presence of a subscribing witness and affix the official seal of your Diocese, returning same to the Department at your earliest convenience, as the Agreement will go into effect on the 1st April next.\n\nOn the return of these documents the signature of the Deputy Superintendent General will be affixed and a copy of each will then be returned to you.\n\nCertain alterations and improvements may be necessary at both the Waboscow Lake and Whitefish Lake Schools to bring the buildings up to the required standard. The Agent at Lesser Slave Lake has been notified to inspect the schools during the coming summer when making treaty payments, and report on the improvements required. A reasonable time will be granted by the Department to allow you to have these improvements made, and in the meantime the increased per capita grant will be paid each school for twenty-five pupils at $125.00 from April 1st next provided these Agreements are completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Right Rev.

Athabasca\nDiocese of Moosonee\n\nJOHN G. ANDERSON\nBISHOP\n\nCochrane, Ont.\n\nMarch 24th, 1920\n\nRe: Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed herewith school returns from Mistassini Mission for Indians entering June 30th and Sept. 30th 1919 respectively. I further advise me to remark upon the personal. He mentions that it has been difficult, in fact impossible to do satisfactory work in view of the fact that the Indians arrived late from their winter hunting grounds (June) and scattered again in July, some unwilling to return home and others becoming restless to maintain a living. As they went their families with them, it was of course impossible to keep the school open for the full quarters. Was an especially hard season on account of the scarcity of food. He also mentions that the winter has been a very severe one and consequently the Indians are having a hard time. He has received all the school supplies forwarded two years ago. I also enclose reproduction from Mr. C. C. Brett, teacher at Rupert House, which explains itself.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn G. Moosonee\nMy dear Mr Scott,\n\nI have just returned from a visit to our Indian Mission at Whitefish Lake, and with the recollection of the usefulness of the desks which were sent by the Department to Wabasca some years ago and with the happy expectation I found prevailing at St. Peter's, Lesser Slave Lake of those about to arrive, the other Mission at Whitefish Lake seemed lamentably equipped with the unwieldly and awkward desks at present in use. They were made when material was scarce years ago and are quite inefficient for present day requirements.\n\nCould you do us the kindness of sending in desks. There are twenty-eight children present when I was there. They should go in at once while the snow trails are good. I saw Mr Laird your Agent in Grouard, he knows the school well, and will I feel sure fully approve of my suggestion.\n\nI am very grateful to you for the kind manner in which you responded to the appeal I made for desks through Mr Conroy for the other school at St. Peter's.\n\nThis Mission at Whitefish Lake, about which I now write is forty miles further North, and your response to my present suggestion would bring all three of our Indian Schools into line with regard to desk equipment.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Railway Station is Emilda, C.W. & B.C.Ry.\n### Prices of school desks for the Whitefish Lake Boarding School.\n\n**Globe Furniture Co., Limited, Waterloo, Ont.**\n\n| No. | Description                          | Price   |\n|-----|--------------------------------------|---------|\n| 4   | No. 6 Globe Steel Automatic Double Desks @ $14.70 each | $58.80  |\n| 4   | No. 5 \"                               | $58.80  |\n| 2   | No. 4 \"                               | $30.50  |\n| 2   | No. 3 \"                               | $26.80  |\n| 2   | Rears for the No. 3 desks @ $13.40 each | $26.80  |\n| 2   | Fronts for the No. 6 Desks @ $13.40 each | $26.80  |\n\nDelivered to the nearest railway station in Alberta.\nPrices subject to a discount of 10% - net amount - $232.20.\n\n### The Western School Supply Co., Regina, Sask.\n\n| No. | Description                          | Price   |\n|-----|--------------------------------------|---------|\n| 4   | No. 5 Preston Ball-Bearing Double Desks @ $19.25 each | $77.00  |\n| 4   | No. 4 \"                               | $77.40  |\n| 2   | No. 3 \"                               | $38.70  |\n| 2   | No. 2 \"                               | $39.00  |\n| 2   | Rears for the No. 2 desks @ $18.00 each | $36.00  |\n| 2   | Fronts for the No. 5 desks @ $18.00 each | $36.00  |\n\nPrices f.o.b.

They have given much satisfaction and greatly added to the appearance of the school-room. Our Bishop, Bishop Robins was here the end of last month seeing these desks for the first time; he was greatly pleased with not only the usefulness, but appearance they gave the school-room compared with the old tables formerly used.\n\nHe advised me to write you and ask if you could see your way to getting us the money refunded which we paid for freight on these desks, Thirteen Dollars ($13.80).\n\nI remain\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nD. White.\nOTTAWA, May 2nd, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 9th of March, last, addressed to the late Inspector Conroy, of this Department, regarding a refund of the amount of the freight paid by you on the desks that were supplied last year for the use of the Whitefish Lake Indian Boarding School, I beg to say that if you will forward the receipt for the amount of freight charges paid by you, viz: $15.60, consideration will be given to the payment of this amount. You should forward this receipt to Mr. Agent Laird, Grouard, with the request that he attach it to proper voucher forms and send to the Department. It is presumed that this is the cost of the freighting of the desks from Enilda Station to the school, as all freight charges were prepaid to that point.\n\nWe are pleased to learn that the desks supplied are giving satisfaction.\n\nYou will regret to learn, I am sure, of the death of Mr. Inspector H. A. Conroy, which occurred on the 27th ultimo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. C. D.

(145 plus 20.) for 25 children. The White Fish Lake School has at present 18 Treaty children in residence, with 2 more about to be admitted, and as the Lesser Slave Lake has about the same number, I am writing to ascertain if you can further assist our Society in looking after the educational, moral, and physical interest of these children, by allowing a grant for a greater pupilage. The school buildings I admit are very poor, and do not measure up to the standards required by your Department, but a good work has been, and continues to be accomplished in them. The cost of maintenance, however, is pressing heavily upon us, and any relief you could furnish in the way of allowing an increase in the pupilage - say from 25 to 40 - would be most deeply appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/PEG.\nOttawa, November 29, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, applying for an increase in the pupilage of the Lesser Slave Lake and Whitefish Lake Indian Residential Schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that from April 1, 1924, the Department will provide funds for a combined pupilage of 40 at these two schools.\n\nOwing to lack of funds we are unable to increase the pupilage until the date mentioned above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I have wired for fuller information, and asked to be informed if any additional help was required. Should such be required, especially nursing help, I will wire or write to you again.\n\nAs information had reached me that the pupils in the R.C.

Indian Residential School, and the authority given you to purchase lumber to fit up extra accommodation at the Wabasca C. of E. Indian Residential School, I have to inform you that the Department is allowing a grant for 30 pupils at this and also at the Whitefish Lake C. of E. Residential School as from the date the pupils will be returning after the present summer holidays. The equipment at the Lesser Slave Lake School is being distributed between the two above named schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. P. L'Heureux, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alta.\nOttawa, August 8, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, informing the Department of the arrangements that have been made for the closing of the Lesser Slave Lake C. of E. Indian Residential School as from June 30th, last, and requesting that a pupilage of 30 be provided at each of the Wabasca and Whitefish Lake C. of E. Indian Residential Schools.\n\nRegarding the request for the increased pupilage, I beg to confirm our night lettergram of today's date:\n\n\"Reference your letter fourth instant in view of closing Lesser Slave Lake School Department will approve of per capita allowance for pupilage of thirty at both Wabasca and Whitefish Lake Schools.\"\n\nRegarding the supplying of the lumber required to provide accommodation at the Wabasca C. of E. Indian Residential School, I have to inform you that the local Indian Agent has forwarded a requisition stating in detail the lumber, etc., required, and he has been authorized to arrange for the purchase and forwarding of same to the school, to an amount not exceeding $250, which is also to include the freighting.\n\nIt is noted that the bedding, dishes and other equipment now at the Lesser Slave Lake School will be distributed between the Whitefish Lake and Wabasca Schools for the use of the additional pupilage. This Department would pay the cost of the transportation charges involved in moving this equipment upon receipt of accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, with receipts attached for any transportation costs paid by your Society. If you prefer that the cost of transportation be paid direct to the parties who do the work, you should forward certified accounts in their favour, in triplicate, when a cheque would be sent direct.\n\nThe pupils now at the Lesser Slave Lake School can be distributed as considered advisable between the Wabasca and Whitefish Lake C. of E.

Wabasso R.C., Demerais, Alta.\n9. Whitefish Lake, Atikamek, Alta.\n10. St Bruno, Jousard, Alta.\n\nThe above is a partial list of residential schools in connection with which the Department pays a per capita grant. In these cases the Department did not build the schools and does not exercise the rights of ownership. It is noted that the last seven in the above list are in one agency i.e., the Grouard Agency.\n\nIn a number of these cases the Department is being asked to assume financial responsibility and to pay grants towards the capital costs of the buildings, besides making additional grants for additions, repairs and maintenance. In at least two instances there are undertakings on the part of the Department to furnish certain financial assistance. Many of the arrangements made and paid in this connection have been verbal in nature and the terms are not of definite record. It would seem clear, however, that in some, if not all cases the Department is obligated to some degree at least, but the lack of written records and agreements makes it very difficult to determine the nature and extent of this responsibility.\n\nThe fact that the Department has undertaken the payment of per capita grants implies a certain responsibility for the up-keep of the buildings, if not for the capital costs.\n\nIn my opinion it is necessary that the Department adopt a general policy for the purpose of dealing with these difficulties and I would respectfully offer the following suggestions for your consideration:\n1. That the Department of Indian Affairs undertake the payment of per capital grants and any financial aid towards the cost of building only when the prior authority of the Department has been granted. This authority should cover such matters as site, size and nature of school buildings.\n\n2. That such authority in all cases be set out in a formal and definitely worded agreement for the guidance of Departmental officials, as a matter of record and for the purpose of avoiding future misunderstandings.\n\n3. That the schools now operating by authority of the Department as recognized by the payment of per capita grants be assisted from time to time as circumstances warrant and financial conditions permit.\n\n4. That the various missionary societies be notified of the above rulings.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nHarold W. Mc Gill,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nJupt. Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYou will recall that during my recent visit to Ottawa (November 21st) you requested me to write to you about certain items of business which I discussed with you and the Director of your branch of Government, and I am now acceding to this request.\n\nOne of these items of business was an official increase in the pupilage of our White Fish Lake School at Atikameg, Alta., from 30 to 40.\n\nFor your information I may say that the addition to this school recently completed, provides, according to word received from the Principal, adequate accommodation for the increase requested, and I most earnestly hope that it may be granted.\n\nIn the comprehensive list of requirements submitted by our Commission to be met by your branch of Government next year, a new school building was included at an estimated cost of $35,000.00. While there can be no doubt whatever about the need of a new building to supersede the one in use at present, and built with church funds, the increased pupilage will be a very material help to our society at this critical and anxious time, should it be found impossible for the Government to build the new and larger building during the fiscal year 1939-1940.\n\nFor your information regarding present conditions at this School and Mission, and to show that our Church is\ndoing all within her power to help forward the Indian work at this centre, I am able to quote the following from a letter from our Bishop of Athabasca, the Rt. Rev. Dr. A.H. Sovereign, who recently visited White Fish Lake, and wrote to me on the 2nd instant:-\n\n\"I have just returned from a visit to Whitefish Lake, and our Indian Mission at that point, and I think I should send you my impression of the work being carried on at that Post.\n\nMay I say that I was quite delighted. The staff is a very capable and efficient body of workers, possibly the best that I have yet seen at that point. I am sure you would be delighted. Mr. Cathcart comes with endless energy and with splendid ideas, and they are gradually working out. The new Matron is exceedingly capable, and everything has been systematised with the background of a nurse's training. Her nursing experience is also a great help to the whole community. The new teacher is thoroughly trained and very capable. I feel that we should always have a teacher at our Indian Schools who has had a normal training, for teaching is a science. Miss Swift is doing excellent work as Kitchen Matron. Mr. Reynolds as farm instructor is also very acceptable. There seemed to be a fine spirit pervading the whole institution. The children were well and happy. I noticed with great satisfaction the following improvements:- New fences everywhere, new land being broken between the School and the Lake where they will soon have an excellent garden-site, a new root-house for the storing of vegetables, and a workshop in the front of it. They will have sufficient vegetables evidently for the whole winter. New land of over forty acres has been obtained through the Diocese, and will be used for the raising of hay and as a wood supply. This land lies between our Mission land and the R.C. property. This now gives us excellent Mission lands. The graveyard has been cleaned up and put in order, and a large area to the east has been cleared up as an addition. A new dormitory has been built for the boys, a fine new dining-hall and bright and commodious rooms for the staff. A new community hall about 35' x 60' is being built, and logs and lumber are on hand for a new church. These have been provided through the Diocese and through the generosity of the community itself. A new cow-stable is under building, and a new corral for the cattle. The old rectory has been repaired and re-planned with excellent effect, and cupboards etc., have been installed in the school buildings. I was quite pleased with everything. I sincerely hope that it may be possible for us to construct a new modern school at this strategic post. We must not in any way decrease our efforts, both at this Mission and also at Wabasca. I am more than ever...\"\n\"convinced that we should have two separate schools at these respective points.\"\n\nAs the July-September returns for this School showed 41 pupils enrolled, though 8 of them had been wrongfully admitted to the Roman Catholic School, there can be no doubt that a capacity enrollment of forty could easily be secured if the official pupilage were increased to that number and I would repeat the very earnest hope already expressed above, that this increase be granted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBW/WH\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa, March 24th, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, in which you advise that Rev. C. D. White, Principal of the Whitefish Lake Indian Residential School, is retiring from that position at the end of the current month.\n\nIn view of your recommendation, the Department approves the appointment of Rev. Robert Thompson Cathcart as Principal, to take effect from April 1st, 1937.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that the Rev. C.D. White, Principal of our St. Andrew's School at White Fish Lake, Alta., will retire from that position at the end of the current month of March, and that the Rev. Robert Thompson Cathcart has been selected by our Society to take his place subject, of course, to the approval of your Department.\n\nFor some time past, Mr. White has felt that on account of his age a younger man should take over the heavy and responsible duties which he has carried so long. He has been a very faithful and conscientious Worker and his knowledge of the Cree language was a great help to him in dealing with the Indian peoples in the districts served by the St. Andrew's School. While he will be greatly missed by them, the fact that he no longer felt able to handle all the work that had to be done has made his retirement inevitable.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Cathcart I may state for your information that he was born in Toronto, Nov. 29th, 1903. After graduating in Theology from Wycliffe College, Toronto, he filled the position of Rector of St. Paul's Pro-Cathedral at Dawson, Yukon for three and a half years. After leaving the Yukon he was in charge of Holy Trinity Pro-Cathedral at Cochrane, Ont. He had a wide experience in Sunday School and colportage work, and in the light of these considerations, along with the excellent testimonials...\nreceived from a number of those who know him intimately, our Society has felt justified in offering him the position in question.\n\nI shall be glad to have your approval of his appointment.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nTHE INDIAN AND ESKIMO RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL COMMISSION OF THE MISSIONARY SOCIETY OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND IN CANADA.\n\nWinnipeg, Man., April 10, 1939.\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\n\nDear Dr McGill:\n\nThere are two matters mentioned in the report for last year of the Principal of our St Andrew's school at White Fish Lake, Alta., which are of deep concern to our Society, and I wish to direct your attention to the same:\n\n2. The second matter is in connection with the settlement of Indians at Prairie Lake, 45 miles to the North East of Atikameg, Alberta, and the surrounding districts where \"there are many Treaty Indians who belong to the White Fish Lake Band and who always come to this place (Atikameg) for the paying of Treaty.\"\n\nThe Principal states that these Indians, under pressure from another church denomination have been agitating for their own reserve in order to save them from coming all this distance for their Treaty. It is the suggestion of the Principal that the agitation for a reserve is but the first step towards the opening of another school on that reserve, and he fails to see any real necessity for either project being allowed.\n\nYou will recall that for some years our Society has asked that a new and larger school be built at White Fish Lake to supersede the one now in existence which was built by our Church many years ago. It is my own personal opinion and the opinion of our Commission that adequate provision of educational facilities for all the Indian children in the White Fish Lake and the Prairie Lake and surrounding settlements can best be made through the building of such a new and enlarged school, and we trust therefore, that any proposal to build another school in the Prairie Lake settlement may not be entertained by your Branch of Government.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.B.R.

T.A. Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Crerar:\n\nDuring my visit to Ottawa on the 9th ultimo, I was informed that you had under consideration, as an economic measure, the question of closing at least two of our Society's Indian Residential Schools, namely, St. Andrew's at White Fish Lake (Atikameg, P.C.) and St. John's at Wabasca, both in northern Alberta, and of establishing Indian Day or Improved Indian Day Schools instead. This information was duly presented to our Commission, when the members, under the Chairmanship of His Grace, the Archbishop of Rupert's Land, unanimously decided to recommend to the Executive Committee of our Society, that you be earnestly requested to refrain from making any alteration whatever in the status of these schools during the duration of the prevailing war.\n\nThe Commission's decision has been communicated to the Executive Committee, but as the General Secretary (Canon L.A. Dixon, M.A., D.D., O.B.E.) is at present absent from Toronto, and as the Executive will not meet until towards the end of the current month of November, I have thought it advisable, seeing that the Estimates for the Indian Affairs Branch for the coming fiscal year are now in the course of preparation, to write to you at once in the matter. In due course, you will, no doubt, hear from our Society's General Secretary in this connexion.\n\nWhile the members of our Commission are as keenly desirous of effecting economies at the present time, as any group of loyal citizens could possibly be, they are convinced that the change you have under contemplation would not produce the result you desire. A careful examination of the expenditures made by the Government during recent years for these two schools, and a comparison of\nthe same with an estimate of what expenditures would have to be made to provide and equip and maintain the type of school suggested, leaves no doubt in the mind of any member of our Commission that the change, so far as effecting economies are concerned, would not be justified.\n\nFurther, as a very considerable number of the Indian children now in residence at these schools come from too great a distance to be able to attend daily, they would be deprived of the educational facilities which the existing schools provide.\n\nThere are other considerations in connexion with this question which are of vital importance to the Missionary Society of our Church and the members of our Commission desired me to say that they would greatly appreciate an opportunity of discussing some of these with you sometime when you happen to be in Winnipeg.\n\nWith highest regards,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.B.R.

(RG 10, Volume 6380, file 769-1, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM:\n\n- Mr. Hoey -\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 16th instant, I am returning the letter the Minister received from Reverend Canon Dixon, General Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England, in which he referred to the educational needs of the Indians of the Whitefish Lake area of northern Alberta. If you will refer to Mr. Pratt's memorandum you will notice that the Minister wished to have a report on the matter referred to in the resolution.\n\nThe Minister read Mr. Phelan's memorandum of the 8th instant and is disappointed in the casual way in which he treated the matter. Surely there must be a record of the Indian children in this district requiring education and the number of those who are now receiving it. Is there more than one school in the district? Are there any plans contemplated to improve the service that we are now rendering?\n\nC. W. Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nEnclosure.\nOttawa, March 21, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nWith reference to Mr. Jackson's memorandum of March 19, I wish to supply the following additional information regarding the Whitefish Lake School:\n\nThe Whitefish Lake School is in the Lesser Slave Lake Agency and in this agency there are two Indian Residential Schools, operated under the auspices of the Church of England. Both of these buildings are church-owned. The authorized pupilage at these two schools is as follows:\n\n| Location       | Pupilage |\n|----------------|----------|\n| Wabasca        | 35       |\n| Whitefish Lake | 30       |\n| Total          | 65       |\n\nIn the 1944 Census the religion of the Indians in this agency is not stated. Consequently, to give you an idea of the religious affiliations of the Indians in the Lesser Slave Lake Agency, I supply the following information from the 1939 Census:\n\n- Number in Band: 3238\n- Number of Church of England Indians: 292\n- Number of Roman Catholic Indians: 2296\n\nThe above figures show that the Indians who are adherents of the Church of England number approximately 9% of the total Indian population in the agency.\n\nThe 1939 census also shows that at that time there were 798 children between 7 and 16 years of age. Presumably, at least 9% of these would be children whose parents are adherents of the Church of England. This would mean that...\napproximately 71 children of school age would require education under Church of England auspices.\n\nFrom the above figures, you will note that while there were approximately 71 children there was accommodation provided in the two residential schools for 65.\n\nI wish also to direct your attention to a letter dated November 3, 1941, from Reverend T.B.R. Westgate, Secretary of the M.S.C.C. This letter was addressed to the Honourable Mr. Crerar and expressed the opinion that day schools would not be satisfactory in that particular area. As stated in my memorandum of March 8, there have been frequent requests from the Church of England for the inclusion of an item of approximately $35,000.00 in our appropriation, in order to provide a new residential school at Whitefish Lake. Owing to conditions in the past few years, we have not included such an item in our appropriation, nor was it included in the estimates recently prepared for the fiscal year 1946-47.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa March 6, 1946.\n\nMemo\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nMiss Marshall advised she had received disturbing information from a teacher at the Whitefish school that the principal there had stripped the girls and strapped them. It appears that the astron had lost $15.00 on the road to the White Bay Store. One of the Indian children had found $5.00 and instead of returning it to the principal spent part of it to buy candles and biscuits which were distributed amongst the girls. Miss Marshall stated that the teacher concerned wanted to travel to Ottawa, at her own expense, to report the Director of the disrespectful treatment, but on her advice abandoned the idea. I told Nurse Marshall that the charge was a very serious one and asked her to obtain a written statement from the teacher and submit a full report. The nurse also stated that when she was examining the girls and filling in their history charts the principal insisted she was taking up too much time and going to too much trouble. He told her all that was necessary for him to do was to sign the cards and he would \"fill in the information.\" Miss Marshall was making stethoscope tests of the girls, with the upper parts of their bodies exposed, and she required a private room where it would be less noisy. The principal insisted he should be present in the room to fill in the cards but Miss Marshall would not permit him. The principal was reluctant to permit her to use medical supplies from the stock stored at the school, and told her that these supplies were at her disposal when required, and instructed that she communicate with Dr. F. E. Moore, Medical Superintendent of the Indian Health Service, who undoubtedly would provide her with a letter authorising her to use any of the medicines, at any of the schools, where he commended upon her work. The nurse also stated that one of the fifteen year old boys from the school ran down through the bush to the lake, where the plains were waiting, to report to her of the strapplings he had received since he knew he would get additional punishment but he did not care what would happen to him as he felt that these unjust beatings should be reported. Miss Marshall is a very conscientious, capable and efficient person, and I feel that she would not have advised me of this condition unless she sincerely believed it to be true.\n\nI would therefore recommend that Mr. M. McCrimmon, on his next visit to the Lesser Slave Lake Agency, be instructed to investigate these charges completely and fully, and submit a report so that - if the charges are confirmed - the necessary disciplinary action may be taken.\nOttawa, March 25, 1946.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\n- THE ACTING DEPUTY MINISTER -\n\nMay I refer to my memorandum to you dated March 16th and your reply thereto dated March 19th. In this connection, I am sending forward for your information an additional report on the subject received by me from Mr. Phelan.\n\nIt is my understanding that these small schools - one at Whitefish Lake and the other at Wabasca, both the property of the Church of England - are at present in a somewhat dilapidated and insanitary condition. The proposal made by the department to Doctor Westgate a few years ago that these schools might be replaced by improved day schools was not acceptable to the Church authorities. I am personally of the opinion, in view of the numerous demands that are reaching us almost daily for the rebuilding of schools destroyed by fire and for the construction of day schools, that it will not be possible to rebuild at either Whitefish Lake or Wabasca at any time in the immediate future. In the meantime, this territory should be thoroughly surveyed by a competent educationist at the time an educational survey is undertaken at Hay River.\n\nDirector.\nThe Department of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nWelfare and Training Service,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Colonel B. F. Neary, Superintendent.\n\nRe: White Fish Lake Indian Residential School\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nIn reply to your reference given above of February 28th, I am happy to say that the above school has not been closed at any time. We were, however, unfortunate in that one member of the staff had to leave in November owing to ill health and another suffered injury through falling on ice. As a result, the duties of the other workers had to be adjusted to meet the emergency and our principal had to ask the teacher to assume the duties of a supervisor during December and January. I sincerely regret that the classroom had to be closed during this period; but it was opened again as soon as a new worker arrived.\n\nI may say that we always find it difficult to fill vacancies which occur unexpectedly at the end of the year. I am confident that the school has carried on effectively with full classroom work since the beginning of February.\n\nSincerely,\n\nN.A. Alderwood\nSuperintendent.\n1st September, 1948.\n\nThe Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI write to ask for the approval of the appointment of the following men as Principals of the Indian Residential Schools indicated:\n\n1. The Rev. Robert Thompson Cathcart, B.A., has been the Principal for some years of St. Andrew's School, Whitefish Lake, Alberta. During that time he has rendered very acceptable service. He has recently resigned on account of the severity of the northern winters. He is available, however, for the Principalship of the school at Brocket, Alberta, and would, we believe, be a very suitable appointment.\n\n2. The Rev. John Evans, B.A., L.Th., B.Ed., is available for the Principalship of the Sioux Lookout School which is, at present, vacant due to the transfer of the Rev. D. C. Wickenden to Sault Ste Marie. Mr. Evans is a widower, born in 1912 in England, received his education in Canada, graduated from the University of Manitoba and St. John's College Winnipeg. He has served with the Armed Services during the war and has worked in our Indian Missions both in Manitoba and Northern Ontario. In 1945 Mr. Evans completed a special educational course in the University of Alberta. We believe he would be a suitable man for Sioux Lookout.\n\nI would be grateful if you would kindly approve these two appointments.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLAD K.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n507 Public Rd.,\nCalgary, Alta.,\n\nWhitefish Lake Residential School\n\nYou will recall our previous correspondence of October 21, 1949 and January 23, 1950 in which I indicated that the discussions were being held with the A.S.C.C., officials concerning the closing of the Whitefish Lake Residential School. At that time I indicated that the Atikameg Day school attendance had been very low and that we might consider using it as a day school for the Anglican children.\n\nSince then two new factors have entered the picture:\n\n(a) Closing of Whitefish Lake Residential School\n\nFortunately Major Clark was briefed on this situation before he left Ottawa and he will be visiting Whitefish in early June. It is our intention to indicate to the Bishop that the future of the day school will depend on the recommendations made by our Inspector.\n\n(b) Closing of Atikameg R.C. Day School\n\nAs I previously told you, I told the Oblates that we were dissatisfied with the attendance at the present school. This matter was then referred to the local missionary Father Floc'h. A long letter has now been received from Father Floc'h in which he makes a strong plea for the continued operation of the day school. I attach a copy of his letter for your information.\nIt would seem that this matter is now rapidly coming to a head and that the closing of the Whitefish Lake residential school is an immediate possibility. At the present time, with the information before them, Departmental officials favour the following actions:\n\n(a) Building of a one or two-room school for the Anglican children at Whitefish\n\n(b) The continued operation of the Atikameg school for the R.C. children\n\nBernard E.

Practically all the children of the community would be able to attend the Day School and the one or two children living at a distance could attend the Wabasca school as boarders.\n\nI have chosen Blue-print No. 837 as the suggested plan for the new building.\n\nMay I thank you for all of your thought and care in reference to this and other projects. I would especially wish to thank you and the Department for the beautiful new school at Wabasca. I was so pleased with it. It foretells a new day and a new deal for our Indian wards whom the government is caring for so wisely.\n\nWith every good wish, believe me, Yours faithfully,\n\nArthur A.

The Bishop has now replied and chooses plan #837 as the better type of building for our needs at Whitefish Lake.\n\nHis lordship also states that Miss Jennie Wright will be willing to stay on at Whitefish as one of the day school teachers.\n\nI trust that now having the above given information Indian Affairs Branch will be in a position to expedite construction of a day school for Church of England use at Whitefish Lake.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHGC/PAL Superintendent.\nSend the following message, subject to the conditions on the back thereof, which are hereby agreed to.\n\n769-1 (E)\n\nOttawa June 7 1950\n\nMajor C A F Clark\nCare of Mr G.

A. F.

Balfour).\n\nA second teacher will be necessary in place of Miss Powell who now reports that she is not available. I think that Mr. Gooderham has one or two Alberta people who would be interested in the assignment.\n\nRental at the figures suggested seems in order i.e., $20. for each classroom and $10. for living quarters for the teachers.\n\nMr. Superintendent Lapp will have to assume the provision of fuel and water.\n\nThere is what was a good lighting plant but the Diesel engine which is Church property ought to be taken \"outside\" and repaired by experts. There is a mail carrier who makes the trip by wagon between Whitefish Lake and the railway station at Grouard. I suggest some arrangement between our Superintendent and Diocesan headquarters at Peace River, Alberta or with the Church representative who takes over from the Reverend E.W. Johnson at Whitefish Lake.\nI am hoping that the two teachers can work and live in one building but this is subject to the reaction of the successor to the Reverend Mr. Johnson. My telegram of June 23 to Mr. Superintendent Lapp refers to this matter.\n\nFurniture for the teachers appears to exist on the spot and the provision of this may be regarded as a contribution by the Church to the comfort of the teachers who may be expected to be adherents of the Church of England.\n\nAs we hope for concerted action in the province it is to be understood, I hope, by all parties, that the regulations for religious instruction for the public schools of Alberta will be followed.\n\nArrangements for enforcing the attendance of non-Indians should be clarified so that there is no loop-hole by which these children will escape attending one of the schools (i.e., either this one or Atikameg), because the example is likely to be followed by the Indian children. Once again it seems necessary for me to urge that school registers be faithfully kept or that those responsible be penalized. We might request further opinions from Mr. Balfour and Departmental field officials. I would prefer to abandon the lean-to in favour of unifying school facilities and living quarters in the same large building. The half-finished community hall might become available as play space for the children later.\n\nC.A.F. Clark,\nEducational Survey Officer.\n\nG.A.F. Clark\nMr. Lapp\nMr. Gooderham\n\nIndian Affairs.

He states that he will be in a position to provide Mr. Lapp with a bill of materials required for the school by September.\n\nFor purposes of record please advise this office just as soon as the sawmill has been transferred from Sucker Creek to the Whitefish Lake Reserve. As the Departmental records on the subject appear to be somewhat obscure it would be appreciated if you would state in your report what form of motive power was used to operate this mill on the Sucker Creek Reserve.\n\n(Signed) H.

Dixon, M.A., B.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMissionary Society of the\nChurch of England in Canada,\n604 Jarvis Street,\nToronto 5, Ontario.\n\nClosing of Whitefish Lake Residential School\n\nDear Canon Dixon:\n\nAs you are aware, there has been considerable correspondence between the Indian School Administration of your Society and Bishop Sovereign with regard to the closing of the Whitefish Lake Residential School, effective June 30, 1950.\n\nThe following telegram has been received from Bishop Sovereign dated May 5, 1950:\n\n\"Agree to closing of Whitefish Lake Anglican Residential School June thirtieth provided two room day school is erected with staff accommodation kitchen and school rooms. Miss Wright has twenty four pupils and Miss Howell twenty seven pupils at present time. Hope day school building can be erected this summer - Greetings.\"\n\nUpon receipt of this telegram, instructions were given to our Educational Survey officer to proceed to Whitefish Lake and carry out the necessary survey. We have now received a telegram from him reading in part as follows:\n\n\"Whitefish Lake Day School will require two teachers using two existing classrooms and present...\"\nliving quarters until new construction is arranged preferably employing local labour and materials and Albertian plan.\"\n\nPreviously Canon Cook and Bishop Sovereign had indicated that plan 37 would be a satisfactory type of day school building to replace the residential school. Unfortunately, this provides only one classroom and it would seem evident from Major Clark's telegram that a two classroom building will be required. Unfortunately, our two-room school plan has not yet been completed by the Architects and it is difficult now to make any commitment that the new school will be finished this year.\n\nI would like to suggest that, in the event of the new school not being erected, we rent from either Bishop Sovereign or yourself the two existing classrooms and living quarters. We are quite prepared to hire Miss Powell and Miss Wright as the teachers at this new day school. A letter has been sent to them today by the Superintendent of Education with the necessary application forms, etc.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. Gooderham.\nSeptember 9, 1950.\n\nReverend Canon H.

I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Indian Superintendent Lapp so that he can submit a voucher as of December 31, 1950, and of June 30, 1951, for such rental and make payable to the Indian School Administration of the M.O.C.O., 102 Bank Street, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nYou will be pleased to know that we have recently authorized expenditures for the placing of a new window in the classrooms and for moving the outdoor toilets. It is presumed that you will not object to the alteration in the building by the installation of the new window in the classrooms. I have also written to Mr. Lapp concerning two teachers, one of whom might fit in with the present teacher.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

It has been operated in old buildings, many of them of log construction and presenting a definite fire hazard. Two years ago it was found that the school still used oil and gasoline lanterns and was heated with small stoves.\n\nIt had only a pupilage of 30 and was operated by the Indian School Administration of the M.S.C.C.\n\nAs a result of an educational survey, it was decided, with the agreement of the M.S.C.C., to take the following action:\n\n(a) Erect a new dormitory block at the Wabasca Anglican Residential School situated in the same agency, which would provide safe accommodation for the children at both Wabasca and at Whitefish Lake who required institutional care;\n\n(b) To erect a two-room day school at Whitefish Lake for the Protestant children living there (we already have a Catholic day school at Atikameg - which is the Indian word for Whitefish Lake).\n\nI attach a series of photographs which will give you a factual presentation of the school as it existed. The photographs are numbered as follows:\n\n1. The residential school classroom is at the left with the teachers' living quarters in the next log building.\n2. The community hall.\n\n3.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nDear Sir:-\n\n--REPAIRS REQUIRED AT WHITE FISH LAKE--\n\nThe Principal of our Society's school at White Fish Lake, Alta., writing on July 19, states as follows:\n\n\"I am sorry to say that on July 5, we had a hail storm which broke seven windows in the main school building, two in the Mission house, and did a great deal of damage to the roof of the school, including the kitchen roof, as well as the roofs of the stores and other buildings. The roofs were all in a bad condition before the storm, as the boards and shingles had been on so long, and in places were quite rotten. When the rain came on, I had to put a tent of mine on the top of the roof of the main building, to prevent our provisions and other things from being destroyed.\n\nThe Principal did not furnish me with an estimate of what it would cost to have the roofs thus damaged sufficiently repaired to enable him and his staff to carry on their work for another year or two, but it seems to me that this could not be effected at a cost of less than \u00a3500, and I write to ask if you will kindly authorize the expenditure of that amount for this purpose.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\"\nOttawa, August 11, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary of the M. S. C. C., has reported that the roof of the Whitefish Lake Indian Residential School requires repairing. I should be pleased if you would make a report and recommendation in this connection and indicate the best manner in which the repairs can be undertaken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nHarold Laird, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGrouard, Alta.\nOttawa, August 11, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to repairs at the Whitefish Lake Indian Residential School. In reply I have to inform you that the Department is corresponding with Mr. Indian Agent Laird and, upon receipt of his report and recommendation, you will be further advised.\n\nPlease instruct the principals of the Indian residential schools conducted under M. S. C. C. auspices that requests of this nature should be directed originally to the Indian agent's office, so that his recommendation can be attached. Such practice will result in a considerable saving of time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to enclose a letter received from Mr. J. A. Moore, who is a Builder and Contractor here.\n\nI heartily concur with Mr. Moore's statements, and consider it a waste of good material to make the authorized repairs to the present building.\n\nI would suggest that logs be procured this winter and that a new building be erected, next spring, in place of the one in question.\n\nBefore purchasing flooring, etc., I will await your further instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarold Russell\nActing Indian Agent\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nOttawa, October 3, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 26th ultimo, enclosing a communication from a local contractor with reference to the possibility of making no repairs on the Whitefish Lake Indian Residential School. I am informing the Field Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada of your recommendation. At the present writing, I cannot authorize you to incur any expenditure in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAset. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nHarold Laird, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGrouard, Alta.\nOttawa, October 3, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer further to your letter of August 6th, relative to repairs at the Whitefish Lake Indian Residential School. Mr. Indian Agent Laird secured the services of a contractor and they recommend that no repairs be placed on the present main building. The main timbers are decayed and the floor joists are in bad condition. It is recommended that logs be taken out this winter and a new building erected in the spring.\n\nI regret, therefore, to inform you that the Department is authorizing no expenditure at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n41-45 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe White Fish Lake School C. of E.\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 3rd inst., (No.131-10-5) in which you decline to authorize any expenditure for repairs to our Society's School at White Fish Lake, and offering the recommendation that logs be taken out this winter and a new building erected in the Spring, I beg to state that so far as our Society is concerned the recommendation for the erection of a log building is wholly unacceptable. On page 2, section 4, subsection (a) of my letter to the Deputy Superintendent General dated Nov. 22, 1923 it is stated in the list of Residential Schools required by our Society that a \"new School should be established at Lesser Slave Lake with increased capacity of enrolment to take the place of the one now established there and the one at White Fish Lake.\"\n\nOur Society is still of the opinion that the provision of the new and enlarged School therein suggested will afford the best and most economical solution to the problem of Indian Education in that part, and I trust that your Department may approve of this arrangement and undertake the erection of a modern and fully equipped building at an early date.\n\nAs the erection of new School buildings for our Society at other centres have a prior claim on your Department it is necessary that the present buildings at both White Fish Lake and Lesser Slave Lake should be made habitable for at least another year, and it is for this reason that I feel constrained to again ask you to give favourable consideration to the request for $500. for repairs contained in my letter of August 6th last.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6380, file 769-5, part 1)\nOctober 21, 1924.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nSome weeks ago Dr. Westgate requested that $500 be allowed to repair the main building at the Whitefish Lake Indian Residential School. I asked Mr. Indian Agent Laird for a recommendation and he reports that it would be a waste of material to repair the present building. He suggested that logs be taken out this winter and a new building erected in the spring. The agent reports that the main timbers are decayed and the floor joists are in bad condition.\n\nI acquainted Dr. Westgate with the nature of this recommendation and he cannot agree to a log structure in place of the main building at this school. He draws the Department's attention to the fact that a new and modern building at Whitefish Lake is one of the L.S.C.C. major requests and that, as it may not be possible to secure an appropriation for the purpose for next year (building season 1925), he urges that repairs be undertaken, so that the work may be carried on until a new building is provided.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your instructions. It was estimated that the repairs would cost approximately $500.\n\nRussell J. Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, October 21, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer further to your letter of the 26th ultimo and to inform you that it has been decided to make the main building at the Whitefish Lake Indian Residential School habitable for the coming winter. You should discuss with the Rev. Principal what repairs and replacements are absolutely necessary and arrange to have the work done with the least possible expense. When purchasing material, you should secure competitive prices and, when submitting the certified account, in duplicate, in favour of the firm given the business, support it with a statement showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted. If expert labour is required, you may employ a carpenter or two and keep time sheets in duplicate showing the hours engaged and the receipts for their wages. The school staff and older boys should assist as much as possible. If an accountable cheque to pay for any labour employed is necessary, please requisition for the same. The expense in this connection must not exceed $500.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Please be guided in the matter of purchases and the engagement of labour by the instructions of my letter above quoted.\n\nI should be pleased if you would intamate what repairs and replacements you propose to make at this school. Since the authority to expend $500 was directed to you, we have paid accounts for lumber, $61.95; building material, $33.20; freighting, $90 and labour, $48.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Indian Residential School. The main building and the barn both require considerable attention. Dr. Westgate telegraphed, asking that the materials be purchased immediately so that they could be freighted in time to be used this summer. I telegraphed that Mr. Indian Agent Laird should prepare an estimate, which is now to hand. It appears that shingles, flooring, logs and other lumber will cost $372; freight, $350; and labour $366 - a total of $1088. I wish to recommend that Mr. Indian Agent Laird purchase the material necessary, arrange shipment and have the work proceeded with as soon as possible.\n\nRussell Heiser\nDept. of Indian Education.\n31 RN CX 30 NIVIA EDMONTON\n\nGROUARDALTA MAR 10\n\nJ D MCLEAN\n\nDEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS, OTTAWA ONT.\n\nESTIMATE REPAIRS TO STANDREWS SCHOOL WHITEFISH LAKE SHINGLES LUMBER FLOORING LOGS THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO DOLLARS FREIGHT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS LABOR THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX DOLLARS\n\nHAROLD LAIRD\n\nIndian Affairs.

I beg to thank you and your Department for your prompt and sympathetic response to my request in this connection, and I trust that the repairs sanctioned may be effected before the rigors of winter set in.\n\nWhen I telephoned to you from Grouard on the 3rd instant after consulting Mr. Indian Agent Laird stating that I considered $2000.00 would be sufficient to meet the repairs at this school, I had in mind the urgent need of a separate class room which it was thought could be supplied for $1000.00. The provision of this would have been a great comfort to the staff and pupils, and have added much to the efficiency of the School. I regret that it was not actually named in the list of requirements forwarded to your Department last Autumn to be supplied this year, but it was included in the repairs to the Main School Building etc., and it was thought the sum of $3000.00 requested would cover the cost of the same.

The list shows the costs of the material at Grouard, and the estimated cost of freighting same to the School.\n\nThe rate of $1.00 per cwt. to Whitefish Lake cannot be guaranteed after the end of the first week in April. To save having to pay the summer rate, which is $2.50 per 100 lbs., I would advise that I be instructed by wire whether I shall purchase and ship the material without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarold Laird\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nSend the following Night Letter, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nApril 2, 1926.\n\nHarold Laird, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGrouard, Alta.\n\nMay purchase materials at\nAndrews school as outlined your list submitted\nwith letter twenty-sixth ultimo.\n\nA.

You should co-operate with the Principal of the School in carrying out the work, and it is thought that he could supervise same, and see that a satisfactory job is completed. The work of erecting the new classroom should be undertaken as soon as weather conditions permit.\n\nReturns of the labour employed should be prepared, in duplicate, on the forms for that purpose, a supply of which is being sent you. An accountable cheque for $400 to pay the labour is also being sent you under separate cover, and this you should account for in the usual manner by forwarding the returns of the labour employed, properly certified. Should you require a further advance at a later date to pay the labour, you should apply for same, stating the amount required. The Principal would, no doubt, arrange to see that proper returns of the labour employed are kept.\n\nAccounts, in duplicate, properly certified should also be forwarded by you covering the cost of the building material and for any freight charges.\n\nThe Department will leave the matter of the erection of the classroom in your hands to have the work satisfactorily completed, as cheaply as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarold Laird, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGrouard, Alta.\n\nA.

You have therefore still to account for the full amount of this advance, and if any expenditure was incurred since you submitted voucher No. 102, you should at once send credit vouchers, together with your cheque for any unexpended balance.

He states there are no fire escapes from the dormitories, and no fire drill, although the Principal has promised to carry this out.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nImmediate cost of fire escapes\nOttawa, July 17, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nMr. Indian Agent Laird reports that there are no fire escapes from the dormitories at the Whitefish Lake C. E. Indian Residential School. The Principal has lately promised to give instruction in fire drill. The Department believes it essential that supplementary exits be provided from the dormitories, and I should be glad if you would let me have an immediate report as to what should be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\n(Copy sent to Agent Laird)\nWinnipeg, Man. July 20, 1929\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your letter of the 17th inst., re the absence of fire escapes from the dormitories at the Whitefish Lake School, and in reply I beg to state that I discussed this matter with the Rev. C. D. White, Principal of this school, when he passed through Winnipeg a few days ago on his way to England on furlough. The main school building, as you may know, is made of logs and was built by our Church some years ago. The height from the dormitory window to the ground is not so great that a child would receive much injury if it jumped from the window to a mattress on the ground or some other safe object. It seems to me that as the building itself is more like a big farmhouse than a school, little difficulty would be found in removing all the children from the school by the present exits. However, as your Department appears to consider it essential that a supplementary exit be provided, I am instructing Mr. Stone, who is in charge of the school during Mr. White's absence, to have a fire escape made of peeled poplar poles with one end embedded in the ground some distance away from the building, and the other resting against the building itself at the upstairs dormitory window. This kind of fire escape has been installed at our Hay River School, and I trust that it may meet with your approval. I am also reminding Mr. Stone of the instructions issued some time ago to all Principals to have a fire drill to be practised regularly by the pupils.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.S.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6380, file 769-5, part 1)\nWinnipeg, Man. September 7, 1960\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of July 17th last No. 131-10-5 and my reply of July 20th, I beg to state that I have been informed by Mr. James Stone, acting Principal, of our White Fish Lake School that two substantial ladders made of peeled poplar poles have been spiked to the building from the windows of the boys' and girls' dormitories, to serve as fire escapes. Mr. Stone also stated that weekly fire drills will be instituted by the school management as soon as the school reopens after the holidays.\n\nI trust that this action on the part of the management of the school may be satisfactory to your department.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.

A reply has been directed to him to the effect that the Department hopes to replace these schools by a central modern one in the not distant future and that in the meantime the school management should be urged to get along with the equipment they already possess.\n\nApril 25, 1930.\nGrouard, Alta.,\nJuly 4th, 1930\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to state that I have received a requisition from Reverend C.

Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43, The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nThe Rev. C. D. White, Principal of our Society's Indian Residential School at White Fish Lake, Alta., is very anxious to know what improvements at this school have been sanctioned by your Department for the current fiscal year.\n\nIn the list of requirements submitted to you by our Commission in the autumn of 1929, the sum of $500.00 was specified in this connection, provided the amalgamation of our three schools in Northern Alberta could not be undertaken this year.\n\nWhen I visited this school in March of the current calendar year, I made a list of the most urgent requirements, and these were as follows:\n\n1. Renewal of foundation logs in the main school building $200.00 (This school was built in 1906 and the foundation has not been renewed since).\n2. Lining the class-room with beaver board ............... 100.00\n3. Building a new cow stable .................................. 300.00\n4. Building an implement shed .................................. 250.00\n5. Lumber for general repairs .................................. 100.00\n\nOn April 15th I made known to you these urgent needs, and on April 28th your reply stated that as your Department hoped to replace these three institutions in the not distant future, and as your appropriation was extremely limited, no items were included for replacement or repairs at these three schools. You also suggested that the management get along as well as they could with the equipment now on hand.\n\nAs the contemplated amalgamation has not taken place, and\nlikely to be deferred, so far as I can see at present, for at least another year, I am convinced some improvements must be undertaken at once.\n\nAs this is the time of year when the logs required for these improvements could be secured to the best advantage, I shall be glad to know if your Department will authorize an expenditure for this purpose, and the amount of the same. The total estimated cost of the improvements, including materials and labour, is approximately $1,000.00. If you will authorize an expenditure of $500.00 for the materials, I will ask the Principal to arrange for payment to be made after April 1st of next year, when a further sum of $500.00 will be required to meet the cost of labour.\n\nI commend this request to your favourable consideration, and remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\n5.

The schools visited were:\n\n- St. Andrew's at Whitefish Lake\n- St. Peter's & St. Bernard's at Grouard\n- St. Bruno's on the Lesser Slave Lake\n- St. Francois Xavier in the Grande Prairie District\n\nST. ANDREW'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (C. of E.)\nWHITEFISH LAKE RESERVE.\n\nThis school is situated on the Little Whitefish Lake, and is 45 miles north east of Grouard, and about 60 miles from Emilda, the closest railway point on the Northern Alberta Railway to the school. The road in from Grouard, for the greatest part, has been cut through a heavy growth of bush, and during the summer months I can readily see that at times it would be difficult to freight in supplies, but during the winter, when the muskegs and lakes are frozen over, the question of transportation is not a difficult one.\n\nI visited this school on February 10th, and found 22 children in attendance, 10 boys and 12 girls. There were also 3 non-treaty children attending as day scholars. The Rev. C. D. White is in charge as Principal.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nST. ANDREW'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (S. of E.) Cont'd.\n\nas Principal and has acted as such for many years. He has, as assistants, Mr. James Stone, teacher, who is non-professional, Miss Punchard, matron, and Mrs. Howe, cook.\n\nThe buildings include the residence for the children, a residence for the Principal, a separate building for a classroom, a horse and cow stable, as well as a storehouse. All the buildings have been constructed with log walls. The Principal's residence was erected about thirty-five years ago. The residence for the children was erected over twenty-five years ago. This building was not placed on a foundation in the first instance; the foundation logs have rotted, which makes the floors very uneven and has put the windows and doors out of line. The cellar is merely a hole in the ground. The building provides a kitchen, a small staff dining room, a girls' playroom, which is also used as a community room for holding services and so forth, a small dining room, which is also used as a playroom for the boys during the winter months. The upstairs provides two staff bedrooms, one for the lady members, and the other for the teacher who supervises the boys. The boys' dormitory is 16' x 18', with a pitched roof, the inside of which has not been ceiled, and consequently provides a certain amount of ventilation through the cracks. There are 9 beds in this dormitory for 10 boys, two of the younger ones having to double up. The girls' dormitory is 15' x 20' in size, with a pitched roof similar to that of the boys'. There are 11 beds for 12 girls, 2 of the smaller ones having to sleep together.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6380, file 769-5, part 1)\nST. ANDREW'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (C.of E.) Cont'd.\n\nThe windows in this building are small and narrow, each sash containing 4 - 10\" x 12\" lights.\n\nA few wash basins are provided in each dormitory, and individual towels, as well as tooth brushes, are supplied. The conveniences in this school are necessarily rather primitive. Coal oil lamps are used for lighting and box stoves for heating purposes.\n\nSix Pyrene fire extinguishers are placed at convenient points throughout the building. The water supply is obtained from the Whitefish Lake, and has to be hauled to the building. There is no adequate provision made for water storage. Ladders, which can be leaned up against the windows, are provided as a means of escape in case of fire.\n\nThe washing for the school is all done in the kitchen as they have no other place in which to do it. The consequence is that during the winter months, on wash days, the school is not a very pleasant place, and the clothes are hung up to dry in the kitchen, the girls' playroom, the dining room, and, in fact, practically the whole building has to be utilised. On the evening of my arrival, which was on wash day, when I entered the school I had to dodge clothes lines. These are difficulties which have to be put up with in the older class of schools such as this. The floors are rough and uneven, but I found them very clean. As a matter of fact, the building was in a very creditable condition considering the class of building it is, and I can readily understand that it is a difficult matter to keep\nST. ANDREW'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (C.of E.) Cont'd.\n\nmatter to keep this building in presentable shape. A new building is badly required.\n\nThe classroom is a new log building 19' x 21', with a 9 ft. ceiling. It is lighted by 4 small windows, one at each side of the door in front, and 2 at the end. These windows have 4 - 10x12 lights in each sash. It will be readily understood that these small windows in a thick log wall do not give very much light. If the front windows were doubled up, it would greatly improve the lighting and at no very great cost.\n\nThe children have a healthy, clean, and bright appearance. They looked well nourished. I saw them at their evening meal, and noted that ample good, wholesome food was supplied for the meal.

The statement of new school buildings required, and as it appears on sheet 1 of the enclosed, has been very carefully prepared by our Commission, in conference with Canon S. Gould, the General Secretary of our Society, and while it is conceded that some time may be required to provide the total number mentioned, there is no doubt whatever on the part of our Society about the urgency of the need of these buildings, and it is very earnestly hoped that one or two of them at least may be supplied each year, until the total number has been completed.\n\nIn keeping with the arrangement suggested by the late Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Education, and approved by our Commission, the list of buildings which it is desired should be provided next year, is recorded on a separate sheet (sheet 2), and is followed by information showing the necessity of the buildings mentioned (sheets 3 and 3 continued). From the information given on the sheets specified, you will note that a new and Amalgamated school, to embrace the activities of the existing institutions at White Fish Lake and Wabasee, is considered the most urgent of all the buildings mentioned, and it will be a keen disappointment to our Society if there is any further delay in providing the same. Our Commission would very respectfully and very earnestly commend to your careful and sympathetic consideration their recommendation embodied in the closing part of paragraph 1 (a) on page 5.\n\nThe suggestion having been made to the Commission that any scheme for the amalgamation of the White Fish Lake and Wabasee...\nSchools, might be extended so as to embrace the activities of the Hay River School as well, with the possibility of having the amalgamated School located at a central point such as Fort McMurray, the members carefully considered the same, but were convinced that this arrangement would not be feasible. In addition to the difficulty already referred to in the enclosed statement, relative to bringing the present pupilage of the Hay River School further south, there would be the equally great difficulty of bringing the present pupilage of the White Fish Lake and Wabasca Schools to Fort McMurray via Edmonton. Moreover, as the greater part of the pupilage for the proposed amalgamated school in the vicinity of the eastern end of Lesser Slave Lake, would in all probability be drawn from the Wabasca and White Fish Lake districts, and points along the Northern Alberta Railway, it did not seem reasonable to the members of our Commission that such pupils should be asked to go so far away from their homes as to Fort McMurray. Considerations of an adequate supply of fish for food, or suitable land for farming and gardening purposes, wood fuel, cost of freighting supplies, etc., received the attention of the Commission, and influenced the members in reaching the decision noted above.\n\nAfter the provision of the amalgamated school just referred to, our Commission considered the need of a new school at Moose Factory to be the next most urgent need, and any help your Department may be able to give in having this need met next year, as well as the very urgent requirements mentioned under the various other schools, will be very greatly appreciated by our Society.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nYou will recall that during my interview with you in Ottawa on September 13th last, you suggested that any plan for the amalgamation of our Society's Schools at White Fish Lake and Wabasca in the Province of Alberta, might be extended so as to include our School at Hay River in the North West Territories as well. You also suggested that the amalgamated School which would embrace the activities of these three Institutions might be located somewhere in the vicinity of Fort McMurray.\n\nOur Commission, in consultation with the Rev. Canon S. Gould, General Secretary of our Society has given very careful consideration to these suggestions, and has come to the conclusion that it would not be feasible to combine the activities of the three schools mentioned in one institution. As further reference has been made to this important matter in a letter which is going forward to-day to the Secretary of your Department, I am enclosing a copy of the same for your information, and trust that the recommendation made with regard to the amalgamation of the White Fish Lake and Wabasca Schools, and the maintenance in operation of the Hay River School until another school building has been provided somewhere along the Mackenzie River, or in the Mackenzie River Delta, may be accepted by your Department, and every effort possible made to have the activities of the White Fish Lake and the Wabasca Schools consolidated into one fully modern institution next year.\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nEncl.\n\nTBRW/JF\n\nIndian Affairs.

Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\nNovember 23, 1934.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 2nd instant, regarding the suggested plan for the amalgamation of your Society's Residential Schools at Whitefish Lake and Wabasca, I would say that the Department has been giving serious consideration to the need of providing a fully modern institution for the children of both these schools, to be erected in a central locality.\n\nI have lately had an opportunity of discussing the matter at some length with the Honourable the Superintendent General. He does not look very favourably upon the building of new schools at the present time but is prepared to consider the erection of new structures in the way of replacing buildings that have outlived their usefulness.\n\nI placed before the Minister the suggestions made you when you were in Ottawa, that is to say, the advisability of consolidating the schools at Whitefish Lake and Wabasca, respectively, and building one modern structure to take care of the children now being accommodated at these two schools. The Department would favour a new structure being built at a point in the vicinity of the eastern end of Lesser Slave Lake, as suggested by you, as it is noted that the greater part of the pupilage for the proposed amalgamated school\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nwould in all probability be drawn from the Wabasca and Whitefish Lake districts and points along the Northern Alberta Railway. In choosing a site, consideration should be given to suitable land for farming, fuel, cost of freighting supplies, etc., and it should be near a line of communication.\n\nOur Estimates for the next fiscal year are now in course of preparation. It is intended to include an amount to erect a modern building to provide for the number of pupils available, but I am unable to state, at the present time, whether same will be approved by the Treasury Board for submission to Parliament.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMay 18, 1936.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI wish to refer to conversation during your recent visit to the Department, regarding the amalgamation of your Society's residential schools at Whitefish Lake and Wabasca and providing a modern building for the children of these schools.\n\nAs I understood the matter, you were of opinion the new building should be located at Whitefish Lake, as this point would meet the needs in providing residential school facilities for the Anglican Indian children of both reserves.\n\nThe Department would concur in amalgamating these two schools and the erection of a new building at Whitefish Lake. I may say it was hoped to obtain the necessary funds to erect the building under the Public Works Construction Act, but this Department was unable to obtain the appropriation. Owing to many demands, it is uncertain when this Department would be able to provide the funds.\n\nI wish to place before you, for consideration, the matter of your Society providing the capital expenditure and undertaking the erection of a modern building to accommodate 75 to 100 children. I should be pleased if, after you have had an opportunity of discussing the matter with your Society, you will advise me regarding their decision.\n\nI may add that all Indian residential school buildings in the northern part of Alberta and in the Mackenzie River district are church-owned institutions - the churches interested having provided the initial cost, this Department subsequently contributing grants in some cases towards alterations and extensions to buildings.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

I have also read over carefully the copy of your letter to Doctor Westgate from which I take it that his suggestion was to consolidate the schools at the Whitefish Lake and Wabasca Reserves and build a modern structure at the Eastern end of Lesser Slave Lake.\n\nPersonally I think this arrangement would not be very satisfactory as the school would be located too far from the recruiting ground. As you are aware, the Roman Catholic Church have a large school at Wabasca and just speaking from memory, when I was there last year ago last summer there were 85 Indian children and 40 Halfbreed children in the school. At the mission about 7 miles distant, there were 30 children. What will happen there if the school is closed down and one built at Slave Lake is that the Anglican parents at Wabasca will all join the R.C. church so that they can send their children to that institution at Wabasca, and in a short time we would not be able to recruit any children from there with the exception of a few orphans; Not that I have any concern as to which church the Indians belong to, but I am merely pointing out what is liable to be the outcome of the proposed change if put into effect, as it has so happened at other places. The roads from Wabasca to Slave Lake a distance of about 100 miles are practically impassible in the winter and especially in wet weather, and I have been informed that the only way you can get through is with team and lumber wagon with a small load.\n\nA situation similar to the above would arise at Whitefish Lake and we would have the same difficulty in recruiting children for the new school from there. The Indians would gradually go over to the R.C. Church so that they could send their children to Groberg instead of to a school down at the South end of the lake. As far as I know there is no trail on the North side of Slave Lake and they would have to be brought up to Groberg and then down the South side of the lake to wherever the school was built, and this would be at least another 100 miles. There may, however, be some trail straight through that I do not know if.\n\nI am sure Dr. Westgate is aware of the difficulties encountered in recruiting for a school that is any great distance from the reserve, Elkhorn, for instance, and I think this matter should receive a great deal of thought before any change is made. I might state that to the best of my knowledge the reserves along Lesser Slave Lake are almost hundred per-cent Roman Catholic.\n\nDoctor Harold W.

C., Winnipeg, Man.\nDated October 31, 1935.\n\nOriginal on 160-2\n\nThe need of the two new school buildings, namely, the one at White Fish Lake, Alta., and the other at Moose Factory, Ont., is so well known to your Department, that further information beyond that given in the enclosed statement, appears to me to be quite unnecessary, and it will be a great disappointment to our Society if there is any further delay in having these buildings provided.\nWHITEFISH LAKE:\n\nNew school at Whitefish Lake to unite the activities of the Whitefish Lake and Wabasca Schools, both of which were built with church money many years ago. As our Society and your Department have already agreed to the amalgamation of these two Schools, and as your Department made an effort to have sufficient funds made available for the building of the new school at Whitefish Lake during the current calendar year, further comment appears to be unnecessary, except to ask that priority of claim in the way of new buildings for our Society for the next fiscal year, be given to the one in question.\nDecember 9, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nWill you please advise me the number of pupils that accommodation will be required for in the proposed new Indian Residential School at Whitefish Lake.\n\nI require this information before entering into any discussion regarding the type of building, location, etc.\n\nArchitect.\n\nThere are not more than 75 Anglo-Indian children I would consider a building to accommodate that number would be sufficient.\n\nJ.

I would like to have a recommendation as to the site, and full information as to the source of water for water supply and sewerage system. If possible it is hoped to erect the building of fireproof construction using reinforced concrete. I would therefore like to know if a suitable gravel can be obtained near the site of the building, the arrangements that would have to be made for the transportation of materials from the nearest railway station to the site, and if possible some idea of the hauling costs.\n\nI would also like to be advised as to the fuel that would be used in connection with the steam heating system that would be installed in the building.\n\nMr. E. Gardner Smith has for some years past supervised the erection of some of our schools and is therefore well acquainted with their requirements. He also has a thorough knowledge of building construction and the necessary requirements in the selection of a site. You may therefore, if you think it advisable, employ him to investigate and report fully giving the information required.\n\nI am sending you, under separate cover, a blue print copy of the Whitefish Lake Reserve also the Department of the Interior sheet of that section.

Gardner-Smith for the purpose of looking over the site, gravel, and getting a lot of information that is necessary, as I am very busy, and it would have worked considerable hardship on me to make this trip. Therefore, I have arranged with Mr. Gardner-Smith to leave here on the morning of the 2nd January, as that is the train day from Edmonton to Driftpile.\n\nIn the meantime I wish to give the Department the following information: All material will have to be hauled in in the winter time, as the roads in summer are absolutely impassable. One may get in with a pack horse or in an empty wagon, but last summer they were practically impassable for even an empty wagon. Therefore, it is out of the question to get any material in there during the summer, and as roads generally break up during March all hauling would have to be completed by at least the end of that month.\n\nThe fuel that would have to be used for heating is wood as it is too far to haul coal from the\nrailway to White Fish Lake. The nearest shipping point to White Fish Lake is one of the following stations: Grouard, Joussard, Or Unilda, now called Grouard. I thought I had better pass this information on, but I am instructing Mr. Gardner-Smith to look into all matters pertaining to the building of the school, and I will report fully on his return from that point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Then there should be a bunk-house for workmen, and a mess-house for meals. Stoves, tables, benches and bunks should be provided. Lumber for these buildings, nails, roofing paper, stoves, etc., could be shipped in, and the buildings erected, previous to the general hauling of building materials. The teamsters would then have somewhere to eat and sleep after the long haul through the wilds; and these temporary buildings would also house the artisans who would come later.\n\nIt is therefore respectfully suggested that if the Department decides to build the proposed school this year, that authority be given to proceed as early as possible in providing the essential temporary buildings. I have had previous experience in setting up working camps, and, if so instructed, would be pleased to undertake this preliminary preparation, and perform any other services which the Department might require.\n\nIn anticipation of the Department's authority, I shall draw rough plans of the suggested temporary buildings, and prepare a list of materials required, so that there need be no\navoidable delay if authority comes to proceed with this work. These buildings, would of course, be of inexpensive type, but suitable for the purposes in view, and could probably be utilized as outbuildings by the Mission afterwards as has been the case in some other instances.\n\nWith kind personal regards, I remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nSpecify Samuel Jones' Non-creasing Gummed Paper to your Printer for Labels, Poster Stamps, Stickers etc.\n\nIt's the Paper that makes the difference.\n\nSend today for \"The Label Book\" free of charge.\n\nSAMUEL JONES & Co., Ltd.\nBridewell Place, London, E.C.4.\nThis map shows the alternative trails for hauling materials from the railway, either from Emilda (now marked Ground on railway maps) or from Driftpile.\n\nPlease return to Indian Office, Driftpile.\nLesser Slave Agency,\nDriftpile, Alta.

Christianson ssq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReport on Proposed School, White Fish Lake, Alta.\n\nIn accordance with your instructions I left Calgary by train on Jan'y 2nd, arriving at Driftpile at 3.30 A.M. On the 3rd, I was met by Mr. N.L'Heureux, Indian Agent, who drove me to his home.\n\nAt 1.30 P.M., Jan. 3rd, we left Driftpile by sleigh for Whitefish Lake. Mr. L'Heureux, who accompanied me, had made preparations in advance, and we occupied a \"caboose\" mounted on bob-sleighs, in which were placed a small sheet-iron stove, fuel, provisions and bedding. We were driven by Charlie Anderson, the Agency Interpreter. The temperature was 24 degrees below zero, with 18\" of snow.\n\nWe proceeded by way of Grouard, crossing Lesser Slave Lake on the ice, and reaching Grouard at 6.30 PM after a drive of 26 miles, where we were kindly received at the R.C.Mission where we spent the night.\n\nLeaving Grouard Mission at 8 AM of the 4th, we drove all day through a rough bush country, breaking the trail through the snow, and at 6 PM stopping for the night about 25 miles from Grouard, and about 16 miles from our destination. We slept in the caboose, with an outside temperature of 35 below zero. Starting again at 8 AM of the 5th (Sunday) we reached St. Andrew's Anglican Mission at 11 AM of the same day. Our journey of approximately 70 miles occupied 2 days, or 17 hours of actual travelling time.\n\nThe Rev. C.D. White, Principal, received us kindly, and put us up for the remainder of the day, and overnight. On Monday morning, the 7th Jan'y, in a temperature of 54 degrees below zero, and through 18\" of snow, he conducted us to his choice of site for the proposed new school. This site is about 150 yds to the rear of the existing mission buildings, and distant about 300 yds from the lake, with an elevation of about 10 ft above the lake level, being on the crest of a fair sized knoll, with the land sloping away in all directions. It impressed me as being a suitable building site, high and dry, with good drainage facilities, and facing the lake with a S.W. outlook. I have indicated the site in pencil, shown on Lot 4, English Church Mission Plot, Plan of Atikamisis Lake Settlement, enclosed herewith. A little land clearing will be necessary in removing trees. I enclose a snap-shot of the site.\nWith regard to a water-supply for the proposed school, there are 2 existing sources of supply\u2014one the lake itself, and the other being Minx River. The Rev. Prin. states that the latter is much the better water, particularly in the summer. I asked him to guide me in the most direct route from the building site to the nearest point on the river, which he undertook to do, following his usual trail through deep snow and dense bush, past two Indian cemeteries, then through thick brush, until I fancied we were both lost! Finally we emerged beside an Indian's shack fronting on the river, and guarded by threatening huskies. I had attempted to pace the distance as I followed my guide, but the travelling was so circuitous that I could not get up, and I'm sure a water-line trench is impracticable in that direction, and the distance too great, probably nearly half a mile.\n\nThe 2nd existing source of water-supply (from the lake) is much more feasible, but would require about 350 yds. of pipe and a 7 ft. trench across land already cleared. As the lake is shallow near the shore it might be necessary to sink a well near the shore to a depth well below the bottom of the lake ice, and to take the water from such well the lake water should enter the well freely through sand and gravel, and be filtered to some extent at the same time. A small well-house and pumping plant could be built over the suggested well when proven, and the water forced to a pressure-tank or reservoir at the school.\n\nA 3rd possibility for a water-supply would be to dig a well at or near the site, and if a suitable supply could be obtained in this way it would prove less costly than taking it from the lake. As well-digging rigs are not available in that region, any well would have to be dug. It might prove worth while to try this chance first.\n\nSand and gravel, especially sand, are said to be procurable at no great distance from the mission. Local inquiries resulted in a tug of gravel being brought for my examination by a half-breed who had dug it with pick and shovel from frozen ground on our own place. The sample, though rather dirty from surface soil, indicated gravel suitable for concrete, and as it was said to be from a large body, I think we may safely assume that sufficient sand and gravel are available not far from the proposed site. Owing to the extreme low temperature and deep snow I did not prospect for sand and gravel myself, but had to depend on local information in this regard.\n\nAs coal is not available at Whitefish Lake, but an unlimited supply of wood in the adjoining bush, the heating boilers would require to be wood-burning. The trees in the locality are mostly poplar, with a scattering of fir and other conifers. Perhaps two moderate-sized boilers might be preferable to one large boiler, and easier transported.\n\nThe existing buildings at St. Andrew's Mission are unpretentious one-storey log structures with attics above, and somewhat dilapidated in appearance. About 25 young Indian children were in residence, and the small staff of five appeared to be carrying on courageously under adverse conditions, and with no modern conveniences to mitigate their hardships, the children were well-behaved, and everything seemed to be running smoothly and harmoniously in the work of this remote mission on the fringe of civilization.\n\nTransportation is a very important factor in connection with any building programme at Whitefish Lake. Roads, as generally understood, are non-existent, there being only ungraded trails winding through the bush, often over muskeg surfaces. It is said that summer hauling over the muskegs...\nbetween Lesser Slave and Whitefish Lakes is impossible, and that all heavy hauling must be done during the winter months if at all. Such being the case it would seem imperative that if a modern school is to be built this year at Whitefish Lake then the promptest possible action must be taken to get the building materials delivered before the spring break-up, which I am told usually occurs about the end of March, occasionally a little later.\n\nMr. L'Heureux assures me he can get sufficient Indians and their teams to do the hauling, and that a number of them are already keeping their horses fed so as to have them in good shape for this undertaking when he says the hauling will give them a chance to earn some much-needed cash, and that he would like it awarded only to Indians, and not to white men with other sources of relief. From the railway to Whitefish Lake will take 4 days for the round trip, and assuming 200 lbs to a load, the hauling cost will probably run to about $14.00 a ton. This estimate is on the basis of $6.00 a day for man and team, from which they would have to find their own hay, oats, food and shelter.\n\nRegarding the route to be followed in hauling materials from the railway to Whitefish Lake, one alternative would be to unload at Grouard station (marked Emile on old maps) then haul the 14 miles to Grouard R.C. Mission, then 40 miles through the bush to destination; this route avoids crossing Lesser Slave Lake, which is sometimes precarious. Another alternative being investigated by Mr. L'Heureux is to unload at Driftmile station adjoining the Agency, then haul direct north, crossing Lesser Slave Lake, then continuing northward through the bush over an old trail not used for some years, and which will require opening up again should this route be found feasible. It would shorten the haul somewhat, and the unloading from the railway, and the spreading out of the teams, could be more readily supervised. The drawback would be the crossing of Lesser Slave Lake, even if the trail itself through the bush were found practicable. Mr. L'Heureux intends making a thorough examination of the possibilities of this alternative route, and will report his findings to me at an early date. The cost of hauling would probably be the same by either route.\n\nIf it is the Department's intention to build the school this year I shall make bold to offer respectfully a few suggestions for consideration, because of the urgency of early building, and to avoid the delay incidental to the advertising for tenders and the awarding of a contract, I would suggest either that a reliable contractor be nominated by the Department to carry out the work on a contract basis as \"cost plus\", under Departmental supervision; or that the work be done by day-labour under the direction of a building inspector of the Department. I would further suggest that a car of lumber, roofing paper, nails, stoves, etc., be delivered at an early date so that a bunk-house, mess-house and storage shed could be built in advance, and a working camp established in readiness for occupancy. Whitefish Lake is an isolated place, and all necessary facilities will have to be provided from the outside.\n\nAll the foregoing is respectfully submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nSir:\n\nI beg to bring to your attention my letter No. 405-11 of the 15th ultimo in reply to Department's letter of the 10th idem in connection with having Mr. E. Gardner-Smith go to Whitefish Lake for the purpose of picking out a site and getting other information regarding the erection of a new school there.\n\nI might say that Mr. Gardner-Smith returned this morning, and I am attaching hereto his report, which I trust the Department will find in order. There is just one thing that he has left out that I wish to mention, and that is that there is a sawmill at Fuest, 7 miles from the Lesser Slave Lake Agency. They have considerable lumber on hand and it may be possible to get some of the rough material there at a very reasonable price.\n\nI am returning herewith the maps that were forwarded by the Department. These were not used, but you will note a small map that Mr. Gardner-Smith borrowed from Mr. White, showing the proposed site; also an Alberta map showing two different roads that may be used in hauling the material in from Grouard or Driftpile. I am also enclosing three snaps, one of which shows the proposed site. I trust all the information the Department require has been provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

He informs me authoritatively that no funds will be granted for the building of a new school at White Fish Lake this year .......... he hopes that something may be done next March.\"\n\nAs this information has given me much concern, I shall be obliged if you will advise me if a definite decision has already been reached by your Department not to build the new school at White Fish Lake this year which, by agreement, was to consolidate the activities of the existing school at this centre and the one at Wabasca. My concern in the matter is increased by the fact that a decision, if already reached, has not been communicated to our Society, and my inability to understand how it could have become known to the Indian Agent mentioned. You will understand the difference it will make to our Commission in preparing their estimates for 1937, whether those estimates are to be prepared for the existing institutions at White Fish Lake and Wabasca on a separate basis as in the past, or on the basis of the consolidated school already agreed upon. Any information you may be able to give me in this connection will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, March 26, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, requesting to be informed if funds will be available for the erection of a new residential school building at Whitefish Lake during the coming fiscal year.\n\nIn reply I have to say that definite instructions have been issued by the Treasury Board for a drastic cut in our Appropriation. Therefore, the amount that was included for the erection of new buildings had to be deleted. Our Estimates have now been passed by Parliament.\n\nI may add that it is understood the Government intends to provide an appropriation under the Public Works Construction Act. The Department is endeavouring to obtain, from this appropriation, sufficient funds to purchase the materials required in the construction of a building at Whitefish Lake, in order that delivery can be made at the site, by next winter's freight. At the present time, I am not in a position to advise whether the funds to commence the work at this school will be provided. The Department regrets very much that it was necessary to greatly reduce the appropriation for the carrying out of its educational work during the coming fiscal year. It may be the middle of May before we will be definitely aware as to the appropriation that will be available for new buildings, including the school at Whitefish Lake.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

The Principal advised the Indian Agent that a watchman was available between those dates and, consequently, the Agent issued voucher at the end of December for $120 covering months of October, November & December, and another at the end of March for a similar amount covering the March quarter. There has, therefore, been paid to the Whitefish Lake School the sum of $240. The Principal now writes that he was unable to secure a watchman on October 1st and did not secure his services until December 15, therefore, the amount due him from December 15 to March 31 would be $140. He has, therefore, overpaid $100 and he has refunded $59.82 ($60.00 less discount of 16\u00a2 on cheque). That leaves him with $40 to pay the watchman's allowance for April, 1936.\n\nThis voucher is being issued to refund last year's appropriation from this year's appropriation.\n\nThe reason for this occurring is due to the fact that Whitefish Lake is in a very isolated location and mail connections are extremely difficult.\n\n---\n\n**TRIPPLICATE FOR FILE**\n\nTotal, $40.00\n\n---\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n---\n\n**VOUCHER NO. 42**\n\nFORM No. 506\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, the Department is again writing Mr. Agent L'Heureux and instructing him that the voucher for the grant towards the salary of the night watchman at the Whitefish Lake Indian Residential School should be submitted monthly. Cheque for October, November and December has gone forward to the Principal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n35-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRev. C.D. White, Principal of our White Fish Lake School, writing on the 6th inst., states that he had not received any grant for the Night Watchman's salary, and as the man greatly needed the money he was paying it from his own personal funds. As you stated in your letter of Oct. 10th last No. 150-53, that payment of the grant would be made monthly to the Principal, I am unable to understand the delay in remitting the same to Mr. White.\n\nMr. White enclosed with his letter to me the following copy of a letter he had just received from Mr. Indian Agent L'Heureux:\n\nDear Sir: Dec. 31, 1936\n\nAs requested by the Department I beg to inform you that the grant towards the salary of a night watchman will be continued to your school at the rate of $40.00 per month commencing the 1st of October.\n\nVoucher is being passed today for payment of the first quarter.\n\nN.P. L'Heureux,\n\nThis letter appears to me to require some comment: (1) Why did the Indian Agent delay until Dec. 31st to inform Mr. White of the availability of a grant from the 1st of October. (2) Why does he state that a voucher is being passed for payment for the first quarter, when your letter stated distinctly that payment would be made monthly.\nAs the delay in remitting to Mr. White the Night Watchman's salary has caused him much inconvenience I shall be obliged if you will take the matter up with your local representative and arrange, so far as possible, for prompter payment of this agent's salary in the future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/KH\nOttawa, January 19, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer you to official letter of November 26th, last, with reference to the allowance made towards the salary of a night watchman at the Whitefish Lake Indian Residential School. A voucher for this service should be submitted at the end of each month.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nN. P. L'Heureux, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alta.\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn a letter from your Department (by R.A. Hoey) he says Dept. is again writing all Agent L'Heureux and instructing him that the voucher for the grant towards the salary of the night watchman at the Whitefish Lake Indian Residential School should be submitted monthly.\n\nI went off the voucher for January the first opportunity I got after the close of the month, went off by the mail February 4 to Indian agent L'Heureux. I have received no word or cheque from him whether he has notified you or not. I don't know if he received my letter. I can't understand why he has not answered me. This kind of thing has caused me much inconvenience. I have had to advance the man for January, and it will be March before I get paid back.\n\nWill you kindly look into his matter, the night-watchman is doing his work faithfully. Kindly let me know what I am to do. I will send a voucher for February at end of month.\n\nYours respectfully,\nC.D. White\nF. H.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant, enclosing accounts to the amount of $145.05 for expenses incurred in carrying out repairs to the Whitefish Lake Anglican Indian Residential School.\n\nNo receipted freight account was forwarded for the freight charges to the amount of $1.85 in the account of the Northern Hardware Company, and this item was disallowed. In the account of the W. H. Clark Lumber Company there was an item of $1.75 for freight, while the freight receipt attached showed that only $1.70 was paid. There was, therefore, a deduction of five cents made in this account. You will be forwarded, under separate cover, a cheque to the amount of $143.15 in payment of the accounts enclosed in your letter of the 27th instant.\n\nIt is noted that the following accounts returned to you in our letter of the 9th instant have not yet been received:\n\n| Name     | Amount |\n|----------|--------|\n| Bert Wray | $30.25 |\n|           | $6.04  |\n|           | $2.83  |\n| N. Grey   | $2.25  |\n| A. Grey   | $2.20  |\n\n$43.57\n\nWhen these are received, if in order, a cheque will be forwarded.\n\nShould you obtain a receipt for the freight charges paid by the Northern Hardware Company to the amount of $1.85, reimbursement would also be made for that amount.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n38-43, The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Ave., E.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nH. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn your letter of January 19th last No. 131-10-5 you informed me that you were again writing to Mr. Indian Agent L'Heureux instructing him that the voucher for the grant towards the salary of the Night Watchman at our White Fish Lake School should be submitted monthly. In this connection I beg to state that in a letter just received from the Rev. Principal White of this school, and dated March 24th, he informs me that he had again written to the Agent about the Night Watchman's salary, but had received no answer. He also states that he himself had paid the Night Watchman for the months of January and February, as the man had no money, and stood greatly in need of it. Our Commission will be obliged if your Department will kindly look into this matter, and take whatever action you may consider necessary to insure that the instructions given in your letter of January 19th last are not being disregarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n**Canadian National Railways**\n\n**Prepaid Freight Bill**\n\n| Car Initials and Number | Date       | Freight Bill No. |\n|-------------------------|------------|------------------|\n| CP 172727               | Jan 25 1937 K | 7304             |\n\n**To**\n\nGrouard Alta.\n\n**From**\n\n8604 Edmonton Alta.\n\n**Route**\n\nAPR 14 1937 NAR\n\n---\n\n**Shipper**\n\nNorthern Hardware\n\n**Consignee Address**\n\nRev.

It would also appear that the Principal reckoned that the grant authorized would cover all expenditures involved.\n\nThe Principal found, however, that practically all of the grant was spent on the materials which were purchased by the Indian Agent, and he applied to our Commission for supplementary grants amounting to $20.00 for labour. As the Commission did not have all the facts of the case before them at that time they sanctioned this expenditure, but since receiving the following additional information they feel justified in requesting your branch of Government to reimburse them to that extent:-\n\nIndian Affairs.

I was certainly under the impression that the right of spending the grant would be given to me as it was with the late Rev. C.D. White, upon the issuing of a detailed account of the requirements. However, in the same letter that I received notification of the grant having been made it was also stated that everything had been purchased and was on its way into the School. I had not counted upon that in my estimates because I knew I could get the freighting done for less, apart from the fact that those in this place were more entitled to the business than outsiders. Out of the $500.00 grant $140.00 was spent in freighting in five or six loads of lumber, etc. I also ordered 3000 ft. of rough lumber and 1000 ft. of dressed, but the Indian Agent sent me 4000 ft. of shiplap. He paid in this one item $7.00 more per thousand feet and also paid for freighting it in from Driftville, 70 miles further away than was necessary, as we have a sawmill only 30 miles away. The whole thing was simply this that his own friends obtained the business regardless of extra cost at the expense of St. Andrew's Mission. The money I expected to spend on the logs went into the wrong kind of lumber and freighting.

It is noted that the labour amounted to $220.00. Rev. Mr. Cathcart should prepare the necessary pay lists in triplicate.

Together they worked a total of 660 hours at 25\u00a2 per hour making a total of $220.00. This, I believe covers the information requested in your letter of Oct. 27th. to Dr. Westgate of the C. of E. Indian & Residential School Commission.\n\nMay I take this opportunity of thanking you most sincerely for this grant. It has made it possible to give each child a separate bed and already we have noticed a marked difference in their general health and conduct, as practically every child was sleeping with another and this did not give either the proper rest that is obtained when sleeping alone. As a Staff, it is enabling us to do a more satisfactory and efficient work with the children in the meantime, until a new School is erected to replace the present one of logs, very old and worn out through long years of Service to this Reserve.\n\nAgain thanking you for this timely assistance and with the best of Christmas Greetings,\n\nI remain,\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** Rev.

These were not promised by me as indicated but I promised I would recommend the supply. The flag has been an oft-repeated item in this school's previous requisitions. As best as I can remember it dates back three years when the initial demand was made. As to the fire extinguishers, I quote from my treaty notes:\n\n\"Rev. Principal inquires for Union Jack and for Fire Extinguishers. Asked him to submit requisition on sheet separate from that for school material. - Allowance for fire extinguishers could be reduced to one for every 325 sq. ft of room as buildings are of logs, very old and are regular fire neat although they are kept in good state of maintenance.- Had two small fires during last two years; one burned area 5' x 5' in roof before it could be reached; cause not told. Type best suited could be the soda an acid type, size 2 gallons although for easy manipulation by children some of Pyrene pump type could be supplied. Fire drills should be held evry 3 months. Fire escapes should be clear from obstructions.\"\n\nThe quantity of extinguishers requisitioned, I find, is insufficient and I am communicating again with the Rev. Principal on this subject. In the meantime I would recommend the supply of those requisitioned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nN. P. L'Heureux\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

L'Heureux,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alta.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nDuring your visit to this school last November and on June 5th last (Treaty Day) in company with Mr. C. Pant. Schmidt, the Superintendent for the Province, when we pointed out the urgent need for buildings and repairs to the present buildings for our stock and the need of a building for our implements, wagons, sleighs, etc. In the history of the school there has never been such a building or anywhere to put the said articles. In the training of the children in the care of stock and equipment, I feel it is very necessary to give them an object lesson, in the place where they are being trained for the future. Our cow barn is forty years old and being of logs is rotten and dangerous to work in and at a rather dangerous angle. Last winter we had one of the animals partly frozen because it is impossible to keep it warm in our severe winters. The shingling of the roofs and the replacement of new logs under the other buildings along with lumber to put in the lofts for flooring in order to hold hay and new planking and runners for the barns will cost about $500.00\n\nThese were pointed out to you both in your visit and I was assured that everything possible would be done to see that the need was met as the above mentioned repairs and replacements were of a certainty badly needed. I am not sure whether they will be or costly. It is, in my humble opinion, much more important to have buildings and equipment such as they can copy upon graduation, and not such that it will be forever impossible for them to duplicate. Thus I feel that if I can have buildings well built of logs, carefully plastered so as to be warm and comfortable and keep the stock in the best that stock ought to be kept and cared for then the children will be given such a practical object lesson which will remain with them through life. All the tools and implements set into these people are never cared for but are left out in all kinds of weather and wherever they finish working. One sees them frozen in on the side of the lake and lying stripped of parts wherever their hayfields are located. This summer when going through the bush, parts of mowers were picked up in several places by the Farm Instructor. If this situation is not to be remedied and the children trained that are growing up, then this is the place and the only one where it will be done. You will I am sure help me out in this and give me the assistance and co-operation necessary to put it into effect. Personally you will lift a very real load off my shoulders by the granting of the above and I know that in a like manner it will be deeply appreciated by the Commission who are absolutely unable to make the replacements. We have at the present time two carpenters at the Mission working on the church with funds raised in England and if you could forward this request and need to the Department for their sanction so that I could have these do the work before they leave as the work is badly needed before the cold weather sets in. Would you help me out in this matter by your immediate attention and let me know the results in the very near future. I would be most grateful and we could get a splendid job done by the carpenters at a reduced cost. Their work with the Church will be finished in about a month.\n\nEnclosed you will find the estimates in detail and I am forwarding a copy as I mentioned at Treaty time to Mr. Schmidt's Office. Thanking you for past favours and in appreciation of your interests in our needs at this Mission. I might mention in closing that I obtained a permit for lumber cutting which will cover our\nneeds, at a saving of $3.00 per thousand ft. Mr Myles is cutting it for the church at present time. Again thanking you, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) Robt. T. Cathcart\nPrincipal.\nDriftpile, Alberta,\nSeptember 22, 1939.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nHerewith please find application of Rev. R. T. Cathcart, Principal of the Whitefish Lake C. E. Residential School of Atikameg, for a grant to repair the school's farm buildings. Form 37 in triplicate is also enclosed listing the materials required.\n\nAs stated the horse and cow barns are in need of repairs and these buildings are inadequate for the stock they own therefore the construction of a shelter for the bull and young stock would be a useful complement.\n\nI recommend that the Department authorize this grant at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN. P. L'Heureux,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nCalgary, October 17th, 1939.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of communication received from Mr. N.P. L'Heureux, Indian Agent, Lesser Slave Lake Agency, with copy of a letter and requisition Form 37 received by him from Rev. R. T. Cathcart, Principal, St. Andrew's Residential School, Atikameg, attached. I am also enclosing copy of a letter addressed to myself by the Reverend Principal.\n\nWhen at this Reserve and school last June, I remarked to both the Agent and the Principal that it was regrettable that the buildings had been let go so long without repairs, and asked the Reverend Principal to make a formal request, through the Agent's office, that this work be carried out this year.\n\nAs it is, all I can say is, that these buildings are in dire need of repair: I appreciate the Principal's remark that the granting of this request will lift a very real load off his shoulders, insomuch as he states that the Commission (Church) are absolutely unable to make the replacements.\n\nThe Principal does not state the rate of wages he intends paying for carpenters. The amount of $213.00 seems to me to be rather high.\n\nAs regards freighting material from High Prairie and Salt Prairie to Atikameg, the School have no horses fit for this work; the only horses they have are a very, very old team used for chores around the place.\n\nI would ask the Department to give this requisition their kind and just consideration, and recommend that the request be granted, purchases of material to be made locally.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

Needless to say I would deeply appreciate your interest and help in this matter which is giving me such a hard time with old and decayed barns. With such a grant from the Department we could put the buildings in good condition and have something to work upon. It is, as you will understand from your own observation, a most difficult task to instruct the children entrusted to us with nothing to do it with but old rotten buildings of logs erected some forty years ago by our Church in this Diocese. From the encouragement which you gave me at Treaty time and the promise that you would do your utmost to see that the situation was remedied, I am looking forward to a reply in the near future so that we can use the two carpenters already on the Mission as per the letter to Mr. L'Heureux.

Rev. Arthur H. Sovereign, Bishop of Athabasca, in which he states that urgent repairs are required at both the Wabasca C.E. and Whitefish Lake C.E. Residential Schools.\n\nAt the Wabasca C.E. School he states that $300.00 is required for labour and $200.00 for material. Funds are available for this purpose and I should appreciate your advising me immediately what material is needed in order that purchase may be made through our Purchasing Branch. In regard to the labour, you should let me know if Indian labour is to be employed, but if white labour is required you should state definitely the tradesmen needed.\n\nAn amount of $450.00 is also available for repairs and improvements at the Whitefish Lake Indian Residential School. You should supply, at once, similar information as requested in the case of the Wabasca C.E. School; namely, detailed information regarding the material in order that purchase may be made through our Purchasing Branch and also information regarding the labour.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. N. P. L'Heureux,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alta.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMr. N.F. L'Heureux,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease find the estimates below for the Grant of $450.00 recently allocated to the above School.\n\nThe buildings upon which the repairs are to be made are as follows\u2014\n\nThe Principal's Residence\u2014\nThe Residential School\u2014\nThe School store house\u2014\nThe new cow barn which was formerly underestimated as to the cost. This additional grant will complete the same. In order to save the foundation logs, I wish to put cement pillars under it, which will add to the life by many years of the foundation logs apart from the preventing of such a large building from constantly rising and falling from the winter and summer thawing and freezing.\n\nWe are employing as much Indian labour as we can possibly do in any work done that they are capable of doing. I am only letting those work who have had previous experience. We cannot afford to pay for their training. We have living here at Whitefish lake a former Far-Instructor who is a good carpenter and tin-smith. He is far more reasonable in his charges than anyone we could obtain from outside, to do the same work and do it as well.\n\nShingling of the Residence roof completely and of the School Residence repairs here and there where it is in bad shape. The Principal's Resid. has not been done for nearly forty years and is leaking in several places.\n\nNew logs are being put around all the buildings except the School (day school) on the foundation because in the majority of the buildings they were rotten up to the second log and the buildings were sinking to a dangerous angle. The plastering has to be replaced by the fact of the moving of the logs in raising the said buildings.\n\nIn a letter to the Govt. re the fire protection of the above School you made the Statement after an Inspection here with Mr. Schmidt, that it was a fire trap but that all the precautions possible were being taken. This grant has enabled us to put asbestos and tan around every one of the places where the stove pipes pass through a floor, and to put in an escape for the girls dormitory in case of fire apart from the stairway. In other words with the additional fire sprays granted last year, we have everything as safe for the children as it is humanly possible to make it in a log building.\n\nEstimates for the above\u2014\n1000 ft. rough spruce lumber\u2014assorted sizes @ $14.00 per M\u2014\nto be purchased from H.

As you know, the building is old and we are advised that the living quarters are so inadequate that it has even been necessary to ask the Matron to occupy a room through which a male member of the staff must pass to his own.\n\nWe have been striving to secure three lady members for the coming year and have found it exceedingly difficult. The Principal has planned an enlargement of the Laundry portion which would provide an additional room and also make possible a much-needed ice-house. He claims that some of the materials for this work are in hand, but a grant is needed before the work can be done.\n\nThe need for such an enlargement is now immediate as we have received an offer from Mrs. S. Hyde, R.N., a former member of the school staff, who is willing to return as Matron and District Nurse. The Principal is delighted at the prospect of having Nurse Hyde back and declares that she is \"as near to the perfect Matron as any Principal could desire\". He states, however, that the proposed enlargement is essential for her and the invalid husband who must accompany her. He is, therefore, anxious that the work shall be put in hand in order that he may be able to obtain the services of a valuable worker who will be likely to remain at the school for years to come. He estimates that the cost of the work will be not more than $450.00 and asks us to approach your Department with the request for a special grant.\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, - 2. July 30, 1943.\n\nKnowing the real inadequacy of the present building and the extreme difficulty of securing a qualified Nurse under present conditions, we strongly endorse the request and trust that your Department may be able to consider it favourably.\n\nThanking you, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nHAA:A.\nOttawa,\nAugust 2, 1943.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to certain improvements that you state are required at the Whitefish Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nI understand from your letter that the materials required for these improvements have been purchased, but that funds are required for labour. For your information I may say that in the current year's appropriation an amount of $400.00 was provided for repairs and improvements at this school and the sum just mentioned is available for labour at Whitefish Lake. The usual pay lists should be submitted, showing the exact dates on which men were employed, the number of days and the rate per hour, or per day, at which they were engaged.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. H.A. Alderwood, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nM. S. C. C.,\n38-43 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nR.A.

You should forward receipted pay lists to the amount mentioned above. These pay lists should show the names of the persons employed and the exact dates on which they worked and the rate per hour or per day.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been requested by the Indian Agent\u2014Mr. Demars\u2014to write to you for sanction re the spending of the $400.00 grant upon labour alone. There were so many repairs made to the above School this year in the effort to make it more warm and comfortable for the children and staff that it cost far more than the amount granted and I felt that the least trouble for all concerned would be to make it out for labour. This last summer we had three carpenters working on a Church and Community Mission Hall\u2014(paid for by friends of the Mission in this country and in the Old Land) and as the floors on our Laundry and children's dining room were quite rotten in parts from over 45 years of service I had them replaced as well as some insulation work to other parts as the Staff on duty in the Staff Room at nights, during the winter time often have to wear their overcoats despite a roaring fire. What material I did not have on hand for this work from last year I supplied from that of the Church and Hall as I might not be fortunate enough to get any help again for some time and I had to act immediately as we so very often have to do in these isolated places. Both in labour and material the sum spent was double the grant, therefore if the Dept. makes the grant for labour I will forward the Labour Returns to the Agent upon receipt of your confirmation. It is a very difficult time to obtain help in the se isolated Schools and it is certainly made no easier for me or the Commission when living conditions are what they are here in a building long overdue in repairs. True we have been doing a little every year since the new School promised has failed to materialize but dragging it out a little each year is a very tiresome job and a hindrance to the best in efficiency and good work. It has meant that during the last seven years I have been tied down to this repair work each summer while the children were away and have paid my share in no holidays. Your attention and kindness to this matter will be appreciated and I will look forward to hearing from you in the very near future.\n\nThe above $400.00 grant is for the year 1944. Mr. Demars in a recent inspection approved the said repairs made and suggested others necessary in the very near future. Thanking you, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs.

As a result of this, the new staff dining-room and a dispensary have been provided and also an additional room for a member of the staff.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nRe: St. Andrew's Anglican Indian Residential School,\nWhitefish Lake, Alberta.\n\nReferring to your 131-10-5 (E.1) of 22nd September, 1948, and my letter of 24th September in reply, I have now obtained from the Principal, Rev. R. T. Cathcart, a copy of the estimates and related correspondence which accompanied my letter of 26th May, 1948, to you. I enclose a second copy which is self-explanatory. The Principal points out, however, that, since these estimates were originally submitted by him to your local Agent, the addition to the present day-school building has increased the roof area by some 800 square feet which would increase the roofing estimate by about 15% or, say, $180.00.\n\nI again suggest that the balance of $693.40 on your 1948-49 appropriation for this school (see my letter of 17th September, 1948) be used for the purchase of as much of the roofing materials as possible and that the balance required be provided in your Departmental Estimates 1949-50 in addition to the services listed in my letter \"Est. 1949-50\" of 17th September, 1948.\n\nWill you please advise me as to what action you propose to take in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G. Cook\nSuperintendent\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease find enclosed the approximate estimates for the Asbestos roofing, and the keeping of meat and fish through the summer months, necessitates an ice house being built and also a fire escape for the girls' dormitory. These were mentioned to you in your recent visit to the School and you agreed as to the urgent need of the same. We have already had a number of fires from the old wooden shingles, some of which have been on for over forty years. I am enclosing a snap of the last one - the roof being only temporarily fixed for the present. I feel a constant weight in worry over the same and our vigilence has no peace or rest from one year to another, and I feel that some day one of these roof fires will get too much of a start to save the School. The urgent request for the replacements is being made through you to the Indian Dept. at Ottawa.\n\nIn reference to tin roofs or galv. iron - I may state that I am requesting Asbestos as more durable and satisfactory in every respect. The winds from the lake are terrific at times and metal roofs have proven to be no end of trouble in becoming loose apart from their noise from rain and heat in summer. The Manager of the Gov. Hatchery at Canyon Creek, has stated to me that they have never proven satisfactory at any time. The same trouble would be ours. Asbestos roofing if properly put on is also 90% good for future use if removed.\n\nRe: The ice house - the present one has been in use for fifty years, and as it is built of logs, you will understand that its usefulness has long since passed. It is in danger of collapsing at any time.\n\nRe: Fire escape - one can be installed here that will be satisfactory.\n\nRe: Your recommendation for a new roof on our school building as per your January Agent's report to the Government; a copy of which was sent to me.\n\nArea of roofs on buildings to be covered by Asbestos roofing shingles:\n\n6000 square feet or 25 bundles\n200 feet hip and ridge shingle - lin. feet.\n500 feet starter.\n\nModel \"F\" - 27 shingle cutter re the above - $39.50\nNotching attachment\nFace nail punching attachment\n\nApprox. 1945 price for the above Asbestos No. 505 Johns-Manville\n\nQuot. for Duaspastos - Form No. 25-Na-7-44-green roofing shingle\n6000 ft. square - or 25 bundles - $418.75\nApprox. 1945 cost No.597 Hip and ridge shingle 34.00\n\" cost green No. 536 starter 33.75\n\" labour to roof buildings 500.00\n\" freighting costs 200.00\n\" of 125 lbs. 2\" galv. roofing nails 12.50\n\n$1235.59\nApprox. cost of ice house insulated with shavings in order to keep ice without sawdust:\n\n6000 ft. shiplap @ $40.00 per M - $240.00\nNails - 50 lbs. @ .08 - 2\u00bd - 4.00\n1000' 2 x 4 lumber - 35.00\nShingles 2000 @ 8.00 - 16.00\nLabour, approx. - 150.00\nFreighting costs Approx. - 75.00\n\n$520.00\n\nApprox. cost of fire escape for Girls' Dormitory - $50.00\n\nYour attention to the above in having it placed before the Department for their approval in the 1946 estimates will be deeply appreciated so that the same can be freighted in at the earliest possible date and work can be done through the summer months while the children are at home.\n\nThe Agent for the Johns-Manville building material at Ottawa is\n\nMr. Glad Chent\nGov. Repres., Ottawa, Ont.\n\nHaving assured me of the full realization of the above, I know that you will do your utmost to see that we no longer are deprived of what is vitally necessary for the safety of the children and the school buildings. Thanking you, I remain,\n\nyours sincerely,\n\nPrincipal\n\nNote: May 19th, 1948.\n\nMay I bring to your attention that it was in your visit to the above School on January 3rd last that you promised an immediate search for the above estimates in your files and that I was to be notified as to the results. No letter was received from that time until my visit to High Prairie on April 14th, 1948 when I happened to meet you and you requested another copy as the other could not be found. I would certainly appreciate your immediate attention to the estimates as made in the letter of Feb. 25th, 1946. As I have no way at present of obtaining new quotations, I leave the increase in all the quoted prices to you for alteration as they have increased considerably in all Departments of building materials. You will be in much closer touch with costs as they are today at your Office.\n\nAgain thanking you for your interest and forwarding of the above to the Department at Ottawa, I remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(signed)\n\nRobert T.

I have not heard from you on this matter and I now suggest that the balance of $693.40 mentioned in the preceding paragraph be applied toward purchase of asbestos roofing for these buildings and its transportation to Whitefish Lake during the coming winter.

The requisition also covers the building of a fire-escape for the Girl's Dormitory.\n\nDuring my recent visit to Whitefish Lake I examined the buildings at the Anglican Residential School. Those buildings are built of logs and are very inadequate from the standpoint of sanitation and fire prevention, and are very unattractive in appearance. There is no plumbing, no water pressure system and the buildings are heated with outdated stoves.\n\nAlthough I have placed my signature on the requisition for supplies, I am of the opinion that the expense involved in making repairs to the roofs of the existing buildings is unwarranted. I would recommend that the fire escape for the Girl's Dormitory be constructed immediately.\n\nG.S.

Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\n\nRe; Shingles, Whitefish Lake Anglican Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to our letter of 7 Oct 48, your 769-5 (E.l) of 9 Nov 48, and our telephone conversation of this morning, I have been in touch with Mr A.G. Ghent, Manager Govt. Dept., Canadian Johns-Manville Co., Ltd., 171 Bayswater Street, Ottawa, (Phone 8-1026) who advises me that they do handle Coloured asbestos shingles. The description is \"Durabestos, Number 607, which are absolutely fireproof (being made of Portland Cement and Asbestos fibre) and come in various colours such as red, green, blue, etc. The price is about $11.00 per square, i.e., sufficient to cover 100 square feet. They are definitely suitable for roofing purposes but require, as accessories, special ridge shapes and a \"starter\" at the base of the roof. The amount of ridge shapes and starter required must be specified in lineal feet.\"\n\nIf you will refer to the details accompanying our letter of 7 Oct 48, you will see that the quantities specified are:\n\n| Item          | Quantity |\n|---------------|----------|\n| Shingles      | 60 squares |\n| Ridge shingles| 200 lineal feet |\n| Starter       | 500 \"     |\n\nWe are assured by Mr Ghent that the above-described product is far more serviceable than asphalt shingles.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G.

S. C. C. exact information as to the type of shingles which they wish for repairing the roof at the above school.\n\nThey have been in touch with Mr. A. G. Ghent, Canadian Johns-Manville Company, Limited, 171 Bayswater Street, Ottawa, (Phone 8-1026) who advises that they do handle coloured asbestos shingles. They recommend \"Durabestos No. 607,\" which are absolutely fireproof, being made of cement and asbestos fibre and come in various colours. The price is about $11.00 per square. It would seem that these shingles are less expensive than those mentioned in your memorandum and that Asbestos Shingles will be quite satisfactory in place of Asphalt Shingles. You will note that in our requisition we specified Asbestos Shingles, Johns-Manville #505, or equal. It would seem that most of the firms have tendered on Asphalt Shingles.\n\nI would recommend that you contact Mr. Ghent and obtain from him a quotation on these shingles.\n\nBernard F.

F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nRe: Shingles, Whitefish Lake\nAnglican Indian Residential School\n\nReferring to our letter of 7th October, 1948, your 769-5 (E.l) of 9th November, 1948, and our letter of 27th January, 1949, has the matter of supply of shingles been settled, please?\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G. Cook\nSuperintendent\n9th March, 1949.\n\nRev. Canon H.G. Cook, D.D.,\nSuperintendent,\nThe Indian School Administration,\nM. S. C. C.,\n102 Bank Street,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nWe have your letter of the 2nd instant with reference to the shingles for the Whitefish Lake Residential School.\n\nPurchase Order 38888 was issued and sent to J.H. Ashdown Hardware Co. Limited on 15th February, 1949, and it is presumed that the shingles have already reached the school. We are writing to Indian Superintendent Lapp today to make certain that they have arrived.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nPP/ST\nSupt. of Indian Education\n9th March, 1949.\n\nMr. G.S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nHigh Prairie, Alberta.\n\nAttached is a copy of Purchase Order 38888 ordering shingles for use at the Whitefish Lake C.E. Residential School.\n\nIt is expected that delivery would be made immediately following receipt of the order, and as soon as the shingles arrive, you should certify the account and forward for payment so that we can take the funds from the appropriation for the fiscal year which ends on the 31st instant.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n31st March, 1949.\n\nMr. G.S. Lepp,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nHigh Prairie, Alta.\n\nOn reviewing our file we do not appear to have received any Vouchers from you for night watchman services at the Whitefish Lake C.E. Residential School.\n\nIf you are aware that a night watchman has been engaged by the school management, you should forward a Voucher for the allowance which the Department makes, namely $60.00 a month. Provided a night watchman has been employed, we are prepared to allow $60.00 a month towards his salary for the period 1st October, 1948, to 30th April, 1949. In the event of your forwarding a Voucher, it should be issued in favour of \"The Indian School Administration, M.S.C.C., 102 Bank Street, Ottawa, Ontario\". The Voucher should read in the same manner as mentioned in my letter of concurrent date regarding the Wabasca C.E. Residential School.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n30th March, 1949.\n\nMajor D. M. Mackay, Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Purchase of Whitefish Residential School.\n\nDear Major Mackay:\n\nYour letter of the 25th March has just arrived.\n\nI note that for the twelve buildings which are listed you give an evaluation of $22,087.20.\n\nI am to say that my Society accepts this valuation.\n\nYou propose a conference between the officials of our Indian School Administration and those of your Education Division with reference to the educational requirements of the Anglican children in the section of Northern Alberta now served by the Wabasea and Whitefish Residential Schools. Canon Cook is, at present, visiting that area. On his return I think a conference such as you suggest would be of mutual value. He is expected back, I understand, about the middle of April.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLAD K.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**PURCHASE ORDER**\n\nTO J. H. Ashdown Hardware Co.

Residential School.\n\nWe have been reviewing the purchase of the Anglican-owned Indian Residential Schools so that items can be included in the Supplementary Estimates where required.\n\nI do not recommend that any action be taken to purchase the Whitefish Lake Residential School. I believe that this school should be closed and that a day school should be erected, to replace it.\n\nA day school was erected two years ago for the Roman Catholic children on this reserve and it has been operating successfully since that time.\n\nI will refer to you the file on the Tealin Residential School, in which it will be noted that I have hinted rather strongly at the closing of this school and its replacement by a day school.\n\nI believe that a letter should be written to Canon Dixon advising him of this fact and recommending a conference in the near future, as suggested in my previous letter of March 25.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAugust 22, 1949.\n\nRev. Canon L.A. Dixon, M.A., D.D.,\nThe Church House,\n60 Jarvis Street,\nToronto 5, Ontario.\n\nWhitefish Lake Residential School\n\nDear Canon Dixon:\n\nWe have been giving some considerable thought to our educational plans for Northern Alberta. Now that the Wabasca dormitory block is nearing completion we would like to present our views concerning the future of the Whitefish Lake Residential School.\n\nIt is felt that this school cannot continue to operate much longer in its present buildings. Would it not be possible to have these children attend a Day School? The few who require institutional care could be sent to the new Wabasca building. We are prepared to include in our next year's estimates a sum for the erection of a one-room Day School and teacherage at this point. I understand that the Superintendent of Education has discussed this proposal with your officials in Ottawa.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDirector.\n\nBFN: MMcN\nColonel B. F.

As you so wisely suggest, I believe that some arrangement between the two Governments can be made for we are all interested mutually in the education and training of our Indian and those with Indian blood in their veins. I trust that your views as expressed in your letter may be carried out.\n\nI also hope that real progress may be made quickly and that if at all possible the two-roomed school could be completed this year. The need is great and time is passing.\n\nI know that it is the intention of both the Provincial and Federal Governments that all children in Canada, especially those of our Indian Wards should receive a real training so that they may become good Canadian citizens. You will be interest to know that at our Diocesan Synod held last week a resolution was passed in which special thanks were to be sent to the Department of Indian Affairs for their sympathetic assistance and wise administration.

As a result, I understand that Colonel Neary is submitting a memorandum to you recommending that the Department rent from us the accommodation required at Whitefish, as suggested in the closing paragraph of your letter.\n\nI am therefore writing to say that since it will not be possible for the Department to erect a double classroom building this year, this arrangement would be a very satisfactory alternative.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLAD/ap\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Practically all the children of the community would be able to attend the Day School and the one or two children living at a distance could attend the Wabasca school as boarders.\n\nI have chosen Blue-print No. 837 as the suggested plan for the new building.\n\nMay I thank you for all of your thought and care in reference to this and other projects.

It would appear that Mr. Lapp was rather indifferent about the whole affair and lax in his efforts to locate the stove.\n\nYour letter of the 21st ultimo comes as a surprise to me, and I note Mr. Lapp's comments. On the 2nd of August last, Mr. Lapp arrived here with the Treaty Party and I mentioned the Range to him then and he replied that \"it would arrive sometime soon\". I again saw Mr. Lapp in High Prairie at his office on the 4th of October, and he wondered where the range was. The next occasion I had of seeing Mr. Lapp was when he and the School Supt. had lunch with us here on the 2nd of February and he was at a loss to understand where the range could have disappeared to. We all wondered if it had been delivered to the local R.C. Mission by mistake and he said, \"I've no authority to go into the R.C. Mission to see if it is there\", so he said \"I will make enquiries at Mr. Bill Atkins' home in Salt Prairie to see if it might be there\" as Mr. Atkins often brings out freight from Enilda to his home there and keeps it until teams from here go for same, and I suggested that it might be either at Grouard or Wabasca Missions, and he promised to look for same, as he returned home on the evening of the 2nd of February by car in company with the R.C.M.P. Officers, by enquiring at the Atkins' home in Salt Prairie, and the Grouard R.C. Mission and the Enilda N.A.R. Station and he hasn't written me or called here since, although he was in this community on the evening of the 9th\n\np.t.o.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary,\nPP/ST\nSupt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Whitefish Lake Residential School,\nYour file 769-5 (E1)\n\nIn July 1949, the Northern Alberta Railways Station Agent at Enilda informed me that a kitchen range for the Whitefish Lake Residential School had arrived. I asked the N.A.R. Agent to have a local trucker take the range on the next trip to Salt Prairie, a point on the road to Whitefish Lake. During the summer months freight is carried by wagon from Salt Prairie to Whitefish Lake and, since this office has no suitable means of communication with teamsters, it has been customary for the school authorities to arrange for transportation beyond Salt Prairie.\n\nAlthough I have been in conversation with the principal of the Whitefish Lake Residential School on several occasions since July 1949, he made no mention of the fact that he had not yet received the range until I visited Whitefish Lake on February 2nd. After being informed that the range was not at Salt Prairie I interviewed the N.A.R. Agent at Enilda and found that it was taken by Reverend G. Tessier, O.M.I., Principal, Grouard Indian Residential School, to Grouard, and that it is now in storage at that school.\n\nWhen a truck becomes available the kitchen range will be transported from Grouard to the Whitefish Lake Residential School.\n\nG.S.

G.S. Johnston. We have received intimation that it is possible that your Department may, after conference with Rev. Dr. Cook of the Anglican Indian Commission, close this school. The buildings are quite inadequate, largely constructed of logs and in dire need of repairs. I believe that it will be your plan to place an Indian day school at this point which would serve the children of the Anglican Church for this large area.\n\nIf this policy is to be followed, may I humbly ask for the construction of day school buildings comparable to those recently erected for the Roman Catholic Church in this district. I assure you that we will have enough children possibly to fill two school rooms. You already have on file the accurate and honest census of the Protestant children of the Whitefish Lake district. These have been most carefully compiled and are quite authentic.\n\nI intend to visit the Whitefish Lake area during the next two weeks and I will be able to give you further information of the definite needs for these people and their children.\n\nMay I ask for a very careful and favourable consideration of this just and fair application and appeal.\n\nWith every best wish and with many thanks,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Athabasca.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Hay Fields White Fish Lake\n\nIn your letter of May 13th last, No. 131-10-9, you desired me to furnish you with any additional information which Mr. Cathcart, Principal, of our White Fish Lake School, had obtained from the Provincial Government of Alberta about hay fields, other than those handed over to the Metis Colony which has been organized.\n\nFor your information I may say that I wrote to the Alberta Government in this matter on May 3, and forwarded a copy of my letter to Dr. McGill, Director of your Department. The enclosed reply was received on May 15th. As it left the matter still undecided I wrote again to Mr. Cathcart and ascertained that he had been able to locate a hay supply about the same distance from the School, but outside the area set apart for the Metis Colony and had forwarded a request to our Bishop of Athabasca (The Right Reverend Dr. A.H. Sovereign) at Peace River, where the Land Office is located, to find out if the School could secure their hay from that source. In this connexion Bishop Sovereign wrote to me as follows on June 23rd last:\n\n\"Mr. Cathcart has not been able to get very much satisfaction from the Metis Colony but he has found another area north of the big Whitefish Lake. This is about the same distance from the Mission. I have been down to the Land Office in Peace River to see about it and everything seems fairly clear in regard...\"\nto it. There were one or two mistakes in his application and I have sent them back for correction and when they are returned next week I hope that the Mission can be supplied for some time to come with sufficient hay for the stock. The representative of the Metis Colony was quite unreasonable in his demands and would only give the lease for one year. When given any authority, they do not seem to know how to use it reasonably.\"\n\nWhile it would appear from the above that satisfactory arrangements can be made for securing the hay required, the members of our Commission still feel, as I pointed out in my letter to Dr. McGill on May 3rd, that the land attached to our White Fish Lake School should be increased from the 84 acres it now embodies to at least half a section, and preferably to a whole section.\n\nThe Church of England has faithfully served your wards in that part of the country so long that the members feel strongly they are entitled to more consideration than they have hitherto received at this centre in the way of new buildings and other improvements. Most of the buildings, which were put up many years ago with Church funds, are so old and so comfortless that I do not find it easy to offer staff appointments there to any of the numerous applicants who look to me for an opening for service in our Church's Indian Residential School Work.\n\nIt has been one of my most earnest desires for some years to see a new school building at White Fish Lake and another at Wabasca, and I would willingly vacate my present position in favour of a younger man if I saw these two most urgent needs supplied.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nEnclosure 1.\n\nTBHW/KH\nGOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA.\n\nBUREAU OF RELIEF AND PUBLIC WELFARE\n\nAdministrative Building\n\nEDMONTON, Alberta.\n\nMay 12, 1939\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Atikameg, Alberta.\n\nYour letter of the 3rd instant received.\n\nI have recently visited Atikameg and when there I met the Reverend R.T. Cathcart, who advised me as to the difficulties he might experience should he be unable to obtain hay from the lands from which he had previously procured it. As the area now set apart for Metis settlement is placed at the disposal of the settlers, I discussed the matter with their Board of representatives, who advised me that they could take the matter up with Mr. Cathcart at an early date with a view of assisting him to obtain feed from the area which is required for the livestock. However, I am writing to the Department's organizer in that area advising him as to the contents of your letter and trust that arrangements may be made between the Board of the Metis settlement and Mr. Cathcart that will be satisfactory to all concerned.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) F.J.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. T.B. M. Westgate, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nM. S. C. C.,\n38-43 The Bible House,\n154 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nIn a letter recently received from Rev. R.T. Cathcart, Principal of our Society's Whitefish Lake School in Alberta, he informs me that the Provincial Government of Alberta has established \"Metis colony\" approximately 9 miles from Whitefish Lake, with \"a grant of some thousands of acres of land so that each member that wishes, will receive besides other things such as livestock and implements, and lumber, a grant of a section of land.\"\n\nThe concern of the Principal of our School over the establishment of this colony, centres round the fact that the area includes the hay fields from which his school's supply of hay has been secured through Government permit duly paid for, for many years past.\n\nAs these hay fields are practically the only ones in that part from which the hay can be secured, our Society will now be faced with an additional expense in the operation of this school, of approximately $500 a year.\n\nI have written to the Deputy Minister of Mines in the Government of the Province of Alberta to ascertain if some consideration can be extended to the school management for another year or two, or until such time as we are able to secure and clear sufficient land nearer our present school site, and on which the necessary hay and green feed could be grown. As our Whitefish Lake School has only 84 acres attached to it,\nit is the opinion of our Commission that this should be increased, and I am writing for the specific purpose of ascertaining if your Branch of Government will secure the increase for us. I have asked the Principal to make a careful examination of the land adjacent to our present school property, and to submit a recommendation as to what land would best be suited from the standpoints of hay and location for the purpose. He will also furnish, so far as he may be able, an estimate of the cost of such land per acre.\n\nAny help which your Branch of Government may be able to give our Society in the way suggested, and under the new and unexpected conditions which have arisen, will be duly appreciated by all concerned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW/WH\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nEncl.\nMay 3, 1929.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Mines,\nProvince of Alberta,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Principal of our Society's Indian Residential School at Whitefish Lake (Atikameg) Alta., the Rev. R.T. Cathcart has informed our Commission in a letter recently received from him, that the Provincial Government of Alberta has set apart some thousands of acres of land for a Metis colony.\n\nAlthough the colony will be located approximately 9 miles from Atikameg, the Principal of our School is much concerned over the fact that the land area set apart for it includes the hay fields from which his school has theretofore duly secured hay permits, secured its hay supplies for many years past. So far as he knows no other person or organization secured similar permits, and although the establishment of the colony would now appear to be an accomplished fact, he desires to know if any arrangements could possibly be made whereby his school could continue to secure its hay supply from that same source for another year or two, or until such time as our Society would be able to secure sufficient land nearer the school's location, and on which the necessary hay and green feed could be grown.\n\nAs Mr. Cathcart expects to visit Edmonton shortly he has been authorised by our Commission to talk the matter over with you personally. I need hardly assure you that any consideration you may be able to extend to us under the new and unexpected conditions which have arisen through the\nestablishing of the colony in question, will be duly appreciated, not only by Mr. Outhoart and his staff, and our vast Diocese of Athabasca in which our Whitefish Lake School is located, but also by our Commission and by our Society.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nTHW/WH\nSecretary of the Commission.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nCLOSED FILE\n\nFILE NUMBER 769 - 9 VOLUME 1\n\nSUBJECT SCHOOL LAND\nWHITEFISH LAKE - ST.

Acland, Supt.,\nCommanding \"G\" Division.\nREPORT\n\nRe:\n\nTruant Indian School children\u2014Whitefish Lake Indian Reserve.\n\nI have the honour to report that acting under instructions received from Sergt. Schulz, in charge at Grouard detachment, that I left Grouard with Police detachment team Reg. No's 1780 and 1802 on the 16th inst., on patrol to Whitefish Lake Indian Reservation, Alberta. I was instruct- ed by Sergt. Schulz before leaving Grouard, to ascertain the whereabouts of an Indian school boy, by name Julien Hear, age fourteen, this boy being registered at St. Peter's Anglican School at Grouard and having failed to attend this school since its reopening on August 15th last; I was also instructed to visit the St. Andrews Anglican School at Whitefish Lake and interview the Principal in charge as to the attendance of Indian school children there.\n\nI arrived at Whitefish Lake on the 16th inst. From enquiries made there, I learned that the Indian school boy, Julien Hear, was away with his people, presumably somewhere in the vicinity of Big Lake, about fifty miles from Whitefish Lake; as there was no means of locating this boy and interviewing his parents, other than by hiring pack horses, and as his whereabouts could not be definitely ascertained, I left a letter with the Indian councillor James Grey, at Whitefish, which he promised to forward to the parents of this boy at the earliest available opportunity; in this note I instructed the parents to send this boy to school as soon as possible.\n\nOn the 17th Sept., I visited the St. Andrews Anglican School at Whitefish and interviewed the Rev. C. D. White, Principal in charge; Mr. White informed me that at present there were fourteen children of Indian parentage attending this school, the average attendance being about nineteen pupils each year; there were four children not attending school, one being sick, and the other three away at summer points from Whitefish; the latter were expected to return shortly, Mr. White stating that he was assured of their attendance at school upon their return, and that he had never had any trouble in this respect.\n\nI left Whitefish Lake with Police team on the 18th inst. for Grouard, arriving at Grouard detachment on the 20th Sept.; throughout this patrol the roads were in an almost impassable condition due to recent heavy rains in this part of the country.\nREPORT\n\nRe:\n\nTruant Indian School children\u2014Whitefish Lake Indian Reserve.\n\nI have the honour to report that acting under instructions received from Sergt.

November 17, 1933.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Rev. C. D. White, Principal of our St. Andrew's School at White Fish Lake, Alta., informs me in a letter dated the 16th inst. that the two pupils - Pat Williers (No. 98) and Fleming Williers (No. 0106) who were in residence last year did not return to the school when term opened this last fall.\n\nWhen our St. Peter's School at Grouard was closed these pupils along with the others then enrolled were transferred to our St. Andrew's School by order of your Inspector Christianson. Their parents brought them to our St. Andrew's School on September 24th, 1932, and the quarterly returns from that date show that they spent the following days in residence:\n\n| Quarter | Name          | Days |\n|---------|---------------|------|\n| Sept. Qr. 1932 | Pat Williers   | 5    |\n|         | Fleming Williers | 5    |\n| Dec. Qr. 1932 | Pat Williers   | 60   |\n|         | Fleming Williers | 52   |\n| March Qr. 1933 | Pat Williers   | 63   |\n|         | Fleming Williers | 49   |\n| June Qr. 1933 | Pat Williers   | 48   |\n|         | Fleming Williers | 43   |\n| Sept. Qr. 1933 | Pat Williers   | 43   |\n|         | Fleming Williers | 43   |\n\nThe Rev. Principal White states that he applied three times to Mr. Indian Agent L'Heureux to have these pupils returned, and that his first two letters were ignored. In reply\nto his third letter he states he was informed \"the mother claims that it is too far to send her children to White Fish Lake School.\" His concern over the non-return of these pupils, and over the failure of the local Indian Agent to reply to his first two letters is intensified by information he had received that these pupils \"were actually in St. Bruno's R.C. School.\"\n\nSome years ago your Department ruled that pupils who had begun their education in one school should not be transferred to another school, and as the two pupils in question were first enrolled at our St. Peter's School, and then transferred, by order of your Inspector to St. Andrew's School when St. Peter's School was closed, I can see no reason whatever why they should not be obliged to return at once to that institution.\n\nIf they are still at home the mother's reason for not returning them on account of the distance, can hardly be accepted as the school has four other Willier children in residence who come from a greater distance. These are John William No. 100; George Joseph No. 106; Agnes no. 0107; and Clara No. 0108.\n\nIf they have been admitted to the St. Bruno R. C. School, an order should be given immediately for their transfer to the St. Andrew's School where they rightly belong, and steps taken to fully establish responsibility for their delay in returning at the appointed time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, November 22, 1933.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to Pat Willier, No. 96, and Fleming Willier, No. 0106, of the Whitefish Lake Residential School.\n\nAs far as the Department is aware, these children are not in the St. Bruno's Indian Residential School. A request for their transfer was received from their mother but was not granted by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. H. R.

No application form and health certificates were received for them, there being no medical officer in the vicinity of Whitefish Lake, so I wrote to the Reverend Principal and advised him that Dr. McIntrye would visit Whitefish Lake around the beginning of February and to be kind enough to submit the certificates of health of Frank Nehachick and Edith Keyespapamato as soon as possible after the Doctor's visit.\n\nAs for George Joseph Willier (Anderson), at the request of his mother, I asked the Rev. G. D. White to release the boy from the school and let him come home with Dr. McIntrye as the child was a Catholic and not eligible for admission to a Church of England School. The mother and also the children of this family are Roman Catholic, but two of the children who are at present attending the Whitefish Lake C. of E. Residential School were re-baptized under Church of England rite for the purpose of acquiring eligibility to that school.

I know her and she needs to be guarded.\n\nBeing an old missionary having worked for 37 years amongst these people particularly among the young, I see more and more, the necessity of guarding these young girls against evil and keeping them until 18 years of age when they are wiser and have a more settled mind and can be married.\n\nMy earnest desire is that they should grow up good and useful citizens of this land and our people.

This boy has been in the school since January, 1936, and there does not appear any reason why the application for him was not forwarded. In the event of delay in the doctor examining new pupils entering a school, the application should be forwarded and the children could be examined later, when the doctor visits the school and a certificate of health forwarded for them.\n\nIt is noted, in the case of pupil No. 115, Philip Lamouche, that the religion of the parents is stated to be\n\nN.

This child should not have been taken into the school until the application was forwarded, with full particulars, and approval granted. The Department has allowed the grant for the December quarter for this boy but will be unable to allow any further grant until we have full particulars regarding the reasons for taking him into the school. It is considered the Principal should not have admitted this boy until he received the necessary authority.\n\nIt is noted, from the return, that five pupils were absent during the entire quarter and no explanation was furnished by the Principal as to the reasons for such absence. In future, when a pupil is absent any part of the quarter, the reason should be stated on the return, in the column for that purpose, opposite the pupil's name.\n\nI would request that you have the Principal prepare and forward applications for all the above mentioned pupils.

P. L'Heureux, with regard to one of our boys living at Sucker who had not returned to school, No. 58 - Pat Willier - age 15. When St. Peter's was closed he was transferred to this residential school by orders. I told the agent I was willing to pay all expenses to this school, but I got no answer. I think a polite letter needs an answer of some kind. I also wrote to the parents, but got no answer from them. Since then I have heard that he was put into the R.C. school at Joussard. This kind of thing to me is out of all order, and I feel that it is not just to our school. Your Department authorized the placing of this boy in our school in the year 1932.\"\n\nPlease let me have a report regarding Pat Willier. If he is in the Joussard Residential School, you might let me know his register number.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nN. P. L'Heureux, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alta.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 30th ultimo, your file 131-10-10 with regard to the complaint made by the Principal of Whitefish Lake Indian Residential School about Pat Willier No. 98.\n\nThe Principal's letter is dated October 1st and was received here on the 10th. On the 17th I wrote to the boy's parents and sent to the Principal the duplicate copy of the letter without any other form of acknowledgement. I have not received yet a reply from the parents although I again wrote to them on Nov. 5th.\n\nThe facts of the case are that the boy's mother, a widow, married Louis John Callio who with his wife, now are recognized as professing the Roman Catholic faith.\n\nThe distance from the boy's home to the Whitefish Lake School is of some 40 miles, while the Joussard Residential School is only 8 miles away.\n\nPat Willier is in the Joussard Residential School but not as a grant-earning pupil. He is there under an arrangement between the boy's step-father and the Principal, presumably at the Mission's expense.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nIn view of the fact that the boy is to reach the statutory age at which he could be discharged from school, I have thought it proper to avoid a dispute with the boy's guardian and have merely asked him in my letter of October 17th, to show cause why the boy should not be in Whitefish Lake Residential, stating however that if he was going to proceed there, his transportation expenses would be paid for by the Principal.\n\nIf it is the desire of the Principal of the Whitefish Lake Residential School to press for the boy's return, then I cannot but recommend otherwise and will accede to the father's request for his discharge from the school roll.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN. P. L'Heureux,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 17, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to Pat Willier. It is noted that this boy is not a grant earning pupil at the Joussard Indian Residential School. It is further noted that his parents are recognized as members of the Roman Catholic Church.

L'Heureux, attached to which is the letter he received from the Rev. R. T. Cathcart, Principal of St. Andrew's C. E. Residential School at Whitefish Lake Reserve, Lesser Slave Lake Agency, re admission of Sammy Ominayak. Apparently this boy, who is three years old, has no home and having been given into the keeping of the school authorities by his Aunt, Maria Laboucan, who is in ill health, I consider this is the best place for him to be, and would ask that the recommendation made by Agent L'Heureux that the school be paid $5.00 per month for his maintenance until he is age to be taken on the roll as a grant-earning pupil, be approved.\n\nAs regards admitting him into Treaty, I consider it would be right to do so: The Agent states the boy is the son (illegitimate) of Florisse Enemamas Alook, #256 Wabasca Band, and Elzear Ominayak, #111 Whitefish Lake Band.\n\nIt will be noted that application for admission and health certificate cannot be sent until the Doctor visits the School in January next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

T. CATHCART,\"\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, October 22, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of the following letter from the Secretary of the M.S.C.C.:\n\n\"The Rev. Principal Cathcart of our Whitefish Lake School requests authority to admit to the school an Indian treaty child, named Sammy Cominyak, aged three years, on the grounds of destitution. The father's name is Issier Cominyak, and the mother's Floris Cominyak (nee Alock).\n\nThe boy Sammy was baptized by our Church's missionary at Wabasca and his mother is still living there. Principal Cathcart reports that she gave Sammy away when she was deserted by her husband, and she herself is now living with another man. Maria Laboucan, the aunt of this child, kept him for a time, but when her health failed she asked our School management at Whitefish Lake to look after him, and this was done on compassionate grounds. Principal Cathcart now feels, and our Commission share his opinion, that this child should be officially admitted to our Whitefish Lake School on a per capita earning basis, and I will be obliged if you will instruct Mr. Indian Agent L'Heureux to complete at once the necessary arrangements for his admission.\"\n\nPlease let me know the religion of the parents of the above mentioned boy, also the religion of his aunt. For what length of time did the Aunt maintain the boy? What is the mother doing at the present time and why does she not look after her son?\n\nDo you consider it necessary for this boy to have institutional care at the present time? Any other information that you can obtain should also be forwarded for the Department's consideration. Please give)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6380, file 769-10, part 1)\nconsideration.

L'Heureux, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alta.\nSir:\n\nRe: Complaint of Rev. R.V. Cuthbert - Athabasca, Alberta - Alleged Contravention of Indian Act\n\n1. I quote hereunder letter received by Capt. Faulkner, I/c High Prairie Detachment, from the above-named, who is Principal of the St. Andrew's Indian Residential School at Athabasca, Alta., and which letter is self-explanatory:\n\n2. St. Andrew's Indian Residential School,\n   Athabasca via Crowfoot, Alberta -\n   Oct. 21/37.\n\nCorps: Falcomer (sic)\nN.W.M.T. High Prairie, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe following facts and data are being sent to you re the children (Pootsy Indians) stolen from the Protestant Church of England, Residential School of Whitefish Lake, and placed in the Roman Catholic School of Crowfoot, by the Roman Catholic Priest, Y.M. Ploch.\n\nIn Chapter 82 - Part 1 - Section 2 of the Indian Act no Protestant child shall be placed in a Roman Catholic School or Roman Catholic Indian Child in a Protestant School. As you will see by the enclosed information, these children are Protestant, and were taken in open defiance of the Indian Act and Law. No discharge papers have been issued by the Indian Agent, Mr. M.J. L'Heureux, or any reason why they have not been returned, following the above violation. Letters written to him and registered by myself are ignored. This open defiance of the law and all honour and decency cannot go on, and I would deeply appreciate your co-operation and action in seeing that the children are returned to the school.\n\nThe Indian Agents at Spirit Lake, and others concerned belong to the Roman faith, which explains the lack of any action from the Department of Indian Affairs. The methods used by this above-mentioned priest are the same as in other places.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6380, file 769-10, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nComplaint of Rev. R.V. Gilmour - Atikameg, Alta -\nAlleged Contr. Indian Act.\n\nAs in other places,\nwhere the work of our schools is hindered by\nevery conceivable means that is dishonest and\nunchristian. Their creed is that the end justi-\nfies the means.\n\nAt treaty time he brought in some young\ngirls dressed up in the finest of clothes to create\nunrest among our older girls. The people are told\nby the Indians that their bosses, that the church\nof England has no church, because they have no churches,\nno Bible, and that their ministers are igno-\nrant and not trained for the work. Furthermore,\nhe points out the advantages of the new modern\nschool just built at Atikameg for the Roman Church,\nwhere the children never have to work, as ours do,\nand they are not faced by the danger of fire, as\nours is an old building, and lacking in conveniences,\nwhich fails of our aim, but because of sinister\nforces at work blocking the grant necessary for a\nnew building necessary to replace the log ones of\nnearly fifty years.\n\nBy the giving of quantities of tobacco\nand grocerie, he wins the parents of these children\nwho are the victims of it all. One could keep on\nwriting about many other things, but enough has been\nsaid to make it clear, just what we are up against\nin our attempt to build and mould the spiritual\nand moral life of these people. The average indian\nis quite susceptible to bribery as you are aware,\nand as I refuse to use such methods, because of their\ndeleterious effects, morally, we lose every year,\nthree or four children, rescued by the priests, in\nthe early hours of the morning after a service in\nwhich the children are re-baptized into the (one\ntrue church) as he names.\n\nAll I ask, is that the law be upheld and no\nchild be removed who belongs to our school except by\ndischarge papers being given to the school from\nthe Deptt. of Indian Affairs. The existing situation\nseems to me to be very near approach to kid-napping\nand you will agree with me I am sure, that it is\nnot a good thing which brings honour to our\nBritish boast of Justice and Fair-play.\n\nDuring my seven years in this North country\nof Yukon and Alberta, I have found the Indians, stand-\ning at all times for Justice and Law mixed with a fine\nquality of mercy, but free from any political or re-\nligious affiliations which might destroy the above-\nmentioned standards, and I feel certain that my appeal\nfor assistance in this problem will not go unanswered\nbecause the intolerable situation of the last three\nyears cannot continue.\n\nIndian Affairs.

None seems to know or wishes to tell. All I know is that the child was adopted by the grand mother, Louisa Adams, as an infant and raised by her and is on her treaty ticket No. 17. As to having the forms filled in and signed in triplicate I cannot see how that is possible as Prairie Lake is forty miles from here and I am not making that trip every day. The child was sent in by a half-breed and I paid him for his work and also paid him to take one copy of an application form as you only asked for one copy previously. No one is there that I can get the forms filled in through and you noticed the way the way in which the other one was returned. I cannot understand why I should be required to dig up the buried past when the child has been receiving treaty for some years. His history ought to be on the books I would think to justify the treaty paid each year. Please let me know as soon as possible about it as the child has already been in here since October (as to the one form being sufficient for this time).\n\nEnclosed please find the application forms in triplicate for Rosina Phyllis Grey, No. 86 who was brought into the school.....\n\nIndian Affairs.

It has been filled but is totally inadequate to in any way meet our needs. Our present teacher Miss K. Courtney has had many years of experience in some of our largest Schools and as all our former teachers were men without certificates from any Normal School, Miss Courtney found on going over the supplies that there were none apart from the few sent in of late. All these years the children have not had what I know is supplied to others by the Department and I feel as I am sure you do also that as we now have a fully qualified teacher it is only fair to her and to the children to have tools to work with which they can now put to the best advantage. I am therefore asking your sympathetic consideration of our needs in order to make our School as efficient as other Schools and as I know the Department wishes it to be.

In a previous statement dated October 1936, Albert Thunder also declared that he was a Protestant.\n\nKindly let me have your instructions in the matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN. P.

L'Heureux,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile,\nAlberta.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nEnclosed please find seven application forms for the admission of the seven children named therein.\n\nI wish also to apply to the Department for permission to keep in Residence at the above School Gertie Gladue no. 99 in our Register and George Coutre No. 90. George is in his seventeenth year and Gertie in her eighteenth. George's mother is a widow and unable to support him and as there is absolutely no work outside the School and we are teaching him in the art of carpentering, painting, along with his usual work in the several branches of farming, I feel that it is to his advantage, to remain in order to become better equipped to earn his own living later on in life.\n\nGertie as you will recall spent some time in the High Prairie Hospital last Winter and although much better, is still far from well and to return home would only mean a re-occurrence from such living conditions and poor food as she would meet with and find. I am sure you will agree that it is a much wiser plan for her to remain until her recovery which the Doctor said might take two years.\n\nWould you please send by return mail as I have none left,\n\nIndian Residential School Quarterly Returns\nDrug Requisition Forms\nSchool\n\nThe Quarterly Returns are needed in order to have a copy to the Commission at Winnipeg.\n\nThanking you, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nDriftpile, Alberta,\nOctober 15, 1938.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nPlease find attached herewith application from the Principal of Whitefish Lake C. E. Residential School, to keep in residence as grant-earning pupils for a further period beyond the age limit of 16, George Coutre, No. 90 and Gertie Gladu No. 099.\n\nGertie Gladu suffers from epileptic fits and her return to her family who is destitute and unable to support her properly will not help her towards regaining her health and for this reason I recommend that she remain in school for another year.\n\nRegarding George Coutre, I appreciate what the Principal writes about him. However I am under the impression that the boy's mother will look to him to support her rather than otherwise. Also his work for the mission should be worth at least his board, lodging and clothing if not more. I do not object to him remaining in school longer but would like to see him have something when he goes out of there at the age of 19 or 20. I favor some form of agreement whereby all parties concerned would contribute their share of assistance: the boy by giving his labor, the C. E. Mission by providing for his board, lodging and clothing and the Department by setting aside the per diem school grant earned by the boy until his discharge and using it to purchase stock, cattle, implements or tools of his trade, and with which he can establish himself in life.\n\nI submit this for your consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN.

For the past 3-4 years this animal has been retained at the expense of the school but has been used, for breeding purposes, with all the dairy cows in the community. Now there is the danger of in-breeding as \"Charlie\" is the father of all the young females.\n\nCircumstances indicate that the use of Trumilk and powdered skim-milk is a more economical measure than retaining a herd at this particular school and I am instructing the principal to dispose of his herd. Will you please let me know what Indian Affairs wishes are in regard to the future of the above mentioned \"Charlie\"?\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHGC:MAA  \nSuperintendent\nOttawa, Nov. 28, 1939.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 20th instant, File No. 405-3 L.S., authority is hereby given for transfer of the bull referred to therein to the Whitefish Lake Reserve to be placed in care of the Principal of St. Andrew's school.\n\nThe services of the bull will be available to both the Indian cattle owners and the school, and by this means the principal's request can be met without establishing a precedent.\n\nThe bull should be listed on the annual inventory under Vote 71 and not as school property.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.W.

Immediately upon receipt of notice of any such decision by the Minister of Labour hereunder the Contractor shall adjust his wages and hours classifications of work so as to give effect to such decision. In case the Contractor shall fail so to do, or at any time to pay any employee or employees for any services performed or for any work done in accordance with the rates fixed in the schedule or fixed thereafter by the Minister of Labour hereunder regarding overtime and classification, the Minister of Labour may authorize and direct the Minister to pay any such wages at the rates so fixed and to deduct the amount thereof from any moneys payable to the Contractor under this Act; and any such payment shall for all purposes as between the Contractor and the Government be deemed and taken to be payment to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall be bound in every particular by any such authority, direction and payment as aforesaid.\n\n(3) For the protection of the workmen employed, the Contractor shall post and keep posted in a conspicuous place on the premises where the contract is being executed, occupied or frequented by the workmen, the Schedule inserted in this clause and also the preceding paragraph (2) and any decision of the Minister of Labour made thereunder.\n\n(4) The Contractor shall keep proper books and records showing the names, trades, and addresses of all workmen in his employ and the wages paid to and time worked by each workman, and such books and documents and such record shall be open for inspection by the Fair Wage Officers of the Government at any time it may be expedient to the Minister of Labour to have the same inspected.\n\n(5) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of any money which would otherwise be payable under the terms of the contract in respect of work and labour performed in the execution of the contract unless and until he shall have filed with the Minister in support of his claim for payment a statement attesting his claims as described above, showing\u2014(1) the number, wages and hours of labour of the various classes of workmen employed in the execution of the contract; (2) whether any wages in respect of the said work and labour remain in arrear; and (3) that all the labour conditions of the contract have been duly complied with except to the extent of notice given by the Minister of Labour of claims for wages, until the same are adjusted. The Contractor shall also from time to time furnish the Minister such further detailed information and evidence as the Minister may deem necessary in order to satisfy him that the conditions herein contained in respect of the payment of fair wages have been complied with, and that the workmen so employed as aforesaid upon the portion of the contract in respect of which payment is demanded have been paid in full.\n\n(6) In the event of default being made in payment of any money owing in respect of wages or other payments due for the said work and if a claim therefor is filed in the office of the Minister and proof thereof satisfactory to the Minister is furnished, the said Minister may pay such claim out of the moneys at any time payable by His Majesty under the said contract and the amounts so paid shall be charged against the Contractor.\n\n(7) These conditions shall extend and apply to moneys payable for the use or hire of horses or teams, and the persons entitled to payments for the use or hire of horses or teams shall have like rights in respect of moneys so owing them as are set forth in the provisions of this clause.\n\n(8) With a view to the avoidance of any abuses which might arise from the subletting of contracts it shall be understood that subletting, other than such as may be customary in the trades concerned, is prohibited unless the approval of the Minister is obtained, and in the event of any such subletting in all cases to conform to the conditions of the main contract, and the main contractor shall be held responsible for strict adherence to all contract conditions on the part of subcontractor; the contract shall not, nor shall any portion thereof be transferred or assigned by written permission of the Minister, and no portion of the work to be performed shall be done at the homes of the workmen.\n\n(9) All workmen employed upon the work comprehended in and to be executed pursuant to the said contract shall be residents of Canada, unless the Minister is of opinion that Canadian labor is not available, or that other special circumstances exist which render it contrary to the public interest to enforce this provision.\n\nA.

In fact, the road ban was enforced the day following the completion of the transportation.\n\nThis week, Mr. Geo. L. Villeneuve, Treasury Representative, called at McLennan, examined and certified First Progress Payment Claim which he will forward to Ottawa this weekend.\n\nBoth Mr. Villeneuve and myself went to High Prairie and had all accounts signed by Mr. G. S. Lapp, Indian Superintendent at High Prairie, whom you kindly recommended to be Clerk of Works.\n\nSince break up, it is now impossible for me to get in touch with Hay Lakes. When truckers were hauling materials and supplies to Hay Lakes, I was able to correspond with the superintendent of construction there but since trucking has been completed and the roads leading from Grimshaw highway to Hay Lakes have become impassable, there is no means of communication with Hay Lakes. I think that a two way wireless station between McLennan and Hay Lakes should be installed; however, I shall discuss this matter fully with you in another letter shortly.\n\nKindest regards and say hello for me to your neighbour,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev.

Neary,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs' Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your telegram of the 16th instant in which you explained that the proposed rate for Mr. Verret is considered excessive. Instead of replying you by wire, I thought that it would be more satisfactory to do so by letter, as this would permit me to explain more fully the reason why this salary is being paid to Mr. Verret.\n\nMr. Verret is about 45 years old and has some ten years of experience in construction work; he is a full-fledged civil engineer, who came to McLennan last year upon the request of the McLennan Chamber of Commerce and the Oblate Fathers of the Diocese of Grouard. The construction of fireproof buildings is his specialty, but he can ably handle any type of construction work. Having heard of his arrival in the Peace River Country, some Edmonton construction firms have offered him contracts which he declined to accept owing to the fact that he had already promised to handle the Hay Lakes project. Lately perusing an architectural review, I was agreeably surprised to see his \"ad\" and a picture of the Hotel Windsor which he built at Rouyn, Quebec. I take great pleasure in enclosing same for your information.\n\nUsually a Contractor is paid a fee equal to 10% of the net cost of all materials and labour; in the case of Hay Lakes the estimated amount of $175,000.00 has been appropriated for this construction; therefore, if the contract had been given in the usual way, a fee of $17,500.00 would have been paid to the Contractor. Mr. Verret has agreed to erect the residential school at Hay Lakes for the amount of $8,000.00, payable $500.00 monthly beginning February 1st 1949 to April 1st 1950 and the balance $500.00 on April 1st 1950, including board at the Missionary's shack at Hay Lakes. I believe that Mr. Verret's charges are fair and just and that the Corporation Episcopale C.R.de Grouard has made a considerable saving by subletting this contract to Mr. Verret. I may say that it was not possible for us to find another Contractor who would agree to accept this contract for a lower fee, on account of Hay Lakes being so isolated and distant from the railroad and other conveniences.\n\nTrusting that the foregoing explanations will justify the rate of salary which we have agreed to pay to Mr. Mr. Verret. In conclusion, I may say that you can rest assured that it is our intention not to exceed the amount of $175,000.00 that was appropriated for the construction of this school, if we can at all help it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Villeneuve - Treasury Auditor - Edmonton, Alta.\n\nRe: Construction of Indian Residential School\nHay Lakes, Alta.\nLa Corporation Episcopale Catholique\nRomaine de Grouard - Contractors\n\nProgress Claim No. 1 $59,918.78\n\nThe audit of Progress Claim No. 1 has been completed by the undersigned at the Corporation's office at McLennan, Alberta and the report thereon follows:\n\nPayrolls and Payroll Charges\n\nThe Contractor has submitted accounts for the salary paid to the Superintendent, A. Verret, C.E. who has been retained for this contract at an agreed price of $8000.00 payable in monthly payments of $550.00 with board provided. Although official approval has not been received from the Department, the rate would seem quite reasonable in view of the engineering and designing work that the Corporation had to provide. It is doubtful that a competent Superintendent could be employed at a lower salary in an isolated area such as Hay Lakes.\n\nVacation Pay and Unemployment Insurance would not apply to this employee by reason of the existing agreement on the remuneration. The employee has been covered under the Workmen's Compensation Act at the rate of 4%.\n\nMaterials and Supplies\n\nThe Corporation has purchased a good portion of the materials that will be required. This was done in order to effect delivery to the project before the roads became impassable as a result of the spring thaw.\n\nSupplier's invoices have been checked in considerable detail for calculations and extensions. Delivery of the goods was established to a satisfactory degree by examining freight bills and the trucker's invoices which in turn were signed by a representative of the Corporation at Hay Lakes.\n\nOn Invoice #56 from McLennan Lumber and Hardware the following items should not have been charged to the contract and will require an adjustment on a subsequent claim.\nThe total of Invoices 59 and 60 from H. Thompson, Grimshaw, has been incorrectly extended as $23,668.66 instead of $27,568.66. The undercharge of $4000.00 will be adjusted on a future claim.\n\nSeveral suppliers' invoices show that the goods are shipped prepaid. However it has been determined that payment of freight is later borne by the purchaser i.e., the Corporation.\n\nGeneral\n\nWhile a good deal of materials have been delivered to the site of the building, the Corporation has informed the writer that work has progressed only to the point of erecting temporary building to provide shelter for the materials.\n\nThe Corporation has been helpful in every way to lend its' assistance in the compilation of the records and accounts.\n\nThe charges submitted in this claim are in accordance with the provisions of the contract. No fee or profit has been derived by the contractor for the services performed and materials delivered.\n\nSubject to the above remarks, Progress Claim No. 1 has been certified.\n\nJ. L.

Episcopal Corporation of Grouard,\nMcLennan, Alberta.\n\nConstruction of Hay Lakes Residential School.\n\nDear Father Beuglet:\n\nBy now, you will have received, or will shortly receive, a cheque for $99,918.78 as Progress Payment No. 1 on the construction of the Hay Lakes Residential School.\n\nI have discussed the contents of your letter of April 19 with the Director and it clarifies the situation insofar as Mr. Verret is concerned.\n\nI am returning, attached hereto, application No. 1 for approval of sub-contracts on this construction work.\n\nI would suggest that this application be clarified by explaining in it clearly the terms under which Mr. Verret is working. As I understand it from your letter of April 19, these terms are as follows:\n\n1. He has agreed to erect a residential school at Hay Lakes for an amount not to exceed $8,000.\n\n2. This amount is to be paid to him in instalments of $500.00 monthly, commencing 1 February, 1949, to April 1, 1950, with the balance of $300.00 to be paid to him on April 1, 1950.\n\n3. He is also to be provided with board at the Mission at Hay Lakes.\nYou will note in Application No. 1, returned herewith, that his salary was to be effective January 1, 1949, whereas in your letter of April 19 you state his salary was to be effective February 1, 1949.\n\nI would suggest therefore that a new application form be submitted as soon as possible, so that the Director can approve the hiring of Mr. Verret as detailed in your letter of April 19.\n\nI will write to you further concerning the radio stations.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nENCL.\n\nBFN/EM\nBishop's House,\nMcLennan, Alberta,\nApril 8, 1949.\n\nMr. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, Hay Lakes is completely isolated from the outside world. Before break up, when truckers were hauling material and supplies to Hay Lakes, I was able to correspond with the Superintendent of the construction there, but since the trucking has been completed and the roads leading from the Grimsby highway to Hay Lakes have become impassable, there is no means of communication with Hay Lakes.\n\nI think that a two-way wireless station between McLennan and Hay Lakes is an absolute necessity. I discussed this matter with Mr. G. L. Villeneuve, Treasury Representative, and with Mr. G. S. Lapp, Indian Superintendent at High Prairie, who also believe that this installation is imperative.\n\nEnclosed herewith letter to the Department of Transport, and application for licence to install and operate radio station at Hay Lakes and McLennan, as well as application for approval.\n\nMr. Secker, Manager, Radio Supply Co., Ltd., Edmonton, whom I consulted in the matter, explained to me that both stations could be installed at an approximate cost of $800.00.\n\nIt is felt that this expenditure would be amply justified by the numerous airlane trips saved, if this two-way radio is installed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. L. Beuglet.\n\nP.S. The Department of Transport may be inclined to think that there is an R.C.C.S. at Fort Vermillion and may suggest that Hay Lakes be connected with Fort Vermillion. However, Mr. Secker of Radio Supply Co., Edmonton, who is versed in the locations of the R.C.C.S. throughout this territory, informs me that he has no knowledge of a R.C.C.S. located at Fort Vermillion. At any rate, it would be far more expedient to be able to communicate direct from McLennan to Hay Lakes, and this is what you should advocate.\nLa Corp. Episc.C.R. de Grouard,\nBishop's House,\nMcLennan, Alberta,\nApril 8, 1949.\n\nDepartment of Transport,\nRadio Division,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWe are submitting herewith completed application forms covering two proposed radio installations, to be operated in Northern Alberta. We would like to draw your attention to the following in respect to the location and purpose of the proposed stations.\n\nHay Lake: This point is located in the extreme north of the Province of Alberta. An Indian School is being built at this location under the sponsorship of the Department of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch. A camp has been established there and a number of men are being employed; to expedite delivery of materials, a radio station connected with our headquarters at McLennan would save much time and a great deal of money. In case of emergency such as sickness or accident during construction, the radio would be of inestimable value. There is no existing means of communication in this remote area, the country being mountainous in most part, there are no established roads and if help was needed it would perhaps take days before outside help would be obtained. Inspection of a map would indicate the remote geographical location. When the school is established the radio station would be continued as a means to order necessary supplies and to serve in cases of emergency. I would point out that the radio station which has been in operation at the Indian School at Wainman for a number of years has already been directly responsible for saving several lives.\n\nMcLennan: This is our headquarters from which point the establishment of the Indian School at Hay Lake will be directed and through which all supplies are ordered. It is from here that we would direct help in cases of emergency. McLennan is connected with the outside by Telegraph, but there is no means of communication between McLennan and Hay Lake. On looking at a map you will see that McLennan is approximately 200 miles south of the Indian School Location.\n\nFor the distance involved we believe that a frequency between 4 megacycles and 5 megacycles would be most suitable, as this has been proven by other stations operating in the north, operating over similar distances.\n\nYours truly,\n\nLa Corporation Episcopale C.R. de Grouard\nMcLennan, Alta.\n\nRev. L. Beuglet.\nOttawa, May 19, 1949.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nA letter which you wrote to Major MacKay, Director of the Indian Affairs Branch dated May 9th, dealing with the New Residential School at Hay Lakes, Alberta, was passed to this Branch for study and comment, previously to your visit here where the matter was discussed between us.\n\nThe point raised by Bishop Routhier has been studied by our Chief Architect and he advised me that the roof of the building can be raised, thereby removing the need for dormer windows, without increasing the cost, and that the boilers selected for installation have sufficient capacity to heat the increased cubical content satisfactorily.\n\nI am pleased that the Bishop's suggestion can be adapted without adding to the cost, since the overall expenditure set out in the Agreement between the Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Grouard and the Crown, is the limit to which the Department is prepared to go.\n\nThe Director of Indian Affairs has concurred in the revision to the structure, and it will therefore be in order for you to advise Bishop Routhier accordingly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa University,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDirector.\nOTTAWA May 6, 1949.\n\nRe: Hay Lakes Indian Residential School,\nHay Lake, Alberta.\n\nWe are forwarding to you today, under separate cover, eight (8) sets of blueprint drawings for the above building. It is anticipated that you will wish to retain at least one copy for your records and perhaps provide Reverend Father Plourde with another, the balance being for the use of Bishop Routhier and Father Beuglet for construction purposes.\n\nThese drawings do not include the Boiler Room drawings, which will be completed shortly and will be forwarded to you together with a brief set of construction specifications for issue in the same manner. These will cover the heating system and electrical supply equipment for both buildings.\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Building,\n165 Sparks Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nT.S.

Episcopal Corporation of Grouard,\nMcLennan, Alberta.\n\nHay Lakes Residential School.\n\nDear Father Beuglet:\n\nI have recently discussed with the Director your application for the approval of a special purchase of this two-way radio station.\n\nDue to the fact that we have only 50% of our Estimates voted, we are doing everything possible to keep expenditures down at the present time. Therefore, we do not wish to approve of the purchase of these two-way radios at this time. I am returning, therefore, your application No. 2 with attached documents.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEnclosure.\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\n\nHay Lakes Residential School.\n\nI do not believe that you had an opportunity of seeing Father Beuglet's letter of April 8, concerning the two-way wireless station which he requests. I would like to discuss the need of these stations with you at an opportune time.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Hay Lakes Indian Residential School,\nFort Vermillion Indian Agency,\nAlberta\n\nReferring to your marginal notation dated the 12th instant on Major MacKay's memorandum to you of May 11th to which was attached a copy of Father Plourde's letter to the Director of Indian Affairs, you are advised as follows:\n\nOur former Minister, Mr. McKinnon had arranged with Bishop Routhier to provide Departmental funds for the construction of this school by the Oblate Fathers from drawings prepared by our own architects.\n\nA reasonable cost was estimated to be $150,000.00 with a contingency allowance of 10%. The total thus reached of $165,000.00 was the limit to which Departmental contribution was to have been made.\n\nAuthority from Council, the Agreement with La Corporation Episcopal Catholique Romaine de Grouard, and the payment of all accounts during construction, were responsibilities assumed by Indian Affairs.\n\nDiscussing the matter with Col. Neary this morning, it was learned that authority from Council to Indian Affairs permits the expenditure of Departmental funds to the amount of $175,000.00.\n\nDealing with the request of Bishop Routhier received from Father Plourde the matter of eliminating dormers, and as an alternative increasing the height of the upper floor slightly so that the roof overhang will be about the top of second storey windows, raises no structural problem, and since the heating equipment as designed has sufficient capacity to take care of the additional volume that will be produced in the building, the change should make no difference to the total cost.\n\nMajor MacKay was contacted by telephone this morning and stated to your Chief Architect, that he was satisfied with any arrangement that was considered advisable by this Branch. Father Plourde was also advised by telephone that this Branch would raise no objection to the structural revision suggested and that following written confirmation from you, he could advise Bishop Routhier of our approval.\n\nAccordingly, there is attached for your signature a letter to Father Plourde confirming our attitude toward the matter.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFor Chief, Engineering and Construction Division.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Verret has been referred to the Department for approval.\n\nThe payroll extracts submitted herewith have not been compiled correctly although the hours worked, rate of pay, gross earnings and board deductions correspond to the Corporation's records.\n\nVacation Pay, Unemployment Insurance and Workmen's Compensation charges have been calculated on the net earnings resulting in the following payroll undercharges:\n\n| Item          | Amount charged | Correct charge | Undercharge |\n|---------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|\n| Wages         | $1,766.30      | $2,179.30      | $412.99     |\n| Vacation Pay  | $24.13         | $31.99         | $7.86       |\n| U.I.

Collins, R. Collins and G. Giroux, all of which are to be taken into account on a future claim.\nThe hours of work have exceeded the minimum hour regulations of the Province in most instances and it is possible that the Corporation may be required to pay overtime on any excess over 48 hours per week. This matter will be investigated.\n\nBoard deductions and value of free board applicable to employees on the project have been credited to board expenses on the summary of invoices for materials.\n\nMaterials\n\nAdjustments have been made in the present claim for items that should not have been charged on Claim No. 1 Invoice #58 amounting to $12.45 and on Invoice #68 amounting to $17.35. An undercharge of $4,000 on Claim No. 1, Invoices #58 and #60 has also been adjusted.\n\nThe following discrepancies have been noted on invoices included in the present claim.\n\n| Shows | Should be | Underpaid |\n|-------|-----------|-----------|\n| Inv. #17 - A.

Esch & Co. | $24.15 | $24.35 | $.20 |\n| Charged |\n| Inv. #33 - Henry Thompson | $4374.42 | $5374.42 | $1000.00 |\n| Overcharge |\n| Inv. #39 - Imperial Oil | $364.35 | $358.95 | $.50 |\n| Inv. #46 - McLennan Lumber | $965.20 | $963.68 | $.52 |\n\nInv. #40 covers bank charges amounting to $55.25 which the Corporation has claimed in order to finance the large amount of expenditures which were required to obtain the materials necessary and effect delivery of same before the spring thaw. As the Corporation receives no fee whatever, it has submitted these bank charges which would appear to be justified under the circumstances.\n\nInsurance\n\nThe Corporation has obtained adequate Insurance coverage and produced the Policies for examination. It was noted, however, that the Policies had not been made payable jointly to the Corporation and the Crown. The matter was immediately attended to and a copy of the Policies will be filed with the Indian Affairs Branch in due course.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe Corporation has continued to give all the information and assistance that it was able to provide in the maintenance of records and filing of claims. As the school is to be erected at some 300 miles away from the Corporation's Headquarters and no regular mail service exists, it is most difficult to obtain any data on the work in progress.\nFor this reason the Corporation has been unable to provide a breakdown of the expenditures incurred to date. Other than temporary buildings and shelters, little work and material have actually gone into the construction of the school.\n\nSubject to the foregoing remarks and adjustments, Progress Claim No. 2 has been certified.\n\nJ.

The blue prints are for the construction of the Boiler Room and Mechanical layout, and the construction notes cover the main building as well.\n\nWe have not prepared electrical layouts or specifications, in view of the reportedly highly qualified supervising engineer engaged by the Church authorities, whom we believe will be able to discuss requirements with Bishop Routhier, and obtain the equipment demanded by the load. For the electrical equipment the space allocated is considered to be sufficient. The location of generators, hot air exhaust louvres, windows and double doors, to be located with consideration to the orientation of the building in respect to the prevailing winds. Oil storage may be small tank and drum or large capacity tank. The total requirements for storage of oil will depend whether A.C. or D.C. units are installed. Ventilation may be manual or automatically controlled by motorized louvres.\n\nIt is anticipated that you will wish to retain at least one copy for your records, and perhaps provide Rev. Father Plourde with another, the balance being for the use of Bishop Routhier, and Father Benglet for construction purposes.\n\nChas. H.

Harkness, Esq., M.P.\n722 Riverdale Avenue,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Harkness:\n\nI have had enquiries made concerning the points mentioned in your letter of August 5th concerning the two schools at Upper Hay River and Hay Lakes.\n\nWe are proceeding with the erection of a log day school at Upper Hay River and the Indian Superintendent is now in the process of having logs prepared for the erection of the building. We are awaiting a requisition from him for the window sash, roofing material and other building requirements.\n\nWith regard to the residential school being erected at Hay Lakes, Alberta, I wish to assure you that a decision was reached to erect this school only after an educational survey of this district was made. As a result of this survey, made by a Provincial School Inspector, it was decided to follow his recommendations to erect a day school at Upper Hay River and a residential school at Hay Lakes.\n\nYou have also mentioned a complaint about children with T.B. being admitted to the residential school at Fort Vermilion. I would be glad to have specific details as our application forms require that children being admitted to residential schools must be medically examined before entering, as grant earning pupils.\nI hope that the above information clarifies the situation in particular about Upper Hay River and Hay Lakes.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\n\nHay Lakes Residential School.\n\nPlease find hereunder self-explanatory correspondence from Father Beuglet.\n\nIn view of the information contained in his letter, I would recommend that we proceed with the authorization for the installation of these radios.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nLa Corporation Episcopale C. R. de Grouard\n\nMcLennan, Alberta\nCanada\n\nAug.15th 1949\n\nMr. B.F. Neary,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian affairs' branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nWith further reference to our application for approval of purchase and installation of a two-way radio between Hay Lakes School and McLennan, I wish to reiterate that this installation is an absolute necessity. There is neither mail nor telegraph service at Hay Lakes, which is located some eighty miles off the highway between Grimshaw and Upper Hay Post, as shown on attached map; moreover, the trail between Hay Lakes and Upper Hay Post is impassable during the Summer months.\n\nLately one of our Lay Brothers who is foreman at Hay Lakes was seriously injured and it was only after eight days of great suffering that news of the accident reached McLennan; a plane was chartered to pick up the patient and bring him to the hospital at McLennan; at present it is hard to say if this most capable brother will ever be able to return to work at Hay Lakes. A good percentage of the hired men at Hay Lakes are married and their wives are most eager to get in touch with their husbands for various reasons. Imagine a man being away from home for many months and his wife being unable to get in touch with her husband. A woman has just stepped into my office, asking me how she could get in touch with her husband working at Hay Lakes; she explained to me that she must undergo an operation, but the doctor would not perform this operation before she obtains the consent of her husband. The only truck which is being used on the job at Hay Lakes broke down lately; trucking was suspended for two weeks; had there existed a means of communication between Hay Lakes and McLennan, the necessary repairs could have been forwarded immediately. The lady who did the cooking at Hay Lakes was forced to return home on account of ill health and news of her departure reached us only after eight days had elapsed; a hired man was taken from the building project to do the cooking, until such times as another lady cook could be found. Had there been a means of communication in existence between the two points, this situation could have been remedied immediately.\n\nThe above mentioned incidents amply justify the installation of these two-way radios; these are available at Edmonton and can be installed without delay. It is hoped that you now see your way clear to have this special purchase approved by the Department and thus avoid further delays in the construction of the school at Hay Lakes. An early reply will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. L. Beuglet, O.M.I.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\n722 Riverdale Avenue,\nCalgary, Alberta.\nAugust 5th 1949.\n\nMajor McKay,\nDirector of Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Major McKay:\n\nI have received some complaints in connection with an Indian residential school which is being built at Hay Lake. My information is that the Indians in the Fort Vermilion Superintendency, who would be served by this school, would much prefer to have two day schools built - one at the Post at the Upper Hay River Settlement, where I am told there are about 200 Indians, and the other at the Settlement at Hay Lake. I am told that these schools could be built at these points out of local logs at a cost of $7,000.00 to $8,000.00 per room as has been done at other points in Alberta.\n\nI understand that the projected residential school is to be at the Mission at Gun River, some eight miles from the present Indian Settlement and that far from the Highway, which makes it very inaccessible. I am also told that there are 136 children of school age and that the residential school as projected will only accommodate 80.\n\nWould you be good enough to give me any other information you have in connection with the school situation of the Fort Vermilion Superintendency and the reasons why a residential school is being put up there in place of day schools, and particularly why it is being placed in such an apparently awkward spot.\n\nOne other complaint I have had is that children with T.B. are being admitted to the residential school at Fort Vermilion and thereby the disease is being spread.\n\nIndian Affairs.

S. Battle,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nPost Office Bldg.,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn your recent trip to McLennan, you interviewed Father Beuglet regarding a Day School at Upper Hay River and the amount and site of land that should be given to the Residential School at Hay Lakes.\n\nAs soon as your request for information was passed on to me by Father Beuglet, I contacted Father Arbet who is the missionary in charge of the Indians at Hay Lakes and Upper Hay River. Father Arbet writes that the Indians at Upper Hay River desire a Residential School like that at Hay Lakes, as they are still obliged to go trapping in the woods and would probably be forced to bring their wives and children along.\n\nI personally have never taken a stand on this question and so long as the Catholic Education of these children is provided, I shall take none. I have understood that decision had been taken for a Day School at Upper Hay River and as a Residential School had been granted to Hay Lakes, I did not see the need of a Residential School at Hay River. There are undoubtedly distinct advantages in both forms of schools and inasmuch as I was concerned, I thought a Residential School at Hay Lakes would suffice for both groups of Indians. However, as the Indian Department seemed decided on giving Upper Hay River a Day School, I did not in any way contradict this decision. As the Indian Department is convinced that the children will attend regularly the Day School and a good Catholic Teacher is assured, I shall be satisfied. I hesitate somewhat in believing that there will be a regular attendance, the experience of the day school at Whitefish Lake does not make it any more reassuring for Upper Hay River. At Whitefish Lake, the Indians are forced to go down into the bush to trap from time to time and take their families along. It may well happen that gradually the Indian population will understand that it is to its advantage in seeing that the children obtain a proper education and make the necessary sacrifices. Let us hope so.\n\nRe: Land for Indian School at Hay Lakes\n\nI am including a rough sketch of the land that Father Arbet would like to have attached to the Residential School. Three sections of land would be required near the extreme south east corner of the Reserve just outside of the Reserve. Or this land, approximately 1/3 of which Father Arbet tells me that Mr. Schmidt, former Superintendent of Reserves, had advised him to obtain two sections, but Mr. Brown, the surveyor of the land, told him it would be better to obtain three sections, although only two sections could be properly used. I am sorry that I have not got the legal description of these three sections of land. This might be obtained through Mr. Knapp, the agent at Fort Vermilion.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenri Routhier, O.M.I.,\nCoadjutor Bishop of Grouard\n\nCOPY\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: School Requirements, Slave Lake Band,\nUpper Hay River Post,\nFt.

In this connection, I refer to our letter written to the Superintendent of Reserves and Trusts on July 27, file 147-4-2, concerning which Mr. Brown no doubt has brought to your attention. As stated in that letter, it is agreed that the school should have the use of this land, but unfortunately this office is not in a position to describe it.\n\nC. H.

Charlton,\nRegional Administrator,\nPrairie Region,\n709 McCallum Hill Bldg.,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nFrom: J.L. Villeneuve - Treasury Auditor - Edmonton, Alta.\n\nRe: Construction of Indian Residential School -\nHay Lakes, Alberta.\nLa Corporation Episcopale Catholique\nRomaine de Grouard - Contractors\n\nProgress Claim No. 3 - $11,308.77\n\nThe audit of Progress Claim No. 3 has been completed at the Corporation's office at McLennan, Alberta, and the report thereon follows:\n\nPayroll and Payroll Charges\n\nThe salary contract with Superintendent Verret has been approved by the Department and charges included in the present claim are in accordance therewith.\n\nVacation Pay\n\nThe Corporation has obtained permission in writing from the Board of Industrial Relations to pay Vacation Pay by cash at termination of employment rather than by stamps. The charges incurred have been set up as allowed charges and will be allowed on the claim upon liquidation by the Contractor.\n\nUnemployment Insurance\n\nUpon personal inquiries made at the local office of the Commission, along with Father Beuglet, the Corporation being a charitable organization and deriving no profit from the contract, is not required to insure employees under this Act. Accordingly all charges previously claimed have been cancelled and adjusted.\n\nPublic Liability and Property Damage Insurance\n\nThe Corporation has secured an owner's protective liability policy with the Globe Indemnity Co. of Canada (Policy No. 47441) with $5,000 and $10,000 coverage effective April 6, 1949, at the rate of .042% of the employees payrolls.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6381, file 770-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nThe Board of Industrial Relations has also allowed a request made by the Corporation to exceed the maximum hours of labour without compelling the Corporation to pay overtime rates.\n\nWorkmen's Compensation\n\nAn undercharge of $16.03 noted in Claim No. 2 has been adjusted so that all charges submitted to date are based on from earnings including board and Vacation Pay.\n\nThe apparent discrepancies reported in Claim No. 2 re payroll April 11 - 16, in connection with Ned Collins, R. Collins, and G. Giroux were the result of errors in transcription and no overpayment has taken place.\n\nBoard\n\nWhere employees have been engaged with free board provided the value of board has been set at $1.00 per day in order to comply with requirements of the Workmen's Compensation Board and Income Tax Act.\n\nWhere employees were engaged at rates excluding board, the understanding with the employees concerned was that deductions for board were to be made at $2.00 per day.\n\nIncome Tax\n\nThe Corporation has not made deductions for Income Tax from any of the employees as, with the exception of Superintendent Verret who is engaged on a contract basis, all are employed as casual help. However, at the end of the year, the Contractor will be required to make returns to the District Income Tax office on the earnings of all employees.\n\nMaterials - Re Claim No. 2\n\nInv. 17 - A.H. Esch & Co. - The amount of $24.15 as paid was correct as the apparent error in addition was due to an error in transcription only.\n\nInv. 33 - Henry Thompson - The underpayment of $1,000.00 reported was taken into account and paid with Claim No. 2 by the Department.\n\nInv. 39 - Imperial Oil - overcharge of $5.40 adjusted in Claim 3 on Inv. 41.\n\nInv. 46 - McLennan Lumber - overcharge of $1.52 adjusted in Claim 3 on Invoice 41.\nInv. 40 - Canadian Bank of Commerce charges for $55.25 were not allowed and have been adjusted in Claim No. 3 on Invoice #40.\n\nTravelling expenses submitted by Father Beuglet in this claim have been found in order and in accordance with the approval received from the Department.\n\nInsurance on Buildings\n\nThe Corporation holds the following Policies against damage or loss by fire.\n\nGlobe Indemnity Co. of Canada #59128 effect April 6, 1949 $20,000.\n\nMotor Union Insurance Co., Ltd. #690757 \" \" 6, 1949 $20,000.\n\nAmerican Alliance Insurance Co. #437866 \" \" 6, 1949 $10,000.\n\nUnion Insurance Society of Canton #449251 \" \" 6, 1949 $10,000.\n\nThese Policies have been registered in joint names of La Corporation Episcopale C.R. de Grouard and the Department of Mines and Resources. Copies have been mailed to the Department at Ottawa.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe Corporation after suspending work at the end of April due to the Spring thaw, again resumed operations in the early part of July and continued since that date.\n\nThe payrolls submitted are not up to date as it is still most difficult to transfer the records from the site of the project.\n\nAccording to the reports received the work has proceeded well in the past two months. In spite of numerous difficulties encountered, the Corporation appears prepared and capable to carry the job to completion. From the information gathered, however, it is apparent that in order to complete the building in accordance with the specifications and requirements of the Department, the estimated cost of $175,000, as set out in Order in Council No. 97/688, will be considerably exceeded.\n\nSubject to the foregoing remarks, Progress Claim No. 3 has been certified.\n\nJ.M.

Villeneuve - Treasury Auditor - Edmonton, Alta.\n\nRe: Construction of Indian Residential School -\nHay Lakes, Alberta.\nLa Corporation Episcopale Catholique\nRomaine de Grouard - Contractors\n\nProgress Claim No. 5 - $11,302.77\n\nThe audit of Progress Claim No. 5 has been completed at the Corporation's office at McLennan, Alberta, and the report thereon follows:\n\nPayroll and Payroll Charges\n\nThe salary contract with Superintendent Verret has been approved by the Department and charges included in the present claim are in accordance therewith.\n\nVacation Pay\n\nThe Corporation has obtained permission in writing from the Board of Industrial Relations to pay Vacation Pay by cash at termination of employment rather than by stamps. The charges incurred have been set up as accrued charges and will be allowed on the claim upon liquidation by the Contractor.\n\nUnemployment Insurance\n\nUpon personal inquiries made at the local office of the Commission, along with Father Beuglet, the Corporation being a charitable organization and deriving no profit from the contract, is not required to insure employees under this Act. Accordingly all charges previously claimed have been cancelled and adjusted.\n\nPublic Liability and Property Damage Insurance\n\nThe Corporation has secured an owner's protective liability policy with the Globe Indemnity Co. of Canada (Policy No. 47441) with $5,000 and $10,000 coverage effective April 6, 1949, at the rate of .042% of the employees payrolls.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6381, file 770-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nThe Board of Industrial Relations has also allowed a request made by the Corporation to exceed the maximum hours of labour without compelling the Corporation to pay overtime rates.\n\nWorkmen's Compensation\n\nAn undercharge of $16.03 noted in Claim No. 2 has been adjusted so that all charges submitted to date are based on earnings including board and Vacation Pay.\n\nThe apparent discrepancies reported in Claim No. 2 re payroll April 11 - 15, in connection with Ned Collins, R. Collins, and G. Giroux were the result of errors in transcription and no overpayment has taken place.\n\nBoard\n\nWhere employees have been engaged with free board provided the value of board has been set at $1.00 per day in order to comply with requirements of the Workmen's Compensation Board and Income Tax Act.\n\nWhere employees were engaged at rates excluding board, the understanding with the employees concerned was that deductions for board were to be made at $2.00 per day.\n\nIncome Tax\n\nThe Corporation has not made deductions for Income Tax from any of the employees as, with the exception of Superintendent Verret who is engaged on a contract basis, all are employed as casual help. However, at the end of the year, the Contractor will be required to make returns to the District Income Tax office on the earnings of all employees.\n\nMaterials - Re Claim No. 2\n\nInv. 17 - A.H. Esch & Co. - The amount of $24.15 as paid was correct as the apparent error in addition was due to an error in transcription only.\n\nInv. 33 - Henry Thompson - The underpayment of $1,000.00 reported was taken into account and paid with Claim No. 2 by the Department.\n\nInv. 39 - Imperial Oil - overcharge of $5.40 adjusted in Claim 3 on Inv. 41.\n\nInv. 46 - McLennan Lumber - overcharge of $1.52 adjusted in Claim 3 on Invoice 41.\nInv. 40 - Canadian Bank of Commerce charges for $55.25 were not allowed and have been adjusted in Claim No. 3 on Invoice #40.\n\nTravelling expenses submitted by Father Beuglet in this claim have been found in order and in accordance with the approval received from the Department.\n\nInsurance on Buildings\n\nThe Corporation holds the following Policies against damage or loss by fire.\n\nGlobe Indemnity Co. of Canada\n#69128 effect April 6, 1949 $20,000.\n\nMotor Union Insurance Co. Ltd.\n#690757 \" \" 6, 1949 $20,000.\n\nAmerican Alliance Insurance Co.\n#437866 \" \" 6, 1949 $10,000.\n\nUnion Insurance Society of Canton\n#449251 \" \" 6, 1949 $10,000.\n\nThese Policies have been registered in joint names of La Corporation Episcopale G.R. de Grouard and the Department of Mines and Resources. Copies have been mailed to the Department at Ottawa.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe Corporation after suspending work at the end of April due to the Spring thaw, again resumed operations in the early part of July and continued since that date.\n\nThe payrolls submitted are not up to date as it is still most difficult to transfer the records from the site of the project.\n\nAccording to the reports received the work has proceeded well in the past two months. In spite of numerous difficulties encountered, the Corporation appears prepared and capable to carry the job to completion. From the information gathered, however, it is apparent that in order to complete the building in accordance with the specifications and requirements of the Department, the estimated cost of $175,000, as set out in Order in Council No. 97/888, will be considerably exceeded.\n\nSubject to the foregoing remarks, Progress Claim No. 3 has been certified.\n\nJ.J.

Goderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n507 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nHay Lakes Indian Residential School.\n\nWe have received a copy of Mr. Indian Superintendent Walker's letter of April 19 concerning medical services at Hay Lakes. We have also noted Mr. Walker's comments with regard to the construction of an Indian Residential School at that point.\n\nAs you are aware, the services of the Provincial School Inspector were employed to make an educational survey of this area. In his report he recommended the establishment of a residential school at Hay Lakes and in having the school erected, it is felt we are following his advice. His report reads in part as follows:\n\n\"With these four classrooms and other necessary teaching rooms this area should be serviced with boarding facilities for the pupils as it does not appear possible to operate a day school, or a number of day schools in the area. The dormitory space required will be the usual for this number of children. Included in the dormitory should be rooms where the children may work or play if it is not sufficiently close to the school. The usual plumbing fixtures should be installed as well as facilities for giving a steam bath.\"\n\nWould you please draw the above to the attention of Mr. Walker. I would also suggest that you discuss his comments with Dr. Stone as it is felt that we are following professional advice in having a residential school erected at Hay Lakes.\n\nBernard F.
