Time and time again both the engineer and myself tested the Bell Line, sometimes it would work, sometimes it would not. On one occasion the bells responded in the morning, in the afternoon they were entirely out of order. For three or four consecutive days the bells would answer, then would come an interval of one or two days when no response could be obtained.\n\nThe fuses were tested time and again, and it was then considered that owing to the dampness between the brick courses, a short circuit had occurred, hence the difficulty of locating the particular trouble.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) S. Middleton\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of April 3rd, (No. not visible) relative to the Bell Electric School, I hold reserves, Jordan, Ont., in which we have our facilities, to meet the expenses amounting to $150.00 incurred by Mr. Brotherston, of the Electric Bell Co., of Ontario, when he visited the school to explain the Electric Bell system which he had installed there. I am now herewith enclosing a copy of his bill from the Electric Bell Co., and it quite clear, I think, that the trouble with the Electric Bell system was due to something more than to \"a burnt-out fuse,\" as Mr. Brotherston seems to have stated.\n\nOur society has discussed this bill, but in view of the explanation given by Mr. Brotherston, and in view of the fact that our society cannot be a fully competent body for this position, I am of the opinion that the amount paid, namely $150.00 should be refunded, and I shall be glad to if you will furnish me with a cheque for said amount.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Dr. Westgate, D.D.,\n41 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nWith further reference to the question of additional outbuildings to be erected by the Department during this summer. The Indian Agent informed me today that he has received instructions from the Indian Commissioner to proceed with the erection of three buildings for St. Paul's\u2014Piggery, Henery and Implement Shed, but no Farm Instructor's House is to be built this year, at least, so Mr. Faunt said.\n\nIn the Department letter of April 6th it states that a sum of $2500.00 has been voted for outbuildings at St. Paul's. These will cost approximately $1200.00, what will be done with the balance of the grant? The Indian Commissioner wrote you on April 28th saying: \"I may assure you however that a cottage for the farmer will be built at the Blood School this summer, as well as a henhouse, piggery, implement shed and garage.\"\n\nI am simply reporting these matters so that you may be fully cognizant of what is being done. If the Farm Instructor's House is not to be built this summer, I would strongly recommend that an outside Dairy and a Utility Building be erected with the balance of the grant. In order to have more money to spend on the actual buildings I am doing all the hauling etc., with the school teams and labour.\n\nFurthermore\u2014Mr. Scott replied to your letter last December stating that the Toilets could be installed in the upper dormitories when needed. Pupils are sleeping in the upper dormitories and there is no provision for toilet accommodation, other than the mere \"roughing in\" as the pipes were left by the contractors last winter. Would it be possible to bring this matter to the attention of the Department as soon as possible?\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) S. Middleton\nPrincipal.\nAugust 15, 1925.\n\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith copy of a letter recently received from the Rev. Canon Middleton, Principal of St. Paul's Indian Residential School at Cardston Alta, which explains itself. The Commission will be grateful for any information you can afford them in connection with the matter referred to therein.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nASS'Y.

Principal of the St. Paul's Indian Residential School. In reply I have to inform you that Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham has been authorized to expend $2500 in the erection of a hen house, a piggery, an implement shed and a garage. The advisability of providing a farmer's cottage has been noted for future Estimates. I am writing to Mr. Graham today, informing him that Rev. Canon Middleton is assisting with school teams and labour so that, in addition to the buildings enumerated, a dairy and a utility building can be erected. I am asking the Commissioner for a statement and recommendation in this connection.\n\nRelative to toilet fixtures in the upper dormitories, it would be advisable for the Rev. Principal to make requisition to the local Indian agent, who will submit his recommendation to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev.

Principal of the St. Paul's Indian Residential School has informed the Department that he is cooperating with you in the erection of the four outbuildings, which you were authorized to provide by the Deputy Superintendent General's letter of May 2nd. He is very hopeful that not all of the sum of $2500 will be expended for these four buildings and urges the erection of a dairy and a utility building.

This is the first intimation I have had that he is co-operating with me in the erection of these buildings. I have had no communication with him on the matter, further than to say that I was going to put up a henhouse, pigsty, and implement shed.\n\nI have not the plans of the St. Paul School before me, but am I right in saying that they did provide for a dairy? I am not prepared at the present time to recommend a dairy out of the amount set aside for outbuildings.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nAsst.

I note that you are not prepared at the present time to recommend a dairy. It is true that there is a dairy room in the main building, but the Reverend Principal may have in mind a separating room at the barn. You might let me have a statement concerning the estimated cost of the four outbuildings you are authorized to provide, and, at a later date, make a recommendation concerning the request for a dairy and a utility building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from our Agent on the Blood Reserve in which he deals with various matters in connection with the St. Paul School. He says regarding the roof water which discharges from the down-spouts on to the ground and alongside of the building that he thinks some temporary arrangement by way of plank surface drains should be made to carry this water away from the building as at present it is soaking down under the foundation, which, of course, will eventually cause settlement of the building and cracking of the walls. The Agent has made a suggestion as to how this water may be diverted at a cost of about $75.00 and in order to save unnecessary delay I have ordered him to proceed with the work along the lines suggested by him.\n\nThe Agent points out that the windows in the attic of the school are only tacked in temporarily, allowing the rain and snow to blow right through, and that there are several places where you can see right through the roof. I have instructed him to have these matters attended to at once. He tells me that during the recent rains there has been considerable leakage from the tower, the water leaking down to the ground floor where it was caught in tubs. He expresses the opinion that in a windy country this tower was a mistake. There is no doubt about this. There has also been considerable damage done through defective eave-troughing but this matter will be dealt with in a separate letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 3)\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that there are no sidewalks around the St. Paul School on the Blood Reserve and when it rains it is a mass of soft mud around the building.\n\nI have taken this matter up with the Agent and he informs me that the school authorities would be willing to haul the material and do all the work in connection with the construction of the walks if the Department will supply the cement, which I understand will cost about $200.00. I would recommend this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Sept. 16, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to the church which your Society purposes to erect on the Blood Reserve, near the St. Paul's Indian Residential School. With regard to your request that the Department extend the water and lighting systems of the main school building to the basement of the church, I have to inform you that favourable consideration will be given to tapping the water supply, if you will estimate the cost and make arrangements to have the work satisfactorily completed. I regret that the Department cannot allow you to connect up with the lighting system of the school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, September 16, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 402-11 A of the 9th instant, with reference to the advisability of constructing walks around the main building of the St. Paul's Indian Residential School. I note that the school management will be responsible for the labour and for the gravel if the Department will provide approximately $200 worth of cement. You are authorized to purchase the cement, after securing competitive prices, and make the necessary arrangements with the local management.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th inst., in which you asked me to make a report regarding the leakage from eave-troughs of above school, giving also an estimate of cost to correct the trouble.\n\nThe Reverend Principal (Canon Middleton) conducted me through the building, and I was able to see that in a number of the rooms a considerable quantity of water had penetrated through the walls, and had caused some disfigurement of the plaster. In one room a small area of plaster had become loosened by the water.\n\nThe main cause of the admission of water is from the eave-troughs. There has been some leakage from this source ever since the building was completed, but during the latter part of the winter the continued filling of the gutters with ice, and the consequent expansion and contraction caused by the changes of weather has had the effect of bursting many of the soldered places where leak joints in the metal covering occur, which damage was inevitably followed by leakage.\n\nGuttering partly over the brickwork the water thus leaking through the joints in the metal penetrated through the tile and reached the interior plastered surfaces. This condition is inevitable, and will continue, and become worse, until the cause of the trouble is overcome.\n\nThe design of the gutter is good and is very suitable for a school building. The framing of it is strong, and it is possible for any person not affected by height and ground to walk with safety along the gutter and remove obstructions, or open the outlets to downspouts, without danger. The reason for the gutter proving leaky is in consequence of the galvanized iron lining contracting and expanding, and bursting the joints. This metal acts as a dam from the gutter 30\" up the roof, with 24\" of it exposed before meeting the shingles. In other words the unglazed end 24\" from the gutter, and there is this metal surface 24\" wide all around the roof. In both the metal lining of gutter, and in the metal on the roof itself, there has been bursting of soldered joints. Also, at the lower edge of the roof there is a horizontal leak joint, which also has been coming open in places.\n\nI do not consider it possible to avoid leakage where galvanized iron is used even in the manner described. It has been tried elsewhere, with similar results, and I am told that in some of the Calgary schools exactly the same trouble was experienced with galvanized iron lining in the gutters, but that the trouble was finally overcome by changing the sheet lead lining. I think it would prove a waste of money to try to stop the leakage at St. Paul's school by tinkering with the existing galvanized iron. In this Chinook district, with sudden and extreme changes of weather, roof gutters are subject to unusual strains, and types of gutters that may have proved satisfactory in more equable climates, do not stand the test here.\nTo remedy the trouble I would recommend that the following be done:\n\nLine the gutters with sheet lead, 1/16\" in thickness, weighing 4 lbs. per sq. ft., and extend the metal 8\" up on the roof boarding and shingle down to the edge of the gutter. In this manner the joint could be made leak-proof. The lead is somewhat elastic in its nature and is capable of adjusting itself to weather changes without bursting joints. In fact the solder becomes fused with the lead, and there is practically no joint to open. The only objection to this method is its cost. There are 520 lin. ft. of gutter to this building, and it would take a strip of lead 42\" wide to line the gutter with sufficient overlap, which figures at 1820 sq. ft. of lead, weighing 7360 lbs. at 4 lbs. per sq. ft.\n\n**DETAIL OF COST OF LEAD LINING & SHINGLING**\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 11 M Shingles @ $7.00 per M               | 77.00  |\n| 10 lbs.

Flatt, Cardston | 1750.00 |\n| **Total**                                 | **1901.50** |\n\nBefore regarding the above estimate as a minimum, I would get outside quotations on the lead lining and labour of placing it.\n\nAnother method of avoiding admission of water to the building from the eave troughs would be to take down the present eave trough, continue the rafters about 1 ft. beyond exterior outside wall line, build out look-outs from the ceiling joists to make a framework with the extended rafters, with soffit and fascia, and attach an oval gal. iron eave-trough to fascia. This method would require roof sheeting on the extended rafters, and shingle along edge of gutter, but would not be so satisfactory as the first, although it would cause some dismemberment to the building occasioned by scaffolding cut from the windows, and its appearance would not be so good. The gal. iron gutters would not be so lasting, and would be difficult to reach for cleaning-out or repairs. However, should they prove leaky, the water would drop beyond the wall-line, and could not reach the interior of the building in the manner at present occurring. The cost of this method would be about as follows:\n\n**DETAIL OF COST OF EXTENDING ROOF & NEW GUTTER.**\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Roof sheeting and Rafter Extensions       | 40.00  |\n| 14 M Shingles @ $7.00 per M              | 98.00  |\n| Shingle Nails, 60 lbs. @ 9\u00a2 per lb.      | 5.40   |\n| Labour Shingling                          | 45.00  |\n| Shingle Stain, labour & material          | 40.00  |\n| Removing old eave framing & making good; |        |\n| 520' @ $1.75 per lin.ft.                 | 910.00 |\n| Oval Gal.

There will be no alteration in the design of the gutter nor change in the appearance of the building, besides which there need be no more fear of leakage of water into the building from the suave-troughs. A good reliable sheet-metal man would give several years' guarantee from leaks. It would be unfair to consider the cost of the lead lining in the light of an upkeep expense, for if this lining had been specified in the first place, the contractors' figure would have been proportionately higher. The building will have an added value if this work is done.\n\nI might mention that Mr. D.D. Smith, of Smith Bros. & Wilson, Ltd., was here yesterday, and, at my request he accompanied me to St. Paul's School, and I conferred with him as to the best and cheapest manner of permanently correcting the suave-trough trouble, and the proposals I have made represent our joint opinion, made after a careful examination of the existing conditions.\n\nI would like to emphasize the importance of early attention being given to the matter. Every rain we get is causing further damage to the building, and, as stated before, the trouble will get worse until corrected. It is doubly important that the necessary work be done before the snow and ice of the coming winter aggravate an already serious condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\nSir:\n\nFurther to my letter of the 9th instant dealing with various matters in connection with the St. Paul's School on the Blood Reserve I now attach hereto a copy of a letter that I have received from Mr. E.

Sept.25,1925\n\nW.M.Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRe:- St. Paul's School, Blood Reserve\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRegarding the leaky eavetroughs at St. Paul's School which is causing serious damage to the interior walls of the building. I made a report on the subject to Mr. Faunt Indian Agent, under date of August 28th last, in which I reviewed the cause of the trouble, and outlined two methods under which the trouble might be overcome, with approximate costs.\n\nI saw Mr. Faunt this morning, and as he was then just starting out by car to attend to other matters in connection with his duties, it was suggested that I write you a few lines calling attention to the advancing season, and the urgency of action being taken before the snow and ice of the coming winter aggravate an already serious condition.\n\nYou will understand, of course, that work of the kind that will be necessary, especially on such an extensive roof, can scarcely be done efficiently during inclement weather, and further damage to the building must inevitably result until means are taken to prevent roof-water from reaching the interior of the building.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) E.Gardner Smith\nInspector of Construction.\nSir:-\n\nOn the 14th of September I wrote to you, enclosing a report that I received from Mr. E. Gardner Smith with reference to the eave-troughing on the new St. Paul's School on the Blood Reserve. As it is now the 2nd of October and I have had no reply to this letter in regard to a most important matter I thought it well to again draw your attention to it.\n\nI enclose herewith a letter which I have received from Mr. Smith in this connection. It seems to me that the matter should receive the immediate attention of the Department, as serious damage to the building may result from this leakage, and cold weather will soon be here, making work of this kind very difficult.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to ask that I be furnished with an accountable cheque for $900.00, to pay wages in connection with the erection of the outbuildings at St. Paul's Indian Residential School on the Blood Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nEXTRACT FROM COMMISSIONER GRAHAM'S LETTER,\nNo. 402-9, dated October 23, 1925, reporting\non Inspector Christianson's visit to Blood Agency.\n\nThe first portion of the report deals with schools\nand outbuildings. You will note that the outbuildings at the\nSt. Paul Industrial School are well under way and will be\ncompleted in good time, and within the amount of money author-\nized by the Department. I would refer you to that part of the\nreport which deals with the matter of a dairy building which\nis asked for by Mr. Middleton. It is regrettable that the\nDepartment is called upon to put up an additional dairy build-\ning, when space for this was provided in the school, which,\nhowever, is claimed to be unsatisfactory. I venture to say\nthat the money which was spent on this dairy space in the\nschool would have provided for a most satisfactory building,\nbut, as it is, we are called upon by the principal to erect a\nnew building.\n\nWhy should the Department be called upon to build\na Farming Instructor's house at the St. Paul School? Could\nwe not insist on the church employing single men as Farming\nInstructors? If we build an Instructor's house at this\nschool, we are going to be asked to do the same at all schools.\nThere is no reason why a single man should not fill the position\nof Farming Instructor at the St. Paul School.\n\nST. PAUL'S SCHOOL\n\nEverything seemed to be fairly\nsatisfactory in connection with this institution.\nI am not in a position to say much about the outside\nwork, as on the two occasions I was at the school,\nthe ground was covered with snow, but as far as I\ncould see the farming had been carried on in a\nfairly satisfactory manner. With regard to the\n\ninterior\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 3)\ninterior of the building I may say that the school has been nicely furnished and everything was in first-class shape, and from my observation I would say that Mr. Middleton has a fairly efficient staff.\n\nOutbuildings:\n\nThe implement shed and garage had already been arranged for and the carpenters had it about completed at the time of my visit. The chicken house was also practically completed. I, however, arranged for the following buildings,\n\nRoot cellar\nPump house - (this is situated over the well that is between the two stables.)\nPig pen\nWork shop.\n\n$2500.00 was allowed for these outbuildings by the Department and I have seen to it that this amount will not be exceeded in the erection of the buildings above mentioned. The school is doing all the hauling of the material, and the excavating for the root cellar, but the work of erecting the buildings is being done by Mr. Butcher as foreman. This man has worked on the reserve off and on for a number of years, and I have always found his work very satisfactory. When the above mentioned buildings are completed, which will be in a very short time, they will fully meet the requirements of the school for the present time, and will be quite in keeping with the institution. The only other building mentioned by the Principal was a combination ice house and dairy building. This, of course, could not be considered this year, as it could not be built out of the appropriation.\n\nThe building\nThe building that Mr. Middleton has in mind for this purpose would cost in the neighbourhood of at least twelve or thirteen hundred dollars. I do not consider, however, that there is any great urgency for this building, as a dairy space was provided in the school, which, however, is not altogether satisfactory. If it is thought advisable to supply the school with the above mentioned building an amount should be placed in the Estimates this year to provide for same, so that the work can be gone on with next Spring. The matter of a Farming Instructor's house for next year was also brought to my attention, and I understand that the church authorities are asking to have an item placed in the Estimates to provide for this expenditure.\n\nSchool Attendance:\n\nThe matter of school attendance was brought to my attention, as there are only about one hundred children in the school at the present time, and they have accommodation in the institution for an additional twenty-five. Mr. Middleton stated that there were a number of children on the reserve who were not attending school. I went into this matter with the Agent and he states that he has seen all the Indians who have children of school age with a view of having them entered in the St. Paul's School, and they have refused to send their children there on the grounds that they intend to send them to the new R.C.School as soon as it opens, and as the parents have the option of sending their children to whatever school.\nwhatever school they choose, they evidently are within their rights, and from my point of view I cannot see that anything further can be done until the Roman Catholic School is opened. As soon as it is, I think the school regulations should be enforced to the limit in this Agency, as with two new schools on the reserve, which are up-to-date in every way, there will be no excuse for the Indians keeping their children at home, as according to the location of these schools it will be quite convenient for the parents to visit their children quite frequently, and I think it would be well for the Department to issue instructions to the Agent along the lines I have suggested.\n\nIndian Affairs.

H. Paget,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent.\n\nThe Harold A. Wilson Co. Ltd.,\n297 & 299 Yonge St.,\nToronto, Ont.\nCardston, Alta.,\nNov. 14th, 1925\n\nRev. Canon Middleton,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Paul's Residential School,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nDear Canon:\n\nI enclose herewith a tender from Messrs. Snyder & Co. of Calgary, for the alteration of the power transmission in the machinery room of your school. In accordance with the request made by your engineer, said tender being for \u00a3180.00.\n\nYour engineer informs me that the proposed change would effect a saving in his time of 35 hours per week, besides wear and tear of machinery, and would also result in a very appreciable saving of gasoline.\n\nAs at present arranged, the power plant is in use for running laundry machines during a large part of Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, during which time he is unable to pump. As the laundry machines do not nearly use the full power of the engine it means that the engineer is unable to use the surplus power for pumping at the same time that the laundry countershaft is running, but must pump afterwards. By making the proposed change the pumping and the operation of the laundry machines could be carried on simultaneously, or, through the medium of a clutch on the lineshaft, the pumping could be done separately, without running the laundry shafting.\n\nI discussed the matter fully with your engineer, and I have no hesitation in recommending the change, in the interests of economy. As Mr. Snyder installed the machinery he is familiar with the conditions existing, and could be depended on to carry out the change in a satisfactory manner. I consider the price he has quoted a reasonable one.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) E. Gardner Smith,\nInspector of Construction.\nSir:\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter addressed by Mr. E. Gardner Smith to the Rev. Canon Middleton, Principal of St. Paul's School on the Blood Reserve, with reference to a suggested change in the power transmission in the machinery room at that institution, and I shall be glad if the Department will advise me whether they will authorize this at the price of $180.00 quoted by Messrs. Snyder & Company of Calgary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 16th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 402-11A of the 10th instant, enclosing copy of a letter addressed by Mr. E. Gardiner Smith to the Rev. Principal of St. Paul's Indian Residential School on the Blood Reserve with reference to a suggested change in the power transmission in the machinery room.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that you may arrange with Messrs. Snyder & Co., who installed the machinery, to make the alterations in the lineshafting so that the pumping can be done separately without running the laundry shafting. We note that the price quoted for this work is $180. When submitting a voucher for payment, please attach a statement from Messrs. Snyder & Co. showing in detail the work performed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M.

M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDecember Twenty Ninth,\nNineteen Twenty Four.\n\nR. Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe St. Paul's Indian School, Cardston.\n\nWe have to report the completion of our contract at the above building, and the taking over of the works by the Inspector, Mr. E. Gardner Smith, as from December 20th.\n\nIn making up the final accounts, there were discussed a number of items of expense and cost allowances for which we expect to receive payment, but which Mr. Smith said he had no authority to handle although some of them are specifically mentioned in the contract and in the list of deductions made at the time the contract was revised. A statement was therefore prepared covering all work with which Mr. Smith had authority to deal, and we received his certificate covering the account rendered to him. Mr. Smith issued this certificate as the final one, but as it does not cover items allowed for in the contract, and others which have been the subject of correspondence, which Mr. Smith stated he had no authority to handle, we do not regard it as the final settlement.\n\nThe matters we have reference to are as follows:\n\n- Increased Sales Tax.\n- Increased bricklayers wages.\n- Allowance of $500.00 for Sundries, Revision of Main entrance and residence porches.\n- Brick piers built into tile walls, to carry steel.\n- Wood beams in residence and laundry in connection with revision of steel price.\n- Beam furring under metal ceilings.\n- Cost of Water Tower, owing to late date of construction.\n- Heating of building owing to general delay caused by tower construction.\n- Location of installation of fan in laundry.\n- Chimney built in Laundry.\nWe understand that Mr. Smith's reluctance to pass on these matters is solely due to his regarding them as being beyond his authority, although he is fully in agreement with us that they deserve your favourable consideration.\n\nThe first two listed arose as a result of the delay in proceeding with the work owing to questions of the site.\n\nThe allowance of $500.00 was made to cover Sundries, Revision of Main Entrance and Residence Porch. We were not able during the course of the work to make this saving. The Main Entrance was changed from stone to brick, around the arch, but a full credit was given for all the stone omitted and this was replaced by expensive pier and arch brickwork which was an addition to the amount of brickwork on the contract drawings for which we received no allowance, so that the small saving made on the residence porch was used up again in the cost of brickwork substituted for stone on the main entrance.\n\nOn the question of effecting a general saving, we used up anything which might have gone toward this $500.00 allowance by building an enlarged coal room, with reinforced concrete slab roof at grade level, at a cost to us of about $600.00. In connection with this fuel room, Mr. Smith knows from his observation of the work that we are sacrificing about $150.00 to put in the fuel room, so that there is no question of having made savings to offset the $500.00 allowed in deductions from the contract.\n\nWhile the work was in progress, Mr. Smith, undoubtedly with the interest of the building and good construction at heart, was so anxious to maintain the highest possible standard on a job already cheapened to the limit of safety, that it was impossible to find any other way to make any savings to apply on the amount deducted for sundries.\n\nThe brick piers built into tile walls, and wood posts and beams in residence and laundry in connection with credit on steel, have already been the subject of correspondence but have not been brought to a settlement.\n\nThere arose the question of beam furring which was not covered by the figures given you on the ceiling boards. This was put in where required, but Mr. Smith had no way of dealing with it.\n\nOwing to the order to proceed with erection of water tower being so long delayed, its construction had to be carried out mainly in bad weather, which added a great deal to its cost, so much so that both we and our subcontractors\nfor plumbing and heating, lost money on this piece of work, due solely to delays for which we were not responsible which ran the work into impossible weather conditions.\n\nAnother feature in connection with the tower construction was the fact that we were forced to hold up the general progress on contract work of the building in order to be able to hold some of our men for work on the tower when material for it arrived from the Coast. This so affected general progress that we were delayed at least six weeks on the general clean up of the work, and subject to the added overhead for that period, as well as the cost of heating the building when the cold weather made it necessary.\n\nMr. Smith will verify these statements about delay, and we are therefore preparing a statement on the tower construction on a time and material basis, as well as for our costs on heating, and ask your favourable consideration on this method of billing for the work.\n\nWe are preparing accounts on all the work mentioned in this letter, and these will be forwarded to you as soon as possible. In the meantime will you kindly have the enclosed certificate paid, and our tender deposit released to us, as soon as possible. In the matter of tender deposit, will you please hold sufficient of the Victory Bonds deposited in connection with this contract, to make a ten per cent deposit on account of the Kamloops contract, and return the balance to us together with the cash deposit which was made at the time our tender on Kamloops was submitted.\n\nWishing you the Compliments of the Season, and thanking you for your kind cooperation throughout the work, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nre St. Paul's Indian School, Cardston.\n\nWhen we wrote the Department on December 29th, 1924, we intimated that we had other items which we wished to have considered, but regret that a peculiar combination of circumstances have prevented us from bringing the details to your notice before this time.\n\nWe could not make up the statement at the time we wrote as the additional guys for the water tower, ordered by Mr. Smith, were not finished. Owing to severe weather conditions it was some considerable time later that the work was completed. Then early last year the new top was put on the septic tank, and this was followed by a long period of correspondence with Mr. Smith about gutters, and prices of work on them. We thought we would bring matters to a conclusion when all of the above were disposed of, and this is our earliest opportunity.\n\nReferring to our letter of December 29th, 1924, you will note that we mentioned increased sales tax. This consideration was promised to us at the time the contract was revised. Tax was then 4\u00bd\u00a2, and was raised to 6\u00bd\u00a2, but before we bought much material was lowered to 5\u00bd\u00a2, so the actual difference came down to 1\u00bd\u00a2. We therefore decided not to raise the question further.\n\nThe other items we refer to are in the same order as they appear in our letter, and on the enclosed account.\n\nNo. 3. Increased bricklayers' wages.\n\nThis matter was raised when the contract was revised and we were promised the increase would be paid if it went into effect. The prevailing wage when the work was figured in...\nOctober 1923 was $1.15 per hour. In June 1924, it was raised to $1.25, making a difference of 10\u00a2 per hour as charged.\n\nNo. 2. Item No. 13 on contract revisions.\nThis we found could not be saved, as any saving effected was used by Mr. Smith to offset cost of the enlarged cool room.\n\nNo. 3. Brick piers etc.\nThese were not called for in contract, but were ordered by Mr. Smith.\n\nNo. 4. Wood Posts etc.\nWe gave Mr. Orr credit for steel omitted in good faith, but failed to deduct from such credit cost of wood beams required to take their place, and further we were unable to secure from our subcontractors as large a credit as the one we made to the Department. We now ask that this item be allowed us.\n\nNo. 5. Beams for framing.\nOrdered by Mr. Smith, but not specified, same item was paid for at Edmonton.\n\nNo. 6. Costs due to delay.\nThis cost was all thrust upon us by continued delay in awarding contract for water supply system. Our quotations on the work were given in the expectation that it could be done concurrently with the contract work. Unfortunately the order came too late, and coupled with a series of severe storms during which the tower work could not be carried on, and then the freeze up, we were placed in a very awkward position. We had to lay off two thirds of our men on the school work in order to have the remainder available to build water tower and erect the tank when materials arrived. Costs as shown were involved and we trust that the Department will accept responsibility. The circumstances which caused the extra cost were unavoidable.\n\nNo. 7. Fan in Laundry.\nThis item was necessary and not specified.\n\nNo. 8. Building chimney in Laundry.\nOrdered by Mr. Smith who thought it was included in revision of contract. We have no record of this being done.\nNo. 9. Guys on water tower.\nOrdered by Mr. Smith as additional safeguard against very high wind peculiar to locality.\n\nNo. 10 & 11.\nThis work was done by a man we left at Cardston to attend to any items required, at the request of Mr. Smith or Canon Middleton. We think both these items are covered by conditions outside of our contract.\n\nNo. 12. Septic tank roof.\nTank as originally built was according to design, but new wooden top was found to be necessary.\n\nNo. 13. Visit to Ottawa.\nArranged for when contract was revised.\n\nIn addition to the above items we found many pieces of work on which we gave reduced prices when revising amount of contract, but on which we were unable to save the reduction given, particularly on face brick, reduction of wall thickness, and painting. As we gave definite figures on the revision, we are not going back on them. We trust however, your cooperation will be given in passing the items asked for.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYTON COMPANY LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPresident.\nWater tower\n\nSept. 5th\nGrand council says no water\n\nSept. 12th.

M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have been enquiring into the cost of providing telephone connection to the St. Paul's School on the Blood Reserve, and have ascertained that the cost will be $375.00. The holes for the poles have already been dug by the bigger boys at the school and they will also help in setting these poles out and putting on the brackets and insulators. The sum referred to will be expended in providing the labor of a practical man to string the wires and connect up with the Cardston office; altogether five and a half miles of double wiring. I shall be glad to receive authority to expend this amount in the manner indicated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

We do not mean that our plant is so complicated that it needs a qualified engineer to look after it but in this case he is a man that has never had any connections whatever or experience with gasoline engines and therefore not in a position to readily put right any small or minor troubles which are always cropping up with a gasoline engine.\n\nWe want to see these plants giving satisfaction and we certainly are going to give all the service possible which we can but if the different organizations which are looking after these plants will not place a man who has had some experience in charge, they cannot expect to get results with any equipment.\n\nThe plants of similar type which were placed in your Edmonton School have a competent man in charge, the result being they have never had any trouble whatever since installation was made.

They are as follows:\n\n1. A rain water tank or cistern to hold 900 barrels. Estimated cost $900.00.\n2. Water piping complete including save troughs, cutting and repairing walls, etc. Estimated cost $1515.00.\n3. Kitchen Boiler Heater with capacity of 80 galls, and attached to the Kitchen Range. Estimated cost $155.00.\n4. A two roll flatwork ironer, same as enclosed illustration. This item was included in the original list of equipment but eliminated when drastic reductions were made in the estimate sanctioned. It is an indispensable article of equipment at a school with the capacity of St. Paul's, and as the Principal informs me that the one in use at the Grey Nuns' Hospital in Regina is for sale, at about one-third of the original cost, owing to the extension of their building and the installation of other equipment, I shall be greatly obliged if you will either secure this ironer or a new one of the same pattern.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It was then impossible to do pumping while the laundry machinery was running, there being no connection from said countershaft to pump pulley. Pumping was done direct from engine pulley by belt to pump pulley. To run the laundry machinery it was necessary to stop pump, remove belt, and put on another belt to reach from engine pulley to pulley on line shaft.\n\nThe change in transmission called for cutting the line shaft just inside the machinery room, at which point a friction clutch has been installed. Also the pump has been changed from centre drive to side drive.

M. Graham\n\nF. H. Paget, Esq.,\nChief Accountant & Purchasing Agent,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nW.M. Graham Esq.\nIndian Commissioner.\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn the completion of the new R.C.School, Blood Reserve, I asked the Indian Agent, Mr. Faunt, to notify the Provincial Department of Public Works that there were two heating boilers and one high-pressure laundry boiler that required inspection under Provincial regulations. As the regular boiler inspector for this district was absent in Ontario the Department sent an inspector from Calgary. Owing to the fact that the boilers at St. Paul's school had not been inspected for considerably over a year, having gone longer without inspection than is allowed by law, the boiler inspector visited that school too, and inspected the three boilers there. Altogether 6 boilers were inspected.\n\nIt has been my practice to have inspection made of steam heating plants previous to accepting the building from the contractors. Also, I aim at having the inspection made while the heating contractor is on the job, so that any changes which the boiler inspector may ask for can be carried out. Several changes were asked for here, which have been attended to, with the exception of different safety valves which have been ordered but have not yet come.\n\nThe charge of $14.00 per day is made up thus: boiler-inspector's time, $10 per day, subsistence allowance $4.00 per day. The cost of inspection came higher in consequence of the absence from the district of the regular inspector, and the higher cost of getting one from a more distant territory.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1926 Jan.30th | To Special Inspection 5 days - $14.00 per day | $42.00 |\n|            | Railroad fare Calgary to Cardston & return    | 11.95  |\n|            | Sleeping car berth Calgary to Lethbridge      | 2.50   |\n|            | Inspection of boiler (A)3424 R.C.School       | 7.50   |\n|            | \" 3425                                        | 10.00  |\n|            | \" 3426                                        | 10.00  |\n|            | \" 1217 St. Pauls School                       | 7.50   |\n|            | \" 1218                                        | 7.50   |\n|            | \" 1219                                        | 7.50   |\n|            |                                               | $106.45|\n\nIndian Affairs.

The voucher as asked for in this letter has not been received, and since then another payment has been made on a certificate form amounting to $503.30, dated March 5th, 1926, and I would ask you to please let me have a voucher similar to the one asked for in my letter to cover this amount.

M.

The henhouse which was furnished this school is the same as that built at the Elkhorn School, and will house from 120 to 130 hens. The Principal thinks he should have accommodation for double this number. If the Department feel like meeting his request, inform me. The cost will be about $350.00.\n\nThe Principal is also asking for an outside dairy and ice house, which will cost about $1300.00. Do the Department wish to supply this building? A request is also made for a utility building and printing shop. This, of course, is unnecessary but the requests are going to you for your decision. A granary is asked for and I do know that this is needed and it can be erected for about $300.00.\n\nSwings for the school are asked for, and I think about $60.00 would supply these but I am not sure about the cost.\n\nI think this school should have telephone connection, which I believe could be supplied for about $150.00, including cost of installation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

My opinion is that they have more shelves at this school than they need, and still I am told that the individual cupboards that have been provided are not satisfactory, and do not provide sufficient accommodation for the clothing. The trouble is that in the P.C. School, as an afterthought they built a shelf on top of the lockers, and Dr. Westgate has noticed this; therefore he makes his complaint about the cupboards in St. Paul's not having the shelf. If we have to supply every school in the country with exactly the same accommodation and equipment, our troubles are only beginning.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

T. Faunt last fall. In discussing the matter later with Inspector H. Christiansen, he informed me that the telephone connection could be provided at a less figure and I am inclined to think that I stated the sum of $150.00 inadvertently as I have now received a letter from Mr. Christiansen estimating the cost at $250.00. Mr. Christiansen informs me that the poles have already been provided, this action having been taken by Mr. J. T. Faunt without authority, however, and were erected; they have not, however, been paid for. The sum of $250.00, however, will provide for the erection of the line together with the poles and I trust the Department will allow this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been in communication with the Department at Ottawa, with reference to a request made by the Principal of the St. Paul's School on the Blood Reserve, to have certain out-houses erected, including an addition to the henhouse, a dairy building, a utility building, a granary and also some swings. The Department has advised me that only $1500.00 will be available and that the question to be decided is what buildings are the most important to undertake the construction of. I communicated with Inspector H. Christiansen of this Department who is now at the Blood Reserve, requesting him to take up this matter with the Rev. Principal and then report. As a result, Inspector Christiansen advises me that the Rev. Canon Middleton agrees that he will be satisfied this year with a chicken house, ice storage and dairy. The cost of the chicken house will be $450.00; the cost of the dairy and cold storage building, in accordance with plans furnished by the Alberta Department of Agriculture, was found to reach the sum of $1600.00, but by reducing the size of the cold storage plan was reduced to $1200.00. The aggregate cost, therefore, of this and the chicken house will be approximately $1650.00. I wrote to Inspector Christiansen pointing out that this exceeded the amount the Department stated would be available and he replies stating that in order to come within the allotted amount, the dairy and ice house building will have to be further reduced in size.\n\nI shall be glad if you will review this matter in order that a mutually satisfactory arrangement may be arrived at as to what would be the best means of expending the $1500.00 which the Department has allowed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Flett. In explanation of this voucher, Inspector H. Christianson writes stating, \"This tank was procured to replace the one shipped with the lighting plant from the Crowfoot School on the Blackfoot Reserve in 1924 which arrived in a somewhat damaged condition. During the time it has been in use at St. Paul's, the action of the soda in the water had the effect of destroying the metal connections and it would no longer hold water. A new tank had to be procured at once to avoid damage to the engine, with possibility of a shut-down, and Canon Middleton is of the opinion that the Department will assume this expense.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.

Christianson Inspector of Indian Agencies, I have attended to the matter of shortage of water at St. Paul's School.\n\nThe shortage was caused by the falling of the water-level in the well, but at first I could not be sure of this, as there was a chance that the failure to pump sufficient water might be the result of the wearing of the leathers on the working barrel, especially as the original leathers had never been renewed. I therefore had new leathers installed, at a cost of $15.30.\n\nIt was then found that the conditions were practically the same, and there was no help for it but to lower the cylinder to a point below the working level of the water. This called for drawing all the well piping, and adding 60' of 4\" P&H gal. piping, and the same length of ash sucker rods, for which we had received a quotation from Mr. Flett of $182.00.\n\nAmple water was obtained in consequence of the lowering of the cylinder, but the noise of the pumping from the lower level made a tremendous pounding noise all through the building. To overcome this feature it became necessary to install a new air chamber, and alter an existing valve at a cost of $46.64, as shown on Mr. Flett's bill.\n\nThe pumping system is now working perfectly and silently, and an abundance of water is being obtained.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Flett's bills for $15.30 and $228.64, which cover all the work and materials supplied by him in connection with the pumping plant at this school.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

Ltd., on the batteries in use at St Pauls School, amounting to $66.74 which, as you will recall were at one time in use at the Crowfoot school. It was found that in some of the cells the plates were almost touching the sediments below, a condition, which if allowed to continue, would have ruined all the batteries. They were therefore sent to the Alberta Battery Co. for cleaning and to add fresh electrolyte, no charge being made for rebuilding or for the plates. The arrangement appears to have been necessary and the charge is moderate and fair and I beg to recommend the voucher for payment. Mr. Gardner Smith reports the lighting system at St Pauls school as now being in good shape.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

Canon Middleton, Principal of St. Paul's School on the Blood Reserve he draws my attention to the necessity of having the attic dormitories in this school completed at the earliest date possible. The number of pupils enrolled at present is 122 and for these adequate accommodation cannot be found until the attic dormitories are completed. The Principal states in his letter that he has already discussed this matter with Mr. Inspector Christiansen and as it was, I believe, the intention of your Department to have the attic dormitories completed this year, I shall be obliged if you will give the above request the earliest attention possible.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, June 29, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the advisability of completing the attic dormitories of the St. Paul's Indian Residential School.

The matter was then taken up with the Department, and with their authority I purchased a bunk house, which had been used by the Claydon Co., for the sum of $100. When the chicken house, pig sty and implement shed were built in 1925, the building that we had taken over from the Claydon Co. was taken down and the lumber used in the new buildings. Mr. Faunt should have rendered an account for the building taken over from the Claydon Co. at that time but he failed to do so. This Company were evidently under the impression that the school was to pay for the building as they never sent an account to this office but forwarded same to the school and it was only a short time ago that I was aware that the building had not been paid for and the Claydon Co. rendered me an account for $100 covering said building, which account I am enclosing herewith and recommending for payment.\n\nIn the event of the Department not having funds at the present time, no doubt the Company will be willing to wait for a new months if the matter is explained to them.\n\nRegina Vr. #4074\nDept.

M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir:\n\nI recently received a letter from the Rev. T.B.R. Westgate, Field Secretary of the M.S.C.C., stating that the engine at the St. Paul's school on the Blood reserve is not sufficiently powerful for the work it is expected to do in connection with the light and water systems and asks that it may be replaced by more powerful equipment and the one now in use could be installed in the new school being erected on the Peigan reserve.\n\nIt will be remembered that the plant now at St. Paul's school was transferred from the Crowfoot school on the Blackfoot reserve when the Power Company carried its line through the reserve and we decided to secure our power from that source. It is described as a 6 K.W. plant and I thought it would be large enough to do the work at St. Paul's. You will also remember that we have a 9 K.W. plant at the R.C. school on the Blood reserve, consisting of a parallel 3 K.W. and 6 K.W., bought from the R.A. Lister & Company (Canada) Ltd.\n\nWhen recently on the Blood reserve Mr. Christianson did hear the complaint that the St. Paul's engine was not powerful enough and it is possible that we should install there a larger plant like the one at the R.C. school. I think possibly that the St. Paul's school authorities think that their school should be equipped similarly to the R.C. school and may be ever ready to condemn the equipment now in use. We can duplicate the equipment at the R.C. school at St. Paul's at a price installed of $5375.00. This figure I have obtained from the Company's Agent in Winnipeg and I shall be glad to know if the Department would consider the change suggested. In making the suggestion Rev. Dr. Westgate says, \"If the new engine could be purchased and installed at St. Paul's school in the near future, it would save our Society considerable money for gasoline and the Principal and Engineer much anxiety.\"\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nIt is possible I may be able to procure from the Company's representative who installed the plant at the R.C. School and I understand looked over the plant at St. Paul's, a report as to its condition and capabilities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nH. REGINA, SASK., NOVEMBER 2ND, 1926.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI received today four cheques covering payments on account of expenditures connected with erection of out-buildings at the St. Paul's Residential School on the Blood Reserve as shown in Blood Agency Vouchers #8700 and #8702, forwarded under cover of my letter of the 14th ult.\n\nCheque No. 3487 in favour of Ralph Weston has been made out for $469.70 instead of $469.40 and I have requested Mr. J.E. Pugh to obtain a refund of .30\u00a2 from the payee when the cheque is handed over to him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nChief Accountant and Purchasing Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nOn the 20th ult., I wrote you in regard to a complaint that the plant installed at St. Paul's School on the Blood Reserve is not sufficiently powerful for the work it is expected to do in connection with the light and water systems. I have just received a report from the R.A. Lister & Company Ltd., of Winnipeg, in regard to this plant. They say it is running approximately fifteen hours a day and is too small for the job owing to the fact that there is not sufficient power to do the pumping work and supply their lights at the same time at night; consequently, the engine has to run for a long period during the day to pump water which a larger plant could do at night. The lighting load makes a demand of 50 amperes, which is practically the full capacity of the plant.\n\nIt seems to me that if the plant they now have will carry the lighting load, the pumping could be done by the installation of an engine for the purpose. I have procured particulars from the Airplane-Morse Company of Canada, Ltd., of two engines. One of 1\u00bd H.P. will cost only $79.05 at Regina and occupy a space of 2' 6\" by 2'. A 3 H.P. engine would be preferable and this can be purchased f.o.b. Regina for $124.00 and only occupies a space of 4' by 2' 6\". I think the solution of the problem at St. Paul's School will be to purchase a 3 H.P. engine which can take care of the pumping arrangements and release the 6 K.W. plant to look after the lighting arrangements. As I stated in my letter of the 20th ult., I think the St. Paul's School Authorities consider that their school should be equipped similarly to the R.C. School on the same reserve and consequently may be over ready to condemn the equipment they now have.\n\nI shall be glad to receive the Department's authority to take the suggested action and provide a 3 H.P. engine.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 11, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 402-11A C.E. of the 6th instant and, in reply, I wish to authorize you to purchase one 3 horse power gas engine for the use of the St. Paul's Indian Residential School.

(RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 4)\nReferring to my letter of the 6th November, in which I drew your attention to the fact that the electric plant at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School on the Blood Reserve was not sufficient to supply all the lighting necessary and do the pumping as well, I would point out that I suggested that a 3 H.P. gasoline engine be purchased and used to do the pumping, thus relieving the plant of a good deal of the work that it is called upon to do. At the time I made this recommendation I knew that there was a movement on foot to either have a new 9 K.W. Lister Plant installed, or to have a 3 K.W. Unit added to the present plant to take care of the extra load, but I did not feel that it was necessary to go to this expense. The cost for this 3 K.W. Unit would be $1870.00, as against a cost of $124.00 for an engine to do the pumping, and as the matter has since been brought up urging this additional 3 K.W. machine I want to know if the Department agree with me that it is not necessary to expend this amount of money, and that the additional pumping engine is all that is required.\n\nI write this letter, as the matter may come up at a later date and I want to have the concurrence of the Department in my recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 7, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 408-11A C.E. of the 13th ultimo and in reply I have to state the Department considers that the 3 horse power gasoline engine, which has already been authorized for the pumping at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School, should be supplied. It is the Architect's opinion that the 6 K. W. electric unit should be adequate for the lighting of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, January 19, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the advisability of supplying storm windows for the St. Paul's Residential School. A note has been made for our Estimates for the coming fiscal year, and, if the item is allowed, the necessary arrangements will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Storm windows for St. Paul School,\nBlood Reserve\n\nI beg to direct your attention to the urgent necessity of having storm windows supplied for all the windows of St. Paul's School on the Blood Reserve. In a letter dated December 14th, the Rev. Canon Middleton Principal of this school writes as follows:\n\n\"During the past week we have been favored with an old time storm and blizzard, of unusual intensity from the north. The temperature in consequence was rather low, twenty-five to thirty degrees below zero. All the north side of the building was very cold, so cold as a matter of fact, that the class rooms were not habitable for the pupils during school hours. We had from three to four pounds of steam constantly at the boilers, yet despite this enormous pressure, neither dormitories nor class rooms were heated enough for use. You will recall that the storm windows which were originally meant for the building were withdrawn and after great difficulty during the last very cold winter, we were able to obtain storm windows for the west side of the building only. It is quite probable that with the aid of storm windows on the balance of the school, that some of the existing difficulty would be more or less overcome. Moreover, the boilers were kept going day and night and during the most severe weather we were burning more than two tons of coal daily.\"\n\"I am submitting the above for your consideration in the hope that something may be done in order to eliminate the excessive consumption of coal, and that the building may be made more comfortable by the installation of storm windows.\"\n\nAs the provision of the storm windows in question is, as I have stated above, an urgent necessity, I beg to request that steps be taken by your Department to have these provided at the earliest date possible. Should the expenditure which the provision of these windows would involve, be beyond the appropriation which you are making for this school for the current year, the school management will be prepared to have deferred the erection of the Utility Building until the next fiscal year in order to make the provision of the storm windows possible in the immediate future. It is hoped, however, that a sufficient appropriation has been made not only to provide all the items on the list forwarded to your Department through our General Secretary, but the storm windows as well.\n\nI commend this matter to your prompt and sympathetic consideration, and remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secy. M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/L\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Department No.103-1-5 dated the 7th instant, authorising the purchase of a 3 H.P. gasoline engine for the St. Paul's Indian Residential School, I beg to advise you that after communicating with the Brotherston Electric Company, Limited of Calgary, who are conversant with the situation at the school and recommend the provision of an engine of not less than 6 H.P., I thought it well to accept their advice and have arranged with this firm to supply and completely instal a 6 H.P. Lister engine at a cost of $370.00, which action I trust the Department will approve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to inform you that on the 18th December last I received a telegram from the Indian Agent on the Blood reserve, informing me that the heating worm in the large boiler at the St. Paul's School had burst causing bad foaming, and that it required immediate repairs. He stated that he had authorized Flett, a plumber at Cardston, to drain the boilers at once, as the weather was then mild, and effect repairs before cold weather set in. In a letter following this telegram the Agent advised that Flett, the plumber, had stated that the trouble was due to using well water in the system, and that the water containing an excessive amount of soda had rotted the worm, and in consequence it was giving out and mixing with the soft water in the boiler, thus causing foaming which would lead to further trouble if not remedied. It is stated that unless soft water is used entirely in the system it will not be long before a number of the pipes corrode and will eventually burst. It is recommended that a soft water reservoir be installed to store soft water for use in the boilers only.\n\nI am today in receipt of further information regarding this matter, and it is suggested that a concrete cistern with a capacity of 200 barrels be installed in the school, which would enable the engineer in charge to use soft water entirely in the jacket heater for the laundry, and also for the power plant engine, as the soda water is doing damage to this plant. I would think that six or seven hundred dollars would meet this expenditure, but I doubt whether anything can be done until Spring, as the ground is frozen.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 31, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 402-11A C.H. of the 24th instant, reporting on the repairs necessary for the heating system at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School. I note your opinion that the only permanent remedy is a concrete cistern for soft water, which can be supplied at a cost of approximately $700. A note has been made for the Estimates in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAss't Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Indian Agent Pugh at the Blood Reserve, in which he informs me that the Principal at St. Paul's School complains that the ventilator on the septic tank, which is only two feet high and is situated 50 feet from the N.W. corner of the laundry gives forth a very bad odor with the prevailing winds from the West. I am told that Mr. Gardner Smith states the only remedy appears to be to carry this by means of galvanized pipe back to the building and up the face thereof and to the roof. The cost of this would be approximately $90.00 to $100.00. Do you think this is necessary? and do you think the plan a good one? I presume the pipe would have to be trenched in. I question whether it would work.\n\nA request is also made for an extension of several rows of coat hangers in the basement of the school. This would require about 200 lineal feet 1x4\" dressed lumber and about 120 coat hooks. The cost of this would be in the neighborhood of $30.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. M.

This school as it stands today provides the necessary air space for this number of pupils, but unfortunately the number of girls so far exceeds the number of boys that it is impossible to give the girls the proper amount of air space in their dormitory, and on the other hand the boys have more than they require for their number. The space allotted to the girls is absolutely insufficient, and steps will have to be taken, in my opinion, to finish the attic floor. Would it not be easy to do this by finishing this flat with V-Joint? It seems to me it would be more economical and much easier to get the work done than to attempt to put in plastered walls, as these would not be outside walls, but would have an air space all around. Something will have to be done to remedy this condition, and I thought perhaps this suggestion might be of some value to the Department.\n\nI understand from the Inspector that there are seven or eight additional children who could be admitted to this school at any time, provided the space is available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Chene Esq.\nDepartmental Engineer.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- St. Paul's School; Blood Reserve.\n\nDear Mr. Chene:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 4th instant with reference to bad odours emanating from the sewage disposal plant of St. Paul's School.\n\nThe chief cause for complaint, I believe, is the result of an extra toilet and washbasin which we installed in the basement of the rear extension some time after the main contract was completed. This was asked for because the engineer and outside men had to use the bath-room on the ground floor, and as these men often came from work very dirty, it made it difficult to keep this bath-room clean. I partitioned off part of the basement store-room opposite the kitchen, and placed a toilet and wash-basin there, with connection to the main sewer outside. The vent from this new bath-room was carried up through the roof of the one-storey rear extension, and when the wind is from the west, odours that can scarcely be called fragrant blow into the windows of the main building, and more or less permeate the atmosphere.\n\nThe remedy for this is very simple. Instead of venting the two fixtures mentioned through the one-storey roof, the present vent should be carried along the basement ceiling until a stack is reached in the main building, and then the odours would be discharged from the high main roof, and be carried away. I asked the local plumber to give me an estimate of cost for doing this, but he has neglected to do so.\n\nThere is not a trap nor ventilation pipe near the entrance to the building, as this is not allowed under the Provincial regulations in force in Alberta. The septic tank is of the \"Aerobic Bed\" type, designed by Mr. R.B. Owens, B.A., Provincial Sanitary Engineer for this province.\n\nDuring hot weather odours occasionally reach the school from the pool at the final outlet of the system, situated about 800' from the building.

Push, the Indian agent. I feel satisfied, however, that this matter will be again brought to the attention of the Department through the intervention of Dr. Westgate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Secretary,\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,\n\nWe read your enquiry re the breeching for St. Paul's School, and also yours of the 6th inst., re the N.W. tank. I was sorry to miss you when you were in Calgary, but have been working getting out plans for two large jobs, which has kept me busy until just now.\n\nRe the leak you mention in the N.W. tank, we do not think that this will get worse by having the regular pressure, but may possibly stop if the water is hot, and as we expect to have to fit in the water pipe to the coulee, can it wait until that time? If not we will have it attended to at once.\n\nRe the water piping to Coulee when will this be ready, and if wanted will you send us the total length of the line so that we can ship this.\n\nHow is the job getting along? Has Percy completed yet? And is the machinery completed with the pump running?\n\nWe are enclosing the price of breeching for Cardston, and as the price runs somewhat high, am quoting for 12 Gu., as well as the 10 Gu. I may say that the 12 Gu. is very often used on this kind of work and will give good satisfaction, being only some 1 lb. per sq. ft. lighter than the 10.\n\nTrusting you will find this satisfactory.\n\nWe are yours very truly,\n\nSnyder & Co'y. Per.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 4)\nIndian Office.\nBrocket, Alta. May 13th, 1927.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- St. Paul's School; Blood Reserve, Cardston.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOwing to inclement weather, and consequent heavy roads, my call at the above-mentioned school had to be deferred from the 5th instant as intended until the 11th.\n\nMr. Pugh, the Indian Agent, accompanied me to the school, and we were joined by Mr. F.W. Flett, plumbing and heating contractor, of Cardston, and also by the Reverend Principal, Canon Middleton.\n\nI shall now take up the matters referred to in my letter of the 1st of May in the order in which they were then enumerated.\n\n1. Offensive Sewage Pool. As previously mentioned, this pool forms at the end of the sewer line in a shallow ravine where the fall is not sufficient to carry the effluvia away. At times offensive odours are carried by the wind to the school building and playgrounds; and persons passing on the public highway alongside the pool come within the smell zone. I am enclosing a rough sketch which will give you an idea of the lay of the ground, and the location of the pool.\n\nTo overcome this nuisance I would recommend the digging of a narrow V-shaped trench as indicated by the red dotted line in the sketch. We should then get more fall by shortening the line in comparison with the winding, sluggish watercourse which the water must now follow to get away. The proposed trench would be about 225 yards in length, and would average not more than 3' in depth, and the cost should not exceed $100.00. The offensive pool would thus be transferred to a more distant point where it would no longer constitute a nuisance.\n\n2. Water Supply. The Department's Engineer, Mr. Chene, wrote me stating that a further analysis of the water is necessary before a decision can be reached concerning the type of water-rectifying plant that may be desirable. I have written to the Provincial Bacteriologist requesting that further samples of the water about to be sent him be given a complete analysis, especially with respect to the hardness of the water, and when this report is received I will forward it to you promptly.\n\n3. Boiler Breathing. It has been pointed out that the breaching from the heating boilers is of insufficient weight, and is sagging noticeably. This should be replaced by one of No. 10\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 4)\nThis breeching is unusually extensive, starting from the ends of boilers, then running singly the full length of the boilers and past the steel I column where they come together in one large breeching before entering the chimney. I enclose a quotation for supplying and installing new breeching in 10 gauge iron for $500.00, or in 12 gauge at $450.00 (Snyder & Co.).\n\nIn a covering letter Mr. Snyder states that the 12 gauge iron is used quite generally in industrial plants, and the saving over the cost of the 10 gauge might be used in putting insulation on the wood ceiling over the breeching. The laminated ceiling is about 15\" above the breeching.\n\nRoof Water. The accompanying sketch shows the position of the downspouts which are now discharging roof water along the foundation walls to the detriment of the building. The red line in the sketch shows a tile drain line to carry the water from the four downspouts indicated to the main sewer just beyond the septic tank. It is proposed to place a length of cast iron soil pipe under each downspout, to connect with the tile drain starting 3' below grade. I gave full particulars of the labour and material necessary for this work to Mr. Flett, the local plumber, and he is submitting a quotation to the Indian Agent, which he in turn will forward to you.\n\nRegarding the finishing of the 2nd floor in the main building of the school, I understand Mr. Pugh is forwarding you full particulars of what has been requested, and is procuring prices for the labour and materials involved. I might say, however, that I gave careful attention to the proposals, and these will be carried out without detriment to the building in any way, and will add very materially to the accommodation at present existing. It is also desired that an additional toilet be installed in boys' basement, for which a suitable space is available. I asked Mr. Flett to give separate quotations for each item on which he has been asked to quote.\n\nI will write you further regarding Item No. 2 as soon as I receive the more complete analysis of the water asked for. I shall be pleased to co-operate in the carrying out of whatever improvements the Department may see fit to authorize.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nMr. Gardner Smith has reported the need of supplying heavier breeching from the heating boilers at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School on the Blood Reserve. This breeching is required in the interests of safety from fire, and I would recommend that it be authorized. The cost will be approximately $500.00.\n\nARCHITECT.\nMay 27, 1927.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nMr. Gardner Smith has reported that it is necessary to renew the boiler breeching at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School. You may, therefore, arrange with Snyder and Company of Calgary to have this new breeching provided in No 12 gauge iron at the price quoted by them of $450.00. You may also instruct Mr. Snyder to arrange for covering the ceiling above the breeching with asbestos paper.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Canon Middleton,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Paul's Indian Residential School,\nCardston, Alta.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Department No. 103-1-5 dated the 5th ultimo, I have received from Mr. John W. Pugh, Indian Agent at Cardston, estimates of the cost of providing additional dormitories at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School. The figures are as follows:\n\nCost of lining attic and partition, including material and labour --- $1465.00\nPlumbing --- $114.00\nRadiation --- $343.00\nLighting --- $112.00\nTotal --- $2434.00\n\nThe above cost does not include painting and staining. I shall be glad to know if the work may be proceeded with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI beg to advise that Mr. E. Gardner Smith, Building Inspector, reported to me various matters for attention at the St. Paul's School, which I understand he took up with the Department.\n\nItem No. 1 was the sewage pool. This pool is situated next to a public highway, and it is suggested that this be carried away from this point, and the Building Inspector has made recommendation by sketch as to disposition. The cost of this work would be approximately $100.00.\n\nItem No. 2, Water supply. This matter, I understand, is pending further analysis of water.\n\nItem No. 3, Boiler Breathing. A suggested replacement of this with heavier gauge iron has also been taken up with the Building Inspector, and is submitting therewith a quotation.\n\nItem No. 4, Roof water. The Building Inspector has submitted particulars of this, together with sketch and the quotations made to me for this work, comprising digging and laying sewer tile, is $325.00.\n\nItem No. 5. It is thought necessary with the Principal that an extra water closet is required in the Boys' lavatory. There are two there at present, and with the added pupilage, a Fourth W.C. is required at a cost of about $80.00.\n\nThese matters were brought to my attention, at various times, by the School authorities, and have been dealt with through the Indian Commissioner's office with the exception of the extra W.C. in the Boys' lavatory, and Mr. Gardner Smith, on his return from Ottawa, passed the Department's instructions on to me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nOn the 25th February last I wrote you stating that the Principal of the St. Paul's School on the Blood Reserve was complaining that the ventilator on the septic tank, which is only two feet high and is situated 50 feet from the northwest corner of the laundry, was giving forth a very bad odor with the prevailing winds from the West, and pointed out that the cost for remedying this would be between $90.00 and $100.00. I received an acknowledgement of this letter from you dated March 10th, stating that the Departmental Engineer was making enquiry into this matter and that I would be advised at a later date as to what arrangements had been made to have it adjusted. Apparently this has not yet been attended to as I am today in receipt of a letter from the Indian Agent, stating that nothing has yet been done in the matter, and pointing out that the cost of extending the vent pipe would be $127.70. I would ask for your authority to have this work done.\n\nI understand that there are several other matters in connection with St. Paul's School which were brought to your attention through this office but which have not yet received attention. I would refer you to my letter of the 24th January with reference to the boilers in the school. I also took up with you the matter of the disposal of roof water, and you replied that the school must attend to this. It, however, has not yet received attention.\n\nI should be glad to know if the Department have been dealing with these matters direct with the Agent or the school authorities, in order that I may know just how they stand. My files show that a number of matters are still unsettled.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 4)\nOttawa, May 31, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 402-11A C.E. of the 20th instant, estimating the cost of finishing the attic at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School. There are no funds available at the present time for this activity, but a note is being made for future estimates.\n\nI have also your letter of the same number of the 23rd instant. The ventilator on the septic tank is not required in this case and should be closed. I note you are in receipt of a letter from the Indian Agent, with reference to extending a vent pipe. I am satisfied that this refers to another matter, viz.: the venting of the two fixtures placed as an afterthought in the basement of the rear extension to the main building. The present vent goes through the one-story roof. To remove the odor which sometimes reaches the main building, this vent should be carried along the basement ceiling until a stack is reached in the main building and then the odors would be discharged from the high main roof. Mr. Gardner Smith recommends that this action be taken and he asked a local plumber to give a price on it. I believe this is the subject matter of the letter to you from the Indian Agent and you are authorized to have this pipe extended.\n\nConcerning the first paragraph in your letter of January 24th, the Department is awaiting a more complete analysis of the water supply so as to determine what type of equipment should be supplied. Mr. Gardner Smith, who lately visited the Department, is attending to this.\n\nIn connection with the disposal of roof water, Department has now a report from Mr. Smith and a sketch showing what should be done. I am enclosing this sketch for your guidance and wish to authorize you to arrange for a tile drain from the down spouts shown on the sketch. This drain should empty into the main sewer at a point past the septic tank. No unnecessary expense should be incurred. I believe the cost of this has been estimated at $325.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nA. Fr MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Sec.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 4)\nSir:\n\nI have your 402-11 C.E. of the 18th instant, with reference to various improvements at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School. To remove the offensive sewage pool, a narrow V shaped trench, approximately 3 feet in depth, should be arranged for by the school management without cost to the Department. This would remove the pool to a more distant point. Mr. Gardner Smith suggests 225 yards distant. A sketch, prepared by Mr. Smith, is being enclosed for your guidance. Please instruct the Reverend Principal.\n\nThe Principal has already received authority with reference to the boiler breaching. Mr. Commissioner Graham is being authorized to arrange for the carrying away of the roof water from 4 down spouts on the building.

However, with this analysis in hand, I am sure you will investigate the matter thoroughly, and ascertain if there is any water-rectifying apparatus on the market capable of overcoming this serious trouble.\n\nI shall be much interested in hearing further from you on the subject. It seems to me that, if it is impossible to correct the trouble regarding the deposits from this water, it will be advisable to install a concrete cistern to hold the rain water from the roof, for use in the heating boilers and cooling system of the power plant.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nJune 23, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a copy of the result of the analyses which has been made of the water at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School at Cardston, which was required to enable me to obtain some quotations for the furnishing of a water softening apparatus for the above mentioned Institution.\n\nI trust that this is the information required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Chene Esq.\nEngineer.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- St. Paul's School; Blood Reserve.\n\nDear Mr. Chene:\n\nWhen at St. Paul's School two days ago, the Principal, Rev. Canon Middleton, handed me an Analysis and Proposal in connection with the water supply, from Stanley Brock Limited, of Calgary. This correspondence had been inadvertently addressed to me at Cardston instead of at Brocket, which accounts for its long delay in reaching my hands. The Principal held the letter, thinking I would be calling there sooner than proved to be the case.\n\nI enclose the data supplied by the Permutit Company of Canada, through their Alberta representatives. The Analysis of the water is from samples sent them in their own containers. Possibly this data may prove helpful to you in your consideration of remedial measures for the water supply at St. Paul's School.\n\nTwo features of the Specification, if I read them aright, seem to present difficulties. The large quantity of salt mentioned (65 lbs. daily) would constitute a somewhat heavy outlay. Then, the amount of wash water (75 g.p.m.) for each regeneration of 5000 Imp. gals. would seem prohibitive, and would wear out the pumping plant. Possibly, however, I may be in error in my reading of this Specification, as I have had no experience in water-rectifying processes.\n\nThe water consumption at this school is probably over-stated, except perhaps on \"laundry days\", and the average daily consumption is likely not in excess of from 3500 to 4000 gals.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nMr. E. Gardner-Smith,\nInspector of Buildings,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nC/o Indian School,\nCARDSTON.\n\nDear Mr. Gardner-Smith:\n\nComplying with your request we take pleasure in giving you particulars on a PERMUTIT WATER SOFTENING PLANT suitable for the requirements of the St. Paul's Indian School, Cardston.\n\nOur proposition is based on the information which you gave us with reference to the consumption of water and the analysis of the sample taken from the well marked 140' deep.

Thoroughly modern and complete, it has its own laundry, which naturally was run on city water.\n\nHowever, Philadelphia water contains normally about 10 grains of hardness per gallon, which is sufficient to cause considerable trouble and expense. Linens simply would not wash white, regardless of the amounts of soap and soda used. Each machine load of laundry took longer to run than should have been necessary. Soap and soda bills could not be reduced. Eventually, they decided to find out what could be done toward remedying their water supply.\n\nThe Permutit Company, water treating specialists, were called in and recommended the installation of Zeolite Water Softening Equipment. In November, 1924, Permutit Apparatus was installed and from that moment on laundry troubles ceased.\n\nAs Mr. D. Adams, Steward of the hospital wrote recently:\n\n\"Before installing the Permutit System, we were unable to get the clothes and linens as white as they are now being laundered. Since the Permutit Intermet has been installed less time is required to run a machine load of laundry\u2014were saving about $35 4/6 in the use of soap and soda.\"\n\nWhat the Jefferson Hospital has done can be accomplished by any hospital, regardless of size or kind. In many ways hard water may be adding to operating expenses\u2014your expenses\u2014often in totally unexpected fashion. Clogged pipelines, leaking faucets, trouble in the boiler room, scale in heating coils, in sterilizers, on instruments\u2014all are caused by hard water. Perhaps you, too, are all unknowingly losing money; a waste that could be turned into a profit.\n\nLet us send you our booklet \"Reducing Costs and Improving Hospital Service with Soft Water\" which has been compiled from our experience in solving hospital problems. It's free\u2014just return the enclosed stamped postcard today.\n\nPermutit Company of Canada, Ltd.\nSole Canadian Distributors of Genuine Permutit\n7 Years of Operation and Not One Ounce of Scale\n\nThis plant operates 4 horizontal fire tube boilers of 150 H.P. each at 115 lbs. steam pressure and normal rating. The water supply comes from shallow wells, is clean and colorless and contains 17\u00bd grains of hardness per gallon.\n\nNotwithstanding the use of boiler compounds their scale pans collected more than a half bushel of scale in two weeks, and boiler tubes became so coated that they could not be removed through the heads. The plates and shell of their open feed water heater had to be frequently cleaned with a cold chisel and the valve seats on their feed water pumps were so lined up that they had to be cut out in pieces.\n\nThe chief engineer decided to install Water Softening Apparatus and in August, 1920, Permutit equipment was installed to remove absolutely all scale forming impurities from the boiler feed water. The results were very gratifying.\n\nAll scale formation stopped at once. Old scale that could not be knocked off with the turbines was softened and eventually dissolved or carried off, and in six months time every bit of equipment in the plant was absolutely clean and free from scale. A letter from the Master Mechanic states in part:\n\n\"Within the past two days it became necessary to make some repairs on the feed line in our No. 6 boiler and in doing so we were able to see the top of the manhole plate, and this gave the writer a good chance for internal inspection of the boiler. We are pleased to say that the tubes and shell were perfectly clean and no scale whatever was detected.\"\n\nPermutit Water Softeners will do for you what they have done for others.

In addition the high quality of work produced in Permutit Soft Water has accounted for a steady increase in his business.\n\nA recent letter from him states:\n\n\"Owing to our constantly increasing business which we believe is attributable in part to the use of Permutit Softener, we are unable at this writing to particularize on savings effected, excepting that for the year our saving on soap alone amounted to 65%.\"\n\nWhether your laundry is large or small, similar savings are possible for you. It will pay you through savings in laundry supplies and increased business to use Permutit Soft Water.\n\nOur booklet, \"How to Increase Your Laundry Profits,\" contains valuable information we have collected in hundreds of laundries that have benefited by Permutit Soft Water.\n\nIt is full of practical facts and figures which are of great value to every laundrystowner\u2014write today for your copy\u2014no obligations.\n\nPermutit Company of Canada, Ltd.\n\nSole Canadian Distributors of Genuine Permutit\n\nMain Office \u2014 318 Laguichetiere St. West, Montreal \u2014 Agents all Principal Cities\n\nMay 10 June 10\n\nIndian Affairs.

MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSIPHON\n\nContinuous Water Softener\n\n(PATENTED)\n\nThe Siphon Continuous Water Softener operates automatically to introduce reagents in direct ratio to the volume of water, without being dependent upon any moving mechanical device. The patented siphon reagent feeding device operates directly from the inflowing water, automatically regulating the volume of reagents to varying volumes of water\u2014the principle being that of a main raw water siphon actuating an auxiliary reagent solution siphon so that the two flow in unison. The reagent feeding starts and stops with the starting and stopping of the flow of water. This apparatus is made to apply treatment with such reagents as lime, soda ash, aluminum sulphate, caustic soda, ferrous sulphate and others, the choice of reagents depending on the character of the impurities of the water supply.\n\nThe reagents are mixed in one or more solution tanks from which they are pumped to their respective solution regulators, in which constant level \"B\" is maintained; the surplus solution returning to its solution tank through an overflow pipe.\n\nThe raw water enters the receiving tank containing a siphon of special design. When the level of water in this tank rises to elevation \"A\", the siphon automatically \"makes\" or goes into operation, discharging the water into the mixing compartment. The instant that this main siphon begins to discharge, the displacement produces suction on the...\nSIPHON CONTINUOUS WATER SOFTENER\n\nsolution siphon and raises the solution level from \"B\" to the elevation \"C\", putting the solution siphon in operation which discharges through the reagent siphon seal into the mixing compartment. The reagent solution flow is maintained during the period of discharge through the main siphon. The discharge of water through the main siphon exceeds the maximum flow into the receiving tank; therefore when the siphon goes into action the tank is quickly emptied. When the water level reaches \"E\" the inrush of air \"breaks\" or stops the action of the main siphon. This releases the suction of the solution siphon which automatically stops the flow in the reagent siphon, dropping the level of solution to elevation \"B\", but with solution retained in the seal at elevation \"D\". The harmonious action of these siphons depends only on the periodic rise of the water level to \"A\" and it is independent of the rate at which the siphon tank fills. The number of discharges through the main siphon has a corresponding number of discharges of reagent solution; consequently when the proper ratio between water and solution is established it is automatically maintained regardless of the number of siphon discharges per hour.\n\nMixing and Acceleration of Reactions\n\nThe raw water and reagents are discharged into the mixing compartment, passing downward, and then upward. The reversal of direction of flow in the mixing compartment results in a thorough mixture of raw water and reagent solutions. The discharging of this mixture over the surface of the water in the reaction compartment of the settling tank gives equal distribution and prevents direct currents. From this compartment the water passes downward to the settling compartment and rises through a wood fibre filter to the treated water offtake, over this filter. By these means the treated water is equally diffused throughout the entire settling tank thereby obtaining maximum reaction, retention and settling. The filtration secured in the wood fibre filter usually is sufficient for cooling water.\nSIPHON CONTINUOUS WATER SOFTENER\n\nFor boiler feed, raw water ice freezing, domestic purposes, etc., it is usual to supplement the fibre filter with a filter provided with a specially graded crushed quartz or silica sand bed to perfectly clarify the water.\n\nGravity or open tank filters are generally best adapted for use in this system. Pressure or closed tank filters are furnished where conditions warrant their use. These filters are confined to steel construction, while gravity filters may be constructed of wood, steel or concrete.\n\nThe filter bed is placed on layers of gravel in which is embedded a manifold to insure uniform filtration and an even distribution of water when washing. The filters operate with the water passing downward through the bed; when washing, the flow is reversed and water passed through to give sufficient velocity to carry off the accumulated sediment on the top of the bed. The filters are built for washing either with water only, or with air and water combined. Less water is required for washing when air is used.\n\nThe reagent feeding device has no moving parts to stick, wear out, plug up or require watchfulness to insure its operation.\n\nThe reagent feeding device is the most accurate method ever designed for proportioning a measured volume of solution to a measured volume of water through all ranges of capacity.\n\nThe design of the Reaction-Settling Tank, with its special mixing compartment, baffles and auxiliary filter produces complete mixing of the reagent solutions with the raw water, proper diffusion, maximum retention and settling, and preliminary clarification of the treated water.\nGround operated steel tank installed for softening mine drainage water containing sulphuric acid.

Cheney, Chief Eng.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Bldg., Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSome time ago you sent us an inquiry covering a Water Softening Plant for the St. Paul, Residential School, Blood Reserve, Cardston, Alta.\n\nWe are now able to quote you on a plant to handle this water in accordance with the latest analysis submitted. We can furnish one siphon continuous water softening system of a capacity of 600 gallons per hour (5,000 gallons of water in 8-10 hours operation). The price of this equipment is TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE DOLLARS ($2,591.00) F.O.B. Cardston, Alta., including all such charges as freight, duty, sales tax etc.\n\nThis plant uses hydrated lime and ferrous sulphate as reagents, and is described on the attached bulletin. If there is any further information which you would like regarding this equipment we would be pleased to be of service to you.\n\nWe might mention that if favored with your order the factory advises they can make shipment in approximately 30 days.

Ltd.,\n104 Sparks St., Ottawa.\n\nAttention Mr. J. A. Wilson.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nIn reply to your letter of August 19th, please be advised that the reagents which we would use to properly soften and purify water in accordance with the analysis attached to your letter of July 11th, would be hydrated lime and ferrous sulphate. To soften the water for the practical removal of the carbonates of lime and magnesia the cost of treatment would be approximately $3-1/4\u00a2 per 1000 gallons.\n\nWe note from the analysis that the water contains 412 parts per million of sodium carbonate. If the water is to be used for boiler and domestic purposes it would be advisable to further increase the amount of reagents so as to convert practically all of the carbonate of soda to sulphate of soda. The cost of this treatment would be approximately $14-5/10\u00a2 per 1000 gallons.\n\nThe above costs are based on using reagents at the following prices:\n\nHydrated lime, @ $0.75 per 100#\nFerrous sulphate, @ 1.25 \" \"\n\nWhen this matter has reached the point where you desire detailed formal proposal and specification, we shall be pleased to furnish same which would include our guarantee for the proper softening of the water.\n\nTrusting that the above gives you the required information that we may have the pleasure of supplying you with our equipment, we are\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMgr. Water Purifying Dept.\nA request was made some months ago by the Rev. Principal of the St. Paul's Indian Residential School at Brocket, that some apparatus be installed at that school for the softening of the water, which has a high degree of hardness. Several analyses of this water have been made, and all have shown that the water contains an abnormal quantity of carbonate of sodium, which is liable to damage the metal pipe system in the building, and be the cause of damage to the heating boilers. To remedy the existing condition of the water, a softening apparatus of capacity of 600 gallons per hour would have to be installed at a cost of about $2,500; operating charges for the reagents, etc., would amount to 20\u00a2 per thousand gallons. Before going any further with this question, I would like to know whether the Department has under consideration the granting of the above mentioned expenditure.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nSept. 21, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of the 24th of January of this year, with reference to the advisability of providing soft water for the boilers and laundry at the new St. Paul's School, it has been decided that a soft water concrete cistern of the size recommended by you will best meet the requirements and you may therefore arrange to have this installed immediately. This cistern should be built outside the building located at the most convenient place in order to connect up with the lands from the roof drainage. Piping should also be supplied and installed leading from the cistern to the laundry and boiler room, with the necessary hand pump. I may say that careful consideration has been given to the merits of a water softening plant, but it is thought that the cistern will better meet the requirements of the Institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Ferrier, Esq., B.A.,\nSuperintendent Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI have attached herewith accounts in triplicate for the lumber etc., duly authorised, for repairs to the property at the summer Camp for the pupils of St. Paul's School. May I say, that this property is situated in the heart of the Rocky Mountains, and for many years past, we have taken both boys and girls (different times) to attend the annual camp. Needless to say, they always return greatly improved in health and well being.\n\nThe material thus procured has been used on what is known as the GIRLS' COTTAGE, thereby completing the repairs which have been needed for some time past.\n\nThe accounts are duly certified correct. Was very pleased to have the opportunity of discussing various matters with you. It is a great pity that the distance between points is so great, thus rendering our meetings so few and far apart. Am hoping you may be able to favour us with a personal visit in the near future.\n\nHearty greetings.\n\nVery sincerely yours\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith cheque No. 66521 which should have been included with the Indian Bands Trust Fund paid cheques which were forwarded yesterday, with the cash statements for November. This cheque was just located today among the War Appropriation cheques.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. McCrahan,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:-\n\nOn November 15th, I received a letter from Rev. Canon Middleton, Principal of St. Paul's Indian Residential School on the Blood reserve, saying that he would like to be supplied with \"a few\" Fire Extinguishers suitable for hanging in the outbuildings, also an attachment to the water main for outside emergencies. As his letter did not make it at all clear to me as to just what he did want I wrote to Indian Agent Pugh, asking him to go into the matter and find out what was really needed and he now informs me that the Principal asks for two dozen of the Pyrene type of extinguisher in the one-gallon capacity, to be hung in the outbuildings, and for use in the dormitories and playrooms and perhaps three in the attic. The attachment for the water main for outside emergencies is to consist of 1000 feet of hose, with a small building to house same. In my opinion this latter item is altogether unnecessary. We are not providing water and hose for the protection of outbuildings that are a long distance from the school and where there is no danger of loss of life. It might be all right to put three or four of the Pyrene Fire Extinguishers in these outbuildings, and one or two more in the school. My recommendation is that they be authorized to purchase twelve Pyrene Extinguishers, and I think you will agree with me that the attachment I have described is not necessary. This, however, is for the Department to decide.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 15, 1927.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to ship as soon as possible, addressed to Rev. Canon S. H. Middleton, St. Paul's Residential School, Cardston, Alta., the following:\n\n12 - 1\u00bd Quart Pyrene Extinguishers, complete with non-freeze charges.\n\nThe price should be F.O.B. Cardston, and should not exceed that usually charged the Department.\n\nPlease forward your account, in duplicate, to Rev. Canon Middleton, whose post office address is Cardston, Alta. He is being informed that the order has been placed with you, and requested, upon receipt of the extinguishers, to certify the account and send it to the Department, when payment will be made.\n\nYour early attention to this matter will oblige,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

In regard to the items for stove repairs, I would state that all these are for Government stoves. The Gurney castings are for the Bake oven of the St. Paul's School which burnt out and had to be repaired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI received a letter from the Indian Agent at Cardston pointing out that the zinc linings on the lavatory tables in both the boys' and girls' washrooms are so badly worn as to need replacement and the necessary repairs can be done at a cost of about $40.00. I would ask the Department's authority to have this work proceeded with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Indian Agent at Cardston, advising me that when Mr. Brotherston was at the St. Paul's School repairing the plant, it was found that both cylinders had completely corroded from water effects on the inside of the jacket which had in turn caused heating and the burning of valve seats and the scoring of cylinders. The same trouble has been experienced with the Agency engine, and the Agent requests permission to purchase a half barrel of 300 lbs. of a compound to overcome this difficulty. The cost of this material is 18\u00a2 per pound, and after the first cleaning, only a small quantity will be required to prevent further corrosion.\n\nI would recommend that this be allowed, and would the Department please advise me promptly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 30, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 402-11A C.E. of the 16th instant, and in reply have to authorize you to expend $40 in repairs to the washroom tables at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School.\n\nI have also your No. 402-4A of the 27th instant, with reference to the advisability of supplying a half barrel of a compound to overcome the corroding effect of water on the cylinders of the lighting plant engine at this school. You may purchase this material at an estimated cost of $54.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M.

It seems to me this is something that the school authorities should attend to. I cannot see that the Department should be called upon to be constantly making repairs and replacements of this kind. Nearly every mail brings a letter of this kind and if the Department is going to be responsible for every little item of repair and replacement, it will be necessary to appropriate a great deal more money for the purpose. It certainly seems to me that the school authorities should be informed that they will be expected to attend to these matters themselves without help from the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Graham\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 20, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 402-11A C.E. of the 16th instant, relative to the repairs required to the grate and lining in the water jacket heater at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School.\n\nBefore the Department can decide whether replacement can be made from our appropriation or whether the school authorities, themselves, should be responsible for the cost, I have to request that you will state if proper care was taken by the school in handling this equipment. If this jacket heater was supplied at the time the new school was furnished, it is considered that, if proper care was taken, there should be no necessity for renewing the grate and lining. When we have further information regarding this matter and the reason for the burning out of the grate and lining of the heater, consideration will then be given as to whether we can provide the expense of renewing same or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The position of these gutters is such that if a leak occurs, the water runs behind the brick end between the walls, with the result that all the inner walls are simply mildewed and badly discoloured. I called this to the Inspector's notice on his recent visit, and it has occurred to me that the only cure is to carry the roof beyond the walls and then put in galvanized eaves trough and connect with the down spout. I appreciate the fact that this will be costly perhaps, but on the other hand with the continual drip of the water between the walls, eventually the plastering on the inside is going to rot and start falling.\n\nI find that work was done on this eaves troughing in 1925, with a two year guarantee which has expired December, 1925, and apparently last Winter with its varying conditions has again buckled the lead and split in many places. In view of this condition I should be glad to know whether I shall insert anything in the estimates to take care of this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) J. E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI enclose copy of a letter received from Mr. J. E.

I showed this letter to the Deputy Superintendent General, and he has requested that this be brought to his attention when he returns to Ottawa. I might perhaps say that in the early part of 1926 the Department expended $2,180.00 in endeavoring to remedy similar conditions which then existed.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nW. W.

Sept 21st, 1928.\n\nThe Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- St. Paul's School, Blood Reserve.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant on the subject of leaky eave troughs at St. Paul's School.\n\nThe history of this trouble makes painful reading, and dates back to the time the building was erected in 1924. First, we found the original galvanized lining of the troughs would not stand the extreme variations of climate. I consulted many authorities, including architects and contractors experienced in western construction and climatic conditions, and was assured that if sheet lead were used in the place of gal. iron, the lead would withstand the contraction and expansion without breaking, and our troubles would be over. Acting on this assurance, and with the authorization from the Department, I awarded the contract to line all the gutters with lead to Mr. F.W. Flett, of Cardston, a very experienced sheet metal man and roofer, and took a two-years-guarantee from him. For a time all was well, but last winter brought unprecedented and sudden changes in temperature, with intense cold and deep snow--and the trouble is more acute than ever!\n\nThe position of these gutters is such that any water leaking through the cracks in the lining tends to seep through the masonry and disfigures the interior plastering, a condition very much in evidence at the present time. One way, and a permanent way, of overcoming the difficulty would be to splice the existing rafters, and carry look-outs from the ceiling joists, and thus extend the roof far enough beyond the wall line to form a framework for a metal gutter where leaks into the building would be impossible. The objections to this method are 1st, the high cost (probably about $2500.00); and 2nd, it would detract somewhat from the present pleasing roof architecture.\n\nThere is no escape from taking measures of some kind if we are to save this fine structure from serious deterioration. On the 19th instant, after receiving your letter on the subject, I went out to St. Paul's, taking Mr. Scanlan with me in the belief that \"in the multitude of counsel there is wisdom\". We made a close inspection of the gutters, and found that the cause of leakage is very apparent, and comes from the buckling and cracking of the sheet lead--the very thing I was assured by experts would not happen.\n\nMr. Scanlan told me of his experience in stopping leaks in\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 4)\nthe metal roof of the Calgary branch of The Canadian Bank of Commerce. He used a patented asbestos cement preparation which he applied with a trowel over the leaks, finishing with a second application of a thinner substance applied with a brush. He states that the cement bonded itself tightly to the metal, and to the best of his knowledge the repairs are still standing up, although the work was done several years ago.\n\nIn any event I should not care to start extensive roof work at St. Paul's so late in the season. Also, before recommending costly changes in construction I wish to try out patching the leaks with the patented roof cement used by Mr. Scanlan. It is probable that we can stop the leaks in this way, and perhaps thus postpone the heavy expense of roof alteration for another year or two, and perhaps longer. At any rate it is our best way of getting quick relief from further leakage, and for getting over the coming winter without further water damage.\n\nI have anticipated the Department's consent in sending for a few gallons of the necessary material, and as soon as it comes I shall have it applied where needed, and in accordance with manufacturer's directions. I hope to have this done before the present fine weather breaks. The cost will be merely nominal, and if it give the relief I expect of it, it will be an invaluable aid to us at this time. I do not pretend that this patching will permanently overcome the trouble, but according to Mr. Scanlan's experience it should at any rate give temporary protection.\n\nI shall keep the Department informed as to the result of this experiment.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nTo A.W.

Flett, Cardston, Alta. In regard to this voucher I would state that the sewer line at the septic tank at the St. Paul's School was broken and two of the closets in the school out of order and Mr. Flett was called in to make the necessary repairs. I trust the Department will meet the voucher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have just received a letter from Mr. J. E. Pugh, Indian Agent at Cardston, reporting that corrosion from the water used at the St. Paul's School, which has split the casting, necessitated the purchase of a new jacket heater, and, as the heater supplied all the hot water in the school, a new one was immediately purchased.\n\nThis corrosion, which is a result of the peculiar quality of the water used, will, in the opinion of Mr. Flett, the plumber at Cardston, ultimately result in the corrosion of the pipes throughout the building, and when that time arrives it will be a costly matter to remedy the condition by replacing the pipes. The only solution of the difficulty now appears to be to get different water. It is pointed out that rain water is out of the question, as the present tank is supplying the laundry and the boilers, and cannot be relied upon to furnish additional requirements. The Agent states that there is a spring about three-quarters of a mile from the school which flows continually, and he is having a sample of the water tested with a view to proposing laying pipes from the spring to the school.\n\nWhen I receive a further report from the Agent, I will communicate with you again on the subject.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nD REGINA, SASK., April 4th, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a short report on the Boarding Schools situated on the Blood Reserve, which report was made by Mr. Inspector Christianson.\n\nWith regard to the water situation, this is a serious matter and it seems difficult to find a remedy for the condition described. I have been discussing it with the Dept. of Public Works of the Provincial Government here, who have buildings at various points throughout the province, and they inform me that they experience the same difficulty at many of their large institutions, such as the Battleford and Weyburn Mental hospitals, and so far they have been taking out the pipes and renewing them, as there seems to be no way in which they can be freed of the substance that collects on them. I note the Inspector uses the word 'corrosion', but this is not correct, as it is not corrosion that takes place, but an incrustation on the pipes.\n\nI am afraid that the roof on the St. Paul's school will have to be changed. Roofs such as this one are not used in this country as they are impracticable. As the Inspector says, $2000.00, or in fact more, has already been spent in trying to remedy this defect, and it is as bad now as it ever was I understand. With regard to the brick walls on both schools, it seems to me we will have to put some kind of a preparation on these bricks or else build another wall with an air space between, but before taking any steps\n\nBuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 4)\nwe should get a practical builder to look over\nthe situation and make a recommendation. We should\nnot depend on Mr. Gardner Smith to do this as, in\nmy opinion, he is not a practical man at all. He\nwould not be employed to do such work as he is doing\nfor us by any firm in the country.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNO. 402-11\nALSO TO DATE OF THIS LETTER\n\nD REGINA, SASK. April 2nd, 1929\n\nAPR 3 1929\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honour to report that while on the Blood Reserve I inspected both schools.\n\nST. PAUL'S ANGLICAN SCHOOL.\n\nI found everything in good order at this institution. The school was well kept and the furniture well arranged and looked after. The children were well dressed and appeared to be in the best of health. There are a few matters which I wish to bring to your attention regarding this school. The water that they are using at the present time seems to corrode the pipes and I am afraid if something is not done that the hot water pipes will in a very short time become so filled up with the hard substance that collects on them that nothing will pass through. The jacket heater has been renewed twice since this school opened. The water is being tested, and Mr. Pugh had sent some of it away with a view of getting a report as to whether anything could be put in it to prevent the pipes from corroding. I also wish to report on the roof of the school. As you know, this roof only comes out to the edge of the walls and there are no eaves at all. The first drain pipes were found to be unsatisfactory and about three years ago there was $2000.00 spent on gutters and down pipes, which were of lead. In looking over\u2014\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 4)\nthen over I found that the gutters had all cracked, not at the joints, but between the joints, and as a consequence the rain leaks through and a lot of it goes down between the walls, and the plaster is greatly affected. No doubt the interior of the school will be ruined if this continues. The Agent reported on this matter to you in his letter dated August 21st last, and you evidently discussed it with the Deputy, as later on Mr. E. Gardner Smith had instructions, I believe, to have the matter remedied. Mr. Middleton informed me that Mr. E. Gardner Smith had tried a certain kind of composition on part of the school, but it was leaking just as badly there as any place else, so apparently it was not a success. In my opinion there have been enough experiments made on these gutters, and I think before any further expenditure is incurred something definite should be decided on that we know will be a success. It is probable that the only plan that will prove successful will be to extend the roof over the wall so as to make eaves.\n\nRe Fire Escapes.\n\nThe top floor of the school has been finished and on the girls' side the rooms are being occupied. There are no fire escapes on this portion of the school, and in case of a fire the only way of escape would be by the main stairs down on to the second floor and from there to the fire escape.\n\nST. MARY'S SCHOOL.\n\nI found everything in A1 shape at this institution. The furniture was well arranged and well cared for. The children here also looked well and\n\n-everything-\neverything seemed to be going along smoothly. This institution had a fair crop last Fall but as was the case in connection with the crops of other farmers in that part of the country, it was badly frozen.\n\nGENERAL FOR BOTH SCHOOLS.\n\nI was glad to note that there seemed to be the best of harmony existing between the schools and the agency. I think both Principals realize now that our Agent has been giving them a square deal and that he is not just a piece of putty that they can do what they like with. Smith, the boys' supervisor at the R.C.School, was discharged, and this seems to have had the effect of quieting everything down. A matter that I wish to bring to your attention is that when you and the Deputy Minister were at the agency a year ago last Fall, the matter of getting something to prevent the rain from beating through the bricks on both schools was discussed. It was again brought to my attention by both Principals and they stated that in a heavy rain storm the water soaked through bricks, plaster and everything, which is certainly hard on the interior decorations, and at both schools the walls are badly discoloured from rain coming in. This happens on the west, north and east walls.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant No. 103-1-5, with reference to the matter of repairing the cornice at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School, on the Blood Reserve, and reply to say that it was just yesterday I wrote to you regarding this matter, after having taken it up with Mr. Johns, Superintendent of Construction with the firm of Messrs. Smith Bros. and Wilson. Mr. Johns is a competent man who thoroughly understands building, and he informed me that in his opinion the trouble was not that the bricks are absorbing the water, and that he would be very much opposed to having the brick walls waterproofed with standard waterproofing before having the matter more thoroughly investigated. He feels that the trouble is largely due to the gutters, and would recommend that the suggestion to have the roof extended be carried out before resorting to the waterproofing of the brick. He does not know of a case where waterproofing has been done in the Province of Saskatchewan, and he claims that the Redcliff brick does not require this as it sheds the water. However, I am going to have the matter thoroughly looked into and will report to you again.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to draw your attention to the fact that the gutters at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School are giving considerable trouble and the inside walls of the school are being destroyed. This matter is not new to you, as it was taken up with the Department on two different occasions. I had a conversation with you while you were in the West and you advised me to write you fully in the matter, which I did.\n\nApparently instructions were sent out to Mr. Gardner Smith to do something in the matter and he decided to use plastic roofing material in the gutters over the Principal's residence. However, recent information to hand shows that this did not meet the situation, as the recent rains penetrated through this material and seeped through the walls and matters are just about the same as they were before.\n\nI have discussed this matter fully with Mr. Johns, Superintendent, Smith Bros. & Wilson, who is familiar with the situation out there, and he is of the opinion, that having experimented with lead, copper and now with the plastic roofing material, all in vain, the proper thing to do is to extend the rafters beyond the walls and put ordinary eavestroughing on. This would at least keep the water away from the walls. As you are aware, we -have already-\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nhave already spent about $2500.00 trying to remedy this difficulty. Mr. Gardner Smith has had his suggestions carried out and they have proved unsuccessful, but I do believe that if we extend the eaves it will meet the situation.\n\nI should be glad to have your instructions in the matter, as it seems to me we should do something before it is too late, as this condition will destroy the tile in time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nJune 18, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 11th with further reference to the gutters at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School, I would ask you to kindly arrange to have a competent contractor close up the present built-in rain troughs and install new troughing and down pipes on the outside of the present cornice, the cornice to be extended if necessary.\n\nIt is quite possible that with this change they will find they will have no more difficulty in water getting into the building. The Redcliffe brick is a very hard pressed brick and it is difficult to believe that during a rain storm water will break through this wall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D.

July 10th, 1929\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the two boarding schools on the Blood Reserve, which shows that everything is being carried on in a satisfactory manner.\n\nThe Inspector deals at length with the difficulty which is being experienced in connection with the gutters on the St. Paul's School. This is being taken up in a separate letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nInspector Christianson's Report on Schools, Blood Agency\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honour to report that while on the Blood Reserve I visited both the Boarding Schools in that Agency.\n\nSt. Mary's School\n\nI found everything at this institution in Al shape. The children were writing on their exams, as it was getting near the holiday season. The grounds around the school were in the very best condition, and they have a fine garden as well as a beautiful lot of shrubs and flowers. Their crop looked exceptionally well, as it had been put in in the early spring, and they were busy doing their summerfallowing and breaking new land. The interior of the school was clean and tidy, and the children seemed to be in the best of health. The construction of a hog pen and implement shed was under way. An expenditure for this was authorized by the Department.\n\nSt. Paul's School.\n\nAt this institution I also found everything in good shape. Nurse McGarry is back there as Matron. During her previous tenure of office I found her to be a very capable woman and I must say I am very pleased to see her back. The interior of the building from one end to\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 4)\nInspector Christianson's Report on Blood Schools.\n\nthe other was spotlessly clean, and the furnishings were well arranged. The children were writing on their exams and they all appeared to be in good health. The grounds around the school were in good shape, and a real effort is being made to beautify the place. Shrubs and trees have been planted, and grass sown, and good results have been obtained. I might mention that a new Church has just been completed within the school grounds which cost in the neighborhood of $15,000. This is a very fine building and has a full-size basement which is to be used as a concert room.\n\nRegarding the gutters on the school, about which there has been a lot of correspondence, I notice by a recent letter from the Department that they seem to be under the impression that the rain beats through the brick walls. This seems to happen but it has nothing whatever to do with the gutters. The gutters are right on top of the wall, and the inside wall evidently is hollow tile and the outside brick, and the water runs down between the tile and the brick, as the rafters in the roof only come out as far as the inside of the brickwork, and as the gutters do not hold the water it, naturally, has no other place to run than down between the walls. This streaks the plaster all over, especially on the north and west sides. While I was there, and it had not rained for about ten days then, one could smell must all through the building as though the plaster were rotting on the inside, which no doubt is what is happening, and if something is not done soon it will seriously damage the building.\n\n-I went-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 4)\nInspector Christianson's Report on Blood Schools.\n\nI went thoroughly into this matter with Mr. Weston, who is the only contractor in that part of the country. I got ladders and went up and looked over the gutters and I found that they were simply cracked all over. In a great many places they seem to crack right close to the joint. With the movement of the building and the change in the weather they seem to expand and then bulge up, buckle and crack, and at the present time they are absolutely useless. The only solution in my opinion and that of Mr. Weston to remedy this was to bring the roof out past the wall, and then put on ordinary eave-troughing. This will entail a tremendous expense as it will mean tearing up a certain amount of shingles all around the roof and extending the rafters by splicing, then reshingling and putting on eave-troughing. If there is any other solution that will prove of permanent benefit I have not heard of it, and I have consulted several different parties who I know understand matters of this kind. Mr. Weston will submit figures for your consideration in the course of a few days. What I wish to emphasize is that something must be done as soon as possible in order to prevent further damage to the building.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

The lead contracts and expands and then heaves up and is full of cracks through which the water has leaked down between the tile and the brick. This is just what Mr. Johns, of Messrs. Smith Bros. & Wilson, said was happening, and that the water was not coming through the brick. There is no doubt in my mind that the roof will have to be extended. Mr. Weston has quoted a price of $4000.00 for extending the roof and putting the building in good shape. This price includes all material, and with your approval I shall have the work proceeded with. Mr. Weston will sign some sort of a contract which might be drawn up in Ottawa, or can be drawn up in this office.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mulloy. Mr. Christianson tells me there is a letter on file at the Blood Agency saying that the Doctor's accounts are not to exceed $200.00 a month, but the fact that the Doctor has had a letter to this effect does not mean that his accounts will be kept down to that amount. There are close on to 1200 Indians, a hospital and two schools at this agency. Would it not be better to appoint the Doctor on a fixed salary basis? I think it would. Of course I think it would be unnecessary to give him anything like what we pay for looking after the Blackfeet Indians, although there are twice as many Indians at the Bloods and the work is much greater.\n\nI also note an item in these Estimates for a Farming Instructor's house at the R.C.School. I do not know if there has been any correspondence with the Department about this or not, but the latest information I have is that Father Ruaux is building a house and in all probability he will ask the Department to pay for it. I do not approve of this plan, as I think we should have control over the buildings that are put up. I am told that the Rev. Father made application for this house and was told that there was nothing in the Estimates to provide for it.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

This also proved an absolute failure, as the extremes of heat and cold caused the lead to buckle and crack, allowing the water to run down inside the wall. On tearing up the old gutters it was found that where the rafters came down to the plate and tile this was not filled with concrete as should be for various distances on the west side of the building. It was also found that the rafters, angle irons, and stay bolts were not embedded in concrete as they should have been, and this left open spaces in the top of the wall and a natural place for the water to get in and run on down between the brick and plaster. There will be a small additional charge for having this filled up with concrete, but this will not amount to much.

I also spoke to our Inspector Christiansen about this item of equipment, and he agreed with me that it was very necessary. The Indians on the Reserve are providing themselves with motor cars, and are showing a strong inclination to use motor power instead of horses, and the presence of a tractor at the school will be a help to the school management in fitting the bigger boys pupils for the management of such mechanical equipment.\n\nYou may recall that the horse stable which was built at this school by Mr. Commissioner Graham, was never considered satisfactory by our Society on account of the limited accommodation which it provides. The provision of a tractor will afford suitable relief in this connection as it will eliminate the necessity of maintaining the large number of horses, and for which there is not sufficient accommodation to adequately cope with the work which has to be done.\n\nDuring my visit to this school my attention was also directed to the following requirements:\n\n(1) paint for the water tower (this will preserve the woodwork and make it more in keeping with the main school building).\n\n(2) storm windows and fly screens for the farmer's cottage (the question of the laying on of water to this cottage has already been referred to you in another communication).\n(3) a suitable table with drawers, etc., for the sewing-room.\n\n(4) a new radiator for the heating tank in the boiler-room.\n\n(5) a water softening plant (the injurious effect of the hard water on the boiler and all the hot water pipes is very manifest and the provision of the water softening plant, if undertaken before it is too late, would be less expensive than a complete renewal of the water and heating systems.\n\nI commend the above requirements to the sympathetic consideration of your Department and remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I so advised Mr. Pugh for the information of the church authorities. He now writes stating that the firm of Metals Limited advises that it will be necessary to buy two jacket heaters and use them alternately every six months, thus allowing one to slack so that the scale could be cleaned out, while the other was in operation. It would appear that Mr. Pugh advances this as a possible reason for re-considering the Department's decision.

At the Blood School, there is a room with a bath in it, but the building has never been linked up with the main school's water system. The expense involved at either school would be a very little, and I am of the opinion that if your Department supplied the materials, the school management would undertake the work of installation.\nSir:-\n\nUnder cover of Department No. 103-1-5 dated the 4th ultimo, you advised me that the Department considered certain repairs to damaged property at the St. Paul's school, caused by a gale, should be undertaken by the school management without expense to the Department. I so advised the Indian Agent. He has now submitted an account for $87.15 forwarded to him by the Principal of the school who seems to take exception to the Department's ruling, offering as his reason that the Department agreed to provide the building and keep it in repair while the school management was to be responsible only for running expenses. The Department expressly stated that it was the province of the school to effect these repairs, and it places me in somewhat of an awkward position when, after passing on a decision of the Department, I am presented with an account and abruptly requested to forward it for payment.\n\nWill you please inform me if the Department wishes to adhere to its previous ruling, or rescind from that decision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.

The item shown on the attached advance \"Lumber Co.'s bill of 22 lineal ft. 3x10 is for entrance doors, part of the sack of cement, and the item of 1 piece \"1x10x10 clear fir.

Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to Department letter of 9th April last with reference to the request for a second jacket heater for the St. Paul School on the Blood Reserve and to the Department's suggestion of a soft water storage tank. I have ascertained that there is a concrete tank for storing soft water, of a capacity of 200 barrels and this is used for the high pressure boiler, the heating boilers, and the engine cooling tank. The jacket heater heats water for the baths, sinks, basins &c and is at present supplied from a gravity tower tank which holds approximately 20,000 gallons and requires to be filled by pumping three or four times a week. In other words, the requirements are from 60,000 to 80,000 gallons per week and it would not be feasible to build a concrete tank of such capacity even if the rainfall could be depended upon to keep a constant supply of soft water available. I therefore beg to recommend that a second jacket heater be installed as the most economical and satisfactory method of meeting the difficulty.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

As Canon Middleton informed me in his telegram that he had notified your Department of this loss, I did not consider it necessary on my part to notify you as well.\n\nWith regard to the cause of the fire, when the Principal sent his telegram on May 26th, followed by a letter of the same date, the cause was unknown. His letter in this connection reads as follows:\n\n\"In confirmation of the 'Wire' sent this morning stating that the cow stable had been completely burnt down between the hours of 9 and eleven this morning.\n\nImmediately after 'Chapel' about 9.20, a girl saw smoke issuing from the barn. She gave warning, and we all rushed out. The Farm Instructor (Mr. Lawton) and several boys were up working on the garden. They also rushed down, and we manned a bucket parade\u2014but all attempts to save the burning building were hopeless. I called the Indian Agent, also the Chemical Brigade from Cardston.\n\nWe were successful in saving the adjoining building. Owing to the intense heat, the pump house was slightly scorched, but no damage was done. Regarding the cause of the fire, that I do not know. Mr. Lawton left the stables long before the fire was first seen. There was some hay in the loft, recently hauled from the stack. There is a possibility that this may have heated, and thus started a smouldering, beyond that I cannot say. All the stock was out of the barn with...\"\nthe exception of two calves, and these were speedily removed. There was a loss with some of the Feed oats, other than that, there was no damage only to the cow stable itself, which was completely burned down to the ground, and the stanchions now stand all twisted.\n\nI regret to have to send in this report, but at the present all I can say is, that the cause of the fire is unknown.\n\nAdditional. As a future assistance towards securing help for outside buildings in case of fire, I wrote the Indian Department late in the year 1927, urging that a Stand Pipe with 1000' of Hose be attached. If such were fixed, I mentioned that it would tend to reduce the chances of fire spreading on both the main building (School) and the out-buildings. To this I received a letter from Ottawa dated December 15, 1927, stating\u2014\n\n\"The Department is not prepared at the present time to supply the attachment consisting of \"1000' of hose for the water main for outside emergencies\".\n\nMay I add, that had this 1000' of Hose been attached as I recommended, the damage would have been reduced to a minimum. As it is there is no possible chance of saving the outbuildings in case of fire.\"\n\nI have asked the Principal to furnish me with a recommendation with regard to the construction of a new building after he had talked the matter over with the local Indian Agent. I have not yet received his recommendation, but will write to you again in due course in this connection. As the horse stable at this School was very unsatisfactory in many ways, I am of the opinion that the plans for rebuilding could very well arrange for this building to be fitted up as a work-shop or for some other purpose, and that the new stock barn might be modelled after the one at the Old Sun School and have accommodation for the milk cows at one end, and for the horses at the other. A building of that type would be in keeping with the main school building and the school premises in general, and I commend this suggestion to your favourable consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\n\nIndian Affairs.

C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a letter just received from Rev. Canon H., Principal of our St. Paul's School on the Blood Reserve, he states that Mr. Sugh, the local Indian Agent had received Mr. Commissioner Graham a \"plan for the proposed new cow stable\", and that the Commissioner had stated in his covering letter \"it was presumed the school would do the hauling\" of the material. In this connection I beg to state that I do not see how it will be possible for the school to do any of the hauling, as the Principal stated when he wrote his letter on August 16th, that they were then busy in the hay field and would begin harvesting the wheat the following week. This means that all the man power and horse power available at the school would be fully occupied with the harvesting operations, and consequently could not assist in the way the Commissioner appears to expect.\n\nI may further state in this connection, that on May 26th last, I wrote to Mr. Commissioner Graham pointing out the need of a tractor for this school, and in his reply on the 5th of June, he informed me that he had referred this matter to your Department, and that you had replied stating that you could not give favourable consideration to this request. As the amount of material to be drawn for the new stable includes, I understand, 190 sacks of cement, 125 cubic yards of gravel, 2400 ft. of lumber, etc., it seems to me that it would be a good plan for your Department to authorize the Commissioner to purchase two teams of horses with harness, and engage two of the Indians from the reserve to do the hauling, the horses and harness to become the property of the school when the hauling has been completed. The school certainly requires more horse power to successfully carry on the farming activities, and the money which the Commissioner would pay for hauling outfits for hauling the materials, would go quite a\nOttawa, August 27, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nDr. Westgate writes that the teams at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School are too busy in the hay fields and with the harvest to give much assistance in the hauling of materials for the new stable. He suggests that two teams of horses be purchased for this school and that two Indians be engaged to do the hauling. Dr. Westgate believes that the saving in the hauling expenses would go a long way towards the purchase of the animals.\n\nI doubt if two additional teams are really required at this school, but it is possible that one team with harness is needed, and, if you concur in this, it might be advisable to make purchase and to arrange for the hauling of the materials for the new stable - the team and harness to be the property of the school at the end of the building activity. During wet weather, the other school teams would, no doubt, be able to assist. Please let me know what action you take.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Secretary.\n\nM. M.

In view of this, I have instructed the Agent that the school authorities will have to make the re-placement in this instance. It has become the practice lately at some points to request the Department to pay for every little trifling thing that goes wrong, and I do not feel that I am asking too much when I request the school authorities to make this re-placement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Concerning a team of horses, Mr. Commissioner Graham evidently considered that they were not required and, therefore, purchase was not made. The Commissioner wrote that he had written to the Agent on the subject and suggested that, if the school supplied one team, the Department would hire another.

I do not know what could be done other than have the mains all cleaned and traces to the septic tank, but before doing anything in the matter I deemed it advisable to seek your authority for the expense. I do not know what this will cost, as it will consist only of labor, unless of course a breakage is found in the sewer line. I should be glad of instructions.\n\nOne other point in the drainage was also brought to my attention, and that was where the overflow of the septic tank runs to the west of the premises, thence under the public road into a culdee, and as we have had no rain the overflow is at present stagnant and causes a bad odor along the public road. The principal had in mind putting piping (clay or wood) in this trench and covering it, but I am personally of the opinion that unless this was carried a long way, not enough fall would be obtained, and the result would be a continual digging up of pipe to clear blockages which would be bound to occur in an open drain. Good rains would solve this latter problem.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd. J. E. Bush,\nIndian Agent.\n\nW. H.

July 13, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal, St. Paul's School, Cardston.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to the Department's letter of May 26th, File No. 103-1-5D, on the subject of the drainage system at the above-mentioned school, I beg to report that I visited this school on the 9th instant.\n\nI was accompanied by Mr. R.B. Goodchild, C.E., of the Water and Irrigation Office, Calgary, through the courtesy of Mr. Tempest, Commissioner of Irrigation, who loaned us a Department car for the trip.\n\nThe Rev. Principal, Canon Middleton, stated that during recent weeks very offensive smells had at times been noticeable in the school, the cause of which he was at a loss to account for.\n\nOn opening the manholes of the septic tank the source of the trouble was immediately apparent. The outlets from the siphon chambers had become almost totally blocked by sludge and solids during the 3 years since the tank was last examined, with the result that there was a flood condition in the tank itself, and an interruption in the free passage of sewage from the school to the tank, though a total stoppage had not occurred.\n\nAs the conditions constituted an emergency, and in consultation with Mr. Fugh, the Indian Agent, I engaged a reliable local man and helper to empty the tank, and make one or two changes with a view to preventing a recurrence of the trouble. By the time we left the school on the 10th instant the outlets from the siphon chambers had been cleared of obstructions, and functioning freely, and the smells complained of had entirely disappeared from the building.\n\nThe septic tank at this school was designed by Mr. R.B. Owens, B.A., Provincial Sanitary Engineer for Alberta, Edmonton, and it was made exactly to his plan. It is an \"Aerobic Bed\" type in which the solids are held in...\nsuspension on a series of perforated shelves, the liquid being entirely drained off and discharged at each working of the siphons. The advantage claimed by Mr. Owens for this design of septic tank is the quicker and more thorough action of the aerobic bacteria in the breaking up and oxidation of the solids held in suspension on the perforated shelves as compared with the action of the deep tank; also it was claimed that the effluent from such a tank is less objectionable. In theory, Mr. Owens may be correct enough, but in actual practice it has been found much more troublesome. For instance, in opening up the tank at St. Paul's School it was discovered that the perforated platforms had collapsed. Though the wood itself seemed as sound as when first placed, the action of the acids in the sewage had destroyed the nails, thus allowing the woodwork to fall into ruins. I gave directions for the entire removal of the woodwork, and the raising of the inlets to the siphon chambers to a level one foot lower than the level of the sewer inlet from the school, and grids to be installed to prevent solids from passing into the siphon chambers.\n\nIt is probable that the cleaning out of the tank and the changes mentioned, will carry the school along for a considerable time, but the objection to the present arrangement is in the shallowness of the tank now converted into the ordinary type, which may not have sufficient depth for thorough bacterial activity.\n\nAt the final outlet of the sewage system, about 300' distant from the school, a pool forms which when the wind is in a certain quarter carries the smell to the school. This pool is also close to a provincial highway, and complaints have been made from the public who travel this road. To extend the sewer another 200' would take it to a point well beyond the said highway, and overcome the smell nuisance complained of. This could be done at an outlay not exceeding $100.00. The Rev. Principal is most desirous that this extension be made, but as this feature of the trouble is scarcely an emergency, I told him I could not order it done without direct authority from the Department. I shall be pleased to carry out whatever instructions the Department may give in this regard. The proposed 200' extension would be at almost right angles to the existing sewer line, and would carry the effluent out of the line of the prevailing wind.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 5)\nAugust 6th, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nMr. Gardner Smith on his recent inspection of the St. Paul's School recommended that the outlet from the septic tank be extended an additional 200 feet to a point well beyond the highway. He states that this can be done at a cost not exceeding $100.00. You may arrange to have this additional piping installed; the cost not to exceed the amount previously mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

(RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise that the Rev. Principal of the St. Paul's Anglican school has made application for the purchase of a 1 3/4 H.P. gas engine for pumping water at the barn well. The engine which they have had in use has worn out completely, and will cost in repair almost as much as a new engine.\n\nMay I say that in this case, that if it is contemplated placing this school on \"Power\" that a 3/4 H.P. electric motor would replace a 1 3/4 H.P. gas. The purchase of an engine appears essential and I would recommend that, in the event of the school not being placed on power, a 1 3/4 H.P. engine be purchased at an approximate cost of $65.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise that my attention has been called to the condition of the batteries of the power plant at the St. Paul's Anglican School.\n\nThese I found to be almost gone, the plates in the batteries are disintegrating and sediment has reached the bottom of the plates, and I now wish to ask if the Department will authorize of a new set, the cost of which will be, approximately, $480.00, which price was paid for the set installed at the R.C. School. This set has been in use at the Anglican School for four years.\n\nIt may be that the department contemplates placing this school on the power line. The estimate cost of this work was $2525.00 in our last estimates. I am of the opinion that perhaps it would be an economy to install \"power\" as the item of, approximately, $480.00 for batteries would not then be required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, File 764-5, part 5)\nREPORT ON SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM AT ST PAUL INDIAN SCHOOL, BLOOD INDIAN RESERVE, near CARDSTON, ALBERTA.\n\nPREPARED FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS By R.H.GOODCHILD. Calgary, Alberta, July 21, 1931. A.M.E.I.C.\nREPORT\non\nSEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM AT\nSt. Paul Indian School,\nBlood Indian Reserve,\nnear Cardston, Alberta,\n\nPrepared for The Department of\nIndian Affairs.\n\nby\nR.H. Goodchild,\nDominion Water Power and\nHydrometric Bureau,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nGENERAL INSTRUCTIONS\n\nOn the 7th instant instructions were issued for an investigation into certain troubles at the above School in connection with the sewage disposal system. If possible, the causes of the trouble were to be ascertained and advice given as to remedial measures necessary.\n\nActing on instructions given him to do the above work the writer proceeded to the School, on the 8th instant.\n\nCONDITION COMPLAINED OF\n\nAccording to information secured from the Principal, the Matron, and Mr. Ralph Weston, a contractor from Cardston, who is thoroughly conversant with the sewage disposal system, offensive odours have been noticeable both in and around the School for some time.\nMr. Weston supplied information to the effect that at times the sewer vents in different parts of the roof gave off a disagreeable smell.\n\nCONDITIONS AS FOUND\n\nA disagreeable smell was noticeable inside the buildings on the evening of the 8th instant, and, as there was no wind at the time, it was evident that the odour did not come from the outlet west of the School but from the School sewers.\n\nOn the morning of the 9th the manhole covers on the septic tank were removed and the tank was found to be full of sewage, the water level standing some three feet above the overflow pipe. It may be added that inch boards and \"two-by-fours\" were also floating about inside the tank. The syphons were found to be choked and the overflow pipe was also blocked.\n\nFrom information obtained through Mr. Gardner-Smith, Superintendent of Construction in Alberta for the Department of Indian Affairs, it was calculated that the sewage was backed up to a depth of over two feet in the sewers inside the School buildings.\n\nDESIGN AND POSITION OF PRESENT WORKS\n\nThe accompanying plan will show the details of the septic tank and the location of the works at present in existence. The septic tank when completed was expected to act as follows:- the sewage was led into the tank from\nthe main sewer, was divided by the baffle shown and was\nthen expected to flow out over the upper board platform\nand through it to the third platform, and so on to the\nbottom of the tank.\n\nIt was expected that the solids would all\nbe caught and held in the holes in the various platforms,\nso that only liquids would reach the syphons.\n\nThis expectation was not realized, and from\ninformation secured by the writer, it would seem that\nthe system has never functioned as it should have done.\nSolids and bits of wood or rubbish have at times blocked\nthe syphons and the tank has gradually filled and backed\nthe sewage up and into the sewer pipes inside the building.\n\nIt may be added that the action of the acids\nin the sewage destroyed all the nails in the platforms,\nas a result of which the platforms became a tangle of\nfloating boards and \"two-by-fours\".\n\nIn order to ensure a permanent and proper\nfunctioning of the sewage disposal system several\nimportant alterations would appear to be very advisable,\nviz:-\n\n1. Depth of septic tank to be increased by some four\nfeet.\n\n2. Some important changes to be made in the design of\nthe tank.\n\n3. Septic tank to be relocated on lower ground further\nfrom the School and playground.\n4. Sewer line from septic tank to be relocated on steeper grade northward, with outlet well away from school grounds and from road allowance.\n\nTEMPORARY REMEDIAL MEASURES UNDERTAKEN\n\nSince funds for such extensive alterations are not available certain alterations are being made which, it is hoped, will go a long way towards preventing a recurrence of the past troubles although it is by no means certain that the hope will be realized. It can be confidently expected, however, that an improvement will result. All the lumber in the septic tank is being removed, the wall between the septic tank and the syphon chambers is being carried to the roof and an opening into such syphon chamber, a foot square, covered by a metal screen is being left in this wall.\n\nThe openings into the syphon chambers are being placed about 18 inches above the floor of the tank. The pool created will therefore be 18 inches deep - in the writer's opinion this is too shallow for a permanent remedy, but might serve as a temporary advantage until funds are available to put in a complete and satisfactory system.\n\nIn addition a long rod rigidly attached to each syphon dome is to be placed and held in a vertical position in each manhole by means of guides so that in case of a blocking of the syphons the dome covers may be raised by a man on the ground above, without it being necessary for\nhim to go down into the chambers.\n\nALTERATIONS AT SEWER OUTLET\n\nIn order to abate the nuisance of bad odours at the sewer outlet it is intended by means of about two hundred feet of wood stove pipe to carry the outlet to a point north of the road allowance as shown on the plan.\n\nWhile this will improve conditions it is realized that it is only a temporary relief measure and that the sewer line should be re-located northward, as shown on the general plan.\n\nPERMANENT REMEDY SUGGESTIONS\n\nTo put the sewage system at St. Paul's School in thorough order and to guarantee against any future trouble it is thought after mature consideration that nothing less than the following measures will suffice.\n\nAt Septic Tank -\n\n(1) Floor level lowered four feet. (2) two baffle walls built - from the ceiling downward - in the septic tank, (3) wall between septic tank and syphon chambers raised to level of one foot above the bottom of the baffle walls, (4) a screen grid of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" rods, closely spaced, placed between baffle wall and wall between septic tank and syphon chambers, said screen to be about one foot below crest of dividing wall.\n\nThe design suggested is one that would closely follow that which was put in at the School at Union Lake, in 1928.\nIt is also recommended that the sewer line from the septic tank be relocated to the northward instead of westward as at present. By so relocating this line, the outlet will be removed to a point where it will not give offence to the school population nor to the passers-by on the road allowance. Many complaints have been received in the past by reason of the proximity of the sewer outlet to this main road.\n\nTo lower the septic tank at its present location and to relocate the sewer line from it at this lower level would be very costly. It is considered that by far the better plan would be to construct a new septic tank some two hundred feet nearer the barn - away from the playground near which it now is situated.\n\nThe ground at the location suggested is about four feet lower than that where the tank now is, and from this new location to the point suggested as the new location of the sewer outlet, the ground falls some twenty feet. It is therefore plain that the fall both to and from the septic tank is ample, and that there will be a minimum of deep trenching.\n\nIt is thought that no useful purpose can be served by making an estimate of the cost of the proposed changes as it may be some years before the work is done, when prices may be very different.\n\nThe measures already taken may cure the trouble and so render the greater outlay unnecessary.\n\nJuly 25, 1931.\n\nR.H. Goodchild,\nA.M.E.I.C.\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith a report received from the Commissioner of Irrigation at Calgary dealing with the sewage system at the St. Paul school, Blood Indian Reserve, near Cardston, Alberta.\n\nThis report was prepared at the urgent request of Mr. E. Gardner-Smith, Superintendent of Construction in Alberta for the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYou will note that temporary measures have been taken to stop the nuisance complained of and a new plan and layout has been prepared which may be carried out in future when funds are available.\n\nEnclos.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

As yet, however, the contract for this building has not been signed.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nThe Honourable C. Stewart,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn a recent visit to the Department of Indian Affairs I was very much disappointed to learn that it is proposed to alter the plans for the proposed Church of England Residential School on the Blood Reserve, Southern Alberta, in such a manner as to destroy the attractiveness of the general appearance of the buildings and, to some extent, impair their utility from the standpoint of administration.\n\nIn the earnest hope that the order for the carrying out of the proposed changes may be countermanded, I beg, respectfully, to ask your careful consideration of the following points:\n\n1. The Church of an land in Canada, through its Missionary Society, provides for the purposes of Indian Residential School Education a much larger annual sum of money than any other non-Roman religious body in the Dominion.\n\n2. The amount so provided for the year 1923, in excess of the total per capita grants, was the large sum of $65,035.47.\n\n3. The Blood Reserve represents perhaps, the largest Church of single Indian responsibility in the Dominion.\n\n4. The Church of England established at its own cost the first Residential School on the Reserve.\n\n5. Missionary authorities of the Church have earnestly anticipated for many years the supersession of its own inadequate and unsightly building by those of an adequate and dignified institution provided by the Dominion Government, whose wards the Indians are, on a scale which should be worthy of the Government and acceptable to the Church.\n\n6. The plans as drawn fully responded, in our opinion, to the requirements noted.\n\n7. The contract was formally awarded for the erection of the building in accordance with the plans as drawn.\n\nFeb. 21st, 1924\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 5)\n8. That the proposed changes in the plans will transform the proposed school from the appearance of a dignified institution, worthy of the Government as the builders and of the Church as the administrator, into the form of a common everyday building which, as far as the exterior appearances are concerned, might be mistaken for a \"paper box factory\" or any similar erection for industrial purposes.\n\n9. That a number of buildings on the general scale and dignity of the plans as first drawn have been erected for other religious administrative bodies.\n\n10. That to truncate and mutilate the plans, as drawn, in the directions proposed, will prove the severest disappointment to the great numbers of our supporters who are keenly interested in the Indian Residential Schools, who are making definite sacrifices in time and money for their support, and who, rightly or wrongly, will regard the carrying out of the proposed changes in the plans as, in effect, an act which is unfair to, and discriminatory against, the Church of England in Canada.\n\n11. That the various delays, etc., which have postponed the erection of the institution, have caused the loss of a large appropriation in aid of Indian education in connection with the Church of England, and have seriously retarded our work and discouraged our supporters.\n\n12. That the total savings effected through the proposed changes in the plans, when judged in relation to the purpose and life of the building, will be represented by a sum comparatively small in itself and entirely out of proportion to the losses involved.\n\n13. That since the plans were drawn up, as to ease and comprehensiveness of administrative details, in consultation with us, and since the contract for the erection of the buildings, so drawn, was formally awarded and let, we have extensively advertised the accomplishment of the long expected provision of adequate and dignified buildings to supersede those erected and owned by the Church; to change the plans at this late date will compel us to go back to our supporting constituency with explanations and apologies which will be harmful both to our Missionary Society and the Government.\n\n14. That the Missionary Society has recently undertaken, from the Dioceses concerned, the transfer of our Indian Residential Schools; has paid large sums to wipe off outstanding accounts against those schools; has plans in process of development to administer those schools on a scale which, educationally, will make them a credit both to the Government and to the Church; and that any action whatever on the part of the Government which will bear an appearance of, or can be interpreted to mean, a want of sympathy, and a want of support, will, at this time and from our standpoint, be peculiarly unfortunate and prejudicial.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons and for others which I might present, and as the Executive Head of the Missionary Society,\n\nIndian Affairs.

I told them I expected the Contractor here to discuss the matter with us, and that we had made certain preliminary sketches. The opinion expressed in this letter is quite their own, and I was not aware that they intended to write to you; in fact they did not seem to be greatly perturbed at the time of my interview that we should be contemplating any change. I expect Mr. Claydon here on the 27th instant. The utility of the building will not at all be impaired by the new plans.

As Canon Middleton had been in hospital and undergone a serious operation and even now is only in a state of convalescence, he thought it well to ask the Electric Co., to defer shipment for a short time until he had returned to the School and was sufficiently strong enough to resume the duties of his office and give whatever assistance he might be able in connection with the process of installation. When you yourself had requested the Electric Co., to communicate with him and make arrangements for the time which would be suitable for this work to be undertaken, I cannot see that his action in this respect is deserving of a letter such as the one you addressed to him.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nI had hoped that after my recent interviews with you in your office that a better understanding had been reached with regard to our relationships in connection with such important matters as the amount and kind of equipment which is required for the efficient discharge of the work which is to be accomplished in our Society's Indian Residential Schools. Your letter has had the effect of modifying my opinion in this connection and it raised the serious question as to whether we who are held responsible for the management of these schools are ever to be allowed to make a reasonable suggestion in this connection or not. If in your opinion we have not this privilege, then I feel obliged to inform you that in this matter we stand in profound disagreement and I must reserve on behalf of our Society their right, and one which I do not think they will readily surrender, to take whatever action they consider best to have this state of affairs remedied.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\nFeb. 18th, 1927.\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg.\n\nRev. Canon Gould, M.D., D.C.L.,\nGen. Sec. M.S.O.C.,\nChurch House,\n604 Jarvis St.,\nToronto 5, Ont.\n\nDear Canon Gould,\n\nI enclose herewith copies of correspondence which I think it well you should have on file. In addition to the information it contains I should add that what the Blood School requires and what the Electricians recommended for the lighting system was an additional 6 H.P. Lister Engine and a 3 K.W. Generator. The Commissioner manifests his determination to send only an engine and there, I suppose, we must leave the matter for the present. The fact, however, that both the Methodist School at Edmonton and the R.C. Blood School have the above auxiliaries, along with the Commissioner's refusal to grant what we have requested seems to me to carry with it, either intentionally or otherwise, a certain amount of discrimination against us.\n\nI thought the Commissioner had really undergone a change of heart as the result of my last interview with him, but my diagnosis of his constitutional condition appears to have been very much at fault.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nSGD.

I wish to make it quite clear to you that when I give instructions it is not for you to interfere with them in any way, and I would ask you to kindly remember this in future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.M.

Canon Middleton,\nSt. Paul's School,\nCARDSTON.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe received this morning an order from Commissioner Graham of Regina for a 6 H.P. Lister engine to be installed at your School to drive the pump. This is, as you know, contrary to the advice that we gave Commissioner Graham with regard to your needs at St. Paul's. He first asked us for a price to install a 3 H.P. Fairbanks engine. We told him that this would be much too small to give satisfaction in driving your pump and advised him to install another 3 K.W. Unit to work parallel with the one you have at present. He replied saying that he had definite information that this extra engine to drive your pump would be satisfactory and asked us to quote a price for installing a 6 H.P. Fairbanks or equal. We quoted him on a Lister 6 H.P. engine and he has replied to us telling us to go ahead with the installation. He also asked us to communicate with you so as to make arrangements for the time that would be suitable to you.\n\nWe will await your reply before we ship this engine.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBROTHERSTON ELECTRIC CO.

Lethbridge,\nW. S. Henderson .............. 718 - 3rd Ave. S.,\nLethbridge.\n\nYou should supply these firms with full particulars as to the type, etc., of the batteries required, and you should place the order with the firm quoting the lowest price. It is noted that you estimate the cost to be approximately $450, and this amount should, if possible, not be exceeded.\n\nAfter the purchase has been made, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 5)\nSir:\n\nI beg to ask for authority to purchase a pump jack, at a cost of $15.00, for the St. Paul's Anglican School.\n\nThe pump jack in use is entirely worn out, and needs replacing. This is used for watering stock at that institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI wish to advise that on a recent visit to the St. Paul's Anglican school, the condition of the hog pen was called to my attention. The flooring, which is of plank, has all rotted away, and is therefore in a bad condition, and impossible to keep clean. It would require, approximately, 1300 sq. ft. of planking at a cost of $45.00 per thousand, and the labor of laying, which would probably entail three days labor for two men at $1.00 per hour for a 10 hour day, a total cost of $157.00.\n\nThe Principal is desirous of moving this building to another site and requests that I place this before the Department. This would entail new cement foundations as well as the cost of moving, and re-planking floors; the total cost of this latter work would be, approximately, $350.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 5)\nOttawa, September 29, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, requesting authority to purchase a pump jack at a cost of $15 for use at the St. Paul's C. of E. Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of a pump jack, and the cost should not exceed the above mentioned amount. Please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nI have also your letter of the same date relative to the condition of the hog pen. In this connection I have to say that the Department has no funds to provide for the cost of supplying new planking to repair the present flooring, or to move this building to another site.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

I may say that we have been using the 80 amp batteries of 9 plate type, hence the price I quoted of $410.00, which was a made up battery.\n\nThe Roy Electric Co. recommend the iron clad at $755.00, and in doing so state that these batteries should last at least eight years. My recommendation in the matter is that the iron clad is far superior to the other batteries quoted, but if the Department feel that this is too much money, I would respectfully ask their consideration of the 13 plate Delco at $652.00, as compared with the Globelite or Prestolite at $545.00 and $499.00 for a nine plate job.

Flett, Cardston, Alta., for plumbing repairs at the St. Paul's Anglican School.\n\nIn this connection I wish to state that this work was the changing of the water heater jacket in the plant at the school.\n\nThis water heater seems to have gone like the former ones installed and (this makes the third heater installed) becomes corroded up with sediment from the water which in about twelve months crusts and then cracks the jacket and needs replacing. At the time of this change we had another heater on hand purchased last year by authority, with the idea in view of changing these off every six months, but unfortunately the one in use cracked and is useless, so the alternating heater is now in use. This, however, will have to be replaced again under the year, and I would, therefore, seek authority to purchase a spare heater so that a change over can be made before next Winter. The cost of these heaters is approximately, $125.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Residential School. In this connection I have to inform you that this account will be paid in due course.\n\nRegarding your remarks as to the necessity of frequent changes in the heaters, owing to them becoming corroded, I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of a spare heater to be kept on hand for use when required. It is noted that the cost will be approximately $125. You should arrange for the purchase from a firm on the list to receive consideration, in accordance with department instructions. The purchase of this heater may be made when considered timely by you.\n\nAfter the purchase has been made, please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I wish to state that on looking over the patronage list, I note that the Plumber of Cardston, Mr. F.W. Plett, is not on that list, and as Lethbridge list shows no plumber, and Macleod with Mr. W.G. Andrews, I have in the past used Mr. Plett's services, being the only competent plumbers in the near vicinity to our premises, and I now ask if it will be in order to continue using his services, and ordering the heater through his medium, as he will of necessity be called upon to install or change the heater. I might say that Macleod is 36 miles distant and Lethbridge 60 miles, which would add to the cost of such work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.S.

BUSKARD,\n\nMr. Indian Agent Pugh, of Cardston, Alberta, writes to know if it will be satisfactory to engage Mr. F. W. Flett, plumber, of Cardston, for repair work. He reports that Mr. Flett is the only competent plumber in the vicinity of the agency and the two Indian Residential Schools. The average distance is approximately 6 miles. The nearest plumber who has been recommended to him by the Department is in Naicton, which is 56 miles distant. Of course, it would be in the interests of economy to engage a plumber from Cardston. Please let me know the Minister's wishes.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, April 25, 1932.\n\nMr. Ferrier,\n\nReplying to memorandum of April 7, it will be quite satisfactory to engage Mr. F.W. Flett, Plumber, of Cardston, for work in the Blood Indian Agency.\n\nActing D.S.G.I.A.\nOttawa, April 25, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 29th ultimo, relative to the purchase of a spare heater for the St. Paul's C. of E. Indian Residential School, I have to say that it will be satisfactory to engage the services of Mr. F. W. Flett, plumber, of Cardston, Alta., to carry out any plumbing services that will be required at either the St. Paul's C. of E. or Blood R. C. Indian Residential Schools. The spare heater for the St. Paul's School may be obtained through Mr. Flett. I may add that it would be satisfactory to utilize Mr. Flett's services for any plumbing work that will be required in the Blood Indian Agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I trust the Department will concur in my action.\n\nI do not know what the cost will be as yet, but will advise the Department as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.S. Hugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter No. 402-11 C.E., of the 23rd ultimo, I beg to state that the high pressure laundry boiler mentioned in the above letter has been examined and it is found to be badly pitted in the crown sheet and the walls and tubes. It appears that on this account that the boiler inspector last year cut down the pressure, and as reported by me, it has now started leaking badly, and I am advised that replacement would be the most satisfactory, in view of the fact that practically all the tubes are leaking and the walls and crown plates are pitted. The cost of a 6 h.p. Leonard upright boiler installed is $450.00, and I would, therefore, seek instructions in the matter. I have had no repairs made to the boiler pending the Department's decision as to replacement.\n\nI may say that the water problem at this school is bad from a corrosion point of view, and it might be an economy to install a water softener in this plant when conditions improve.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 20, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 402-11 C.E. of the 6th instant, with reference to a new high pressure boiler for the laundry at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School. You may make replacement, awarding the business to F. W. Flett, provided his price is entirely satisfactory. Before submitting the account in triplicate for payment, the local boiler inspector should approve of the installation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston,\nAlta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to state in reply to departmental letter No. 103-1-5, dated June 20th, regarding the laundry boiler at the St. Paul's Anglican school, that I have had Mr. Dick, the local boiler inspector, check this boiler over, and a slight expense we have cut away several flues and examined the shell, and Mr. Dick advises that by refueling the boiler should last for several years, and he suggests that I take the boiler into Lethbridge and have this retubing work done there. Mr. Dick is giving me a report on this matter.\n\nThe cost should not now exceed $175.00, which will effect a saving that the Department desire at this time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Principal asks if the department will meet this account.\n\nI am also advised that a set of grates for the kitchen range has been ordered as these had burned out and required replacing, the cost of which would be about $39.00, and the Principal has also asked if the department will meet this account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise that at the St. Paul's Anglican School the pump rods on the deep well of the water supply broke and went to the bottom of the well and it became necessary to obtain the services of Mr. Flett, plumber of Cardston, to take out the pump jack and get out the broken rods from the bottom of the well. This has necessitated the renewal of several rods and changing the head and leathers of the pump. The cost of this work will be kept as low as possible and the account rendered. I am advised that this well should also be rebores to clean out sand etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta., October 25th, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise that during recent very high winds, the steel sheet chimney on the St. Paul's Anglican School building has blown over, as a result of deterioration in the metal and consequent winds.\n\nIt will be necessary to replace this chimney completely, as all the metal is rotted and it becomes necessary to rebuild.\n\nAs this became necessary, I have taken steps to have this chimney erected in order to protect the building and permit the use of the kitchen range.\n\nThe cost is estimated at $60.00, and I trust the Department will concur in my action in view of the circumstances.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 28, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, enclosing a voucher covering the cost of drive belting for the pump at the St. Paul's C. of E. Indian Residential School, to the amount of $19.85.\n\nIn reply I have to say that this account will be paid in due course. The Department will approve of the expenditure required in the purchase of a set of grates for the kitchen range, at a cost of approximately $39. You should forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nI have also your two letters of the 25th instant, regarding the removal of broken pump rods from the bottom of the well and the renewal of several rods and changing of the head and leathers of the pump. You may forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred for this purpose, when payment of same will receive consideration.\n\nRegarding the repairs required to the steel sheet chimney which was blown over, it is noted that you have taken action to have a new chimney erected in order to protect the building and permit use of the kitchen range, at an estimated cost of $60. You may forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to bring to your attention in connection with the St. Paul's Residential School on the Blood Reserve, that a steam register is required in the clothing room. This has been asked for on several occasions.\n\nWithout the register, the room in question is cold, and the clothing in winter is always damp with frost when taken out of this room. If the register were supplied, this would be overcome.\n\nA plumber from Cardston would have to install this register. The cylinder in the well should also be lowered, as very often they are out of water for awhile until it rises. There is an abundance of water in the well but in order to take advantage of it a 20-foot length of 2\" pipe is necessary to lower the cylinder. It would be necessary to have Mr. Flett from Cardston do this work, as the school has not the proper equipment to make the change.\n\nI trust that both the register and the lowering of the cylinder will be authorized as both are required and the cost would not be very great.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, December 9, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 402-11A., C.E., of the 2nd instant, recommending that a steam register be installed in the clothing room at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School also that the cylinder in the well be lowered.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of the expenditure required in the installation of a register in the clothing room. You may arrange to have this work carried out and keep the cost as low as possible.\n\nWith reference to the lowering of the cylinder in the well, I have to say Mr. Agent Pugh informed the Department in October last, that the pump rods on the deep well of the water supply broke and went to the bottom, which necessitated the removal of several rods and the changing of the head and leathers of the pump. He was authorized to have the necessary repairs carried out to the pump. It is presumed that this would include the lowering of the cylinder.\n\nAfter the register has been installed, please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise the Department that the Principal of the St. Paul's Anglican School informed me that the check valve in the main water line to the water tower had gone out of order, and that the boiler room had flooded etc. This became an emergency and I accordingly instructed Mr. Lett, Plumber of Cardston, to proceed to the school to effect repairs. It was found that the check valve leather had worn and it will be necessary to replace.\n\nI am not in position at present to state the cost, but this will be kept as low as is consistent with putting the damage in good repair.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 20, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, regarding the repairs required to the check valve in the main water line to the water tower at the St. Paul's C. of E. Indian Residential School. It is noted that you gave the necessary instructions to have a plumber proceed to the school and effect the repairs necessary and that the cost will be kept as low as is consistent with putting the damage in good repair.\n\nAfter the work has been completed, you may forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost. This account should show in detail the cost of an equipment supplied and also the labour in carrying out the repairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. E.

With reference to this expenditure I have to advise that the septic tank at the St. Paul's Anglican School and the boiler and laundry rooms were both flooded. The school did all possible, but eventually I had to call Weston Bros. to get the tank cleaned, and it was found that some rags etc. had blocked the syphon. Being an emergency, I had not the time to obtain Department authority. I trust the Department will take care of this account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, enclosing voucher No. 11417 for $24. This is being paid, but it is noted the cause of the trouble was that some rags, etc., had blocked the syphon. It is considered that precautions should be taken by the school management to prevent such occurrence in the future. If a similar condition arises, due to the same cause, it is believed the school management should bear the cost of the repairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter 103-1-5 of the 9th, ult., in connection with the well at the St. Paul School, in the Blood Agency.\n\nThe well that the Department refers to in the second last paragraph of the letter is the well at the school. The well we had reference to is the one at the barn which supplies the water for the stock.\n\nI will admit I did not make this matter quite clear in my report.\n\nIt requires two more lengths of 2\" pipe to get properly down into the water. I trust the authority to have this done will be granted by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, January 10, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 402-11A C.E. of the 3rd instant, with reference to the lowering of the cylinder in the well at the barn which supplies the water for the stock at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of the expenditure required in the supplying of a 20' length of 2\" pipe and for the labour in installing same. You may, therefore, arrange to have the work required to place this well in a satisfactory condition carried out at an early date. An account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred, should be forwarded. Please keep all costs as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Slett, plumber of Cardston and amounting to respectively $19.54, $21.85, $73.87, $23.90, $11.80, $17.20 and $2.60, and I wish to report as follows on these expenditures made at the St. Paul's Anglican school.\n\nVoucher no. 11458 - $19.54. Under authority of Letter No. 103-115, dated October 25th, 1932, authorized charge of \u00a360.00. This smoke stack metal extends from the kitchen flat roof to the elevation of the school building roof, and on account of its length, approximately 30', it is stayed by wire stretchers. When making the estimate on this it was thought that half of the metal could be used again, but it was rotted and unfit to use again, and the whole stack was therefore renewed, and re-erected from the base, and the cost therefore should be included. The work proceeded with the workmanship found it necessary to repair the whole structure. I may say that this is the third stack put up since the school was built, and I am of the opinion that a brick stack should be erected here, and I think, if stayed with iron rods, with an enlarged base, that it would be a lasting job. The stack is on the west side of the building, and being of such height, that when the metal deteriorates and high winds strike it, collapse usually follows.\n\nVoucher no. 11459 - $21.85. This voucher covers repairs to pump in the barn, last fall when the pump went out of order, and repairs became a necessity, as this is the only water for stock available without laying lines from the school proper system.\n\nVoucher no. 11460 - $73.87. This work was executed in December, as the well became practically dry. Authority was given later to lower the pipes and add a 20' length with rods and couplings. On pulling the pipe it was found that the well would take a further 20 feet of pipe and couplings and would then be in 30 feet of water, and I authorized Mr. Slett to put on the additional pipe and rods etc.\n\nVoucher no. 11461 - $23.90. This voucher covers the cleaning out of closets and sewer line on the girls' side of the school. These were clogged and the services of the plumber obtained to put them in order again. The latter portion of the voucher is for repairs to the kitchen sink.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 5)\nVoucher No. 11462 - $11.80. Covers repairs to the wash tray in the girls' lavatory. Traps were rusted and leaking and was replaced.\n\nVoucher No. 11463 - $17.20. This is for general repairs to two radiators (supply of Dunham rad., traps) and pipe for hose faucet with the faucet.\n\nVoucher No. 11464 - $2.60. This covers certain fittings and rubber packing got by the school. Rubber packing used in the kitchen grease traps and tees, couplings for the same purpose, with tees also used in repairs in the girls' lavatory.\n\nIn submitting these vouchers, I may say I feel it somewhat of a problem, when I am phoned by the Principal that certain plumbing etc., are out of order, and having no specific authority for minor repairs, and as they appear necessary, I instruct the Principal to do the repairs. The incurring of expenditure in this respect is, however, done with temerity. I may assure the department that in exceeding any authority in the matter, that judgement is used in order to give the best and most economical service. I should like to be advised as to what course to follow in cases of emergency calls from the schools in cases of this kind, where expenditures are incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

MACKENZIE.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 5)\nSir,\n\nI have to state in further to my wire of the 10th instant, which referred to damage to heating system at the St. Paul's Anglican School, that in company with plumber, I went to the school yesterday afternoon, after a call from the Principal, and found that a pair of radiators in the dormitory on the S.W. corner of the building had frozen, splitting practically all the cores and the piping, and in the toilet a radiator also split and ruined, and the newly installed radiator in the clothes room, under the chapel. This was on the third floor. On the fourth floor on the S.W. corner, one toilet and the pipe connections had been frozen, and in the dormitory, in the middle of the fourth floor on the west wall, a toilet that had also frozen solid.\n\nI made inquiry in regard to the firing of the boilers in the night of the 9th and 10th February, which without doubt was one of the worst storms experienced in the south part for long time, a wind of 35 miles an hour, with snow shifting and the temperature around 10 below zero, and I feel satisfied that there was no fault in the firing, both boilers going and the fireman up all night till 4 A.M., stoking, when he was relieved.\n\nThe position of the radiators is under windows, and we are of the opinion that the cold air striking the radiators caused condensation and the freezing.\n\nI believe that a saving can be effected on the price quoted of about $100.00, as the oil tanks after being emptied, are not beyond repair, and it will not be necessary to renew these, but the radiators will have to be new.\n\nI am enclosing a sketch showing the position of the radiators in the dormitory, and in replacing I think it would be wise to utilize the blank wall space and get away from the windows and the consequent drafts in weather of the type we are experienced in the same week.\n\nI may say that I deemed it advisable to wire the department in this regard, and have not proceeded with the work of repair pending the department's authority.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 5)\nFeb. 25, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 11th with reference to the damage to the heating system in the St. Paul's School, you were advised by telegram of Feb. 11th to have the necessary repairs made.\n\nIf the traps on the radiators are working properly there should be free circulation of the water condensation back to the boiler, and water should not lie in the radiators. The traps must have been clogged up in some way which held the water in the radiators. It would be well for the Engineer at the School to check these traps at different periods to see that they are functioning properly.\n\nIt is desired that the accounts for this work be forwarded to reach the Department not later than March 31st as they will have to be paid from this year's appropriation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

Flatt, Cardston, Alta., for replacing radiators and repairing water pipes damaged by frost in the St. Paul's Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. Telegram dated February 11th, 1933. A.F. McKenzie.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nSir:\n\nI beg to bring to your attention that a short time ago I visited the St. Paul's School in the Blood Agency, and while there it was brought to my attention that they were having a great deal of trouble with the well that supplies that institution with water. The well evidently is getting filled up with sand and the engine has to be kept going almost continually to get sufficient water for the school.\n\nBefore making any suggestion I would ask that the Department get in touch with the Dominion Water Power Branch and have Mr. Fetterly look into this matter. It is urgent that this be attended to as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, June 2, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your 402-11A of the 29th ultimo, with reference to the well at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School.\n\nFor your information, I may say that no funds were specifically provided in this year's Appropriation for work at the St. Paul's School, and, under these circumstances, the Department is unable to authorize any expenditure in connection with the well.\n\nI would suggest that the school authorities have this work done at their own expense; and, when it is completed, you may submit the receipted account to the Department. The matter of making a grant to the school towards the cost will then receive further consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\nWhile we were working on this well, the Principal of the St. Paul's Anglican School advised me that their pump had broken on September first\u2014and the children in school. I went to the school to find that they were also out of water and found that the rods had been broken off in the bottom of the well and the leather in the valves reversed and worn. I, therefore, deemed it advisable to pull this pump, and accordingly got the driller to set there at a cost of $75 to draw the pump and clean this well out, which was done. We found about six feet of a shale of fine grade in this well, but the brass barrel in good shape. The rods were repaired by Weston Bros. of Cardston. That well is now working in good shape. I did find, however, that in this well the pump sits fairly well up, is a 4\" pipe pump, and the well casing is as shown in the log, reduced, and therefore the pump cannot be lowered. I would suggest that when next this well is worked on that a 3\" pump pipe be used and then lowered into the well casing.\n\nAs with the Blood School, I put in a lot of time at the Anglican School, and the cost of this work will be $75 for well rig and work, and a charge for repairs to rod and help in getting the rods out, etc., to get a supply of water, pending the cleaning of the well.\n\nBoth schools rendered assistance in the work, particularly the Blood R.C. School, as the work is heavy, and the expense was kept down in this respect, using only two on the well rig, and I may say that, by careful planning, the two jobs have been done under the cost I estimated, and as a consequence of the break down at St. Paul's School, I did that job without wiring the Department for authority, as it appeared an absolute necessity to satisfy myself and the schools that an efficient water supply be maintained from all points of view. I trust the Department will concur in my actions in the matter.\n\nThe total cost of both jobs will not exceed $350.00, and the Department may be assured that the work was done economically, and that the water supply is sufficient at both schools.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta., October 19th, 1933.\n\nSir:-\n\nI beg to report that I have today authorized the local plumber, of Cardston, to replace the heater (hot water) at the St. Paul's Anglican School.\n\nI was advised that the one in use had split with sediment, and that there was no hot water. I may say in this connection that about two years ago authority was given to purchase an extra heater, and it was then proposed to alternate these heaters and this has been done about every six months. This time it lacked a month or more to the change, and apparently the sediment has been greater and corroding set in faster with the result that the heater split.\n\nKindly advise if an extra heater should be purchased at a cost of $125.00 to $130.00.\n\nWe have found at this school, due to the corroding quality of the water, that a hot water jacket heater will not last a year, hence the reason of having an extra heater to alternate.\n\nI trust the Department will concur in my authorizing the replacing of the extra heater under the circumstances. The cost will be for labour and minor fittings only.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n402-11 C.E.\n\nOttawa, October 30, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, regarding the installing of the extra hot water jacket heater, to replace the one in use, at the St. Paul's Anglican Indian Residential School. It is noted you request that an extra heater be supplied, to be on hand in case of damage to the one in use.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of the extra hot water jacket heater - the cost not to exceed your estimate of $130. I enclose an encumbrance certificate authorizing an expenditure to that amount. After the purchase has been made, you should obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost.

This should be looked after whenever money is available.\n\nThe machinery in the school is all in fair shape but the power plant is beginning to show wear and will soon require a general overhauling. The present engineer.....\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 5)\nBuildings. (Continued),\u2014\n\nengineer seems to handle the plant and other machinery very satisfactorily, but naturally machinery that has been running for 10 years will show considerable depreciation. The present plant is a Lister Bruston and in my opinion the sooner it is given a general overhauling, the better. This company has been taken over by the Delco Light Company but they retain several men from the former company and in conversation with the Manager here recently, he informed me that some of his experts would be in the southern part of the province sometime during the summer.\n\nWhat the plant requires, besides the general overhauling, is two new cylinders and pistons and rings, and new bearings; also connecting rods.\n\nThe grounds around the school are well kept and considerable improvement is noticed each year. When the foliage is all out and the grass is green it is quite a beauty spot.\n\nThe out-buildings are all in a good state of repair and have been well kept. The water tower, however, is giving considerable trouble and needs repairing, as it is leaking badly. It also needs painting. The well went dry sometime ago and had to be cleaned out, and I was informed by the Principal that at the present time they had to pump practically 24 hours a day to keep the school properly supplied.\nBuildings, (Continued),-\n\nwith water. If it goes dry as it quite possibly might do, this would be a calamity. The present well is 140 feet deep and at the time the school was built there was ample water: I was there several times while it was being built and had the quantity of water in the well tested. I would recommend that we have Mr. Fetterly of the Dominion Water Power Branch look into this matter sometime during the summer.\n\nFARMING:-\n\nThe farming operations of this institution were more or less of a failure last year. They threshed no grain whatever on account of drought, but raised sufficient potatoes and other garden truck to carry them through the winter. They have about 70 head of cattle of which 35 are cows. At the time of my visit they were milking 17 cows. They also have 18 horses and some pigs, but no chickens. They intend to crop 200 acres of wheat and about 60 acres of oats this year and are putting in a larger garden. They have not sufficient cattle to meet the beef requirements of the school so considerable beef is purchased from the butcher shop in town.\n\nHEALTH:-\n\nThe children all looked well and were well clad and I am quite sure are being properly cared for. At the time of my visit there were 56 boys and 85 girls, a total of 141 present.\nHealth, &c., (Continued),\u2014\n\nI also checked over the clothing for both boys and girls and considered that they were well supplied with good warm clothing. Both boys and girls are getting a fair training at this institution, as the boys do all the outside work on the farm, in the garden, &c., and the girls receive very good training in household science which should fit them for the home life on the reserve after they leave school. Miss McGarry, the Matron, is a very capable woman and her influence at this institution has certainly been of great benefit to the children.\n\nGENERAL:\u2014\n\nThe cook stove at the school is in poor shape, badly burnt out, and has more or less passed its usefulness, and the Principal is asking that the Department supply him with another stove as soon as this can be arranged. I might say that this is not a case of asking for a stove because the other school received one a short time ago; I looked over the stove myself and realize that it is in bad shape. What would be required would be the same kind as was supplied to St. Mary's School recently.\n\nAs a whole things are quite satisfactory at this institution and I was quite pleased with the progress being made.\nSTAFF:\n\nThe staff at the school, as far as I could ascertain, are all rendering good service.\n\nTrusting this report will be of interest to you,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

St. Paul's Anglican Indian Residential School on the Blood Reserve.\n\nA preliminary inspection of the water supply of the above School was made on the 23rd inst. I also interviewed Canon Middleton, The Pump Engineer, Mr. Pugh, the Indian Agent and Mr. Flett of Cardston, plumber.\n\nA copy of the log of the well which shows the depth, water level, length and size of the different casings used, also size of pump is attached.\n\nIt will be noted that the well was cleaned out in September, 1933, when the piston was removed May 1st, the old leathers were found to be badly worn and new leathers were put on. It has been known for some time that the cylinder is badly worn and when the new leathers were put on, they were loose in the cylinder. A pumping test was carried out which showed the efficiency of the pump to be only 50%.\n\nAs the water goes up and down with the piston, the Engineer is of the opinion that the check valve under the cylinder is loose and not holding the water. This was not replaced on May 1st when piston was removed. The trouble started about Christmas 1933. The St. Mary's Indian School had similar trouble last year. The pump was taken out, and a new cylinder put in. No further trouble has been experienced. The well there is down over 200 ft.\n\nAt the present time there is about 2' of water in the tank and even pumping 18 hrs. per day it is impossible to build up any reserve. The water supply has been cut to the minimum and as a consequence the lawns, shrubs, garden, etc., have suffered. A fire would be disastrous.\n\nRECOMMENDATION.\n\nThat a brass ball type working barrel No. 2460, 3\u00bd x 39\" be ordered at once. When it arrives the pump should be taken out and thoroughly overhauled. Also 20 ft. of 3\" cast pumping pipe threaded 8 to the inch be ordered as well. If the system then fails it will be due to lack of water and this can only be overcome by sinking a new well. The old well cannot be\n\nO.M. Hoover, M.E.,\nEngineer-In-Charge,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nCalgary.\ndeepened.\n\nThe general opinion is that the present well is too shallow.

In regard to this expenditure I wish to state that owing to corroding quality of the water used at this school, and the fact that in the past a new heater had to be supplied several times, it was deemed advisable to have an extra heater on hand and alternate their use every six months in order to have the heater cleaned and checked and save it from splitting.

I received authority sometime ago to have the water tower at St. Mary's School repaired as it was leaking badly, and he informs me that this has been repaired in a very satisfactory manner. He now asks for authority to have the water tower at St. Paul's repaired, and states that the cost will be approximately $35.00.\n\nI would ask that this be allowed and the authority forwarded direct to the Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

The flow of water seemed good at the test made, and it becomes apparent that the working parts of the pump were worn. A further test will be made on this well. Work of a repair nature was started at the Blood R C School, particularly to the water tower which was in bad shape. Other buildings were also undergoing repair as authorized. I noted that at the St. Paul's School, the water tower there was leaking, this no doubt being due to the poor pumping and not sufficient water being carried in the tower, and the upper ribs not sealed. I have sought authority to do some repair work on this tower. At both schools the grounds present a very nice appearance, expenditure being made by both institutions on improvements.\n\n(sgd) J.E.

Engine. This bill of the latter firm is $19.70 but by doing this we did affect the saving of the cost of a new Crankshaft at about $55.00. I have not the Bruch Robinson bill to hand as yet, and therefore not in a position to state the total cost. It will however, exceed the $125.00 under the circumstances, as two days time was absorbed in getting the work done at the Lethbridge Iron Works as the Bruch Robinson man had to take the parts there to fit etc. I will submit direct to Ottawa the accounts unless you further instruct.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Flett, Plumber of Cardston, for changing over the water heater at the St. Paul's Residential School. This expenditure was for the changing over of the water heater as was deemed advisable to do every six months, owing to the corroding quality of the water at that school, and authority was granted by the Department in letter No. 103-1-5, dated March 24th, 1932, to have this done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E.

Indian Residential School on the Blood Reserve to be supplied with a kitchen range and reflooring for one of the dormitories.\n\nAs instructed by the Department, I have been in touch with the Agent for the Gurney Foundry here for a price on the stove and I am in receipt of a letter from the Hall Hardware Company here, their Agents, and a firm on the approved list, and they have submitted a price of $495.00 for the stove, F.O.B. Cardston. This is for a 3-oven No. 13 C.L. John Bull coal range with a warming closet and French Top and one fire box; the same stove that was furnished to St. Mary's School about a year ago and which has given every satisfaction there. The stove is meant to cook for from 150 to 200 people and it is what is required at St. Paul School. I have been able to secure a little better price than that given a year ago as the Gurney Foundry have agreed to supply it at 10% less than they charged for St. Mary's School. Over and above this there will be a few small extras for stove pipes and putting in a new flue in the chimney, &c. I would recommend that this price be accepted as I consider it reasonable for that class of stove.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

This request has been renewed for the past year, but, through lack of funds, purchase of the range was not approved.\n\nThere will be sufficient funds in the Appropriation for Indian Education during the present fiscal year to cover the cost of the range.

The price quoted is $485.00, f.o.b. Cardston, for the supplying of a three-even John Bull coal range, with warming closet, French top and one firebox. This is the type of stove supplied to the R.C.

In this connection I beg to confirm the following telegram to you of today's date:-\n\n\"May incur expense; refuel high pressure boiler, Saint Paul's School.\"\n\nThere has been considerable expenditure incurred at this school during the current fiscal year, and it is now hoped that there will be no further requests, unless an emergency occurs during the balance of the fiscal year. You should arrange to have the new flues placed in the boiler, and the cost should not exceed your estimate. After the work has been completed, please forward an itemized account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost. In connection with any labour employed, the number of days or hours and the rate paid should be stated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nwould put Calgary Power into this school ready for use. I am offering this suggestion from an economic point of view, in that we shall have to expend on this plant now in operation close to $900.00, and I am candidly of the opinion, that as the plant has almost 12 years of operation, that the cost will increase instead of decrease as to upkeep, and my suggestion is placed before you for your consideration.\n\nI would further suggest that if the Department consider this proposal, that the Calgary Power Co. be approached with a view to consolidating rates to the Blood R.C. School, the Agency and the St. Paul's Anglican School, together with the Blood Hospital. The latter using Carston town power, which comes off the Calgary line, and I understand that Carston may drop off the Calgary line, if reduction sought is not met by the company. This suggestion is made as the total load will be the equal of a small village, and I think cheaper rates might be obtained.\n\nThis is submitted for the Department's consideration before the estimates are presented, and purely from an economical viewpoint. In any case authorization of expenditure will have to be incurred if this suggestion is not considered, and the amount involved will be close to $900.00 for the overhaul of plant, repairs and batteries.\n\nI should be glad of the Department's opinion in the matter. I may say in conclusion that the Principal is now desirous of this change, as the present plant is getting very costly from a gas and oil point of view.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI beg to state that recently I was called to the St. Paul's Anglican Indian Residential School in connection with their plant (lighting and pumping), the report being that the generator (Lister plant) was sparking excessively. I proceeded to the school, and made examination of the whole plant, as far as I am able. I found that two or three segments of the commutator on the generator were shorting, and as it looked more or less serious, I moved our generator from the Agency to the school in case of theirs burning, and called in an electrician and had some work done on them, and it will carry them for a time. Eventually however, it will have to be replaced. I also checked over the batteries, and had the electrician check them over, and we find that these will have to be replaced shortly with new ones. Both engines are in need of overhaul, the lighting engine being out week, with loss of compression etc. The water cooling tank was almost done, and the galvanized iron all eaten out at the top. This I had replaced at once as there was a danger of it bursting. The cost of this will be about $30.00.\n\nHaving looked over the whole plant carefully and ascertained known costs of repairs to engines, new batteries, repairs to generator, I discussed the matter with the Principal as to installing Calgary Power Co., and the Church authorities reaction should the Department consider same from an economical point of view. The cost of above repairs etc. would be approximately, engine $200.00; generator repairs around $60.00, or perhaps more if complete rewinding had to be done; new batteries at about $600.00, a foreseen total of $960.00. The batteries apparently last about four to five years, and the engines were overhauled two years ago. Hence I am placing the matter before the Department for their consideration of installing Calgary Power services at this school, the estimate was gotten on the necessary line etc. when the Agency and R.C.School were placed on that Company's line. This was approximately $1000.00 per mile, the distance to the school is two miles. This figure was given in 1930-31, and no doubt revision now would reduce the charge. The cost of moving, installing etc. (quoting cost of the installation at the Blood R.C.School) which included one 5hp and one 4 hp motor, electric, and making all necessary change over from the D.C. to A.C. current, was $78.50. This cost may be less today, and some saving could be made, as the St. Paul's School wiring is built up for change over. I am of the opinion that $2000.00 to $2500.00\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Christianson  \nInspector  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs  \n507 Calgary Public Bldg.  \nCalgary, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: St. Paul School at Cardston\n\nIn reply to your recent inquiry regarding the possibility of supplying the St. Paul School with electric power, we beg to submit the following information.\n\nThis school is located approximately 2 miles from our existing transmission lines but if your Department could guarantee us a yearly revenue of $500.00 for a period of 10 years we would build the line without asking the Department to pay anything toward the construction costs. The energy rates would be similar to those in effect at St. Mary's School, namely:\n\n**COMMERCIAL SERVICE**\n\nA service charge of $2.00 per month for the first 500 watts installed capacity plus 50\u00a2 for each additional 250 watts of installed capacity. Energy rates are as follows:\n\nFor the first 100 hours use of installed capacity - 10\u00a2 per K.W.H.\n\n\" next 100 hours \" \" \" \" - 5\u00a2 \"\n\n\" all over 200 hours \" \" \" \" - 3 1/3\u00a2 \"\n\n**POWER SERVICE** - Service charge of $1.00 per month per K.V.A. (H.P.) of installation. Energy charge as follows:\n\nFor the first 50 K.W.H. used per month per K.V.A. of installation - 5\u00a2 per K.W.H.\n\n\" next 50 K.W.H. \" \" \" \" - 1 1/3\u00a2 per K.W.H.\n\n\" all over 100 K.W.H. \" \" \" \" - 1 2/3\u00a2 \"\n\nThe minimum charge, including the service charge, would be $3.30 gross per month and $3.00 net. A prompt payment discount of 10% on the even dollars of the energy account is allowed for both the Commercial and Power services.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCALGARY POWER COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nOperating Superintendent.\n\nHBL/MM\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 5)\nSir:\n\nI beg to point out that Mr. Pugh, the Indian Agent on the Blood Reserve, wrote to the Department on the 15th instant setting out that the two engines at St. Paul's School were pretty well worn out and that it would cost approximately $900.00 to repair them, &c., stating that the only alternative would be to have the school hooked up with the Calgary Power Company's lines. Mr. Pugh furnished me with a copy of this letter.\n\nYesterday I was talking to Mr. Sherman, the Operating Superintendent of the Calgary Power Company, and in the course of our conversation I mentioned this matter to him and he informed me he would be pleased to look into it and give me a price on the cost of supplying electric energy from their lines to the school, &c. I am herewith forwarding his letter to me, setting out that in building the two miles of line they would not expect the Department to furnish any funds for this provided an annual revenue of $500.00 is guaranteed by the Department for 10 years. I might say that according to the cost at the other schools the bill would come to much more than $500 per year. They informed me that St. Mary's School, who would use practically the same energy as St. Paul's, pay between $600.00 and $900.00 per year. I might point out that should the school be connected up with the Calgary Power Company line, two motors would have to be supplied as Mr. Pugh points out in his letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta., January 27th, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to state that on a recent visit to the St. Paul's Anglican School, my attention was called to the condition of the bake oven, which I examined at that time.\n\nI find that the complete fire box, together with the ducts, are burnt out, and will require complete replacement, as it is now useless for baking in the present condition. I have ascertained the costs of these parts, which is $79.00 F.O.B. Winnipeg. To this cost must be added the freight and labour of installation, and the approximate cost of these are as follows: Freight Winnipeg to Cardston, 400 lbs. @ 2.13, $8.52, labour of installation, $20.00.\n\nOne other item was called to my attention, and that was the back lining of the cook range, this was burnt through and in two pieces, and in order to prevent the oven side being burnt, I ordered this part at a cost of $9.55. No action has been taken on the bake oven pending authority or otherwise for the cost quoted above, which totals $107.52.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.F.

E. Indian Residential School. In this connection I beg to confirm the following night lettergram to you of today's date:\n\n\"Replying your telegram, Department approves installation light and power by Calgary Power Company, Saint Paul's School, per terms outlined, letter to you from Operating Superintendent, attached with letter. Definitely understand school authorities responsible payment current costs energy supplied. Arrange with Company commence work installing power lines and you may incur expenditure purchase motors and making change over from present system. Keep costs low as possible.\"\n\nIt is understood that the Power Company will build the line from their existing transmission lines to the school, without any charge to the Department for construction costs, and that the school authorities have agreed to accept payment of costs of energy supplied to a minimum amount of $500.00 per annum. In a communication from Mr. Agent Pugh, he stated it would require that the Department supply one 5 h. p. and one 1/4 h. p. electric motor and also certain costs in making the change over from the present system. As instructed in telegram above referred to, you may arrange for the purchase of the above mentioned items in triplicate, covering the costs. The Department will also pay any other expenses in making the change over to the present system. It is understood that the Power Company can install the lines and make the change over in about 18 days. It is hoped that the cost to the Department can be kept within the sum of $500, as our funds are extremely limited. If possible, the cost should be lower than this amount. After the work has been completed, please forward all accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure. The Department would like to receive the accounts before the end of the present fiscal year.\n\nMr. Agent Pugh suggested that the Calgary Power Company be approached, with a view to lowering rates to the\n\n- Blood R.

I had this engine looked over by the mechanic who went down from here, and he informs me that this is an excellent engine, and could be put in first class shape for approximately $150.00 or $200.00. It is a 6 K.W. Lister Bruston Automatic.\n\nIf an engine of this kind is needed at any of the other Departmental Schools it is now available for transfer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, March 18, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 402-11A C.E. of the 12th instant, informing the Department that the St. Paul's Indian Residential School has now been connected up with the Calgary Power Company's lines and that there is now, surplus to requirements, the Lister Brunston engine. The Department is not aware, at the present time, of any of the other residential schools requiring this equipment, and I would request that the school authorities arrange to store same, until such time as it may be possible to have it sent to another school. We have no funds available at present to overhaul the engine and place it in good condition.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM.

I now find that it is costing us a little over $600.00, and this includes the two motors and many other things too numerous to mention. When this came up I was under the impression that the electrician in Cardston would be able to do the work, but Mr. Pugh advised me that the man down there would not take it on as he did not consider he had sufficient knowledge of the work. It was necessary to send workmen down from Calgary, and they took the material down with them on a truck, and when they got there they got in touch with Mr. Pugh and proceeded with the work. As you know, Mr. Pugh is quite a mechanic and very practical, and nothing has been supplied but what was absolutely necessary. He has reported to me that the work was done in a very satisfactory manner, and that the system is in A.1 shape.\n\nI am also forwarding a voucher for $13.70 in favour of Mr. E. Gardner-Smith. At the time this was arranged I was up at Hobbema and I had to get Mr. Gardner-Smith to get prices and make arrangements with Wilkinson's, &c.

Indian Residential Schools of this Agency, that due to unforeseen weather conditions, the labour portion of this allotment, which will amount to $222.00, or $11.00 on each tower, has not been carried out. I now wish to ask if the Department can carry this item over into the coming Fiscal Year, until such times that the two towers can be completed?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E.

(RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 5)\nOttawa, April 2nd, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your 402-11 R.C. of the 27th ultimo, the Department regrets that the water towers at the St. Paul's C.E. and the Blood R.C. Indian Residential Schools were not painted during the last fiscal year. Funds were available for that purpose. However, it is noted from your letter that the material for both schools is now on hand and you may arrange for the necessary work. It is further noted that the cost of the labour will be $111.00 at each school.\n\nThere are certain funds available for repairs at each of these schools in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1936-37 and the Department will write you further about this matter next month. It should be understood, however, that the amount being authorized in this letter for painting the towers will have to be taken out of the amount provided for repairs and improvements in the current year's appropriation. Our funds are so limited that it will not be possible to consider allowing any amount over and above the appropriation.\n\nWhen submitting accounts for the labour in painting the water towers, a separate voucher should be submitted for each school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

E. Indian Residential School on the Blood Reserve:\n\nThe buildings are in a fair state of repair and apparently well taken care of in every way. The furnishings are well arranged and in good order.\n\nThe Department will recall that the machinery at this institution went out of order during the winter and arrangements were made with the Calgary Power Company to connect it up with their power line. The old engines are no longer in use, and pumping, etc., is now done by electricity. The boilers are in good working order as they were fixed up during the winter.\n\nIt was brought to my attention that the cement between the bricks was beginning to crumble away and that it would be necessary to point the brick-work. This was provided for in the estimates. The roof of the main building also requires painting whenever funds are available, and provision was made for this expenditure in the estimates. The outbuildings also require painting, but this was not provided for. We furnished the school with some paint.\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6372, file 764-5, part 6)\nlast year for interior decorating, and the work was done by the Staff. Canon Middleton informed me that if an additional amount was supplied this year the Staff would again do the painting inside.\n\nThe grounds around the school are in good shape and considerable work has been done by Canon Middleton and his staff in beautifying them.\n\nThe health of the children has been very good this last winter and they all looked fairly well. The only thing that was brought to my attention was that the epidemic of Measles there sometime ago had left the children with weak eyes, which very often happens with that disease. Doctor Wall will be there shortly, I believe, and he will go into this matter.\n\nI found that the children were furnished with ample clothing and in checking up on the meals I found they were very well fed.\n\nFarming:\u2014 Farming was more or less of a failure last year owing to the drought, but the School is seeding approximately 200 acres this spring, and the work was well under way when I was there. They also have a good garden, and as a rule raise sufficient potatoes and garden truck for their own use. They have quite a number of cattle and horses, and have a total of 40 cows, 21 of which were being milked at the time of my visit, which supplies them with milk and cream, and they also make butter.\n\nTraining of Children:\u2014\n\nThe Provincial School Inspector inspected this school a short time ago and he remarked that\nit would be of great benefit to engage another teacher. I discussed this with Canon Middleton and he informed me that several of the children from the junior room, which was overcrowded, would be advanced to the senior room this spring, which will take care of the situation and that the matter would adjust itself, as he stated the commission would not sanction the appointment of another teacher.\n\nAs far as the academic work in this school is concerned, I would say this is very satisfactory and that the children are getting a good education in the classroom. I am, however, of the opinion that the farm work might be better done and the boys given a better training in this respect. I am not in a position to say very much about this as the land was just being plowed and harrowed, but their returns from farming operations have not been as good as they should have been. I shall go into this matter the next time I visit the reserve, which will be during the summer, and see how the work is performed. The girls receive a very good training, and as a whole I would say the school is doing very good work.\n\nThe Staff consists of the Principal and 6 other male members, and 5 lady members \u2014 a total of 15. The Department know that Canon Middleton's daughter is on the teaching staff, and his son is acting as Farming Instructor. Probably this will work out well, but personally I am never enthusiastic over such a family arrangement.\n\nThe Staff all seem to be doing satisfactory work and they are very busy.\nIn conclusion I wish to point out that I would recommend that $125.00 be authorized for interior decorating, and if the painting of the roof of the main building and the pointing can be allowed, this work is necessary as soon as funds can be provided. Authority for whatever work is to be allowed might be sent either to Mr. Pugh or myself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, May 28, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 402-11A C.E. of the 13th instant, reporting on your inspection of the St. Paul's C. E. Indian Residential School. It is noted that conditions, generally, at this school are satisfactory, with regard to the care of the buildings, the health of the children, the food supplied and classroom work.\n\nRegarding the repairs and painting, as mentioned in your report, I would say, for the information of the Agent and yourself, that the following amounts have been provided for this school in the appropriation for the current fiscal year:\n\n- Painting roof, main building - $350.00\n- Interior painting, main building - $200.00\n- Repairs, two boilers - $175.00\n- Fencing material - $150.00\n- Miscellaneous - $225.00\n\nYou or the Agent may arrange for the purchase of the quantity of paint required to paint the roof of the main building and the additional amount of paint necessary to complete the interior decorating. It is noted the school staff would do the work in connection with the interior painting. You may arrange, also, for the pointing of the brickwork of the main building. The Department will leave the matter in the hands of yourself and the Agent to have the above work carried out.\n\nThe amount as mentioned above is the full expenditure.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of the Department's letter No. 103-1-5 of the 28th ultimo in connection with my report on St. Paul's C. E. Indian Residential School on the Blood Reserve, and to state that the amounts that have been allowed by the Department for painting, &c., are very acceptable, and I appreciate the matter having been left in the hands of the Agent and myself.\n\nI might say the repairs to the boilers were carried out last winter and the expenditure of $175.00 will not be necessary.\n\nI was down at the Bloods this week when this matter was discussed, and the necessary steps will be taken in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nI beg to state that I was called to the St. Paul's Anglican School with regard to the 5 h.p. motor installed at that school, and I found that the pulley for driving the line shaft and pump was badly burned, and of no further use.\n\nI accordingly have ordered another pulley, increasing the size slightly from a 3\" diam., 4\u00bd\" face, to one of 5\" diameter and with 6\" face, and of a different type.\n\nI was of the opinion that belt slipping was the cause, and warned the Principal and Engineer with regard to the adjustment of belts, when washing, as I am of the opinion that by careful watch being kept on wash days, when the extractor (which pulls hard to start) and other laundry machines are on the line shaft, that this could be avoided. There is plenty of adjustment allowed on the motor to tighten up the belt.\n\nI am not at the moment aware of the cost, but this should not exceed, with labour entailed, $15.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E.

I had as intimated thought of having Indians do this labor, but on Wednesday morning last, Mr. Pilling of Cardston, who is on the approved list, called at this Office, and advised me that he would like to do this work, and his services had been approved by the Local Committee, I therefore sent him to the School to give me a bid on this job.\n\nI am enclosing herewith his bid, together with Messrs Mc Clung's bid, the latter now refusing to do the work, because of some difference with the Local Committee. It will be noted that the cost for labor if Mr. Pilling's services are procured will be $150.00, and I am informed that due to the extreme dryness of the roof that it will take about 150 Gallons of material to complete the work. The total cost would then be Material $195.00 Labor at Mr. Pilling's bid $150.00 approximately $345.00.\n\nIn regard to the Indian Labor, I discussed this with the Principal and it is agreed that some risk is attached in painting this roof, and he would personally prefer not to have the risk taken.\n\nIn view of the facts that the matter is in the hands of the Local Committee, I deemed it advisable to submit the matter for your decision before proceeding with the work. If this meets with approval, would the Department kindly wire me instructions, as I am anxious to complete the work this month.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nJ.E.

The condition of the porch is bad, the plaster is all down, and will require plastering and also repairs to the galvanized roof, the cost of which would be $40.00. On the steps which are well broken down on the treads, and are dangerous, and require refacing, taking off the old tread which apparently was trowelled on about 1/2\" thick and is shelling off. The cost of this would be about $35.00.\n\nWill you kindly seek authorization for this work from the Department if, of course, they have funds available. I may say that in talking this matter over with the Principal, I mentioned that there was an allowance for fencing, and that this work, if allowed, might be charged to that appropriation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"JOHN E.

No children being in school this month. At the St Paul's Anglican School, paint was provided for the school and the labor of painting being done by the staff. Brick work pointing was done on all the windows, doors and coping stones on the roof. Roof painting was not carried out, the matter being placed before the Department regarding the labor entailed in the work. At the Blood R.C. school, their repairs were looked over and the matter referred to the department, and the work necessary and authorized is now being proceeded with. Crops at both schools was very poor, averaging about 4 bushels to the acre. The potatoe crops were also useless and they will be faced with purchases in both flour and potatoes.\n\nJ. E.

The cost of the jack will be charged against the amount provided in next year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. E.

Necessary replace at cost of three hundred fifty dollars. Replacement present account low water supply. Please advise.\"\n\nIn this connection I wish to state that I was called by the Principal a week ago by phone, and he advised me at that time that the pump jack was making a grating noise. This I presumed to be the gears, and said so, and advised that the Engineer keep his eye on the jack, and I would visit the school. Friday last I called at the school in response to a phone message, stating that the jack had broken down. On enquiry it was found that a key in the big gear on the left side had come out, and consequently, the pinion teeth had been broken out, three in number, the pitman arm broken, and the pins in the cross head snapped off and other minor breakages.\n\nRepairs were made to the main frame some time ago, which was broken, due to loose gears and consequent wearing of keys, and the school paid for the welding job. I found that they had only around 1500 gals. of water in the tank, and it was therefore necessary to make temporary repairs, but this will not stand up very long, and I, therefore, advised the Department of that condition, seeking replacement with a new jack.\n\nThis jack has been in use for thirteen years, but due to breakages, with subsequent repairs, it is now almost unfit for use. This recommendation would not be made unless it was considered necessary.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Several radiators also leaking, and I am having an estimate made as to cost of repairs for these.\n\nAt this school, Xmas. festivities were held for all pupils and parents. Two truants were taken care of during the month, from this school and were returned by the parents the day following their truancy.\n\nJ.K. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta., January 13th, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to report further to my night letter of the 11th, regarding the repair and replacement of heating radiators in the water tower at the St. Paul's Anglican School, that I find that the breakage in this was discovered on the morning of the 11th, and I find that the Engineer had resigned and left the school that morning and I, therefore, had no chance to question him regarding this breakage.\n\nOn enquiry however from the Principal, I find that about two weeks ago, during a very cold spell of 20\u00b0 below zero, that the Engineer found it necessary to refill the boilers, which would indicate that the radiators had been frozen during this cold spell, and with the mild weather since prevailing, there has been no heat used in the tower till the 10th - 11th, when a bad storm struck and it turned cold, and it was then that one of the employees went up into the tower to find the radiators all cracked and leaking. I may say that every fall I telephone both schools to see that the steam is put up into the towers before cold weather sets in, to prevent an occurrence of this nature, and in my opinion steam has been turned on too late, in other words, when there was too much frost, with consequent cracking.\n\nAs instructed, I have requested the local Plumber, Mr. F.W.Flett, who is on the \"Approved list\" to make the necessary repairs at a cost of $65.00 for radiator repairs. We may, however, find that the supply line is frozen, and if such is the case, the information will be sent forward at once. We cannot ascertain this latter until the radiator section is repaired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Pant.

The firebox lining burned out badly and will require a new set of linings as per requisition. Cost given in estimate by Cardston Implement Co., Cardston, (Approved list) $27.50.\n\n2/ Bake oven. This also requires new linings and tinsmith repairs, and the cost of repairs in this case is given by Mr. F.W. Flett, Tinsmith and Plumber of Cardston (Approved list) at $30.00 to cover material and labour. Mr. Flett's remarks in this case are that this will only be a temporary job, as he is of the opinion that it is too light for the amount of baking done.\n\n3/ Radiators. Three (3) of these are broken and have been since last Winter it appears, and are situated in the following places in the building:- Dairy, stock room and boys' intermediate dormitory.\n\nThey are beyond repair, and will require re-placement, and the estimated cost of new radiators and installation is quoted by Mr. Flett at $130.00. Fortunately we have not had many severe cold spells and they have been shut off. However, in severe weather they will be a necessity.\n\nI have, I may say, just received an account from Mr. F.W. Flett for several items of work and material supplied to this school, described as follows: 1 1/8\" sink trap 1 - 3/3\" N.P. self closing stop cock, both at a cost of $7.50, and an account is being submitted for these items. I took the matter of these recurring items up with the Principal, with a view to avoidance, and I am informed that the school authorities themselves have taken care of an account for plumbing material etc. to the value of, approximately, $80.00.\n\nRequisitions are attached herewith.\n\nC.

It is thought that the brass cases are in good condition, though on examination found to be stiff in action. These have been in the building for 12 years.\n\nChecked over the fire hose, eight sets, and I have asked that these be taken down and water put through them. From my observation, I am of the opinion that all this hose will require replacing. Further report on this when tests made.\n\nIn the matter of fire escape in this building, the top floor, which is occupied by senior boys and girls, there is no fire escape. This stops on the third floor. In case of fire, these children would have to go down the main staircase to the next floor and then on to escape. In my opinion this is dangerous.\n\nEscapes should be provided from this top floor to roof of kitchen on south side and on to laundry on the north end.\n\nI also note that the drop off at this school is similar to that at the Blood R.C.

(Approved list).\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta., Feb. 28th, 1938.\n\nREPORT FOR MONTH OF FEBRUARY 1938.\n\nOn checking over various matters called to my attention by the principal of the St Paul's school, only one was dealt with at once that of Belts for the laundry plant, and I authorized the purchase of the following belting; 16 feet of 1\u00bd\", 16' of 2\" and 24 feet of 4\", all the belts were in a dangerous condition, being badly worn, the cost will be noted on the St Paul's school returns. This purchase was deemed advisable without waiting for authority as there is a danger where the staff and girls in the laundry are working, and I trust the department will concur in my action.\n\nJ.

Except for the odd truant at the Anglican school, attendance was full at both schools. Examinations occupied the last two weeks of the term. St Paul's school had two or three pupils taking their exams, at the Cardston High school in the Higher grades.\n\nAttendance was made at both schools on the last two Sundays of the month, at the prize giving. Both schools well attended by the parents for the occasions.\n\nRepair work had to be carried out at the Anglican School on the Pump, taking out the rods and leathers, the latter we had to change and I note that the brass valve is badly worn, and will before long have to be renewed.\n\nBoth schools dismissed their pupils on the 26th June for the summer holidays, except for a number of girls over the age of 14 years, whom they have retained. I suggested to the principals, that in view of new regulations regarding holidays, I thought it advisable to let all children go, and place the responsibility on the parents of the older girls.\n\nAll boilers at both schools have been inspected by the Prov. Gov. Boiler Inspector.\n\nJ. E. Pugh\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 12, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI note from your June report that you have found it necessary to authorize repair work on the pump at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School.\n\nFor your information, I may say that, in the current year's appropriation, we provided an amount of $500.00 for repairs, improvements and purchase of new material at this school. We have already authorized $43.80 for fire hose and equipment and, in addition, there will be the cost of the repair work to the pump. These two amounts are, of course, charged against the sum provided and the balance will be available if there are other repairs or improvements that you consider necessary. In that event, you should let me have full particulars, and, if the materials cost over $50.00, it will be necessary for you to forward detailed information in order that purchase may be made through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nJ.

MacInnes,\nActing Director.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta., August 24th, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to state that due to the breaking of the pump rods in the deep well at the St. Paul's Anglican Indian Residential School, Blood Indian Reserve, and as a consequence, it will be necessary to replace approximately 100 feet of pump rod.\n\nThe cost will be kept as low as is consistent, in view of the fact that it means pulling up the piping to get the cylinder and broken end of rod out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nAt the St. Paul's Anglican School, there have been some unforeseen repairs to purchase. A pulley for the pumping motor, cost of which will be about $4.50. I am also informed now that a drive gear on the New Pump head purchased last year has had to be taken off and one off the old head put back to service, due to loose key and set screw. This has not been checked over. I am also informed that the Water Jacket heater of which we have always had two, one in use and one being cleaned, has split, and a replacement of this will be necessary. I have not made any inspection since the opening of the School, but these items will be looked into when I visit the school next and report made. Authorized work, chiefly plumbing at the St. Paul's Anglican School has been carried out the latter part of the month, and the accounts covering this work will be assembled and submitted as soon as possible.\n\nJ.

I would point out, however, that our funds are quite limited and you should not incur any further expenditure at either of the Residential Schools in your Agency without first obtaining authority.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nCardston, Alta., Nov. 30th, 1938.\n\nREPORT ON BLOOD AGENCY FOR MONTH OF NOVEMBER 1938.\n\nA great deal of trouble has been experienced at the St Paul's school with the 5 H.P. motor for pumping and laundry line, and has had to be taken out several times for repair and adjustment. The pump has also been a source of trouble this summer, with breakage of varying parts, and is a source of worry generally.\n\nAll the work authorized at this school has now been completed and accounts for this are now being sent forward. I note from the Boiler Inspector's report that some work is needed on the High pressure boiler and heating boilers, this being, bending of flues, and I have asked the local plumber Mr. Flett to carry out this work.\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nExtract from Inspector Schmidt's report on the St. Paul's Indian Residential School dated November 23, 1938:\n\nBUILDING:\n\nThe school building is kept clean and in good repair. The outer buildings are properly cared for.\n\nI noticed on opening a tap at one of the wash-basins that the air-pressure was exceptionally strong. I am afraid this is caused by the hard water, a certain amount of corrosion forming inside the pipes, which reduces the water flow and causes the air pressure to be too strong. I would suggest having this checked over; also the steam boilers, to ascertain whether there is not some damage being caused through the system generally, by the water now in use.\n\n(Sgd.) C. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your report of the 23rd ultimo regarding your inspection of the St. Paul's Indian residential school the Department agrees that it would be advisable to have someone check over the water system and the steam boilers at the school with a view to ascertaining the cause of the air pressure in the pipes.\n\nWhen you obtain this report you should forward it for our consideration.

We have not been successful up this AM, and I now intend to set up a steam line to the supply pipe and try blowing out in that way. Every effort is being made to get the line thawed, but as I have entailed some expense, I thought it advisable to inform the Department. I cannot say what the cost will be, but will endeavour to keep the cost as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E.

The heater will not be supplied until after April 1.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta., February 17th, 1939.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to state, further to my letter No. 402-ll C.E., of the 8th instant, that further investigation into this matter of water tank damage at St. Paul's Anglican School reveals two splits in the riser pipe of this tank, and it became necessary to strip down the boxed casing of the water riser and steam pipe casing up to the tower, and this revealed the condition referred to above. I noted that all the hair and insulating material had broken off the pipes and washed down to the bottom of the casing.\n\nIt now becomes necessary to do the following work:\n\n1. Weld riser supply pipe.\n2. Re-wrap with new insulating material the riser pipe and steam pipes.\n3. Re-case with inside boards and rubberoid paper the boxed casing, and as a matter of better protection, to line the both sides of the boxed casing with zinc or tin, this to prevent water going into this casing and to keep out the wind, as the wood shiplap shrinks and eventually lets in the cold winds of Winter as it was due to the leaking water from the tower and the open cracks in the casing that frost struck the bare pipe with consequent freezing and splitting.\n\nI will make every effort, as stated in my previous letter, to keep the cost as low as is consistent with the big job that has now presented itself.\n\nI think I can suggest that this cost be carried over till your new Fiscal Year, as I feel sure Mr. Plett (approved list), who is doing the work will wait till after April 1st next.\n\nOn the completion of this work, I will further report in a general way on other work to be done on this tower, which will also entail considerable expense.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E.

It is expected, of course, that the cost will be kept as low as possible. Payment cannot be made until after the first of April as funds in the current year's appropriation are practically all assigned.\n\nFor your information I may say that in preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1939-40 it was only found possible to include an amount of $350.00 for repairs and improvements at the St. Paul's school and the same amount at the Blood school.\n\nThe cost of the repairs to the water tower at the St. Paul's school will have to be charged against the amount provided in the 1939-40 appropriation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

The tank due to the breakdowns of late has dried out and it is not possible to get the tank full as there is considerable leakage over the halfway mark, and during the holidays it may be necessary to do some repair work on the tank.\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith Voucher No. 53, amounting to $320.62, in favour of Mr. F.W. Flatt (Approved List) of Carstairs, for material and labour on the St. Paul's School water tower, when that unit was badly damaged by freezing last Winter, as referred to in my letter of February 17th last.\n\nI may say that while the account exceeds a little my expectation, unforeseen damage and the difficulty of performing this labour, and the material involved to ensure a lasting job, has set the cost somewhat high, but I feel sure that the pipe system to the tank will last quite a few years.\n\nIt may be necessary to do some repair work to the tank itself, as the wooden staves at the top of the tank are quite wide from drying out, and it will only hold water to the half way mark.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is operated by the Anglican church with Rev. Canon Middleton the principal. Visitors at Cardston for the stampede this week would find much interest on the reserve, including St. Paul's and St. Mary's school, the latter operated by the Roman Catholic church, and the modern hospital.\n\nIndian Affairs.

BAILEY\n\nI have your memorandum of the 19th instant with reference to the expenditure incurred in repairing the water tower at the St. Paul's Indian residential school.\n\nThere is a large water tank at this school and the Indian Agent reported in a letter dated February 17, 1939, that an examination of the tank revealed two splits in the riser pipe of the tank. It was, therefore, necessary to strip down the boxed casing of the water riser and steam pipe casing up to the tower. When this was done it was noted that all the hair and insulation material had broken off the pipes and washed down to the bottom of the casing. It was, therefore, necessary to do the following work:\n\n1. Weld riser supply pipe.\n\n2. Re-wrap with new insulating material the riser pipe and steam pipes.\n\n3. Re-case with inside boards and rubberoid paper the boxed casing, and as a matter of better protection, to line the both sides of the boxed casing with zinc or tin, this to prevent water going into this casing and to keep out the wind, as the wood shiplap shrinks and eventually lets in the cold winds of winter as it was due to the leaking water from the tower and the open cracks that frost struck the bare pipe with consequent freezing and splitting.\nAt the time the Agent wrote there were no funds available for the work but as the school was dependent on the proper condition of the tank for their water it was necessary to authorize the Agent to proceed and forward the account for payment from funds provided in the current year's appropriation. I might add that when forwarding the account on June 31 last Indian Agent Pugh wrote as follows:\n\n\"While the account exceeds a little my expectation, unforeseen damage and the difficulty of performing this labour and the material involved to ensure a lasting job has set the cost somewhat high but I feel sure that the pipe system to the tank will last quite a few years.\"\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSupplies mentioned hereunder have been received and found satisfactory with exception of those listed under \"Remarks.\"\n\n| Quantity | DESCRIPTION                                                                 | UNIT | TOTAL   |\n|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|---------|\n|          | **Emergency Purchase - Blood Agency**                                       |      |         |\n|          | Labour and material for repairing water line from water tower to building, damaged by frost, at the St. Paul's Residential School as per invoice of May 31st, 1939 - voucher No. 83 - June 31, 1939. |      | $329.62 |\n\n**WELFARE DIVISION**\n\n**IN THE PRESENCE OF**\n\n**JUL 28 1939**\n\n---\n\n**Shipping Instructions**\n\n- Work already performed\n\n**Vote:** 76  \n**Allot.

The local plumber and tinsmith advised against any repairs, stating that it was useless. I however had the two side warming closets taken out, and both were burned through. I therefore had these remade at the Lethbridge Iron Works and had them made of heavier iron, at a cost of $7.00. This I considered the best manner to provide the school with the essential baking requirements, and save the cost of purchasing a new bake oven at this time. I feel that this oven will last for a few years now. I may say that under my instructions I had the school do the necessary labour in taking the oven apart and replacing the worn side warming closets. I had these photographed and such are available to the department should they desire them.\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

I, however, personally had the chimney taken down and found both boxes burnt out, and as they cost to make two new boxes, I found that the Lethbridge Iron Works were the only people I could get to do the job, at a cost of $27.00, and it is considered that by doing this, we are putting the bake oven in shape for two or three years more, and avoiding the cost of a new oven, or of having the school purchase 150 loaves of bread per day. The school provide the labour on the work of taking down and re-assembling.

An endeavour is being made to include an item for this purpose in the estimates for 1940-41.

Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the ever increasing demands and growing population of the Reserve, the officials of our Church have decided to further augment the School Staff by the appointment of a well trained and qualified Deaconess, whose sole duty will be to visit and minister to our Anglican Indians on the Reserve.\n\nFurther, Inspector Hamilton, during his recent visit and inspection of the Academic work, strongly recommended our engaging an additional teacher for Class Room duty. With the acceptance of the Deaconess, and the similar acceptance and appointment of another teacher in order to cope with the influx of additional students, we shall need more bedrooms in the school than we now possess.\n\nYou will recall that we discussed this probability when you were here last week, and on that occasion, I suggested the provision of two additional Staff rooms at convenient and suitable positions in the main building.\n\nFirstly, it is obvious that there two rooms must be provided without delay.\n\nSecondly, the rooms indicated should be at convenient points, where the least possible space be utilized to the best effect.\n\nWith that purpose in mind, I sought with your approval the assistance of two local firms to submit estimates for the erection and completion of the necessary quarters.\n\nI am pleased to enclose herewith copies of the estimates now received. These have been carefully checked and examined and both come within the scope of efficient service.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6373, file 764-5, part 7)\nI therefore beg to recommend that the estimates be accepted, and that you submit same to the Department with your approval.\n\nI am sure you will agree that with the pressing demands for future development, and barely in order to cope with present emergencies, that it is imperative that suitable and adequate quarters be provided for the increase in personnel of the School Staff. As matters now stand we have no available bedrooms for these two additional workers.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nS.H. Middleton\nPrincipal.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nResidential School,\nAlta., May 16th, 1940.\n\nMAY 20 1940\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to state that the Principal of St. Paul's Anglican Indian Residential School has taken up with me the matter of providing additional staff rooms at this school, and in this connection I am enclosing a copy of his letter.\n\nIn order that the Department may deal with the matter, I have obtained estimates based on the enclosed plans, and it will be noted from the plans, that the changes, or new work, are proposed for the second and top floors of the building.\n\nOn the second floor, the plan provides for a partition, and changing a wall in an existing toilet room, and extending this toilet room to accommodate a toilet for the dormitory and one for the staff room. A wash basin in the proposed room is required. The estimated cost of Carpenter work and material for this change is as follows:- Material $45.00, Labour $77.90, and for changes and additional plumbing, the estimated cost is $150.00, inclusive of material and labour.\n\nOn the top floor, the plan provides for making two rooms, and bath installation, and the estimated cost of Carpenter work is as follows:- Material $76.50, labour $37.50, and for provision of bath, the estimated cost is $114.00.\n\nThe total of this work would be $500.00. The estimates were provided by Mr. T.E.Weston for carpenter work and material, and Mr. F.W.Flett for plumbing fixtures and labour.\n\nFor the information of the Department, I am quoting herewith the number of staff employed at this school, and to this total should be added the extra teacher as mentioned in the Principal's letter, who will be taken on the staff in the Fall; Males, white, two males, Indians, two, females, eleven, a total of fifteen resident in the school building proper; Mr. Charles Middleton, who is now designated as the Assistant Principal, is occupying the Farm Instructor's house, and is married with a family.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E.Fugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nMay 23, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 16th instant with reference to providing additional staff rooms at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School.\n\nIn view of the National crisis at present confronting us there is not a remote possibility, at the present time, of securing the funds that would be required to make the changes suggested by the Rev. Principal of this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to state that I have recently checked over certain of the equipment at the St. Paul's Anglican Indian Residential School, which is in need of repair or replacement.\n\nThese are enumerated as follows with the approximate cost:\n\n1/ High Pressure Laundry Boiler. Top flues require rebeading and the top sheet requires welding. Approximate cost, $25.00.\n\n2/ Stock watering pump. New jack required as present one is completely worn out. Cost approximately $16.00.\n\n3/ Gurney Oxford Kitchen Range. Right and left sides of fire box castings. Present ones burnt out. Cost approximately $28.00.\n\n4/ My attention is also directed to the water tower at this school, which I note is only holding about half its capacity of water, due to the staves spreading and permitting leaking.\n\nIt would appear to me that the only remedy would be to apply a waterproof membrane paint coating on the inside.\n\nI have not obtained an estimate on this work, but will do so if the Department would consider this work.\n\nIn view of the curtailment of operating costs, I am submitting this report and would recommend at this time Nos. 1, 2 and 3.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n402-11C.F.\n\nOttawa, July 9, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, the following expenditures are approved at the St. Paul's (C.E.) Indian Residential School:\n\n1. Repairs to high pressure laundry boiler - $25.00\n2. New jack for stock watering pump - $16.00\n3. New castings for kitchen range - $28.00\n\nIf it will not involve too much trouble, you might let me have an estimate of the cost of lining the water tower with waterproof membrane paint. However, I am extremely doubtful at the present time if funds can be provided for the purpose.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J. E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alberta.\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta.,\nJuly 29th 1940.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to state further to my Letter No. 402-11CE of the 3rd instant and to your reply, Letter No. 103-1-5 of the 9th instant, re repairs to the High Pressure Laundry Boiler at The St Paul's Anglican School at a cost of $25.00, that when carrying out the repairs as authorized, Mr. Flette, the local Plumber, found that on completion of beading the tubes and welding the top sheet, that the tubes leaked on test on the inside and in several places, and as these cannot be repaired it will be necessary to either re-flue at a cost of approximately $90.00 to $100.00, or replace this boiler at a cost of approximately $110.00.\n\nIn the interest of economy, I have called the Boiler Inspector and he advises that it will stand re-fluing, and I have arranged that he check it over when delivered in Lethbridge at The Iron Works there, and I now seek authority to carry out this work at the cost mentioned above.\n\nMay I respectfully ask for this authority by Air Mail.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E.

E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent,\nCardston, Alta.\nSCHOOLS.\n\nBoth schools closed for the month. A check over of the equipment at St Paul's Anglican was made at the request of the Vice Principal and these were dealt with under separate letter. The jacket heaters at this school have also burst, due to the water condition as usual and I have had them sent in for welding, which will I think carry them for sometime. The HP boiler repairs were commenced but held up, and the department advised by letter of its condition. Pump jack as authorized by the Dept. was ordered.\n\nJ.E.

Towards the end of the month the Well at the Blood R C School stopped pumping water, and the tank with the water supply diminishing fast, I advised the Principal to allow the Children to go home until the well had been cleaned out, at the time of writing Authority has been received, to clear the sand out of both the Blood R C School and St Paul's School wells, both of which fill up with sand. At present the St Paul's School are getting enough water for their school needs. As soon as these wells have been cleaned reports will be sent forward under separate cover.\n\nAnthony M.

The main item is the extractor which is in very bad shape, and needs a complete inside (new), the outside of the Extractor is in good shape, but the portion which revolves is the inside is in very poor shape, and Mr Flett Plumber Cardston who accomplished me advises that it is dangerous and may break while in use and portions of it may cause a fatal accident amongst the girls while working in the Laundry.\n\nAs this extractor is supplied by the Beaver Laundry Machinery Co Toronto, I thought that if authority is granted for this replacement of the Extractor it could be ordered through our Ottawa Office quicker than writing and getting quotations through this Office. This Extractor is Beaver Laundry Extraxtor Type 244 serial 461. The type figures are badly worn and may not be correct but the serial Number was quite plain. May I be advised if this purchase is being made as early as possible.\n\nThe other item is the belting running the main pulley and the belting running the extractor, both these belts are in very bad condition and have been repaired numerous times, one of them having been joined together seven times and is badly worn.\n\nI have asked a quotation from Cardston Motors on the two belts as follows.\n\n1 Belt 4\u00bd\" 24 feet long, for 30\" Pulley\n1 Belt 3\" 15 feet long for extractor.\n\nTheir prices for the two belts is $17.00 subject to change.\n\nMay I be advised if I May make this purchase through the Cardston Motors at the above quotation.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nSecretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources.\nOttawa.\n\nClerk in Charge,\n\nIndian Affairs.

There are no funds available at the present time for the purchase of a new oven but we wish to have the information on file in order that provision may be made for its purchase when preparing the estimates for the fiscal year 1942-43. At the present time I cannot definitely promise that the amount required will be included in the estimates for that year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A.

Flett) advises that these Tanks may be hard to procure but that as he handles the R.C.A.F. Airport contracts, he might be able to get one should the Department decide to purchase same.\n\nThis Tank, in its present state is very apt to give way at any time and an emergency would arise which would take time to rectify. I am therefore bringing the matter to the attention of the Department so that this possibility may be forestalled.\n\nMay I have the Department's instructions regarding a replacement? This is a 500 gal. Hot Water Tank, type B 468 of Craner Limited, when taken down it may also necessitate the replacement of the Steam Coil.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nT.R.L.

This has been done by Mr. Flett of Cardston.\n\nI recommend that authority be granted to renew this tank immediately, because it leaks (drips) from several small holes, and an emergency may arise any day.

A few repairs are needed here and there.\n\nRain, sleet and snow, driven by winds, penetrate into the west end gables of the dormitories which is spoiling the plaster. I believe the coping stones are loose, and need to be re-cemented together; or renewed with a solid layer of concrete; perhaps an asphalt compound or mixture would serve the purpose. I have asked for a report, in writing, re this matter.\n\nThe metal (copper) covered wash tables, or troughs, in both the boys' and girls' wash-rooms, are perforating through wear. This should be renewed at an early date, as water is now leaking onto the floors. Tin or galvanized iron is not suitable; it always looks black and dirty. I am wondering whether a cement (concrete) trough, having a very finely polished (glazed) finish, would not serve the purpose; I have never seen anything like this, but if we could get the same finish as there is on the cement floor of the playrooms in the basement, which is polished like glass, I would be satisfied to recommend it.\n\nThe bake oven is in poor condition -- badly burned. It might be possible to repair it; new grates were asked for in the estimates. The Principal suggests a new one.\n\nThe hot water tank is perforated, and needs to be renewed. This has been asked for and approved. (Ref. Dept. #103-1-5 dated Jan. 28, 1942).\nThe main water tank -- an elevated wooden structure, outside the building -- (gravity system) is said to be showing signs of wear and tear, owing to the elements. This may cause trouble by leaking, before long. Being a poor \"steeple-jack\" I did not try to climb up to look at it closely, but I asked for a full report on same.\n\nThis school has no frigidaire, and they are very anxious to obtain one. They are still using ice, which is not very satisfactory. This is hauled from Lee's Creek, 6 miles away, and cannot be obtained in square blocks, as the weather is too mild to freeze it thick. A brick-walled frigidaire could easily be built adjoining the west wall of the kitchen; this should have two compartments: one for meats, the other for dairy produce. A small fish compartment (drawer) could also be installed.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 21, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your report of February 10 on your inspection of the St. Paul's Residential School, the hot water tank has been ordered from the Riverside Iron Works, Calgary.\n\nActing Indian Agent McMillan has already written regarding the oven. We have no funds available for its purchase at the present time but this request will receive further consideration when our appropriation for the fiscal year 1942-43 is available.\n\nYou might instruct the Acting Agent to obtain quotations on the other repairs which you mention in your letter are necessary. He should submit these to us immediately following April 1 and careful consideration will be given to them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. C.F.

The hot water tank at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School leaking badly in several different places. Mr. Flatt sent a local \"plumber\" to repair leaks and did not receive his account from us until March 15th, 1943.\n\nRegarding the stove, mining and top for stove, this was done on an emergency call that there were unable to use the stove as the top had fallen in.

The contents of your letter have been carefully considered and the Department is not prepared to incur the expense of installing the coil in this tank.\n\nThe amount requested by Mr. Flett for installing the tank appears excessive and I should appreciate it if you would make further inquiries with a view to obtaining a capable man who will do this work at a lower figure.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I am now advised by the Indian Agent that the new basket of the extractor was returned to you as it appears that it could not be properly installed.

(RG 10, Volume 6373, file 764-5, part 7)\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise in connection with correspondence through our Inspector's Office in Calgary, in which I was informed that the Riverside Iron Works at Calgary were making a Hot Water Tank, that this Tank has now arrived at the St. Paul's Indian Res. School. I had Mr. F.W. Flett examine it regarding the installation of same and he gave me the following quotation for the installation of same, at the sum of $125.00, copy of which is attached to this letter.\n\nThe following is a description of the Tanks:\n\nOld Tank:\nBadly pitted and for which new one is purchased, is a 500 Gallon Hot Water Tank, Type B468 of Crane's Ltd., with a Man-hole and Pipe Coil. Tank is 36\" wide and 10' long and has a Man-hole and pipe coil for Heating purposes, this coil is used for heating water in the Tank from the Heating system in conjunction with jacket heater.\n\nNew Tank:\nTank now supplied by the Riverside Iron Works, Calgary, is 42\" wide and 8' long and has no man-hole, it will be impossible to heat this boiler except through the jacket heater direct.\n\nMr. F.W. Flett has made a report on this Tank, a copy of which is enclosed. He quotes, over and above the installation fee, the question of making a man-hole and installing an Iron pipe coil such as was in use in the old tank, at the sum of $100.00.\n\nThis other recommendation (if the necessary permission can be obtained from the Dept. of Munitions & Supply) is to place a Copper Coil Element, which would be expanded into a removable head through a steel sleeve, welded in the Tank, thus doing without a man-hole and having a coil that would easily be cleaned off as corrosion would only be on the outside of the coil, which, being cleaned off, would be as good as new and would last indefinitely as copper does not...\nnot deteriorate. This type, furnished and installed would cost $125.00.\n\nThe total cost on this basis would be, installation of Tank, provide and install Man-hole and Steel Coil $220.00, for Installation of Tank and furnishing and installing a removable type Copper Heating Element at $245.00.\n\nI am writing this direct on the instructions of Inspector C.P. Schmidt of Calgary and a copy of this letter is being forwarded to him for his information and files.\n\nMay I be instructed regarding the above work, as to type of Coil, also authority re. installation as quoted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nEnc.\n\nT.R.L.

Res. School during the summer of 1941 and as a change of Engineer's occurred and School Vacation was on, it was September before any effort was made by the School Officials to set up the new part. It was then found that a part of the new repairs would not fit and it was decided to send forward the OLD bearing as a sample; this was done and the Beaver Laundry Co. were unable to supply the part so they repaired same and sent it back to the St. Paul's School.\n\nThis was installed on the new Extractor and the new Extractor would not fit the casing in which it was supposed to work, so the old Extractor was re-installed on the repaired part and ran very evenly.\n\nThe School authorities then shipped the new Basket of the Extractor back to the Beaver Laundry Co. Ltd., 101, Parent Street, Toronto, Ont., and I am advised that they have written to the St. Paul's School direct, regarding it.\n\nSince receiving this information I am advising you so that arrangements can be made for a refund on the Basket which did not fit the stationary bowl and was returned.\n\nI am writing the Beaver Laundry Co. Ltd., that I have placed the matter of a refund in the hands of my Dept.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.R.L.

Hoey.\n\nI beg to advise that in taking up the question of the balance allowed for the current fiscal years Estimates as quoted in Dr. Westgate's letter enclosed with your letter of the 1st inst File 103-1-5.\n\nI interviewed the Principal of St Paul's School this morning, and in discussing this question with him, he advises that he would like to leave the balance of the money allowed in the Estimates for this year, dormant until some unexpected emergency occurs when this can be used for that purpose.\n\nAs considerable breakages occur at different times at this School, which call for emergency requests to the Department, I would concur in the available funds for this School being left for emergency Vouchers.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nSecretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\n\nA/c Indian Agent.\n\nENcl 2.

That is twenty years ago, and the hose in the meantime has become more or less perished, and does not hold water.\n\nThe fire extinguishers now attached on all corridors and stairways have also been on hand for several years and need replenishing.\n\nWould further suggest that a complete fire-hydrant be built adjoining the Water tower with at least 500 feet of hose attached.

McMillan, Indian Agent, Cardston, Alta.\n\nAs you are aware, we recently forwarded a circular letter to the principals of all residential schools in connection with taking precautions against fire hazards. A letter has just been received from Reverend Canon Middleton which reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"As stated before all the fire hose of this school has been in use since completion of the building in 1924. That is twenty years ago, and the hose in the meantime has become more or less perished, and does not hold water.\n\n\"The fire extinguishers now attached on all corridors and stairways have also been on hand for several years and need replenishing.\n\n\"Would further suggest that a complete fire-hydrant be built adjoining the water tower with at least 500 feet of hose attached. Such could be used for any outside purpose with efficient force. I made this suggestion several years ago, but was informed there were no funds available for that purpose.\n\n\"In addition to our regular series of fire-drills the equipment mentioned above would strongly fortify our position.\"\n\nIf you let me know the number and size of the fire extinguishers at present in the building immediate arrangements can be made to secure refills for them.\nIn regard to the suggestion for a complete fire hydrant adjoining the water tower you might let me know if you think this is absolutely necessary and, if so, give an estimate of its cost. Purchase of the amount of hose suggested by the Principal would involve an expenditure between $250.00 and $275.00.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 11, 1944.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to our recent circular in regard to fire hazards. The Indian Agent is being written and requested to advise us the number and size of the fire extinguishers at present in the school in order that we may purchase refills for them. We have also brought to his attention your suggestion regarding a fire hydrant and he is being requested to submit quotations for our consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

In St Paul's School I found nine Fire Hoses in the Corridors and the Boiler Room, every one of these hoses were very old and in a bad state of repair. At St Mary's R C School I found 10 Hoses some of them in a very excellent state, which had been replaced lately, and the rest of the hoses were in a good condition. I t would seem that the fire hoses in St Pauls should be replaced immediately for to give them fair protection inside; I would also recommend that sufficient refills be purchased for the fire extinguishers at each School the number and size of each extinguisher being attached on a separate sheet.\n\nIn reply to your last paragraph regarding the suggestion of a Hydrant being placed close to the water tower for outside fire protection, I have looked over the situation regarding this suggestion, and find that the site of the new compound to the suggested Hydrant will be laying on the ground and will hardly reach the main Building. I would like to recommend that when funds are available to insure good protection to the School that can be used when the building is full of smoke the following which I have tried to show on the enclosed sketch, as both building are very much alike the same system can be used at both Schools.\n\nThe plan is as follows the running of a three inch pipe to the North and South Walls of the annex to the main Building where at present the Kitchen Laundry and Boiler room are located, with the School Chapel above, which is the most likely place for a fire to start, the three inch pipe will come through the wall and be fitted with a connection to which the fire hose can be attached. This will allow the use of the hose on the back of the main building, and will cover a portion of the front of the building. The expense to do this with the purchase of three inch pipe sufficient to reach the walls from the main water main, the labor (this may be done with help of the School engineer) and the purchase of 300 Feet of Fire Hose for each School.\n\nI have made no estimate of the cost of this work, but if the Department approve of my suggestion I will immediately make enquiries as to cost etc.\n\nCopy to Inspector G P Schmidt\nAlberta Inspectorate\n507 Public Building\nCalgary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Pugh, Indian Agent, Cardston, Alberta.\n\nRe: Repairs and Equipment,\nSt. Paul's Indian Residential School.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 28th ultimo, in which you intimate that an account has been presented by Mr. F. W. Flett, Cardston, Alberta, covering two items of expense at the school, for which apparently no authority had been received at this office.\n\nInasmuch as the repairs to the pumping system involve a comparatively small amount ($22.82), it will be in order for you to send forward a voucher for this sum. In the absence of Mr. Phelan, however, I am somewhat puzzled with respect to the purchase and installation of the bake oven at a cost of $120.50. Under existing regulations, all such purchases are made by the Departmental Purchasing Agent and only purchases made by him can be recognized for payment by this Branch. In Archdeacon Middleton's letter dated April 18, 1944, a request is made that a new oven with a larger loaf capacity be purchased. Is there any explanation as to why this request was not sent forward to the Department? It would be appreciated if you would discuss the matter again with Archdeacon Middleton and let us know, if you can, just exactly what has taken place.\n\nR. A.

W. Flett's Account as rendered.\n\nThe undersigned can offer no explanation as to why this request was not sent forward.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nE. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 2, 1944.\n\nMr. J.E. Pugh, Indian Agent, Cardston, Alta.\n\nI have your letter of the 21st ultimo, with reference to the bake oven at the St. Pauls Residential School.\n\nIt appears from your letter that only a new part was installed in the oven. If this is correct the account should be prepared in a more explicit manner. The item for labour amounting to $25 should also give details showing the number of hours the workman was engaged and the rate per hour. If the account is submitted in the manner desired, favourable consideration will be given to payment. However, you should again point out to the Principal that unauthorized purchases will not be considered in future.\n\nR.A.

Woolf, Painter, Cardston, Alta., it was found that he did not quote for Paint, only giving the quantities required for the jobs and prices for his labour.\n\nThe Requisition was prepared for the Paint by this Office on the basis of prices current in 1942, and when the writer contacted Mr. Woolf regarding the Purchase Order #25812, he advised that he could not possibly undertake to provide the Paint at the prices quoted, and further that it was not understood that he should provide the Paint.\n\nThe items which are condensed herewith in respect of each School job, show the quantities of Paint, kinds are the same, but prices are the 1944 prices obtained from the G. F. Stephens Co. Ltd., by the undersigned.\n\nPerhaps the writer should have returned the Purchase Order when this discrepancy was discovered on interview with Mr. Woolf, but some anxiety was felt as to our ability to have this and other outside painting completed before winter set in.\n\nJ.

The requisitions which we had previously forwarded to you stated that the prices shown on the requisitions had been obtained from S.D. Woolf, Painter, Cardston, Alberta. This was the information that had been supplied to us by the Agent who was in charge of the Blood Agency at that time.\n\nIt now appears that Mr. Woolf did not desire to supply the paint; he simply wished to do the necessary work. As a consequence the present Indian Agent, Mr. J.E. Pugh, purchased the paint required from G.F. Stephens Paint Company, Calgary. I enclose, for your information, a copy of the Indian Agent's letter of October 27.\n\nAs the matter stands now the purchase order was issued to Woolf and consequently the Treasury Branch will not pay an account for paint supplied by Stephens.

The requisitions which we had previously forwarded to you stated that the prices shown on the requisitions had been obtained from S.D. Woolf, Painter, Cardston, Alberta. This was the information that had been supplied to us by the Agent who was in charge of the Blood Agency at that time.\n\nIt now appears that Mr. Woolf did not desire to supply the paint; he simply wished to do the necessary work. As a consequence the present Indian Agent, Mr. J.E. Pugh, purchased the paint required from G.F. Stephens Paint Company, Calgary. I enclose, for your information, a copy of the Indian Agent's letter of October 27.\n\nAs the matter stands now the purchase order was issued to Woolf and consequently the Treasury Branch will not pay an account for paint supplied by Stephens. It would be appreciated if you would either issue a new purchase order in favour of Stephens, or send a memorandum to our Treasury Branch.\n\nR.A.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to state with reference to Purchase Order #1640, File #57418-15-16 dated March 13th, 1945 to John Woslyng of Cardston, Alta., for the supply and installation of a 5 HP Electric Motor - 3 Phase at the St. Paul's Anglican Residential School, that with Mr. Woslyng, this job was looked over, and on the advice of Mr. Woslyng, it is now asked that the Purchase Order be cancelled for the time being, as it is found that a 3 Phase will not work on the present set up of the Calgary Power Co., that only a Single Phase will work in this type of line.\n\nThe cost of a Single Phase is higher than a 3 Phase, but Mr. Woslyng advises that the present set up at this school is not a good working layout. The 5 HP Motor at present in use is entirely overlooked, and the Motor is in bad shape, due to overloading.\n\nIt is now suggested that a re-arrangement of this set up be made, details and cost of which will be submitted after prices on the suggested change have been obtained and compiled.\n\nIt is regretted that we have had to take this action, but it is considered that the Department should review the proposed redistribution of the Machinery load at the School as will be outlined by Mr. Woslyng, before going any further in the purchase of the Motor authorized in P.O. #1640, and it was therefore thought advisable to cancel this Purchase Order for this Fiscal Year of 1944-45, and the matter reviewed for Fiscal Year 1945-46, Estimates.\n\nJ.

Both schools well attended during the quarter, except for truants. The services of the RCMP used in some instances for the return of pupils who either ran away or did not return from week-end holidays.\n\nThe matter of the above truancy is now being dealt with on instructions from the Branch, and the notations of the Provincial School Inspector's Report being passed on to the respective Principals for their comments.\n\nA number of pupils were hospitalized during the quarter at the Indian Hospital and returned to their respective schools on recovering.\n\nQuarantine was placed on both schools during the month June due to an outbreak of measles, nine cases were reported from the St. Paul's Anglican School, none from the Blood R.C. School.\n\nPremises at both schools are in fairly good shape, and improvements made at both schools without cost to the Department from appropriations. Painting of several buildings at The Blood R.C. School has been carried out, and are quite attractive, using white for walls and red for roofs.\n\nThe Painting of the barns and house at the St. Paul's School has been completed, this was delayed due to bad weather.\n\nThe High Pressure Laundry Boiler was the subject of Special letter seeking authority for repairs by the Lethbridge Laundry. Due to labour shortage, this work cannot be carried out till after the 9th of July, when this company will have a boiler man available.\n\nThe Motor at this school, used for pumping and laundry was sent into Lethbridge for repairs, and is now in use again. Further study of the plant at this school is being made, with a view to eliminating the costs of repair, and will be submitted to the Branch when compiled.\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI beg to state that the Principal of the St. Paul's Anglican Indian Res. School reported to this Office that one of the main Heating Boilers was leaking in the Tubes, I accordingly examined this Boiler and thought it advisable to have a competent Boilermaker examine same.\n\nMr. G. B. Davis was consulted by Telephone on the matter and he had his expert examine both Boilers, and he found two Flues leaking due to \"pitting\", and advised against replacing these as a number of other Tubes were weak and replacement would cause further leaking and he has recommended re-Tubing the Boiler completely.\n\nThe Boilers in this School have been in use for twenty years, and no repair work on Tubes carried out, and in view of this Mr. Davis made the above recommendation and a copy of Mr. Davis's letter is attached, outlining the costs for this job, this being $496.25.\n\nIt is possible that the second Boiler will be weakening, and it is therefore recommended that the above be repaired at once, in case of Flues going bad in the other Boiler.\n\nThe writer is of the opinion that if a \"Stoker\" was provided at this School, using only one Boiler, which method is being used at the Blood R. C. School, and it is found there, that one Boiler is sufficient to heat the school under ordinary conditions. This is only a suggestion, with a view to saving a re-Fluing job on the second Boiler and no data has been obtained on the cost of the purchase of an Automatic Stoker and installation, but it is thought that this cost would approximate $600.00.\n\nHowever, the matter of re-Tubing the Boiler now leaking, is urgent, should the other one spring a Tube leak the School would then be without heat.\n\nThe arrangements mentioned in Mr. Davis's letter regarding Transportation, Board and Room has been tentatively arranged with the Principal of the School, may we be advised, please.\n\nJ.

Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCARDSTON, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nComplying with your request we have had our boilermaker inspect the boiler at the St. Paul's Anglican School and are of the opinion that to replace two leaking tubes at this time would prove a matter of throwing good money after bad.\n\nThe engineer intimated that the boilers had been in service for about twenty years and had so far not been re-tubed. This suggests to us that all tubes may be pitted and such works as would be required to replace those presently giving you trouble might disturb the others to such an extent that they also would shortly commence to show leaks.\n\nDue to the fact that the smoke box end of the boiler is so very close to the solid brick basement wall, it will be necessary to cut these tubes in two inside the boiler and remove them through the upper manhole. Taking allowance for this and the complete re-tubing of your boiler we are pleased to quote you a price of $496.25.\n\nIn addition to the above charges we would have to depend on you to see that our boilermaker and helper, together with their personal tools, were picked up in Cardston and delivered back at that point on completion of the work. We would also depend on you supplying these two men with room and board during the time they are working on the boiler and which we would estimate would run in the neighbourhood of ten days.\n\nWe appreciate this opportunity of quoting you.

This causes overloading on the motor, and to add to the load the Pump head is badly worn, and has passed its efficiency peak.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the writer had Mr John Wosley of Cardston, check over this plant with the Blockman of the Fairbanks Morse Co Ltd of Calgary, with a view to submitting the matter to the Branch with a detailed costs.\n\nThe details procured are as follows:\n\n- Fairbanks Morse Pumping Head, Model No. 315B, 11 HP Single phase motor with direct driving pump head for deep well, with \"V\" belt drive. Cylinder capacity 970 gallons per hour, using a 3\" cylinder.\n  - Cost: $295.00, FOB Calgary, Alta.\n- Switch Box cost for this unit $17.35\n- Push Button Starter \" \" 2.42.\n- Freight, Approx?.\n- Installation, inclusive of Labour Conduit and wire $111.00 Total $514.75\n\nIf the above proposal is authorized, it is suggested that the 5HP motor now used for pumping be placed on the laundry machinery shaft; this will then divide the load that is at present carried by the one motor for pumping and laundry, and the cost of placing this motor on to the line shaft of laundry will be approximately $25.00 for labour only, using the present Switch Box and Push Button, but re-wiring for the laundry shaft. Conduit and wire for this change over will be approximately $15.00.\n\nThe total cost to carry out the above proposal will be $564.75.\n\nIn connection with the above, I may say that all angles of pumping to the water tower, the flow and back pressure were studiously gone into by the Fairbanks Morse Blockman, and they are satisfied that the unit described above will meet the demands of the water supply for the school. The lay-out of our plant was viewed by the Fairbanks Representative, and I am assured that such a unit will give entire satisfaction.\n\nThe unit now in operation has been in use for 20 years and is of a type that is now obsolete, and requires too much power to drive for the purpose of pumping.\n\nConsideration to the foregoing proposal is respectfully asked, and if possible authorization granted.\n\nJ.E.

Schools re-opened on the 2nd of September, and were visited on the 4th to check attendance. As a result of such visit and lack of attendance, the Branch were advised by wire of the status of attendance, and instructions sought.\n\nOn receipt of these instructions, truant notices were prepared, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police requested to serve such notices. This latter action was the subject of correspondence with the Branch.\n\nThe schools have been visited each week during September, and at the last visit, 19 pupils were absent from The Blood RG School and 50 pupils absent from the St. Paul's Anglican School, this information was passed along to the Branch in my Letter No. 402-11B of the 25th instant.\n\nSome 6 pupils are in the USA, with their parents who have gone there for work and visits, and truant notices were mailed to Min. F. Chief P. Chreighton who is also in the USA, and he was asked to serve such notices.\n\nThere has developed a very distinct feeling among a lot of the Indian parents against sending their children to school, and seek devious means to attain that end. The Medical Officer has been requested by your Agent to exercise great care in giving out certificates of health to parents. A number have called on the Doctor, seeking exemption for their children.\n\nBoth schools have been advised that no monthly or other holidays are to be given during the school term, and the letter sent out to the Principals from the Branch, have been posted for the Indians benefit.\n\nA survey was made at the Blood RG School in connection with the re-conditioning of the Dining room floors, and the Branch's letter in this respect has now been received.\n\nBoth schools were in very good shape for the start of the School year, in both cases painting and cleaning of floors at some expense to the schools having been carried out.\n\nAt the St. Pauls' Anglican School, the leaking of one of the heating boilers was reported, and consequent upon this report, the Southbridge Iron works, were requested to examine this boiler; they report that two flues are leaking, and a re-tubing job is stated to be the only satisfactory way of re-conditioning. This\n\n(over)\nmatter is being dealt with by special letter.\n\nData has also been obtained regarding the pumping arrangements at this school, and this also will be dealt with by letter.\n\nDuring the quarter ending, some 15 pupils of the Blood RC school and 6 of the St. Paul's school were hospitalized, and returned to their respective schools. These children were sent to hospital for varying reasons, minor accidents and ill health, none of which were serious.\n\nCorrespondence was entered into with the Branch, regarding a pupil of the Blood RC School, requesting permission at the Father's request, to place this pupil in the Minapore Orphanage School. The contents of the Dept. reply was given to Shade, and I am now informed that the child is in attendance at that school and Shade is desirous of re-opening the correspondence in the matter of grant for this child.\n\nXX XX XX\n\nJ.R. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI beg to state that the metal extension on the Kitchen Range chimney at the St. Paul's Anglican Indian Residential School has collapsed due to weather wear and the continued high winds of the past few weeks, height: approximately 22 Ft., and supported by guy wires, this extension is imperative to the operation of the afore-mentioned Range.\n\nI contacted Mr. Frank W. Flett of Cardston, and requested that he examine the extension with a view to possible repair and he advises this Office that same is absolutely worn out (having been in service about eight (8) years) and quoting a price of $135.00 for the purchase and installation of a new chimney extension unit complete.\n\nAs this is considered an \"Emergent\" item, the writer requested Mr. Flett to proceed with the necessary new installation at the figure quoted ($135.00 installed), and to supply this Office with his written Quotation to this effect for forwarding to the Branch with the voucher for payment.\n\nMay the writer have the authorization of the Branch for the expenditure of the sum as quoted for this very necessary replacement, please.\n\nJ.

Pugh, Indian Agent\nAGENCY'S REPORT FOR THE QUARTER ENDING DECEMBER 31ST, 1946.\n\nWelfare And Training\n\nSchool attendance improved during the quarter, mostly as a result of invoking the truancy section of the Indian Act.\n\nThe total roll for the St Paul's School at the end of the quarter is 136 enrolled, of these 20 failed to attend due to illness or truancy, the latter embraced 11 students of which 5 were in the USA, not having returned after the summer holidays.\n\nOne has been excused school by the Medical Officer as not fit for attendance.\n\nAt the Blood R.C. School, the total enrolled number pupils is 176, of these 5 failed to attend during the quarter due to illness.\n\nNew admissions for the quarter are as follows:\n\nBlood R.C. School. 20. St Paul Ang School. 1.\n\nDischarges for the quarter are, Blood R.C., and St Paul's. 2.\n\nVisits have been made to both schools during the quarter and matter pertaining to the welfare of the children gone into with the Principals. Both institutions are well kept, and the children appear fairly contented, though there exists a feeling among the pupils in regard to the holidays which they formerly enjoyed.\n\nThe heating boiler at the St Paul's School was re-tubed and a very satisfactory job carried out, this boiler is in full use and the engineer in charge advises that it is working well.\n\nThe matter of the Pumping system at the above school was the subject of special correspondence, and it is hoped that the new pump head will be forthcoming in the new year.\n\nThe SHP Electric Motor in use on the old unit, went out of use completely at the end of the quarter and had to be sent to Calgary for repairs, this will be the subject of special letter on receipt of information as to costs of re-conditioning this motor. The Gas engine is being used for pumping purposes and keeping the lighting equipment. The Principal of this school also brought to my attention the condition of the Water tower, which I noted is leaking; but due to icing conditions we have been unable to get into the tower to examine the difficulty. However it does appear that the Radiators have been disconnected and will have to be re-installed, and the leak in the water tank repaired. A further report will be made when costs are available.\n\nThe work of draining the area adjacent to the basement of the Blood R.C. School was completed by the Parks Branch, this was carried out under difficulties due to the lateness of the season, and the inability of obtaining equipment.\n\nJ.E.

Blood Agency - Repairs: Buildings & Works.\n\nWith reference to the marginally noted subject, I beg to ask if I may be advised of the items that have been approved for expenditures contained in our Estimates 1946-47, Sheet #6691A for the above School.\n\nBefore commencing authorized work at this School, I would like to place before the Branch the condition of the Water Tower at this School. Recently I had the Tower checked over by Mr. F. W. Flett, Plumbing Contractor of CARSTON, following upon a leakage in the Tank during the winter, which formed a huge block of ice at the entrance to the Tower room which contains the Tank.\n\nMr. Flett advises me that the cross members or foundation of the Tank itself are water-logged and rotted, and the Tank, due to leakage, has taken on a malformation and is getting to the stage of being dangerous. Mr. Flett is unable to quote me on a renewal job, and therefore it is recommended that the matter of renewal of this Tank be placed in the hands of the Parks Engineering Branch.\n\nThis Tank has a capacity of 40,000 gallons, and is contained in a Water Tower Room elevated to a height of 85' above the ground on wooden legs and has been in use for 22 years.\n\nA rough sketch is attached herewith for some guidance in the matter.\n\nIt is further suggested that if it is deemed advisable to renew the Tank, that such work be carried out during the Summer Holiday in readiness for the opening of the School in September.\n\nA replacement of the Water Towers at both Schools was placed in the \"Post War Programme\" rules of this agency.\n\nJUN 18 1946\n\nIndian Affairs.

Consequently, I do not feel that it is advisable to expend the amount provided in the current year's appropriation until we know what it will cost to repair the water tank.\n\nBernard F.

The tank is elevated to a height of 85 ft. above the ground. It is placed on wooden legs and has been in use for the past 22 years.\n\nThe Indian Agent states that he has had it examined recently and found that the cross members or foundation of the tank itself are water-logged and rotted and that the tank, due to leakage, has taken on a malformation and is becoming dangerous.

You are aware, from recent correspondence, that we are endeavouring to secure new toilets at an approximate cost of $1,355.00. In the current year's appropriation we included an amount of $1,200.00 for repairs and improvements at this school. The purchase of the toilets will exceed that amount. Under these circumstances I doubt if we will be able to provide the funds for the floors. However, we will consider the matter again when we know the cost of the repairs to the water tower at the St. Paul's School. The Surveys and Engineering Branch was requested on June 25 to have one of the officials of that Branch visit the school and I understand he will reach there shortly, if he has not already done so.\n\nBernard F.

School.\n\nI beg to submit herewith Voucher #227 in favour of F. W. Flett, Plumber, CALGARY, Alta., amounting to $53.70 for repairs to the Plumbing system at the St. Paul's Indian Res. School, this Agency.\n\nIn this connection it is desired to state that no water could be procured from this well, and I had the pump drawn out and it was found that the working barrel was worn through and one length of pipe pitted and beyond use and leaking.\n\nAs the main pump in the School proper was in process of being installed, no water was available and I therefore authorized the repairs as indicated on the enclosed Voucher, as being of an emergent nature.\n\nI may also state that when mounting the new Fairbanks-morse Pump Head and Motor, that we found that the working barrel and Pump Rods in this well were in need of repair. The working barrel was sent to Calgary by Mr. John Woslyng, this necessitated pulling the lengths of pipe and Rods out, which was done after the new Rod had been installed and it was found that the Rod and Valve would not drop and water was leaking out, cutting down the flow of water in the head. The inspection of the Cylinder & Rod revealed the badly worn condition and I instructed Mr. Woslyng to carry out the necessary repairs of having the Cylinder Barrel honed, the foot valve re-built and re-made and leathers supplied, we replaced the 4 Rods but these are warped and drag on the pipe sides causing excessive power to be used on the Pump Head.\n\nI personally checked over the whole system with Mr. John Woslyng and authorized the repairs, and have further requested Mr. Woslyng to procure new Pump Rods and these will be installed as soon as received.\n\nIt is estimated that the cost of repairs to the Main Pump will approximate $150.00 to $175.00, which will cover 4 New Rods & Couplings approx. $45.00 - Honing Cylinder $12.50 - Making Foot Valve, new Leathers, and labour entailed pulling Rods and replacing in Well.\n\nI may add that it was when the Main Pump was out in the School, that the Stock Pump broke down and no water was available hence my treating the matter as emergent and authorizing the necessary repairs for both pumps.\n\nI may add that while generally checking over at this School I was informed that the Water Tower Tank was in very poor condition, and that it will only hold approximately 11000 Gals of water due to shrinking of the leaves and warped condition of the Tank and it therefore appear that the Pressure Tank system recommended for this School by the Engineering Branch, Banff (Mr. Snelson) be installed at an early date.\n\nRespectfully submitted, and I trust that my action will be concurred in.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI beg to state that while checking up attendance at the St. Paul's Anglican Indian Residential School on the 4th inst., several matters pertaining to the School premises were brought to my attention - these are enumerated herewith:\n\n1. MAIN ROOF LEAKS: (a), Dormitory on the North Wing, leaking on Ridge Cap and Roof Flashings between Wing and Main Roof.\n\n(b), Dormer Windows leaking at Flashings on West side of building.\n\nIn both cases, when raining, the water has leaked down to the plaster, and repairs should be effected on Roof Cap & Flashings and the Plaster then replaced.\n\n2. SEWER SYSTEM - This has become bogged down due to lack of water passing through the system while the Pumping set up was under repair, and it appears necessary to have the system and septic tank pumped out while flushing with the Fire hose. To do this I have obtained the services of the Town of Cardston tank pump which we will have to pay a nominal rental for 2 days, and authorized the School to hire 2 Indians to assist the School labour in this work.\n\nIt is thought that if the whole Tank is cleaned out in this manner, it will clear the blockage and prevent the recurrence of the strong odour now permeating the School.\n\nI have not obtained costs for the Roof work as this will be difficult to estimate, being a patching job, utilizing tin flashing some shingles and perhaps some sealing Compound. Should the Board so desire an Estimate can be obtained from a local Contractor and submitted prior to carrying out this work. It is thought that approximately $125.00 would cover the Roof work and Plastering.\n\nIn the matter of the Sewer Tank cleaning, if, as I surmise, in using the Town Pump and Indian labour will clear this Tank, a sum of $25.00 should cover this work. As this work is urgent and essential to School health, I am proceeding with this work.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ. E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Motor made to the laundry line.\n\nWhen this installation was being made it was found that the foot valve of the main pump was badly worn and that the pump rods were warped, and all required either replacing or repairing, this was the subject of special letter, and authorization made for the work necessary. During the process of installing the new pump on the main well, the pump in the Stock Barn broke down, and it was necessary to replace the working barrel in order that the school could obtain water.\n\nA check up of the water Tower was carried out by the Engineering Branch, Banff as requested by this office.\n\nJ.E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nbut no report is available as yet. It is understood that the Engineer recommended a pressure tank system to replace the tower which was found to be dangerous for further use.\nOctober 30, 1946.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe: St. Paul's Indian Residential School Blood Indian Agency, Cardston, Alberta.\n\nAn inspection of the elevated tank and water distribution system at the above school has been made by engineers of this branch in accordance with your request of June 28, 1946.\n\nThe existing tank and supporting structure has deteriorated to such an extent that it has become unsafe and uneconomical to repair. A careful study has been made of the water requirements for this school and it is recommended that a 2500 Imperial gallon water pressure tank be installed to take the place of the elevated tank, the estimated cost of which would be $3000-including the cost of dismantling the elevated tank. The water pressure on the top floor is at present only 15 p.s.i. The minimum pressure with the proposed system would be 40 to 50 p.s.i., thus ensuring adequate fire protection which the school does not have now. The cost of replacing the elevated tank and supporting structure would be approximately $12,000 with an additional $1200 required for a gasoline driven centrifugal booster pump for use in case of fire.\n\nWe now have all the necessary information to enable us to proceed with the installation of the pressure tank system at once if you concur in our recommendation. It is estimated that this work will require about two months as this is the best delivery that can be procured for the steel tank. On the other hand replacement of the present elevated tank would require about six months.\n\nWe will await your further advice before proceeding any further in this matter.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Walker, Res.,\nDistrict Engineer.\n\nSt. Paul's Indian Residential School,\nCardston, B.C.\n\nI arrived at this school Monday morning May 19th, 1947 at 9:30 A.M. O'Sullivan's dragline and crew of three men arrived at the same time. About noon a large truck arrived loaded with an air compressor and jack hammers. By 5 P.M., excavation had been completed and the large tank placed in position in the excavation.\n\nMay 20th. All piping connections from the tank, through the concrete wall and into the boiler room were made, and excavation refilled with earth. Surplus earth was hauled away where required by school officials.\n\nMay 21st. Plumber and helper completed inside piping and change over from old to new tanks. Electricians installed pressure switch, conduit, wiring, etc.\n\nMay 22nd. I rented a small air compressor for initial air charge into tank and spent day checking and adjusting controls.\n\nThe large tank was installed in the only location on the outside of the boiler room basement wall not occupied by coal bins, ash hoist or chimney foundation. In this location, at a depth of six feet below ground surface, 6\" piping from the pump to the outside tank was installed. This line crossed the trench at such an angle that it was necessary to place the end of the tank at a distance of twelve feet from the outside boiler room wall so that the bottom of the tank could be set at an elevation of eight feet below ground surface. It was not advisable to cut the 4\" pipe as it was at the time under pressure supplying water to school. The tank will have an additional winter cover of some two feet of ashes and cinders from the boilers.\n\nIt is necessary that the 1\u00bd H.P. motor that is now running the pump be replaced by a 3 H.P. motor in order that the tank could be maintained at the required 85 pound pressure if and when the water surface in the well was down to 150 feet. In my report of August 6th, 1946, page 2, under \"Well\" I stated that the motor was 2 H.P. At that time the 2 H.P. motor was on hand and ready for installation. However, on my inspection trip of May 19th, 1947 I found that the pump was being driven by a \u00be horse power motor. The 2 H.P. motor had, for some reason or other, not been installed.\n\nThe 1\u00bd H.P. motor now installed would raise the water pressure in the new tank to only 50 p.s.i. This condition, which will probably obtain until a more powerful motor is installed, made it necessary to temporarily set the automatic controls to a pressure range of between 34 and 48 p.s.i.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mines & Resources, OTTAWA, Ont.\n\nRe: Dishwashing Units,\nBlood Residential Schools.\n\nThe dishwashing units of both residential schools on this Reserve are inadequate and the present tin sinks are worn out and leaking - I believe this was brought out in the report of Miss McCready, Nutrition Expert, when she visited this Reserve last summer.\n\nAttached hereto is a plan as suggested by Miss McCready and the Dept. National Health; this unit, installed, will cost approximately $150.00 per school.\n\nThe writer investigated the possibility of War Assets Corporation of Calgary having something on hand of a similar type and suitable for the schools. They do have dishwashing units made up of two sink compartments 2' x 2', with drain boards at each end; these are constructed of sheet metal and are the type used in army kitchens. They are in good shape and are being offered at $18.36 per unit. We would require two of these units, one for each school, and would have to add to the original price the cost of installation with new traps, pipe, etc., which would probably amount to another $25.00 per unit.\n\nAs both Residential Schools are badly in need of these units, may authority be given either to have the large units built and installed at $150.00 each or purchase the smaller units at $18.36 each with costs of installing added.\n\nIt would be appreciated if we could have your advice by Air Mail\n\nCopy: Mr. Gooderham\n\nR.D.

On inspection it was found that the 5000 gal. tank had sunk and sheared off the top pipe to the tank. It was necessary to hire Indians to dig down to the bottom of the tank so that the plumber could install new fittings. The pit was left open and the Surveys and Engineering Branch, Banff, were contacted by telephone. Engineer Snelson was here on the 2nd instant when he made an inspection of the damage.\n\nThe system is again working satisfactorily and we have filled in the pit; it is hoped that the tank has settled as far as it is going to. Engineer Snelson has recommended eavestroughing be installed on the garage next to the tank - the cost would not be over $20.00 - may we proceed to have this done, please?\n\nR.D.

The Agent was instructed to have the local plumber repair the break and leave the work open for our inspection.\n\nMr. Snelsom inspected this work on October 3rd. All the run-off from an adjacent roof, and from a two foot depth of wet snow directly over the tank, had caused sufficient settlement in the tank and in the one inch air pipe leading from the tank into the building to break the threads off the one inch pipe at the tank. Upon inspection it was found that they had dug down to this connection and repaired it. They were advised to fill in the hole, as in Mr. Snelsom's opinion it would not be probable that there would be any further settlement. There is also the possibility of there being a weak thread in the connection that broke.\n\nIn our opinion very little settlement could have occurred in the large 5,000 gallon tank as this tank was carefully bedded down on the solid earth of a newly excavated trench. Some settlement could have occurred in the one inch air pipe that runs from the top of the tank to the inside of the building.\n\nOn October 3rd the old water tower had been pulled down and a local firm was salvaging the useable lumber and pipe.\n\nC.

Middleton,\nSt. Paul's Anglican Indian School,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to the inquiry re refrigeration for the St. Paul School\nand also further to my visit and conversation with Mr. Charley\nMiddleton, please be advised of the following quotations in re-\nspect to the reach-in cabinet for the kitchen and the walk-in\ncooler for storage.\n\nYour reach-in cabinet in the kitchen can be built to any size\nrequired up to the following dimensions. That is the actual size\nof the compartment that you will store food in. The size could\nbe 3 feet in width, 4 feet in height and 7 feet in length inside\nbox measurements. This cabinet should be so constructed that you\nwould have at least 3 inches of insulation all around. The doors\nwill also have to be insulated and have a rubber stripping around\nthe inside edge so that they would fit tightly against the face\nof the box proper. The insulation would be of rock wool and comes\nin five cubic feet per bag.\n\nThe price of the condensing unit complete with a fin coil and drip\ntrays, the necessary refrigeration controls and tubing, the elec-\ntrical installation and refrigeration installation would be \u00a3125.00.\nThe above price does not include the cost of the rock wool insula-\ntion or the necessary door hinges and door latches. The rock wool\ninsulation would cost you a \u00a31.85 per 5 cubic-foot bag F.O.B.\nCalgary and the door latch and hinges would be approximately \u00a38.00\nper set.\n\nIn respect to the walk-in cooler, I suggested to Mr. Charley Mid-\ndleton that you build an ante-room adjacent to the walk-in cooler\nwhere we could install a fin coil for cooling the beef before it\nis hung in the freezer proper. It will also be necessary to have\nat least 8 inches of rock wool insulation laid on the concrete\nfloor and wood floor laid on top of that. Also the wall of the\nrefrigerator proper and ante-room will also have to be insulated with\nrock wool. We can again supply the necessary rock wool for this\npurpose at \u00a31.85 per 5 cubic-foot bag F.O.B. Calgary. In estimating\nthe equipment that would be required for this walk-in refrigerator,\nwe have estimated that you would be freezing 200 pounds of beef per\nday and having a total storage of 3000 pounds. Therefore, the walk-\nin refrigerator will require a 1 HP condenser unit dole plate, con-\ntrols, etc., and we could install same complete with the necessary\nelectrical installation and refrigeration installation and also the fin\ncoil required installed in the ante-room for the sum of \u00a31372.00\nOttawa, December 8, 1947.\n\nDear General Turner:\n\nWe have your letter of December 5th, with reference to the request that you have received for new walk-in refrigerator at the St. Paul's Residential School.\n\nWe regret that the funds at our disposal at the present time do not permit us installing the equipment required.\n\nWe have included an item in our appropriation for 1948-49 that can be used for this purpose; but at the present time we are not in a position to state definitely that it will be allowed, although we are inclined to feel that the funds will be available.

In this morning's mail we have an airmail reply and are giving you below a copy of the quotation, together with full specifications. We will be glad to have you check over this figure and would be very pleased to complete an order for you for this unit:\n\n\"This unit to consist of three compartment sink. Each compartment 24 x 24 x 14\" deep. Two of the compartments are situated together, while the third is separated from the two by means of a 20\" drainboard making the overall 3 compartment sink of 7'8\". At the left hand end of sink will be a 6' drainboard constructed of 16 gauge stainless steel with 10\" splash at back and 1-1\" turned up edge at front and one end. Under this drainboard, full length, will be a 6' drainboard, same construction as former with exception that the rubber scraping block and drain trough will be supplied. Complete unit mounted on stainless steel angle legs and adjustable aluminum ball feet. Overall length of complete unit 21'8\".

I have contacted other tinsmiths in adjoining towns - and the answer has always been the same - no sheet metal.\n\nGeneral Steel Works did give me a price - but their sink is constructed of stainless steel and the price is far above what was authorized; I am enclosing a copy of their letter. Would the Department consider installing these units at the price quoted of $925.00 per sink - f.o.b. Calgary?\n\nR.D.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Bldg., Ottawa.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nHereunder are extracts from a letter, dated 4th of February, received from Archdeacon Middleton, Principal of the above-mentioned School.\n\n\"The question of a suitable cottage - house or residence for the married Farm Instructor has again arisen. Dr. Alderwood was presented with this emergency on his last visit to the School, and suggested that we obtain any building available, and then send the matter forward with recommendation. I have searched all the air-ports of the south, but up to date there is nothing suitable.\n\nOne mile south of Cardston there is a 3-4 room frame cottage - brick chimney and in good condition. Some interior lining is needed.\n\nThe price of the house is $400.00. Have made enquiries regarding moving. A local contractor will haul and set it on foundation for $100.00, thus making a five hundred deal. For years past we have needed such accommodation, and have lost several qualified farmers owing to having no separate residence for man and wife.\n\nThis is a real bargain, and a splendid opportunity to settle the persistent clamourings for a separate residence. Moreover, unless this is accepted, a further difficulty will have to be met by providing one or two additional rooms for Staff members, or assign two members to share one bedroom, which is wholly inadvisable and a method to be deprecated. Can you clinch the deal --- now?\"\n\nMay this matter be considered please and, if your local Agent considers the proposition a reasonable one, may action be taken to procure this building and place it in the location desired, please.\n\n(over)\nWe shall be glad to be advised, at your earliest convenience, of what action you take in this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHenry G. Cook\nActing Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, OTTAWA, Ont.\n\nAttention: B.F. Neary, Supt. Welfare & Training\n\nReference your telegram of January 31st, giving authority for the purchase of ten institutional or double decker beds at $10.00 each for the St. Paul's Anglican Residential School on the Blood Indian Reserve.\n\nOn receipt of this telegram I immediately got in touch with Archdeacon S.H. Middleton, Principal of the School, to find that he had already contacted War Assets, Calgary and was unable to procure double decker beds. War Assets directed him to 'The Trading Post', a war surplus store in Calgary where he again was unable to get the double deckers but did purchase ten single cots and five hospital cots; these were in use at the school when your wire arrived.\n\nAs the expenditure is not over that allowed in your telegram, and as the beds are certainly needed in that institution - since our concerted drive to get more pupils - I am forwarding herewith Voucher No. 105 in the amount of $96.25 in payment of the cots purchased.\n\nR.D.

Fraser, of War Assets Corporation, Montreal, reading in part as follows:\n\n\"Reference L B 14802, Building Number 12, Pearsee, Alberta -stop- We are issuing instructions Calgary Branch Sales Office, 513 - 5th Avenue W., Calgary, today to provide for the sale of this building to your department at $1,160.51 -stop- Will you therefore forward your purchase order to Calgary office.\"\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines and Resources, OTTAWA, Ont.\n\nAttention: Bernard F. Neary, Superintendent of Education.\n\nWe have your letter of the 10th instant, File 103-1-5 (F.1) with reference to purchasing a building to be used for the Farming Instructor at the St. Paul's Residential School on the Blood Reserve.\n\nThe necessity of a building for the Farming Instructor is not disputed, and is rather urgent at this School; at the present time the married Instructor must live in a room inside the school proper, which is inadequate and very unsatisfactory.\n\nI have viewed the building suggested, however, and certainly do not consider it a 'bargain'. It is only a shell and when moved would be of little value; the shingles are all coming off, the windows are out and although the building is double-boarded it has no outside sheeting. The chimney is of the bracket type, and would have to be rebuilt if moved; the inside is hopeless being used at the moment for the storage of grain.\n\nSt. Paul's School has a qualified Carpenter on the Staff and a goodly number of large Indian boys anxious to learn more about carpentry - it would be my earnest recommendation that the Department furnish these boys with the material and, under the guidance of Mr. J. Mould, the Instructor, allow them to build a small cottage for the Farming Instructor. The Principal has assured me that the Staff and pupils can handle all the labour involved. I have had an estimate prepared by the Cahoon Lumber Company of Cardston for the entire material for a small cottage, 20 x 20, or 16 x 20 with an 8 x 10 lean-to copy of which I enclose; you will see that the total cost of material is not much greater than the cost of moving the ramshackle building and the value will be thrice as great.\nMr. B.F. Neary\n\nI believe the Department would have plans for a simple cottage, size 20 x 20, which Mr. Mould could follow - if not, I am sure plans can be drawn here for such a building.\n\nThe estimate enclosed includes everything for the cottage from cement foundation, chimney, shingles and siding and is complete. There would be an extra cost - in either plan of moving or building - of electric lights and plumbing, but the total cost would not come to over $1,000.00 - including all material, electricity and plumbing for kitchen and bath.\n\nI would sincerely recommend that the bill of material, as listed on the enclosed estimate, be purchased for the St. Paul's School for the purpose of erecting a small cottage for the Farming Instructor on the understanding that the Staff of the School do all labour necessary without cost to the Department.\n\nR.D.

(RG 10, Volume 6373, file 764-5, part 8)\nMarch 1st, 1948.\n\nDear Archdeacon Cook:\n\nOn receipt of your letter of the 7th ultimo with reference to a cottage for the farm instructor at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School, the Indian Superintendent was written and his reply reads in part as follows,\n\n\"I have viewed the building suggested, however, and certainly do not consider it a 'bargain'. It is only a shell and when moved would be of little value; the shingles are all coming off, the windows are out and although the building is double-boarded it has no outside sheeting. The chimney is of the bracket type, and would have to be rebuilt if moved; the inside is hopeless being used at the moment for the storage of grain.\"\n\nIn view of the above, the Department does not consider it advisable to proceed with the purchase of the building mentioned.\n\nAs an alternative, the Superintendent suggests the erection of a small cottage, the material for which would be supplied by the Department and the labour would be supplied by the school management. The latter would include the manual training teacher and the larger boys. To follow out this suggestion would involve an expenditure of approximately $1,000, and I regret that at the present time we do not have the funds for the purpose. However, the Superintendent's recommendation will receive further consideration after April 1st.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nVen. Archdeacon H.G.

Owing to lack of funds at the present time, we are not in a position to authorize the expenditure that you recommend.

Heseltine, Esq.,\nSuperintendent, Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Classroom Block St. Paul's Residential School,\nBlood Reserve.\n\nYour files 103-2-5 and 103-1-5 (Z).\n\nUpon receipt of yours of the 24th instant, I contacted the Manager of the War Assets Corporation, Calgary, and learned that his office had just received a directive to say that Building #12 at Peace and Building #38 at Macleod have been allocated to the Indian Affairs Branch, and would be released when notification of payment for them had been received.\n\nI have not yet contacted Superintendent Ragan, but I know that the moving tenders do not include the placing of the foundations. This work must be done either by day labour or by contract when weather conditions allow. I would not recommend that such work be done until the weather at least is fine and warm, and that will be in the new fiscal year. It is not at all likely that the mover will get the buildings on to the reserve before early summer.\n\nIn the meantime, the foundations can be made. (I have moved numerous buildings and set them up in the air until the foundations were laid. This is not the best procedure, of course.)\n\nIn regard to the changes to be made to these buildings, I cannot remember how the windows are placed, but I would not attempt to do any alterations until they are on the new foundations. Will not fenestration be subject to the direction the front is facing, and whether or not they are clear of other large buildings? I also consider it too early to consult with an Engineer from the Lands and Development service.\n\nI am asking Mr. Ragan to locate the sites for these buildings and to obtain some figures on cost of foundations, to be submitted to you.\n\nThe main problem now is to gain possession of the buildings and, in due course, get them moved on to the Reserve. We cannot expect to have them in use before next fall.\n\n(Signed) G.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I also note that the movers will not likely be ready to move the buildings before early summer. However, I will now forward the two tenders to the Minister's office for the necessary approval, on the understanding that this work will be carried out in the 1948-49 fiscal year.\n\nHowever, I would suggest that you advise me now as to the cement which will be required and also the cribbing so that we can forward the requisitions to the Departmental Purchasing Agent now. In this way you will be sure to have the necessary materials when the time comes to build the foundation. With regard to the movement of windows, I will expect to hear further from you when you have had an opportunity of considering this matter.\n\nBernard F.

I immediately called Hall Brothers, plumbers of Cardston, who, after pulling the rods, reported that there was no water in the well. Wm. Maughan, Well Driller of Lethbridge was then called and reported that a new well would have to be drilled.\n\nMr. Maughan stated that he cleaned this well out in March 1941 and at that time stated that the well might last five weeks and might last five years, but that a new well should be drilled soon. The casing was very thin and pitted at that time and he expected it to give way at any time; that is what has happened now and, according to Mr. Maughan, there is no remedy but a new well. See Mr. MacMillan's correspondence on his accompanying Voucher No. 408 of March 7, 1941.\n\nThe present well is 144 feet deep and Mr. Wm. Maughan quotes a price of $2.00 per foot for drilling a new well and $2.00 per foot for 6\" casing - until his present casing is used up and after that $2.25 per foot for casing - he believes however that he has enough casing for this well at $2.00. This well driller cannot get to this job until around the 19th instant but has promised to come as soon as possible if authority is granted for a new well.\n\nMay this be treated as urgent and authority given for the expenditure of approximately $600.00 for the drilling of a new well at this school.

Snelson, of the Banff Engineering Service, submitted a tender from Mr. Ralph Weston, shingling contractor, to re-roof the St. Paul's School with his letter of October 21st, 1947 - addressed to the Chief Engineer, Engineering & Construction Service, Ottawa - we have had no word re this job since.\n\nOn a recent inspection at this school it was found that snow melting on the roof is coming through and that plaster on the ceiling is falling in great gobs - if something is not done with the roof soon we will have a complete plastering job too. As a matter of fact, the interior plaster of practically every room is damaged to various degrees - and all of it is stained with water coming through the old roof.\n\nCould this matter not be reviewed again? You will note that in Mr. Snelson's letter of October 21st he states that unquestionably something should be done at once - before the onset of last winter. That winter has now come and gone but if something is not done before the spring rains the damage that will be caused will be terrific.\n\nR.D.

Mines & Resources, OTTAWA, Canada.\n\nAttached hereto is a requisition, in triplicate, for a 250 loaf capacity bake oven urgently needed for the St. Paul's Indian Residential School, Blood Reserve, Cardston, Alberta. Also attached is a cut of the type of oven needed and a letter from General Steel Wares Ltd., Calgary regarding an oven.\n\nThe existing oven at St. Paul's School has been worn out for years, the lower deck is completely burned out and cannot be used at all while the upper deck does a very poor job of baking and is near the burned out stage. I was called to the School a week or so ago when the grates had fallen out of this oven and with the help of baling wire and scrap iron these were patched up, but there is no doubt but that this oven can be used but a few weeks more; it is hopeless.\n\nYou will note that the need of a bake oven was listed first as equipment most needed in the report submitted by the Nutrition Division of the Department of National Health and Welfare upon the St. Paul's School. A bake oven was also included in the Estimates for the Blood Reserve, 1948/49, for this school.\n\nIt is hoped that this requisition can be given immediate attention, for the need is urgent.\n\nR.D. Fegan,\nSuperintendent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6373, file 764-5, part 8)\nJanuary 20, 1948.\n\nMr. R.D. Ragan, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Cardston, Alberta.\n\nPlease find attached a copy of the report submitted by the Nutrition Division of the Department of National Health and Welfare upon the St. Paul's Indian Residential School.\n\nYou will note that the sanitary and hygienic conditions are very clean and tidy and that the food quality is good. The report shows that the foods are suitably prepared and cooked for immediate service. If the family service system were introduced here, it is felt that a great improvement could be made.\n\nA copy of this report has been sent to the M.S.C.C. and will be forwarded to the principal of this school in the near future. When you have ascertained that his report has arrived would you please discuss this matter at some length with him and forward your comments to the Department for action.\n\nIt would seem that the main problem at this school is the provision of an adequate dough mixer.\n\n(Signed) Bernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\ncould it would not be feasible from the standpoint of training or convenience. I have written, under separate cover, regarding the immediate need of a bake oven and have forwarded a requisition for same together with prices and literature from General Steel Wares Ltd., of Calgary, who claim to be able to supply in four months time. It is hoped that an oven can be ordered immediately and that the present relic will hang together until delivery can be made.\n\nBread mixer. This is certainly needed - the work of mixing great quantities of dough is far too great for the pupils and even the grown staff. We hope to have a greatly increased attendance at this school in the new term and a mixer will then be an absolute necessity. It would be very desirable if a bread mixer could be installed at the same time the new oven is put in this school - the two should certainly go together and make for more efficient production with much less manual labor.\n\nPotato Peeler. A potato peeler should be secured for this school and would be another big labor saver. We should be able to secure a suitable peeler from War Assets; I shall look into this the next time I am in Calgary and report. It would be appreciated also if War Assets at Ottawa could be interviewed regarding any of these machines which might be for sale.\n\nWalk-in Refrigerator. A necessity which has been brought to the attention of the Department and turned down in the past. For sanitation and health and for the convenience of the Staff, a walk-in refrigerator should be installed in the near future.\n\nBread slicer. We should be able to secure this machine, inexpensively, from War Assets along with the potato peeler, - it will be a great help and should not cost much. Could War Assets, Ottawa, be approached regarding a bread slicer - when information is asked re the potato peeler; I shall see what is in Calgary stores.\n\nElectric Mixer: A household type mixer is what Miss McCready suggests - not a necessity, but very useful nevertheless. One can be secured locally for approximately $50.00.\n\nCovering of Table Tops. There are twenty tables in the dining room of this school, each 8' x 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)', making a total of 560 sq. ft. of table surface to be covered; at the same time we would\nneed approximately 500' of aluminum beading for the edges. These tables are badly worn and should be covered with either battleship linoleum or tempered masonite; the masonite, I believe, makes the neatest and most durable surface as well as being most economical. With pupils of the school doing the work, under the able direction of their woodworking instructor, this whole project could be completed for about $250.00, if authority were given.\n\nWhile we are discussing tables, I would like to see the 'family service' system inaugurated at this school. This system is used at our other Residential School and with very marked success. With this method the children get their food served hot, they take only what they can eat which makes for a considerable saving, and at the same time learn valuable table manners. This method also makes for a neater dining room and I am sure the pupils enjoy it much more in that each table is one little happy family rather than the long tables stretching across the room, without any individuality, where the food is placed on the plates in the kitchen and brought to the table - cold when eaten. Miss McCready, in her report, mentions this system and I am sure would like to see it started.\n\nThe tables that we now have could be used, if repaired, as individual tables, but some form of chairs would have to be secured - and the benches that are now used thrown out. We would also need covered serving dishes for each table.\n\nIf the Department would consider starting this system of dining at the St. Paul's School, I would be only too glad to secure complete prices on all necessary items.\n\nCovering of floors. The kitchen floor in this school is of cement - it should be covered with linoleum for the Staff's sake; however, with the scarcity of this item it is believed that this will have to wait for the present.\n\nAdditions of necessary cooking utensils. Additions of large kettles and mixing bowls, as recommended by Miss McCready, have been purchased by the Principal and are now in use.\n\nDishwashing unit. This was asked for last year - at a cost of $950.00, but funds at that time did not warrant the purchase. We mean to ask for this item at the beginning of the coming fiscal year again - as it is badly needed - and we hope that purchase can be effected at that time.\nIn closing, we would like to point out that the St. Paul's Residential School - as a structure - is badly run down. This is due in part to age and also to the lack of upkeep during the war years. The roof, of course, is the big thing and the leakage caused by it has been instrumental in doing a great deal of damage to the interior walls and ceilings. Some plastering is now badly needed and the entire building, inside and out, needs paint in the worst way. The water system has not been working perfectly, and the last blow has been the failure of the well, which has given out (authority has been asked for the drilling of a new one). Equipment for the most part is very old and has seen too many years of service - this mainly in the boy's and girl's wash rooms. The old tin wash troughs are eaten out and leaking and should be replaced with wash bowls. Some toilets have just recently been replaced, but many others will have to be scrapped - and soon.\n\nWe appreciate that a great many of these things cannot be secured - and we shall have to make haste slowly, but the Staff are working under many difficulties at the present time and it is hoped that many of the improvements and replacements suggested in this letter can be effected soon.\n\nSeasonal repairs and improvements, such as painting, will be requested during the proper season.\n\nWe would also like to point out at this time that this School hopes to have a new classroom block ready for occupancy by next September, and if this becomes a reality the school attendance will increase enormously - making it all the more essential that the improvements asked for are installed.\n\nR.D.

The need of something to be done to the roof of this school was brought to the attention of Engineer W.H. Snelson, of the Banff Engineering Service, on one of his visits to this Reserve in October of 1947. He agreed to the urgent need - we secured a tender for the job and this Mr. Snelson forwarded to the Department with his letter of October 21, 1947 - we have, however, heard nothing since. The matter was again brought to the Department's attention by my letter of the 5th instant and it is hoped that something can be done at once.\n\nBake oven. The present two-deck oven at this school is absolutely worthless and beyond any hope of repair - it must be replaced at once.

Buildings No's 12 at Pearce and No. 38 at Macleod with a view to moving to the Blood Indian Reserve; the road over which we will have to travel has also been inspected.\n\nThese buildings are in good shape with approximately three foot foundations and cement piers under each; the building at Macleod has forty cement piers under it. The road is not good and will have to be bulldozed in many places, cost of this is included in our tender.\n\nWe will contract to Move Buildings No's 12 and 38 to sites on the Blood Reserve selected by yourself; to move the two hot water heating boilers that go with the buildings; to salvage all gas and water pipes and sewer lines; to move all cement piers with buildings if needed; to cap all water and gas mains and to haul all cement foundations from present sites and restore these sites as called for by War Assets Corporation and to place these buildings on your foundations and tie them together for the sum of $6,800.00 (Sixty eight hundred dollars).\n\nBy tying the buildings together, we mean to add an extra rafter, floor stud and wall stud all round and fit the whole building together and nail in place; we will also place heating boilers where wanted, etc.\n\nFor reference I would refer you to the Canadian Sugar Factories at Raymond or to Mr. Mark Mann of the P.F.R.A. for whom we have moved many buildings, with complete satisfaction.\n\nIf given this contract we would start on the moving job almost immediately.\n\nYours truly,\n\nKAUGHMAN & SONS\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mines & Resources, OTTAWA, Canada.\n\nRe: Your Files 103-1-5 E & 103-2-5\n\nSince forwarding you written tenders from H.J. Roelofs of Lethbridge re the moving of buildings No's 12 at Pearce and 38 at Macleod it has been brought to my attention that War Assets Corporation demand that the original site or the buildings be restored. As Roelofs had been asked for a price of moving the buildings only I immediately got in touch with him and learned that his tender did not include restoring the original site, salvaging any pipe or cutting off gas and water mains.\n\nAt this time Kaughman & Sons had just finished doing a very fine job of moving I.D. Welfare buildings for us and they were asked to tender on this job, including in their tender restoring the site, salvaging pipe, sewer line, etc., capping gas and water mains and hauling the two large hot water heating boilers to the Reserve. Their tender, in the amount of $6800.00 is enclosed.\n\nThis tender is $2200.00 higher than the one for just moving the buildings. However, cost of restoring these two sites will be no small problem; the existing concrete foundations and pillars will all have to be hauled away and the ground bulldozed back level. Also, under the Kaughman tender all gas and water pipe and all sewer pipe will be salvaged for us which will be of considerable value. Mr. Roelofs was asked to quote on this work, but was only interested in moving the buildings as per his original tender.\n\nThis is brought to your attention at this time so that the added expense may be anticipated. Mr. Roelofs has not been told that his tender is accepted and I do believe that it would be good business to allow Kaughman & Sons to do the entire job at the price tendered; from experience we know they do very fine work.\nWe are endeavoring to get prices on the cost of foundations for these buildings as quickly as possible; we have taken a contractor to look over the buildings and the sites and from very rough figures he places the cost at around $1000.00 for the two foundations. We shall have written tenders for these as soon as final plans and arrangements are made.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could let us know by return Air Mail whether you consider it advisable to accept Kaughman & Sons tender for the moving of these buildings, restoring the site, etc. He is very anxious to know as soon as possible as he has a large crew of men without work at the moment that he could put on this job.\n\nR.D.

Ragan,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nI am returning your requisition which you forwarded last July for equipment for the classroom block at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School. We did not order the articles last July, as we felt they should not be supplied until the building was nearly completed.\n\nOur reason for returning this requisition is due to the fact that we consider the quantities of the different articles requested are in many cases excessive. For instance, why does the school request 10 looms? Unless you feel it is necessary to supply an electric floor polisher to both the St. Paul's and Blood Residential Schools, we do not feel that this item of equipment should be supplied to the St. Paul's Residential School.\n\nIt is not our custom to supply blankets, bedspreads, sheets and quilts except when a residential school first opens. Replacement of such articles is made by the school management. There has been no increase in the pupilage at the St. Paul's School, and consequently, we do not feel prepared to supply the articles listed under the heading \"Dormitories\", unless there is some reason why special consideration should be given.\n\nWhat has been stated regarding the items under the heading \"Dormitories\" applies also to the items listed under the heading \"Dining Room\".\nWith reference to the 80 desks requested, we would like to know the sizes required, namely the number of large, medium and small desks.

The entire interior of the main school building needs painting badly.\n\nIf the Department can give us a stated amount which can be expended for painting, having in mind the other necessary work that must be done, we can then ask the contractor to give us a tender on the most necessary painting. McClung and Son of Cardston, charge $1.50 per hour each for two foremen, and $1.25 per hour each for other painters. They will furnish materials at cost, or this can be furnished by the Department Purchasing Agent. It would be appreciated and would simplify matters, if we were allowed to employ these painters on this basis, doing all the painting possible on the amount allowed by the Department. If this is not possible, then we will endeavor to get prices and quantities of paint as accurately as possible up to the amount allowed by the Department.\n\n(R.D.

After looking the situation over, I rather doubt that a heating stove is necessary and would leave this equipment in abeyance for the time being until the new Principal moves in. If a heater were supplied, it would be an ordinary tall coal heater, medium size.\n\nAs regards the cook stove, an average size cook stove should be supplied, coal burning. Archdeacon Middleton now has an electric cook stove installed in the kitchen which he is willing to sell for $100.00. This stove is already hooked up to the Calgary Power line and is in very good condition. Here again, however, as in all the furnishings for the Principal's residence, I hesitate to make any recommendations as the new Principal's tastes may be far different from mine; I would suggest that he be allowed to make his own decision as regards the cook stove.\n\nThe measurements of the dining room are 15 x 24 and the sitting room are 15 x 27 and 25 yards of stair carpeting are needed.\n\nWe are glad to see that local purchase of curtain material is allowed and it would seem to me to be much more satisfactory for the incoming Principal, if he were allowed also to choose his carpeting, cook stove, and, in fact, all furniture.; I am sure that with the Government discounts we receive we can do as well in purchasing as anyone.\n\n(R.D.

Archdeacon Middleton gave me the measurements of the dining room as $15' \\times 24'$ and the sitting room as $15' \\times 27'$; when Mr. Pitts checked these measurements, however, he has found that both rooms are, according to him, $12' \\times 18'$; therefore the size of the carpets will be substantially different than previously reported.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Pitts have also looked at the small electric stove which Archdeacon Middleton wishes to sell; they do not wish this stove however, but did request that an electric stove be provided instead of a coal cook stove and in this request I would concur. Mrs. Pitts has also voiced her hope that an electric refrigerator can be supplied, which, I believe, is a reasonable request.\n\nAs previously stated, it would be so much more satisfactory if the Department could allow the Pitts' to choose their own furnishings under my supervision, and getting Government discount, submitting all prices and descriptions to the Department before any actual purchases were made.

Although prices were also secured from the Hudsons Bay Co., the T.Eaton Co. prices were much better and the Eaton Co. could supply all furnishings required where the Hudsons Bay could only supply a portion of what they need. All goods shown on the attached estimate are quoted f.o.b., the School on the Blood Reserve for immediate delivery if the tender is accepted.\n\nAs this offers the most satisfactory way of furnishing the Principal's Residence so that he can occupy same in the shortest possible time, it is hoped that wired authority can be given the T.Eaton Co. of Calgary for the supplying of these necessary furnishings. Mr. Pitts and myself have carefully gone over this list and I can assure you that every bit of equipment is needed and I believe you will find the prices very reasonable.\n\n(R.D.

Ragan - Superintendent\n\nGentlemen:\n\nFurther to our discussion with Mr. D. L. Pitts of the St. Pauls Anglican School, we are advised that they will require Frigidaire equipment to cool a walk-in cooler which will measure 11'6\" x 9'4\" x 8' high outside the cooler.\n\nThe cooler should be insulated with 6\" of Fiberglas insulation in all walls, ceiling and floor, and to maintain a 36 - 38\u00b0 temperature, with a product load of approximately 500 lbs. per day, we would suggest the following Frigidaire equipment:\n\n1 - Model CAK75T heavy-duty air-cooled Frigidaire Compressor unit.\n1 - Model CO620 heavy-duty Blower type cooling unit.\n\nTo properly insulate the cooler would require approximately 575 sq. ft. of 6\" Fiberglas; 1 roll Vapor-proof Paper; 1 gallon Asphalt; 1 - either 2'6\" or 3'5\" x 6'6\" refrigerator door; 2- 30\" x 30\" service doors for the side wall of the cooler.\n\nThe supply on the installation of the above equipment and material, but assuming that the actual construction of the cabinet and walk-in cooler would be made on the premises, with us supplying the required insulation, would be $1,057.00 F.O.B. Cardston.\n\nFor your information we have this equipment in stock and could supply the insulation when required, and the Frigidaire equipment when installation and insulation of the cooler had been completed.\n\nThe price quoted does not include the electrical wiring of which we are not aware as to what would be\nrequired, but this could be done locally.\n\nWe thank you for the opportunity of quoting on your requirements, and will look forward to being of further service to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBRUCE ROBINSON ELECTRIC LTD.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDKA/mm\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA, Ont.\n\nRe: Walk-In Refrigerator, St. Paul's Residential School.\n\nYou will recall that a walk-in refrigerator is badly needed at the St. Paul's Residential School and installation of this equipment was put over from the last fiscal year until this fiscal year. Mr. D.L. Pitts, who recently took over as Principal of this School, now informs me that the Department are ready to go ahead with the installation of this important equipment.\n\nWe have, therefore, had a refrigerator expert from the Bruce Robinson Electric Co., Calgary, inspect the School and give us his recommendations and prices; copy of which is enclosed. This walk-in cooler is to be installed inside the School proper, between the kitchen and the milk room in what is now a storeroom; this will make a very convenient arrangement. We have asked Mr. Tom Weston, Contractor of Cardston, to give us an estimate on building this refrigerator room according to the Bruce Robinson Electric Company's specifications; copy of this also attached. This would make the complete cost of the cabinet and walk-in cooler, including the installation and supplying of the frigidaire equipment, etc., not including the electrical wiring $2,395.60.\n\nIt is respectfully recommended that the enclosed two tenders be accepted as quickly as possible so that the St. Paul's School might have refrigeration at the earliest possible moment.\n\n(R.D.

Neary,\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, file 764-5(F.6) regarding furniture for the Principal's Residence at the St. Paul's Residential School, Blood Indian Reserve.\n\nThe Purchase Order No.47192 accompanying your letter certainly did not please anyone on this Reserve, in fact, Mr. Pitts is very upset over the whole matter. It does not seem logical nor fair to me to supply the quality of furniture shown on this Purchase Order; most of it is inferior grade as well as being unfinished, certainly not the quality that should go in a Principal's residence. I believe that Mr. Pitts telephoned you regarding this, and it is hoped that Purchase Order No.47192 can be cancelled and Mr. and Mrs. Pitts' own selections from the T.Eaton Company, Calgary, substituted.\n\nRegarding local purchase of curtaining as mentioned in your letter of the 25th instant, we intend to purchase the entire list of curtaining, etc., shown on page three of the T.Eaton Co., Calgary, estimate forwarded with our letter of the 8th instant.\n\nPresuming that Purchase Order No.47192 cannot be cancelled, we therefore, are revising our list as instructed in the last paragraph of your letter of the 25th instant, to cover the balance of furnishings needed; this list is taken directly from the estimate submitted by the T.Eaton Co., Calgary, and forwarded with our letter of the 8th instant, and is attached hereto as a requisition. We hope that immediate local purchase can be authorized for these furnishings.\n\nRegarding the memorandum from the Departmental Purchasing Agent, dated August 19th, included with your letter of the 25th regarding rugs. Necessary rugs, carpeting, etc., selected by Mr. and Mrs. Pitts and which we believe most necessary, are included on the attached requisition with prices as submitted by the T.Eaton Co., Calgary.\n\nWe note that the electric stove has been requisitioned for to the Purchasing Agent and we hope this will arrive in the very near future so that the Pitts' can start living.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6373, file 764-5, part 9)\nWe trust that this whole furnishing situation can be cleared up as soon as possible so that Mr. and Mrs. Pitts can be content in their new position.\n\n(R.D. Ragan)\nSuperintendent\n\nAtt: 2\n\nRDR/S\nColonel B.F. Neary,\nSupt. Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nThis is to offer my sincere apologies for that rather hasty phone call of yesterday morning.\n\nWe were so disappointed at the list of furniture that we noted was dated August 18th and which we thought was in reply to our urgent request for the furniture for our house.\n\nMr. Ragan told us that you had been out of the office and we assumed that possibly some clerk not familiar with the situation had undertaken to equip a small day school teacherage.\n\nImmediately after the phone call we received a letter from Canon Cook in which he stated that you had purchased very generously for our residence. Your own reassurance over the phone gave me considerable encouragement.\n\nRealizing the heavy expense, we had been careful to choose with an eye to cost and Eaton's had offered us bargains over and above the Sale Prices. The residence is an 8-roomed house, but because of the expense, we had planned on leaving two rooms very sketchy. When we went to Kenora we were faced with a similar situation, and at that time we proceeded in the same manner as this time.\n\nWe find that the Staff rooms are very poorly furnished, (partly due to the fact that the existing furniture must be spread more thinly among an increasing Staff) and we wonder if this first order can be used in the main school and the new school block, to help out that situation?\n\nWe have always appreciated your sympathetic understanding in the past, and hope that we are still on the old friendly basis.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have already promised Mr. Pitts the use of our machinery for breaking land for this school and I have approached the Council with favourable results regarding the school being allowed the use of more land.\n\nThere are many things that the St. Paul's Residential School must have immediately and we are endeavoring to get tenders on these requirements. Foremost among these is a need for new basins in the boys' and girls' washrooms, the existing tin troughs are completely rusted out. The sewer and septic tank have also caused trouble and I now have men working to rectify this. Painting requirements were very essential before school begins and we have the painters working at the present time at the school. Mr. Pitts has alterations which he would like done in the Classroom block by tearing out partitions and making larger classrooms, which was discussed at the time of your visit last year; a tender for this work will be submitted as soon as possible.\n\nAs stated before, the whole atmosphere at this school has changed for the better and we expect within the year to have this school back on its feet.\n\n(R.D.

We are attaching herewith a sketch showing how we propose to make three larger classrooms from the four existing small classrooms and put more windows in each end of the building, thereby giving more light. This will make a much nicer classroom block with more room and better light, and it is hoped that authority can be given to do this work.\n\nAttached hereto as estimate by Ralph Weston, Contractor, Cardston, to do this work for the sum of $275.00. Mr. Weston will use material taken from the one partition where possible and very little other material will be needed. We believe this estimate is very reasonable.\n\n(R.D.

Colonel Neary also viewed this classroom block and it was he who first suggested the alterations which we propose. I have asked Mr. D.S. Pitts, Principal of this school to give me the information asked for in your letter of the 1st and he has measured all rooms as requested and given other data which is attached hereto. Dr. Falconer and Dr. Stone recently visited this Reserve and were shown our ideas in regard to the new plan and they heartily endorse it from a health standpoint as it improves the cubic air space, the ventilation and lighting.\n\nWe note your remarks regarding the reports of the Alberta School Inspector indicating that considerable changes are required in the organization of the classroom work at this school. We are glad to advise that many changes have been made, all for the good, and more changes will be made if alterations as indicated can be carried out. The discipline, organization, cleanliness and general improvement at this school during the past two months is tremendous and we believe that Mr. Pitts should be encouraged to further carry on his good work.\n\nIt is hoped that with the data and detail attached authority can be given to proceed with the alterations to the classroom block which we believe will improve classroom conditions at this school tremendously.\n\nR.D.

I am sorry I did not have the opportunity of discussing these installations with you at the time of my visit as your office was locked each time I called.\n\nThese installations, since first being made, have had additional loads connected and the present services are overloaded. The method used for wiring the main buildings is conductors run with present requirements, with the exception that all neutrals are fused, and circuits are badly over-fused. Considerable use has been made of extension cord to secure additional outlets and this creates a fire hazard as well as personal hazard.\n\nThe distribution panel in the St. Paul's School and the main switch board in the St. Mary's School are of the open terminal type with exposed live connections when changing fuses or operating starters. The outside and wiring in each case should be overhauled to provide adequate clearance between conductors, from ground, and over buildings, and decayed and undersized poles replaced to restore the distribution to a safe condition.\n\nThe following corrections were felt advisable in the interests of safety and are listed under the name of the School to which they apply:\n\nST. PAUL'S SCHOOL:\n1. Increase the service entrance conductors and conduit to a minimum of 225 amps. capacity, with a #2 gauge wire run to the water line. This will require No. 4-0 wire in #2 conduit. The service must be located in an accessible location so that it will not be necessary to stand on the meter to operate switches or work on equipment.\n2. Remove all fuses from neutrals.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6373, file 764-5, part 9)\nMr. R.D. Ragan, Carleton,\nRe: 19th Sept., 1949.\n\nST. PAUL'S SCHOOL - Cont'd\n\n3. Check existing lighting and receptacle branch circuits to limit the load per circuit to not more than 15 amps., and reduce the fuses in these circuits to not more than 15 amps. This may require installation of additional circuits to remove excess loads from present circuits. It is recommended the open terminal panel be replaced with a dead front panel.\n\n4. Remove extension cords used as permanent wiring or replace with approved wiring in conduit or metal moulding.\n\n5. Install separate circuits for the irons in the laundry. These outlets to be equipped with an indicating switch and pilot lamp.\n\n6. Rewire in conduit the line from the outlet box in the machine room to the pump motor in the pump room.\n\n7. Outgoing feeds from the building to the yard distribution to have at least 8 ft. of clearance over the garage roof and 12\" between conductors.\n\n8. Provide fuse protection and a ground at the horse barn.\n\n9. Change service into the cow barn to 250 volts, installing a ground and providing a separate circuit for the 1 H.P. motor and another circuit for lighting. This barn is wired with BX cable which is not approved for damp locations and should be replaced with knob and tube wiring using solid knobs.\n\n10. Rewire the chicken house with knob and tube wiring, installing fuse protection at entrance.\n\nST. MATTHEW'S SCHOOL:\n\n1. Increase the present service entrance to a minimum of 275 amps. capacity, running a ground wire of #2 gauge to the water line and install a gutter at the distribution centre.\n\n2. Install switches or pull fuse panel to provide adequate protection for the various circuits and feeders.\n\n3. Replace live front switch board with a dead front panel or switches.\n\n4. Remove fuses from all neutral conductors.\n\n5. Check existing lighting and receptacle branch circuits to limit the load per circuit to not more than 15 amps., and reduce the fuses in these circuits to not more than 15 amps.\n\n6. Rewire the garage using approved wiring methods and properly supporting the service drop to this building so as to clear the overhead pipe from the water tower to the School.\nMr. R.D. Ragan, Cardston.\n\nSt. Mary's School - Cont'd.\n\n7. The basement of the chapel has been disconnected and this should be rewired in conduit before being reconnected.\n\nI trust these changes, which are in the interests of safety to life and property, will be given your earliest attention.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Bread Mixer, St. Paul (Church of England)\nIndian Residential School\n\nSome time ago Superintendent Ragan asked us to inspect and report on a second-hand dough mixer offered for sale by the Trading Post, a Calgary firm dealing in surplus war materials. The machine they had for sale at $750.00 was a Glen Power Plus Mixer, size 60 to 80 quart, with variable speed and speed meter, and a one horse power 220-3 phase motor.\n\nThe matter was taken up with Major Clark and he suggested that it might be just as economical for the school to purchase bread. However, the Principal, Mr. Pitts, has since advised that it is more economical to bake their bread because they apparently use a considerable amount of bread each month. In the meantime Mr. Pitts saw the dough mixer offered for sale by the local firm and although he stated that it was just the machine they required, it has apparently been sold. The firm has another similar machine coming in within the next few days which they are offering at $700.00.\n\nIn view of the fact that a rather expensive bake oven has just been supplied to this school, I think we should purchase the dough mixer for them provided funds are available.\n\nYour comments at your convenience would be appreciated.\n\nG.

Ragan, Supt.,\nBlood Agency,\nGARSTON, Alberta.\n\nRe: Power Lines\n\nDear Mr. Ragan:\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon October 25th, Cooper's large truck loaded with beds, mattresses, etc., touched one of our overhead power lines and pulled over one of the posts, dropping the lines down to the ground.\n\nThis created a serious condition in the boys' playground and we had to cut off the power at the main switch.\n\nTherefore, it was necessary to call out an electrician to repair our wires to give service to the school. This was fortunately assisted by the use of the large truck and gin poles of Mr. Naughan, the well driller who placed our new poles into their prepared holes.\n\nIt was this condition and danger which has been prompting us for some time to have the wires raised to a proper level. We still have 220 volt wiring just eight feet above the boys' playground which is a temptation for them to touch the wires.\n\nWe again request that you will draw this danger to the attention of the Department so that the recommendations recently made by the electrical inspector may be speedily carried out.\n\nMay we also request permission to forward to the Department for payment the account of the electrician for this emergency repair job?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nCopies: Mr. Ragan (2)\nCemon Cook (1)\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am attaching a copy of a report which he forwarded me for your information, please.\n\nR.D. Ragan,\nSuperintendent,\nBlood Indian Reserve.\n\nRDR/MR\nEnc. 1\nCopy to: G.H. Gooderham, Esq.\nBUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE\n\nKitchen and storerooms should be of a non-absorbent material and painted with enamel so that surfaces may be washed.\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\nThe dining room tables are in poor repair, that is, warped. New tables covered with a non-absorbent material are recommended. A kitchen work table also requires covering.\n\nDISHES AND UTENSILS\n\nThere are a number of cracked and chipped cups.\n\nCLEANING AND STERILIZING OF DISHES AND UTENSILS\n\nDishwashing facilities are considered inadequate. A three compartment sink and drainboards of a non-corrodible material are recommended to meet Provincial standards. The first sink is used to wash, second to rinse and the third to sterilize with a chlorine or quaternary ammonium compound.\n\nFOOD STORAGE\n\nThere is signs of mice in the storeroom.\n\nREFRIGERATION\n\nRefrigeration is inadequate and results in open displays of food i.e., butter, cooked meat, vegetables, etc. An attempt has been made to keep these foods cool in the dairy room, which although it is cooler than adjoining rooms still does not refrigerate food and is most unsuitable from a public health viewpoint.\n\nTOILETS AND WASHROOMS\n\nSome toilet seats are needed and it is understood that improved hand washing facilities are soon to be installed.\n\nThe present metal covered wooden table is in an unsanitary condition due to the corrosion and rusting away of the metal, thus allowing water to penetrate beneath it. The present enamel handbasins are badly chipped and cannot be kept clean.\n\nGARBAGE\n\nMore metal covered receptacles are required for proper disposal.\nSt. Paul's Report Contd.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS\n\nThere is a fairly heavy infestation of cockroaches in the kitchen and laundry room. An insecticide and powder is being used.\n\nTHE BAKESHOP\n\nIs generally clean, but it was noted that the wooden lids of the troughs used for storage of bread are in a very poor state of repair and cannot be kept clean. Also, the present arrangement used for the mixing of bread i.e., a series of wash tubs in which the dough is kneaded by the youngsters cannot be regarded as a good method of handling. A mixer is recommended.\n\nThe dairy room requires simple racks for the storage of pails and utensils. A small pipe or 2\" x 2\" is easily kept clean. A few pails are corroded.\n\nCooling of milk to 50\u00b0 immediately after milking is essential to good quality. This may be done by the use of the water cooled can plunger method or immersion in a tank of cold water.\n\nThe sterilizing of dairy utensils with a chlorine rinse is advocated, as in the washing of the cows udders prior to milking.\n\n(Signed)\n\nJ.E.

We have reviewed the preceding correspondence, and while we feel that we authorized these items, we want to make the matter absolutely clear, and consequently, we are again approving an expenditure of $342.60 for Mr. Weston and $25.00 for the wiring.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nOttawa, Ont., Nov. 15, 1949.\n\nG.H.

This is due to the fact that the amount provided in the current year's appropriation in connection with the classroom at the above school has been exhausted, and it is necessary to transfer funds from another project.\n\nIt will probably be a week before we can have approval of this transfer, but as soon as we do, the balance will be forwarded to Mr. Weston.\n\nIn the meantime, we would like to have a definite statement from you to the effect that the building has been satisfactorily completed and that both the Principal and yourself are satisfied with it.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nAttention: Mr. Phelan,\n\nRe: Bread Mixer - St. Paul's Indian Residential School, Blood Reserve.\n\nFurther to our letter of October 24th, file 103-48-2 and subsequent wires, \"The Trading Post,\" a company dealing in second-hand equipment has today offered a Hobart 40-80 Bread Mixer complete with:\n\n- 1 80 quart bowl\n- 1 40 quart bowl\n- 1 dough hook\n- 2 batter beaters\n- 1 basket beater\n- 1 sharpening stone\n\nThe serial number of the machine is 136833 and is operated by a one and a half H.P., 110 single phase motor #69277.\n\nThis is offered for immediate delivery at $750.00.\n\nI have inspected the machine and listened to it run. All visible parts and exterior are in good condition; the motor runs smoothly and the gears sound as though they were also in good condition. I was also advised that this machine had been operated in a small country bakery which had gone to the wall. I would say that it had not been overworked and that in my judgment it is a good buy and would be very suitable for the needs of this residential school.\n\nImmediate repairs are not anticipated and if and when such were required, the parts can be readily secured, as it is a standard machine.\n\nKindly wire if the purchase is authorized as the 'Trading Post' can place it elsewhere.\n\nG.

Your File 103/6-1-2\n\nWe have your letter of the 14th instant with reference to certain second hand equipment which has been offered to you for use at the above school.\n\nWe have interviewed the office of the Hobart Company in Ottawa, and from the serial number on the machine, it appears that it is approximately 30 years old. However, it may be in good condition provided it has been reconditioned recently. It is pointed out that a 2 HP motor would be preferable to the 1\u00bd HP motor which is now attached to the machine.\n\nWe were informed that the Hobart Company has in stock from time to time reconditioned machines of a similar type, and their usual price for such equipment is $725.00. If we purchased the machine mentioned in your letter and desired to have it reconditioned, it would cost us approximately $350.00.\n\nA new machine of the type mentioned would cost approximately $1,500.00, and we were also informed that it was not intended for 1 bag of flour, but only for 65 lbs.\n\n......2\nDo you consider that a machine of this type is actually necessary for St. Paul's School? It would appear that a less costly machine would meet the requirements.\n\nI suggest that the Principal and yourself visit the Hobart office at Calgary and look over their catalogue and make another recommendation to us.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F.

To explain - Mr. Weston carried out his contract to the letter in amount of $198.28, but when the doors were repaired and rehung, the old wooden Threshold, which was entirely worn out, left a gap of over an inch under the doors. To finish this job as it should be done, I gave authority for Mr. Weston to install a 5 Ft. Aluminum Threshold, which he did at a price of $9.50, bringing the entire job up to $207.78.\n\nWe will destroy our original voucher and attach hereto two vouchers No. 739, in amount of $198.28, covering authority of your letter 764-5 (E.1) of April 21st; and voucher 739A in amount of $9.50, as extra to contract on this authority; it is hoped that this latter can be approved and paid.\n\nR.

Mr. D. S. Pitts, Principal, reports that he inspected the boiler in the Classroom Block at 11:00 p.m. and fired it up and Tom Prairie Chicken, an Indian, was to fire up at 4:00 a.m. At 7:00 a.m. when another man came on duty the fire was very low, and the pipe in the tunnel connecting the School and the Classroom Block had frozen and burst. There was no heat in the radiators and no circulation, and it was impossible with no water to bring any heat into the building. Hall Brothers, Plumbers at Cardston, were called but were out with another frozen pipe job and had worked all night the night before and could not come. Therefore Mr. J. C. Edgar, Plumbers of Macleod were called and appeared at the school with two helpers on the afternoon of the 2nd instant. All available staff at the school had worked up to this time changing pipes and trying to save other radiators from freezing, but\nWould you kindly bring these matters to the attention of the Department as soon as possible?

Clark Chidlow, Sales Representative.\nSt. Paul's Residential School\n\nD.S. Pitte, Principal\nCardston, Alberta\n\nAugust 23, 1949.\n\nSuperintendent R. Ragan,\nBlood Indian Reserve,\nCARDSTON, Alta.\n\nDear Supt. Ragan:\n\nRe: Fire Equipment\n\nAs discussed with you during visit of inspection to the school on Monday, August 15th, herewith we request the following equipment as absolutely essential immediately for Fire Protection in St. Paul's School.\n\nAs mutually agreed, further additions of inside hose would not be of much value since our water supply and water pressure could not handle more than one outlet at one time.\n\nHowever, we both feel that it is essential that the School be supplied with the large 2\u00bd gallon Soda and Acid type extinguisher. We require eleven (11) of this type to take care of 2 on each floor, and 1 each in Furnace Room, Kitchen, and Garage.\n\nOf secondary importance would be three (3) of the Pyrene type. One for each the shop, barn, and tractor shed. I say 'secondary', because the small type at present supplied could be used in these places.\n\nWe also need at least 500 feet of rubber lined outside hose of standard 1\u00bd\" couplings.\n\nThe alarm Bell system at present installed is not satisfactory, in that it can only be heard on the main floor. I would strongly recommend that two more Fire Alarm Bells of 10\" Diam. be purchased to install one on each side main building, upper floor. These could be connected with the present Alarm buttons so that all three could be rung from various floors by pressing any one button.\n\nRe Fire Escape. These are at present unsatisfactory in that (a) they must be entered through Staff Bedrooms, which are often kept locked, and (b) they follow the HERRICK stairwells. In case of fire the natural exit would be down the other stairway, rather than the fire escape. The entrances to fire escapes, should be from the dormitories. At present the Fire Escapes end on the roof of the Entrances, about 12' above the ground. Merely placing a ladder here would only assist unwanted night visitors. There should be a balanced steel ladder, counter-weighted.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I also attach a copy of a letter from Mr. D. S. Pitts, Principal of the St. Paul's School also regarding Fire Protection for his school.\n\nWe realize that funds are limited at Ottawa and that what the recommendations of the LaFrance Representative possibly can not be carried out at this time, but these letters are forwarded to give the Department a picture of things as they now exist.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. D. Hagen,\nSuperintendent,\nBlood Indian Reserve.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6373, file 764-5, part 9)\nwith no heat and the temperature outside 35 degrees below zero, this was practically impossible. As January 2nd was a statutory holiday, your office could not be contacted for authority to call in the Plumbers and it is hoped this action is approved.\n\nI have just returned from the School where the Plumbers have worked all night and now have some heat in the building (the temperature last night was 45 degrees below zero). It now appears that 100 sections of radiator is going to be required as well as about 25 ft. of 1 inch pipe and one toilet bowl which was broken - this material we estimate will come to approximately $400.00. We have had up to five Plumbers working and although it is very hard to say what their wages and transportation will come to we would estimate that another $250.00 will be required for wages. It is our intention to telephone your office and request that authority for $650.00 be requested by teletype from Ottawa.\n\nAs to the cause of this freezing, it would seem to me that it could be laid to three things:\n\n1. The Principal in order to conserve coal while the pupils were out on holiday had shut off every third radiator; with Hot Water System, we are quite sure that this should not have been done.\n\n2. The main water pipe feeding the boiler which came through the tunnel between the school and classroom block froze and burst thereby cutting all the water supply for the boiler.\n\n3. We very much doubt if Tom Prairie Chicken fired the classroom block boiler as ordered at 4:00 a.m., January 2nd.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. D.

This is a brand new machine and has never been used. Its specifications are as follows:\n\n1 Bag Mixer, Figure 4990, with Scraping Type Mixing Arm operating at 25 rpm and 1 HP Single Phase, 60 Cycle, 110-220 volts and push button starter.\n\nDo you consider the above would be suitable for the requirements of St. Paul's and if so we are prepared to transfer it.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n21 January, 1950.\n\nMr. R. D. Ragan,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nSt. Paul's Residential School\n\nYou will recall our previous correspondence concerning your action in having certain painting work carried out at the above school, without receiving the necessary authority.\n\nWe have many Indian day and residential schools in Canada and our repair and maintenance bill every year is a large one. It is only fair that we take reasonable precautions with the moneys provided and that we attempt to do as much work as possible with the funds voted by Parliament. This can only be done with the co-operation of our field officials.\n\nIn your letter of May 27 you advised that the painters would supply materials \"at cost\". You were told on June 4, 1949, to forward a requisition for the paint required at this school. The next we heard from you was on August 31, forwarding voucher No. 546 and attaching an account from McCullough and Son, totalling $1,524.55. You will be interested to note the figures underneath:\n\n| Item                  | Sherwin Williams Co. of Canada, Ltd. | British America Paint Co.

(RG 10, Volume 6373, file 764-5, part 9)\nThese other prices were obtained by the Departmental Purchasing Agent at my request and are f.o.b., Cardston, Alberta. The paint is similar to the product provided by Canadian Industries Limited.\n\nIf you will refer to the bill submitted by McClung & Son, you will see that the prices charged for materials by them are as follows:\n\n| Item       | Quantity | Price   |\n|------------|----------|---------|\n| 93 Gal. Tramlux |          | $5.75   |\n| 20 Gal. Undercoat |        | 5.25    |\n| 6 Gal. Sealer     |          | 5.80    |\n| 16 Gal. Dulux      |          | 10.00   |\n| 7 Gal. Turps       |          | 2.00    |\n\nTotal: $48.55\n\nYou will find by simple arithmetic, that the Department could have saved $378.81 or nearly 45% by buying the paint from Sherwin Williams Company. We could have saved $269.96 or nearly 30% by buying the paint from British American Paint Company Limited.\n\nYou can appreciate the Department's position in that we have a large number of schools to be painted every year. From the above it should be very obvious to you that the most economical way of doing this job is by purchasing paint directly from the manufacturer through the Departmental Purchasing Agent. We simply cannot carry out all the work required unless our Indian Superintendents comply with our instructions. This over-expenditure at the St. Paul's Residential School not only on this painting project but elsewhere, has resulted in other schools going short of funds and having to delay maintenance work which we had intended to finish during this fiscal year. The money we would have saved by buying this paint through our Departmental Purchasing Agent, could have been used to paint two one-room day schools.\n\nBernard F.

There is a large new oven, but the bread is still mixed in the old antiquated bowls by hand. I had suggested that the Superintendent and Principal investigate the possibilities of purchasing bread from Eskeries. They had done so and reported as per attached copy of letter from Mr. Ragan that this would not be economical at this Institution. A modern mixer should be supplied and I believe the Hobart Company type is suitable. I do not know of any other less costly machine which would meet their requirements.\n\nG. H.

We have discussed the question of a Bread Mixer in the St. Paul's school with Mr. Pitts, principal, and as this school uses over 3000 loaves of bread each month, Mr. Pitts states that it would be much more economical for this school to make their own bread. He also states that it has been found by experiment and trials that it is cheaper to buy bread if using less than 2000 loaves of bread a month, but cheaper to make bread if over this amount. Added to this would be the necessity of picking up boughten bread every other day or so, which with winter roads and conditions as they are here, would be uncertain. The St. Paul's school have had a new oven installed last year, and it would seem that this should be used.\n\nTherefore, it is our opinion that the St. Paul's school should make their bread and as suggested by the Superintendent of Education, Mr. Pitts will call at your office the next time he is in Calgary, so that some Bread Mixing Machine Company can be interviewed.\n\nR.

The cost of repairing, however, is going to run about $250.00 more than first anticipated. This is due to many more radiator sections being cracked than first estimated; these cracks were not visible and were only found after water was turned into the system. I now have J. C. Elgar and Sons, Plumbers, bill which amounts to $183.65; this will be vouchered for payment immediately. I have not as yet received Hall Brothers account, the Plumbers which secured the new sections, but they have estimated that their bill will amount to $725.00; this will be vouchered as soon as received.\n\nMr. Gooderham was with me on an inspection of the two schools on this reserve on the 11th and 12th instant, and he was shown where heat must be gotten into the connecting tunnels to the classroom blocks at each school to prevent the pipes in these tunnels from freezing, thereby causing a repetition of what we have just gone through.\n\nHall Brothers, Plumbers of Cardston, have been asked to give a firm tender on installing heat in each of these tunnels and when this tender is received it will be forwarded for your further study through Mr. Gooderham's office.\nIt is hoped that a further $250.00 expenditure on the St. Paul's heating system can be approved.\n\nR. D. Logan,\nSuperintendent,\nBlood Indian Reserve.\n\nRDR/1R\n\nCopy for Mr. Gooderham\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA, Ont.\n\nHerewith Voucher No. 546 in the amount of $1524.55 payable to McClung and Son, Painting Contractors of Cardston, for interior painting at the St. Paul's Indian Residential School, Blood Reserve.\n\nThe expenditure on painting was kept as close to the $1500.00 mark as possible in line with your letter of June 4th last, file No. 764-5(E.I). McClung and Son are very competent and trustworthy painters and they had a slack time during this month in which they could do the very necessary painting at the St. Paul's School. We had no time to forward requisitions for the paint to be used at the School, nor did we, at that time, know just how many gallons of each kind of paint would be required. McClung and Son agreed to furnish paint at cost price and complete the most urgent work selected by Mr. Pitts and myself, before school began and promised to keep as close to the $1500.00 mark as possible.\n\nIn order to get the work done before the School pupils came in, I, therefore, authorized this work and Mr. Pitts, myself and the Indians are very pleased with the work that has been done and with the way the School has been brightened up. We trust that our action can be approved and this account can be paid.\n\n(P.D. Hagan)\nSuperintendent\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6373, file 764-5, part 9)\nJune 4th, 1949.\n\nMr. R.D. Ragen,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 27th ultimo, your file 103/6-3, with reference to St. Paul's Indian Residential School.\n\nIn the appropriation for the present fiscal year we have provided an amount of $1,500.00 for repairs and painting at the above mentioned school. We also have approximately the same amount for equipment. We have already paid accounts to an amount of approximately $350.00. You will also recall our letters of May 16th, one of which referred to the furnace for the Principal's residence, and the other to the equipment lists that you forwarded to us in July of 1943.\n\nAll these requests will have to be kept in mind to see which is the most urgent. Would an amount of $1,500.00 for painting do the most necessary work required in the interior of the building this year? It would be understood, of course, that the amount mentioned would include both material and labour, and in the event of your agreeing with our suggestion, you should forward a requisition for the paint.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST Chief, Education Division\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ragan,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nRe: St. Paul's Indian Residential School.\n\nYour file 103-6-3 -\n\nWe have your letter of August 31, enclosing voucher No. 546 in the amount of $1,524.55, issued in favour of McClung & Son for interior painting at the above school. It is noted that you refer to official letter of August 4. There was no authority contained in that letter to proceed with the work. It simply pointed out the amount that we had available and requested further information in view of other expenditures that we were obliged to make. I cannot locate on our file any reply that you made to our letter of June 4 and it would appear that you had time between the date of the receipt of that letter and the time the painting was done to forward us a requisition for the paint.\n\nYou are also aware that expenditures of over $500.00 for labour have to be submitted for the Deputy Minister's approval. When we submit such requests we are obliged to give the name and address of the firm and, if possible, supply more than one tender. As we did not receive any information from you regarding the firm that was to be employed, naturally we have not received the Deputy Minister's approval.\n\nYour action in this regard has placed us in a very awkward position and it is really necessary to have more complete information from you explaining why you did not reply to our letter of June 4 and supply the name of the firm to be employed. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to Regional Supervisor Gooderham.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. Gooderham\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nDepartment of Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: St. Paul's Indian Residential School.\n\nI have your letter of the 27th of September file 764-5 (E1) regarding our voucher No. 345 in the amount of $1,524.58 for painting of the above school.\n\nIt is much regretted that a misunderstanding in this case has occurred. In our defense we must say that we believe we received the best value for the money spent that could possibly be obtained - all paint was of first quality and supplied at wholesale prices. The painting work itself was also of first quality and of a greater quantity than could be secured on any \"quotation\". Work was all completed before school opened and the pupils returned to a much more cheerful atmosphere than if the painting had not been done.\n\nOn receipt of your letter of June 4th we thought it good business then not to proceed with the painting at this school as Archdeacon Middleton was due to retire at the end of July and certainly the incoming principal should be allowed to see what part of the whole school, which is badly in disrepair, should be painted. Consequently we waited until Mr. Pitts the new Principal arrived, told him what money was allocated for painting and asked him to choose those areas which, in his opinion, were most in need of paint. After Mr. Pitts arrival there was not time before school opening to submit another tender and as $1,500.00 had been allocated for painting, we thought it unnecessary.\n\nIn view of Colonel Neary's wish that this school be put back on its feet as soon as possible and in order that Mr. Pitts might receive some encouragement from the set-back he received when first viewing the school we took it upon ourselves as Superintendent to get this work done and we are sorry if we have overstepped our authority, but again we must say that a very good job has been done and this school is well on its way to recovery.\n\nR.D.

Neary  \nSuperintendent of Education,  \nIndian Affairs Branch,  \nDepartment of Mines & Resources,  \nOTTAWA.\n\nAttention: Mr. Philip Phelan, Chief, Education Division.\n\nRe: St. Paul's Residential School.\n\nYour file 764-5 (E 1).\n\nYour letter of September 27th addressed to Superintendent Ragan, copy to this office, was discussed with Mr. Ragan when I was in Cardston yesterday. I feel that no useful purpose will be served by endeavoring to go into great length regarding the many difficulties and responsibilities that Superintendent Ragan has had to cope with during the last two months, involving the harvest, cattle sales, etc., etc. I should tell you, however, that in the very midst of his busiest season of the year, he lost a clerk grade 3, an assistant agent grade 3 and a stenographer grade 2; these losses all came within two weeks of one another. He is still without the assistant and the stenographer.\n\nUnable to give his personal attention to every matter and every problem arising on the reserve at this critical time, he was faced with the need of having the interior of the badly deteriorated St. Paul's Indian Residential School ready for occupancy at school opening. In his haste to take care of every pressing matter I can understand him considering your letter of June 4th authority to expend $1,500.00 for painting badly needed in this school.\n\nI visited the school yesterday. Although there is still considerable work to be done to bring this school up to a decent standard, I was impressed by the good and sufficient value obtained for the $1,500.00 and I strongly urge that the account be passed for payment as soon as possible.\n\nG.

It is also necessary that the roof at this school be reshingled. It is understood that Mr. Ralph Weston has submitted a tender to do this for a price of $4,900.00. Mr. Weston's tender is now before the Lands and Development Services Branch for consideration. We have also submitted to our Departmental Purchasing Agent a requisition for a bake oven of 250 loaf capacity. A quotation by General Steel Rares, Limited, on this oven amounts to $1,890.00.\n\nWe also have before us a long report from Mr. Hagan in which he advises that the two most immediate and urgent needs at the school are the items mentioned above, namely -\n\n(1) the replacement of the present roof and\n(2) a new bake oven.\n\nHowever, he also points out that this school is in need of the\n\nVenerable Archdeacon H. G. Cook,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian School Administration, M.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank Street, Ottawa, Ontario.\nfollowing new equipment:\n\n(1) Bread mixer,\n(2) Potato peeler,\n(3) Walk-in-Refrigerator,\n(4) Bread slicer,\n(5) Electric mixer,\n(6) The covering of table tops,\n(7) Covering of floors,\n(8) Dishwashing unit,\n(9) Repairs to the interior, including plastering, painting, etc.\n\nTo review the situation at this school, we have now already taken action with regard to the following repairs and equipment needs:\n\n(a) Replacement of Roof ................. $4,900.00\n\n(b) Purchase of Bake Oven .................. 1,890.00\n\n(c) Drilling new Well ..................... 600.00\n\nTotal: ...... $7,390.00\n\nTherefore it will be a question of priority for the work needed at this school and it would be appreciated if you could definitely indicate whether you consider that the purchase of materials for the farmer's cottage comes next to the three urgent items listed immediately above.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Mines & Resources, OTTAWA, Ont.\n\nRe: Your files 103-1-5 E & 103-2-5.\n\nReference our Air Mail letter of March 23rd, enclosing a tender of Kaughman & Sons of Taber, Alta., for the moving of Classroom Blocks for the Blood and St. Paul's Residential Schools on the Blood Reserve.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that this tender of $6800.00 be accepted and these movers allowed to start work on this moving. As was stated in my previous letter, they have a large crew of men standing idle and are most anxious to start the work of cutting and loading these buildings for moving as soon as road and river conditions permit.\n\nWe are recommending that Kaughman & Sons tender be accepted instead of JH. J. Roelofs for the reason that the Kaughman tender covers not only the moving, but the restorations of sites, moving of large boilers, salvaging of all sewer, gas and water pipe, tying buildings together on new foundations, etc., while the Roelofs tender only covers the actual moving of the buildings.

Wm. W.

The cylinder has been bored out & is off size now I was told. After installing it in the new well, the school found they could not get the tank pressure past 42 lbs., which not let the automatic switch shut off, which is 45 lbs.\n\nWe were then called back to find there trouble, which was (two) leaks in the pump pipe which they were unable to build up pressure.\n\nI would like to suggest a new pump outfit, as they may have trouble any day.\n\nThe price per ft. Galvanized 3\" is -------------- $1.17\n1/2 wooden rods octane------ $1.05\n\nThe price per ft. 3\" all brass, ball & valve $61.75 cylinder\n\nApp. 5 length (110 ft.) also same ft. for rods.\n\nApp. 15 hrs. time to change pump pipe at $4.00 per hr.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.M. W. Maughan\nWater Well Driller,\nLethbridge Alberta.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources\n\nAttention: Mr. B.F. Neary, Supt. of Education.\n\nReference your 103-1-5 (E.1) of the 30th of April with regard to the new well drilled at St. Paul's Residential School, Blood Reserve.\n\nHerewith vouchers, in this connection, as follows:\n\nNo. 277 - $167.00 - Cleaning barn well; supplying new rod.\nNo. 278 - $689.50 - Drilling and casing new well.\nNo. 279 - $76.00 - Pulling pump on old well, installing on new well.\nNo. 298 - $37.50 - Plumber's charges re connecting pump to new well.\n\nTotal - $969.00\n\nThis is, we know, over the amount authorized, but costs were kept to a minimum, the school doing the concrete and carpentry work and helping with the other work.\n\nRegarding the last paragraph of your letter as to whether or not the well can now be considered satisfactory, I am forced to answer in the negative. We have had a good deal of trouble with the well since drilled but at this writing seem to have it working satisfactorily although there is no guarantee how long this condition will exist. It was necessary to call Mr. Maughan, the driller, from Lethbridge on two different occasions when the well failed; on one trip he had to bring his equipment and pull the well - which he did at no cost to the Department. When the well was pulled it was found that the trouble was caused by leaks in the old pipes and that the cylinder was badly worn; however, the pipes were re-threaded where needed and again put in the well and everything has been fairly serene since. Mr. Maughan warned me, however, that the well might fail any day - he stated that the pipe was too old, that the rods were becoming badly worn due to the pipe being crooked and that the only permanent remedy was new pipe, rods and cylinder. I asked him to give me a full report with an estimate of the cost of replacement; this is attached. I am also enclosing Mr. Maughan's log of the new well for your information.\n\nTo add to our troubles on the water system at this school, the Provincial Boiler Inspector, Mr. W.A. Henry visited us to inspect pressure vessels. He found that the large water pressure tank installed by...\nand Engineering Branch of the Department at Banff early in 1947 was buried deep in the ground and he could not inspect same. He stated that this was a pressure vessel carrying 80 lbs. pressure and has been installed contrary to all the laws and regulations regarding high pressure vessels, that it had to be inspected once each year and must be set on concrete trunnions in a concrete pit so that it could be inspected. This is the tank we had trouble with last September when it sank further in the clay soil shearing off the connecting pipes.\n\nThe new well, of course, had to be drilled outside the existing building and is now sitting out in the open without protection of any kind. A building will have to be erected over this and as it is near the pressure vessel, and if Mr. Henry is correct, one structure can be built to house both the pump and the pressure tank. Excavation and cement work would have to be done around the tank, and I would suggest that the building be constructed of cinder blocks and frame and shingle roof, approximately 24 x 30 feet. I am quite aware that this school has had their full share, and more, of improvements this fiscal year, but I see no alternative but to erect this building. If you concur in this I shall procure tenders and costs.\n\nWe hope that it will not be necessary to buy new pipe, rods and cylinder for sometime but this information is given at this time so that you may be aware of the situation. We would be pleased to have your comments on the whole situation.\n\nR.D. Racan,\nSuperintendent.\n\nC.C. G.H. Good rham, Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Calgary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You should also let me know if there will be any sales tax or transportation expenses on the material in the event of the business being given to the firm mentioned.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMay I urge that full basements be provided for the buildings to be added to these schools?\n\nIt will add a few thousand dollars to the cost, but it is the cheapest way of getting the extra space that these schools need.\n\nEven with this extra space they will still lack the optimum, but with proper organization, they would serve their people almost to the extent required.\n\nMay 3, 1948\n\nC.A. Clark\nJuly 15, 1948.\n\nAIR MAIL.\n\nMr. R.D. Ragan, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Cardston, Alberta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 10th instant with reference to the payment to L.W.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nFP/MGD\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta.,\nJuly 10th, 1949.\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, file\n103-1-5 (E.1) regarding my voucher of $2,000.00 in\nfavor of L. W. Kaughman for the moving of buildings.\n\nThe firm of Kaughman and Sons consisted of\nthe father, Andy Kaughman and the one son L. W. Kaughman.\nThe father who was blind in one eye and elderly, had no\nactive working interest in this firm except to find the\njobs and make the contracts. I have dealt with the son\nL. W. Kaughman regarding this moving as much as I have\ndealt with the father, Andy Kaughman, and I am certain\nthat the son is the proper legal party to whom payment\nshould be made.\n\nThis is being written so as to hurry the\npayment to L. W. Kaughman if it is possible at this time;\njust as soon as I can find the time, I shall drive to\nTaber and get this man's signature on the original\ncontract. It is hoped that payment can be made at this\ntime.\n\n(R.D. Ragan)\nSuperintendent\n\ncc to: G.H. Gooderham, Reg.

Ragan, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Cardston, Alberta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 25th ultimo enclosing voucher for $2,000.00 in favour of L.W. Kaughman. The original contract for moving these buildings was signed as follows:\n\n\"Kaughman and Sons, per Andy Kaughman\"\n\nIn view of this fact it is doubtful if we should make any payment to the son unless we can obtain definite assurance that he is the proper legal party to whom any payment should be made.\n\nPlease let us hear from you further.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nc/o to Mr. Gooderham.\n\nPP/MGD\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta.,\nJune 25th, 1948.\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nHerewith Voucher No. 379 in the amount of $2000.00 payable to L.W. Kaughman, Taber, Alberta. This is in part payment for moving of the classroom blocks recently purchased from War Assets, to the Blood Indian Reserve.\n\nThis Voucher may be a bit irregular and we wish to give you the following information in explanation. Andy Kaughman, head of Kaughman and Sons, who tendered on this moving, was killed last week in an automobile accident. The remaining son, L.W. Kaughman, finds himself in financial difficulties and has appealed to me for payment on account. This son assures me that he will carry on with the moving and carry out the original contract. I have agreed to pay him $2000.00 for work already done as these buildings are cut, jacked up and ready to move. The flood stage of the Belly River is the only thing holding up delivery and it is not expected that this river will be down to normal before another month, at least.\n\nIt is hoped that this payment can be made to L.W. Kaughman at this time.\n\n(E.D. Ragan)\nSuperintendent.\n\nAtt:\nRDR/S\nCC to: G.H.
