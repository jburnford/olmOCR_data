I beg to report as follows; after examining the building I find new sill are required as well as the concrete foundation, and would estimate the cost to be between 25 and 30.00.\n\nThe building is 12' X 20', the foundation should be 6\" thick and about 2' deep, the sills should be 2 X 6 the old sills are badly decayed.\n\nAbout the time I received your letter above mentioned the weather turned so cold that I found we could not make a good with concrete and decided to leave it until spring.

He advised me to value the damage and get it made good and would notify the Insurance Company.

As follows: Jacob Laform, $35.00; Harvey Clark, $25.00; and Wm. King and Walter Sault, $50.00.\n\nIt was moved by Wm. King seconded by John Herkimer that we recommend the acceptance of the tender of Jacob Laform for $35.00, he being a member of the band.\n\nCarried unanimously.\n\nW.C. Van Loon,\nIndian Agent.\n\nHagersville,\nMarch 30th, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nRegarding tenders for foundation under the woodshed at the school house at New Credit, the council thought that as Jacob Laform was a member of the band he should have the preference, his tender being the same as Mr. H. Clark's, $35.00, while Clark has had considerable more experience in such work, Laform should be able to put a foundation under a wood shed as he has had some experience in such work, and as the council prefer him I would recommend that the contract be given to him.\n\nW.C.

McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.C. VanLoon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHagersville,\nOnt.\nSir:\n\nWhen visiting the school at New Credit yesterday I was informed by the teacher that the water in the well was not fit for the children to drink and they had to go about one quarter of a mile for water.\n\nI examined the well along with some of the councillors and found that a new pump was needed; the old one has been there for a good many years, broken and repaired many times and the iron pipes appear to be rusted through in places, and the well should be cleaned out. I think a rabbit or cat has been drowned in it during the winter, one of the boards was loose and had been left open.\n\nI enquired the probable cost of a new outfit this morning and was told by Mr. Shildrick who sells pumps that a good cast iron pump head with brass cylinder, galvanized iron pipe, put in complete would cost $24.75; if an iron cylinder was used it would be $6.00 less. He recommends brass and so would I after using both.\n\nHis estimate is given on a well 20 feet deep; I do not think this well is that deep, if any less the cost of the amount of extra pipe would be added or deducted.\n\nIt would take two men about one day to clean the well as it is about full of water at the present time.\n\nThis is a matter that should be attended to without delay.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Asst.

This would be sufficient to hold the supplies required for the school.\n\nMaterial for the shields would have to be hauled from this village; the book case could be taken over at the same time.\n\nI will enclose a sketch of the rear end of the school house and outbuildings.\n\nThe school house is about 70' from the closets.\n\nThe shields would cost $20.00\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

This should be remedied.\n\nJ. L. Mitchener,\nInsp.\nOttawa, October 30, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Mitchener, in a report on his recent inspection of the New Credit Indian Day School, states as follows: \"Cement placed in walls where plaster has washed from between bricks would protect the building. Some rain water is still allowed to run against the building. This should be remedied.\"\n\nFrom the Inspector's report it is not clear as to what repairs are required to the walls and to prevent the water from destroying the building.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will furnish a report as to what repairs are required and also give an estimate of the cost of having them completed. You should give this matter your prompt attention, in order that, if the work is authorized, the necessary repairs can be completed before the season gets too late.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S.

Van Loon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHagersville, Ont.\nINDEAN OFFICE,\nHagersville Nov. 9th, 1920\n\nSir:-\n\nEnclosed find report for the month of October.\n\nI was out yesterday to visit the school and to see what was required to the school house to make the repairs mentioned in your letter of the 30th Oct. No. 16-1-5. It does not require much to make the corners of the building good which have been damaged by reason of the conductor pipes being broken off and water allowed to run down near the brick wall. The Council house needs considerable more repairs than the school house; some of the bricks torn out and all conductor pipes both at the school and council house are broken off halfway up the sides of buildings.\n\nI think if new elbows are put on above the reaches of children, to throw the water away from the buildings is all that would be required after the corners have been repaired. I think about one yard of sand and one barrel of cement would be plenty for everything and it would take a mason about one half day to do the necessary work. It might be well to get the material and hire a mason by the hour for this. The whole should not cost more than $20.00.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, November 12, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant informing the Department as to the repairs needed to the New Credit Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange to have the conductor pipes repaired and new elbows put on, in order to throw the water away from the walls of the building. You should also have the brick work in the corners repaired and you may engage the services of a mason for this purpose. The cost of the work should not exceed your estimate, namely $20.00. You will be good enough to give this matter your prompt attention, in order that the pipes for conducting the water may be placed in good repair before the weather gets too cold. As soon as the work is completed you should furnish properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nFor Asst.

You will notice that the insertion was given some time ago. This class of advertising is essentially CASH WITH ORDER business. It is impossible to open ledger accounts for all these advertisements, in view of the fact that they are each small in amount, and that they number nearly 400,000 in the course of a year.\n\nWe give a generous discount for cash with order, and most people take advantage of it. We give a smaller cash discount for cash within ten days, which most people who do not send cash with order secure by remitting immediately upon receipt of bill.\n\nA small proportion of our Classified advertisers do not take advantage of either the cash with order discount or the discount for payment within ten days. In a STILL SMALLER NUMBER of cases it is necessary for us to send several bills before payment is made.\n\nYou have apparently overlooked the item, particulars of which are given below, and we would ask you to remit NOW. Please send postal note, money order, or cheque payable at par in Toronto.\n\nIf the amount is incorrect, please advise us at once.

Only a little\npointing up is required at the school house.\n\nI think about 1500 new brick, 6 yds.of sand, 3 of\ngravel and four of cement (barrels) and a load of sand\nwould be all the material required.

We first thought that the old one would have to be torn down and a new one built but we did a real good job without which saved us considerable expense.\n\nI am forwarding the account for labor in my own name as I have advanced some money on each. They are all members of our band, and I may add they are all good workmen.\n\nThe letter of your authority was dated Oct 22, 1930.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nMEMO.\n\nSir-\n\nWe have had no rain to amount to anything since May and things have become serious as far as water is concerned at the school and around New Credit where the school is there is not a drilled well the nearest is about two miles the children have been drinking water from the old well that is not fit for a beast to drink. The first intimation I had of this was Sat. I arranged for a man to get water twice a week in a can from the drilled well above mentioned until further advised at .50 cents a can.\n\nMy own candid opinion is that a well should be drilled at the school and this should be done immediately. I have had a report from the Doctor McCracken to that effect, I believe some of the school children are sick now.\n\nI cannot give you an estimated cost of a well as I have no idea or no one else has how far we may have to drill but a rough guess would be around $125.00.\n\nKindly advise me as to this at your earliest possible date. I had intended sending a night letter, but since I have arranged for water to be drawn I have more time.\n\nI had three of my councilmen in on Sat. and they think to only solution is the same as I have mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 3, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, relative to obtaining a supply of drinking water for the use of the New Credit Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that it is considered, as stated by you, the only solution is in having a well drilled. You may, therefore, arrange to employ competent labour for the purpose of drilling a well at a convenient spot near the school, and the cost, if possible, should be kept within the amount mentioned by you, viz., $125. After an expenditure to this amount has been made, if not sufficient to complete the well, you should report the progress to the Department and obtain authority for proceeding further with the work. It is hoped, however, that the above amount will cover the cost of drilling the well and installing the necessary pump and piping required, also a suitable platform around the well. You should arrange to have this work begin as soon as possible. It is hoped that a good supply of water can be obtained without it being necessary to drill to any great depth. Accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred in the drilling of the well and in the purchase and installation of the pump, piping, etc., required. The Department will leave the matter of drilling the well in your hands to make the best arrangements and at the lowest possible expense.\n\nIt is noted that you have arranged in the meantime to have the drinking water required delivered at the school twice each week. Certified accounts, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

To Drilling Water Well at School $75.00\nSir-\n\nAs stated in your letter of December 3, I have had drilled a well at the New Credit school and am glad to say we have got a real supply of number water at a depth of thirty-nine feet. The well had to be cased thirty-one feet with five inch casing. The driller furnished this in with the drilling; it was second hand casing but was good. The other accounts are for supplying water for drilling and getting the pump placed in good condition also for supplying water while the well was dry. In all I consider the job done in first class condition and at a very low cost. We have yet to place a top on the well but this cannot be done until Spring as we have too much snow at present, however the cost will be not more than $3.00. I will forward a bill for this when the job is completed.\n\nI believe a check forwarded to me will be better than individual ones, and I can make the distribution of payments as some of the work was done by members of the band and they have already received goods on same.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nMemorandum\n\nMr. Ferrier,\n\nI visited the New Credit Indian Day School recently and found conditions generally very satisfactory.\n\nMrs. Parker is spoken very highly of as a teacher and apparently is very deeply interested in her work among the Indian children. Agent Winger states that the pupils are making excellent progress under her tuition.\n\nThe school buildings are in very good condition. The seats in the classroom are of the old double type, very badly worn. I would recommend that thirty new single seats be provided when funds are available.\n\nThere are some low spots around the building which hold the water and mud; pupils walking through these keep the entrance and classroom floor very dirty. A few loads of gravel, easily available, would eliminate this condition at little cost. I would recommend that this be done.\n\nMrs. Parker is paid $95.00 per teaching month; she has to keep a car to get to and from school. She has made an application through Agent Winger for an increase of $5.00 per month, which would make her equal with the Six Nations teachers. From what I saw of her work in the short visit to the school and from reports of some of the Indian parents, I would recommend this for your consideration.\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, February 26, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector McGookin, who recently visited the New Credit Indian Day School, states that he found conditions generally very satisfactory and that the teacher is interested in the work and the pupils are making good progress.\n\nThe Inspector has drawn attention to the condition of the grounds around the building. He states that there are some low spots which hold water and mud, and the pupils walking through these keep the entrance and classroom floor very dirty. He recommends that a few loads of gravel, which he states is available, be placed around the grounds and at the entrance to the school, and states that this would overcome the condition at little cost. I have, therefore, to request that you will arrange as soon as weather conditions permit to have a few loads of gravel placed around the grounds and at the entrance to the school. You should see that same is properly levelled. No unnecessary expense should be incurred. After the gravel has been supplied, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nThe Inspector also states that the seats in the classroom are of the old double type, very badly worn, and recommends that 30 new single desks be provided. You may draw this matter to the attention of the Department early next Summer, and at that time you should give full particulars as to the size and number of each size of single desk required, also full shipping directions. It would be advisable to have each row of desks of the same size, with a front and rear seat. When we receive particulars regarding the desks as requested next Summer, consideration will then be given as to whether funds for the purpose can be provided or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMaurice Winger, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHagersville,\nOnt.\n\nA.

The labour was somewhat longer than really should have been but the man was handicapped from the bees bothering him. It was rather an unusual happening, but nevertheless it had to be fixed.

(RG 10, Volume 6150, File 416-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nSir\u2014\n\nWith further information regarding fire which destroyed the New Credit Indian Day school. The fire occurred Sunday morning at about 8 o'clock. I was not notified until this morning Monday. I immediately went and made inquiries but could find very little information except the fire started in the roof on the same end as the chimney; there had been a snow fall Saturday evening but the first man at the fire claimed no tracks could be seen around the building so the only cause as far as we can figure must have been from the soot lying in the chimney and must have been there from Friday night.\n\nThe books were all saved also most of the small things such as water pails, globes, and extras used to carry on the school work. About the only requirements to carry on would be seats and a blackboard. For this I would recommend that we purchase new seats that would be used in a new building also a small blackboard that could also be used in a new building. Apart from that the cost to carry on would be very small. I could purchase whatever we need from our local hardware store and would not run over $10.00.\n\nShould the Department decide to purchase new seats and put them temporary in the council house, it would have to be looked after from the Department or else instructions sent for the purchase of them. In that case the teacher could with myself and possibly the Inspector for this section make the selection. Approximate cost of these can be sent later.\n\nI may add that the out buildings were all saved just the school burned and I have notified Mr. Jennings the Insurance agent here of the burning; it has $1000.00 on the building and $200.00 on the contents furniture etc.\n\nAny further instructions advise me.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nDecember 15, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nThe Indian Day School building and contents on the New Credit Reserve were totally destroyed by fire on the morning of the 11th instant. The local Agent was unable to state definitely how the fire occurred.\n\nTemporary arrangements can be made to carry on the school work in the council hall on the reserve, but it will be necessary to supply new desks. Thirty-six single school desks will be required, at a cost of approximately \u00a3250. Funds for the purpose can be provided from the item in the Estimates for Unforeseen Expenditure. As it is intended, if possible, to have the temporary quarters fitted up and ready for class-room work to proceed when the school re-opens after the Christmas holidays, on January 3rd, next, I would request that you advise me of the names of the firms who should be asked to quote on the supplying of the desks necessary. This school is located near Nagersville, in the federal district of Haldimand, Ont.\n\nI might add that the building was the property of the New Credit Band and was covered by insurance to the amount of \u00a31,000 on the building and \u00a3200 on the contents, a claim for which will be made to the Insurance Company.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, December 16, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to the total loss, by fire, of the New Credit Indian Day School building. In reply I have to say that the Department is not quite satisfied, from the information given by you, as to the cause of the fire. If the building was not in use from Friday evening, the 9th instant, it is not understood why soot lying in the chimney would cause a fire on Sunday morning following. It is considered there was someone in the building on Saturday night and had a fire in the stove. I would request that you make further enquiries in this matter. You should consult the teacher and obtain his report regarding the condition in which he left the fire in the stove on Friday evening when the school closed.\n\nIt is noted that temporary arrangements can be made to carry on classroom work in the council house but that it will be necessary to provide new desks and blackboard. Regarding the desks, it is thought that approximately 36 single desks will be required. I have to request that, after consulting the teacher, you will inform the Department definitely concerning the sizes required and the number of each size. For your information, I may say that desks are manufactured in the following sizes:\n\n| No. | Size |\n|-----|------|\n| 2   | pupils 15 to 18 years |\n| 3   | 12 \" 14 \" |\n| 4   | 10 \" 12 \" |\n| 5   | 7 \" 9 \" |\n| 6   | 5 \" 7 \" |\n\nIn figuring out the sizes, it would be advisable to have each row of desks of the same size. Also please furnish full shipping directions.\n\nRegarding blackboard, you might state the dimensions required. This material is manufactured in 3, 3\u00bd and 4 ft. widths.\n\nPlease supply the information requested regarding the desks and blackboard as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMaurice Winger, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHagersville, Ont.\nDecember 15, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

In view of no veto having been received you may take action to obtain prices for the desks required from -\n\nCanadian Foundries and Forging, Limited, Brockville\nCanadian Office & School Furniture Co., Limited, Preston\nGlobe Furniture Company, Limited, Waterloo\nMcGill Chairs, Limited, Cornwall.\n\nD.S.G.\nHagersville, Ont.\nDec. 18, 1932\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nSir:\n\nThe agent for the New Credit Bay School requested me to write to you concerning the fire at that school.\n\nI left the school house on Dec. 7 about 5 o'clock. The fire in the stove was then nearly out, as we had left the school at 3 o'clock to practice in the Council House for our Christmas Concert. I returned from the Council House about 4.45 and, as I have stated, the fire was nearly out. I left the school about 5 for my boarding house. Everything else was in good condition. We never had any large fire during the day, nor did we ever have any trouble with the chimney.\nThe cause of the fire is unknown to me. There is only one thing which may have caused it. The chimney was built from the foundation on up. It was also hollow from the foundation on up. This hollow part became filled with soot. In time the soot took fire which caused the roof to become heated and take fire also. Whether this is a good cause I can not say but to my knowledge it is the only cause of the fire.\n\nThis is all the information I can give, for as I returned Monday morning for work I found it in ruins. Just why it should take fire 46 hours after there was fire in the stove I can not say. My above explanation is the only cause that I know of.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nWinifred Backer\nTeacher\nSir -\n\nReplying to your letter dated Dec. 16th, I have consulted the teacher and different members of the band who were at the fire last Sunday morning of the burning of the school and everyone has the same story that the fire started in the roof around the chimney, they claim that no one was near the School form Friday night and the caretaker had the keys in his pocket from the time he locked the school about 5 o'clock Friday evening. When the first persons got to the school they tried the doors and everything was looked good they had to break in with a crowbar. So as for getting the origin of the fire it is impossible. I am of the same opinion as the Dept. I can hardly see how a fire could smoulder from Friday night until Sunday morning but we have no other proof, so for the present will have to believe the short story.\n\nI have requested the teacher to write the Department direct any information he can give, which he has consented to do.\n\nWe regard to new desks we will require 45 as we have now 42 pupils on the roll and an extra seat or two would do no harm. The teacher and myself have therefor figured out the following for seats and blackboards.\n\n| SEATS | Name seats in each row |\n|-------|------------------------|\n| 9     | seats and desks        |\n| 18    |                        |\n| 9     |                        |\n| 9     |                        |\n\nBlackboard --\n\n12' long and 4 ft. wide. This will do for the present in the council house more can be obtained later if required.\n\nThe above should be shipped to Maurice Winger, Hagersville, C.N.R.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMaurice Winger\nIndian Agent.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\n**OFFICE OF THE PURCHASING AGENT**\n\nOttawa, December 22, 1932.\n\nReq.

A class-room has been fitted up with desks and necessary equipment in the Council Hall and meets the needs very well. There are 42 pupils on the roll, 27 present the day of my visit. The absentees were reported suffering from the flu. The pupils are given Cod Liver Oil daily. They have all been vaccinated up to date.\n\nThe classroom is too cold for the comfort and health of the pupils. They have to keep their coats on. This is due to an open balcony at one end of the classroom causing a draught. It would be unnecessary to go to the expense of boarding this up. A couple of our heavy gray army blankets hung across the opening would eliminate the trouble. When no longer needed, these could be given to some indigent Indians.\n\nThere is not sufficient blackboard in the classroom. Two pieces, 6 feet each, should be provided.\n\nThe Department is very fortunate in having the services of Wilfred Bacher as teacher. He is an excellent teacher, holds a First Class Certificate, deeply interested in Indian work. The pupils are making very satisfactory progress under his tuition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThos.

I recommend it for payment.\n\nWith regard to the school our heating system is very inadequate for the winter months; if we are to stay in the council house for the winter we will have to have a new stove and all new stove pipes, there may also have to have some other work done to make it comfortable.

As for the purchase of a soft ball for the school, I am quite aware I should have had authority for purchase, but in this particular case, the school had a very important game on with a Six Nation school to decide the championship they had no ball and I did not have time enough to ask for one so I took a chance this time without authority for that small amount, if the Department does not see fit to pay this amount I will pay Park & Co myself.\n\nIndian Agent.\nHagersville, Oct 16th, 1933.\n\nSir -\n\nI spoke to the Department in a letter reporting on the last council meeting about a stove for the school. Since the burning of the school and the moving in the council House it has been impossible to sufficiently heat the place for children to sit in school so that something will have to be done before the winter months sets in. I have taken Mr. E.E. Shildr\u00e8ck our dealer here back to the school to get his opinion and price on a heater that will do the job. As the old pipe now in use has been up about 15 years and very rusty it will be necessary to get new pipe also if the old is taken down. Mr. Shildrich has priced the whole thing at $70.00 and claims the heater will do the job. And if we should in the future say next year happen to build a new school he will take the stove back on heating material for the new school providing the new stove now recommended for purchase will not do.\n\nAs is this most important would appreciate an early reply.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

The accounts are all on one sheet presented to me by Mr. Shildrick. Now I had authorized $70.00 for expenditure and the stove cost a little less, but when it was being erected I noticed the water was running off the roof of the building and making a bad job of the foundation, also noticed there was no pail or cup to drink out of, so I ordered those things to the small cost of $2.55 without authority. If it is possible you can add the smaller amount on the larger voucher and send one check for both amounts. I would have done that here, but my authority for the stove was not to exceed $70.00.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nNEW CREDIT MINUTES OF COUNCIL MEETING HELD JAN. 17, 1934.\n\nA motion was passed by Walter Sault and seconded by Chancey Herkimer that the band being very much handicapped for the use of their council house, immediate steps be taken to have a new school erected. The band being out of the use of this building for considerable time the Dept. should give this matter every consideration.\n\nCarried.\n\nRegarding the motion about the building of a new school the band have been dissatisfied all year not being able to use their council house as they have concerts and different entertainments during the year and have no place to hold them. They feel since the old building was covered partly by Insurance, they should have a new school. It would also provide a little work for them. I believe if a good contractor was engaged by the day and used as much Indian labour as possible the school would not have to cost too much money, especially in these times as labor can be got very cheap. It looks as though this is the time to build a school if they expect to have one at all.\n\nMaurice Winger,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 23, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to resolution of the Council of the Mississaugas of the New Credit Band, held on the 17th instant, that a new school building be erected to replace the one destroyed by fire in December, 1932, I have to say that, owing to lack of funds, the Department will be unable to consider the erection of a new building at the present time. While a certain amount of insurance was obtained on the building that was burned, under the policy of the Department this sum would not be utilized in paying the cost of a new building. The money received on account of insurance has been placed to the credit of the funds of the Band.\n\nThe present arrangements for the carrying on of classroom activity in the council hall will have to be continued, until such time as it is possible to have the funds required in the erection of a new building provided by Parliament.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

More than half the children are in the primary grade.\nand impossible for the smaller ones to get to the out house without an accident which make them uncomfortable rest part of the day.\n\nThe agent Mr. Winger gave us to understand that a new school would be built by this fall.\n\nOften children gather around the stove, with coats on, and snow blowing in the windows, it's a serious problem all around and we beg of your favorable consideration in our grievances.\n\nMrs. Jacob King,\nSecretary of\nNew Credit Wounless Band.\nOttawa, September 17th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Mrs. Jacob King, Hagersville, Ont., which she signs as Secretary of the New Credit Women's Institute. You should inform Mrs. King that her letter has been received but that, as you were advised in official letter of March 20th, last, the Department was unable to secure the necessary funds this year for the erection of a new school.\n\nMrs. King complains in her letter that the toilets are situated too far from the Council Hall, which is now used as a school. It might be possible to move the toilets closer to the Council Hall and, if so, you may take the necessary action in this regard.\n\nMrs. King also states that the Council Hall is very cold during the winter.

Heating with coal instead of wood would cost possibly a little more.\n\nAs for the toilets they are now just 80 yds from the school being 240 which is not very far away, some of the women got it into their heads it is very bad for the children but unless we will not have a school for a couple of years I would advise leaving them where they are. However the cost of moving them would be only about $10.00.\n\nI will consult the Inspector and get his advice on the matter.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The largest part of this account is for grates for the stove used in the school. When I bought the stove I had the hardware man Mr. Shildrich go right to the school and measure it and ask him to supply a stove that would heat the place; therefore purchased a stove from him. Where the difficulty is the building is so hard to heat that we must keep so hot a fire on the grates in the stove cannot stand the intense heat consequently we have put new grates on the stove three times during the last season.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nREGULAR MEETING OF MISSISSUAGA OF CREDIT COUNCIL\nHELD JULY 15, 1936.\n\nMoved by Walter Sault and seconded by Wesley Laform, that the band vote $10.00 toward refreshments for a picnic to be held for the school children in the month of August. Carried.\n\nAs for the $10.00 voted for picnic, this was done some years ago but was discontinued. It is a nice thing to have a picnic for the school and $10.00 does not seem very much money but it will make lemonade and buy a few candies for the children, and we have quite a lot of them now. The number that will be on the roll when school opens will be around 50.\n\nMaurice Winger\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 23, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to resolution passed at the recent meeting of the council of the Mississauga of the Credit Band, the Department approves an expenditure of $10 in the purchase of refreshments for a picnic to be held for the children of the Band. This amount will be paid from Band funds, and cheque will be issued when you forward a certified voucher, in triplicate, to which should be attached a detailed account showing the articles purchased to an amount not exceeding $10.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

There are a number of quite large children and they can hardly get into the largest ones we have. I am therefore asking the Department to supply me with six more seats for the school, the same as we have. They were purchased from the C.O. And S.F. company of Preston, Ont., the largest seats we have now are Number 3. I would therefore advise size number 2.\n\nWe have a number of children attending that do not belong to the band but are people having Government leases kindly advise me if they are entitled to free books the same as Indian Children. I have not been allowing it, but would like an answer just to know if I am right.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 26, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, requesting that four or five extra desks, of large size, be supplied, to accommodate the children attending the New Credit Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that there are a number of children attending whose parents are lessees on the reserve. I would point out that the Department is not responsible for providing educational facilities for their children. As there are a sufficient number of Indian children to fill the school, it is considered that you should notify the parents of the white lessees that there is no suitable accommodation for their children and that they cannot be permitted to attend the New Credit Indian School.\n\nThe Department was not aware that the children above mentioned were in attendance. The white parents should be responsible for providing for the education of their children at a school other than the New Credit Indian Day School. You should instruct the teacher that he is not to admit them. The Indian children only, should attend and receive instruction and the necessary textbooks, etc.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L.

In either event, you should state the size of the site you consider necessary, and the general condition of the land, viz.: whether level or sloping. You should also mention the direction in which you consider the building should face.\n\n(2) Do you consider it necessary to provide living quarters for the teacher? As this School is located close to a White settlement, the Department is inclined to feel that teacher's quarters are not required. If a School only is erected, it will mean less expenditure.\n\n(3) Can drinking water be easily obtained on the site recommended by you?\n\n(4) Would you recommend construction by contract or by day labour?\n\n(5) Do you consider a full basement advisable? This would provide room for vocational training.\nIn addition to the information requested above, you should also give any other particulars that you consider would assist the Department in planning the building. It is hoped that your reply will be both detailed and definite, in order that further correspondence will not be necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. A.

A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter 16-1-5 of the 25th of October in connection with provision of a new Day School on the New Credit Reserve and in reply would make the following report.\n\n(1) A site is available where the previous school stood, but in my estimation it should be moved about 100 feet north of the old site, placing it on level ground and making a better all round location, especially if there is to be a basement. The Mississauga Council own twelve or fifteen acres around this site, so no purchasing will be required on any site finally chosen, though I would prefer about 2\u00bd acres to be fenced off definitely as school grounds, instead of an open piece of ground of many acres as at present.\n\nIn my opinion the building should face the West in order the interior of the building should get as much sunlight as possible during the fall and winter months.\n\n(2) I do not consider the provision of living quarters for the teacher necessary, as today with motor cars and a good gravel road, access is easy for any teacher and in most ways living away from the school is preferable.\nThere are two wells on this site lying between the Council House (used now as the school) and the old school site. If the site recommended by me is used the same wells can be used, though the water would have to be carried a little farther, but as school consumption most of the year is not high, this would not be a great drawback.\n\n(4) It is my opinion, construction should be made by contract, employing Indian labour if possible. If the building is to be like most schools on the Reserve, of frame construction, there are Indians on the Reservation capable of constructing it.\n\n(5) I would certainly suggest a full basement to the proposed school, as there are many advantages to this.\n\nI suppose there is no question that a furnace would be installed, and it is suggested the furnace room be separated from the basement so the children cannot contact the furnace in any way as they do at our No. 2 School in the Six Nations Reserve.\n\nIt is also suggested that built-in cupboards be made, rather than the moveable ones in most schools, as they would last longer and look better.\n\nAnother necessary requirement is a small, but bright and convenient room where the teacher can retire away from her charges when occasion permits. Some of our present schools have not any such accommodation, or it is a little dark room too depressing to use.\n\nIt is also suggested a basin for washing hands etc. be in the building, for where children do not go home at noon it is advisable they have an opportunity to be cleanly in their habits.\n\nI would also recommend single graded seats be provided if possible, and all doors open outwards, as at present many open inward, and if a fire or panic occurred the children might jam the door and not get out.\n\nAt present there are 45 pupils on the roll of the New Credit School, but as the Indian population appears to be increasing steadily, it might be best to consider room for a few additional pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. P. Randle,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nMajor E. P. Randle.\nMISSISSAUGAS OF THE CREDIT MINUTES OF COUNCIL MEETING\nHELD November 17, 1937.\n\nNo. 5.\n\nMoved by E.P. King, seconded by P. J. Laform\nthat a sum of $5.00 be voted Band funds to permit the school\nteacher of the New Credit school to purchase cocoa, etc. in\norder to give the children a hot drink during the noon hour\nthroughout the winter months.\n\nCarried.\n\nAs the department will appreciate, during the\nwinter months children staying at school during the noon day\nhour, only have with them cold lunches and it is undoubtedly\ndesirable that they be provided with some form of hot drink\nand this resolution provides for a small contribution from the\nMississauga funds to place at the disposal of the teacher\nin order he may purchase cocoa, etc. to provide the necessary\nhot drink. I would recommend the department approve of the\nCouncil's decision.\n\nE.P.

We wish to know if it will probably be reasonably easy to dig a foundation.\n\nI presume that you desire a coal burning furnace installed.

Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter 16-1-5\nof the 3rd instant with regard to the proposed\nnew day school at New Credit.\n\nIn reply would advise you the subsoil\nis a heavy white clay, which after about the first\nthree has a hard pan, and cannot exactly be called\neasy digging, though there are no stones or rocks\nto contend with.\n\nA coal burning furnace is the only pos-\nsible thing, as supplies of suitable wood are no\nlonger available on the Reserve.\n\nHagersville Station is 4\u00bd miles from New\nCredit, which would certainly be the best point for\nsupplies to arrive at.\n\nThis office cannot recommend day labour\nas a rule, time is prolonged too easily and costs\ngreatly increased.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMajor E. P. Randle.\nIndian Superintendent.\nPROPOSED BUILDING DATA\n\nNAME OF BUILDING: NEW CREDIT INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nLOCATION: NEW CREDIT RESERVE - SIX NATIONS INDIAN AGENCY.\n\nPROVINCE: ONTARIO.\n\nBRANCH: INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nDATE: DECEMBER 31/37.\n\nAPPROPRIATION VOTE: 1938-39 Estimates\n\nRECOMMEND CONSTRUCTION BY: DAY LABOUR\n\nCONTRACT YES.\n\nREASON: CLASS OF INDIAN DAY LABOUR AVAILABLE.\n\nThe Indian Agent recommends construction by contract, employing Indian labour. He states there are Indians on the Reserve capable of constructing this building.\n\nBUILDING REQUIREMENTS: ROOMS AND ACCOMMODATION; NUMBER OF PUPILS;\n\nTYPE OF CONSTRUCTION:\n\nAt this place we require classroom for forty pupils.\n\nA full basement should be provided.\n\nNo accommodation for the teacher is required at this school.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SITE AND CONDITIONS; SUMMIT PLAN; NORTH POINT;\n\nNATURE OF SOIL, DRAINAGE REQUIREMENTS AND ANY OTHER PARTICULARS.\n\nThe sub-soil on the school site is a heavy white clay, which after about the first three feet has a \"hard pan\" and cannot exactly be called easy digging, though there are no stones or rocks to contend with.\n\nBuilding to face the West.\n\nWATER SUPPLY: SYSTEM REQUIRED; SOURCE OF WATER, ETC.\n\nThere are two wells already on the property and no further action is required regarding water supply.\nTOILET FACILITIES: SEWAGE DISPOSAL; SYSTEM REQUIRED; LOCATION.\nTwo outside toilets should be erected.\n\nHEATING SYSTEM: TYPE OF FURNACE OR BOILER; FUEL.\nCoal furnace should be installed.\n\nLIGHTING SYSTEM: SOURCE OF POWER; SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS.\nNone required.\n\nBUILT-IN EQUIPMENT REQUIRED: BLACKBOARD AREA; CUPBOARDS, ETC.\nIf it can be done at a reasonable cost, built in cupboards for the books and supplies should be provided.\nBlackboard on front and along one side.\n\nSHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS FOR MATERIALS: NEAREST SHIPPING POINT LOCAL TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES TO SITE, ETC.\nHagersville Railway Station is \u00bc miles from the site of the school. There is a first class road from the station to the school.\n\nREMARKS:\n\nINFORMATION SUBMITTED BY:\n\nDATE:\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nre New Credit Indian Day School\n\nProvision is being made in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1938-39 for the erection of a school on the New Credit Indian Reserve.\n\nI enclose a copy of your form giving building data. While you will note from this that the Agent suggests erection of the building by contract; at the same time he points out that many of the Indians are capable of erecting the frame building. It is quite possible this building could be economically erected by day labour, employing Indians in charge of a competent \"white\" foreman.\n\nYou will note in this case that accommodation for the teacher is not required.\n\nI would appreciate your submitting a sketch plan of the building which you would consider suitable at this point.\n\nDirector.\n| Date | ARTICLES          | Folio | Debit Amount | Credit Amount | Balance |\n|------|-------------------|-------|--------------|---------------|---------|\n| Oct 13 | 3-8x10 glass      |       |              |               |         |\n|       | packed            |       |              |               |         |\n|       | Beads             |       |              |               |         |\n| 20    | glass 10x14       | (47)  |              |               |         |\n|       | glass 10x16       |       |              |               |         |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Matheson, Southampton, Ont.\n\nfor trucking and crating stove shipped to Hagorsville.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\n\nLetter No. 12-1-5 dated January 5th 1936.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\n31st January, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: New Credit Indian Day School.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 31st ultimo, I am enclosing herewith, in duplicate, a blue line print of sketch plan (design A.7) for the above building.\n\nIt will be noted that whereas this type of school has previously been designed with a verandah across the entrance front, this feature has been eliminated and grade entrances introduced at a saving in cost. These entrances obviate the risk of slippery steps and that on the boys' side serves also as a grade entrance to the basement.\n\nThe estimated cost of this building is $5,900.00 and an additional amount of about $200.00 would be required to cover the cost of outside toilets, making a total amount of $6,100.00 which should be placed in the Indian Affairs Estimates for the project.\nWill you kindly look over these plans and return one duly signed with any comments you wish to make.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 15, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. WARDLE\n\nRe: New Credit Indian Day School.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of January 31 I enclose blue line print of sketch plan (design A.7) for the above building.\n\nYou mention $200.00 as the cost of outside toilets. In this regard I may say that for years past we have been erecting frame outside toilets at a cost of $35.00 -- $50.00 each.\n\nWhen forwarding building data form with my memorandum of December 31, 1937 it was suggested that this building be erected by contract. I am hopeful that we will have some extra funds in the appropriation for the current fiscal year and, if so, it may be possible to purchase the materials required for this building. I would, therefore, appreciate if you would prepare a bill of materials. I will know definitely by the end of the first week in March whether our appropriation for this year will permit a purchase of the materials and therefore, if you have a list of the materials ready by that time, and if funds are available, the matter could be presented to the Purchasing Agent and arrangements made for securing the material and paying for it before the end of March.\n\nDirector.\n## ORDER BILL OF MATERIAL\n\nFOR\n\nDAY SCHOOL, NEW CREDIT INDIAN RESERVE,\nSIX NATIONS INDIAN AGENCY, ONTARIO.\n\n| Quantity | Material | Remarks |\n|----------|----------|---------|\n| 365 bags | Portland Cement | Of approved Standard brand conforming to the Specifications of the Canadian Engineering Standards Association. |\n| 15 bags | Hydrated Lime. 50 lb. each. | Of approved Standard brand, fresh. |\n| 220 only | 8\"x8\"x12\" Hollow clay Tile Blocks or Concrete Blocks of similar size. | Of approved manufacture |\n| 2000 only | Common brick | Of approved manufacture Hard burned. |\n| 400 only | Face Brick. | Hard burned Red of approved manufacture. |\n| 2 cu. yds. | Sand. | Sharp, clean, screened, from 1/32\" to 1/8\" free from earthy or vegetable matter.

It has been decided to erect this building by day labour. If the materials for this building were purchased before the end of March and paid for out of the current year's appropriation it would greatly assist us in carrying out our proposed building program during the fiscal year 1936-37.\n\nFunds are available for the purchase of the material for this school from our appropriation for the fiscal year 1937-38 and I would appreciate if the Honourable the Minister would authorize the Purchasing Agent to proceed at once with the purchasing of the material necessary for this building. I enclose requisition to which is attached an order bill of material which was prepared by the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nDirector.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to previous correspondence regarding the proposed new Day School at New Credit it has been found possible to purchase the materials required for this building from the current year's appropriation.\n\nIt is hoped to ship these supplies in the near future. They will be addressed to you at Hagersville, Ontario. I would suggest that you get in touch with the Station Agent at that point and have him notify you when shipments arrive in order that you may arrange to accept delivery and store the materials until required. It is expected that it will be possible to commence building operations within the next month or six weeks.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hosy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor E. F. Randle,\nSupt.

Hagersville, Ont., with the following results:\n\nMr. C.N. Aldridge, Caledonia, Ont. No tender received\nW. Bailey, Jarvis, \" \" \" \"\n\nMessrs. Bailey & Green, Hagersville, Ont. $2361.90\non all except six items, including concrete blocks, brick, flue lining, flue thimble, and Hyloplate blackboard.\n\nIt will be noted that the latter firm promise delivery in 15 days of all the material quoted on, but can deliver most of it within one week.\n\nAs you may wish to obtain the advice of the Surveys and Engineering Branch officials in connection with this proposed purchase, I am sending you herewith the only tender received, and request advice as to your wishes in the matter, and as to whether this tender is considered satisfactory.\n\n[Signature]\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nOttawa, March 25, 1938.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. Phelan.\n\nRe: Day School at New Credit Indian Reserve, Ontario.\n\nI am returning herewith a tender for building materials for the above which has been received by the Departmental Purchasing Agent from Messrs Bailey and Green, Hagersville, Ontario, and which you handed to Mr. Harris for inspection together with a covering memorandum from the Departmental Purchasing Agent to Doctor McGill.\n\nThe prices quoted appear to be reasonable and fair. Some minor errors are noted in the Request for Quotations however, which should be corrected in the Purchase Order as follows:\n\nOn Page 1: 2 cubic yards Sand, the description has been transposed from an item 60 cubic yards gravel, which has been omitted. The description of sand should read \"clean, sharp, screened from 1/32\" to 1/8\" free from earthy or vegetable matter, suitable for mortar\".\n\nAs no price appears to have been asked for gravel and there is probably not time to secure one before the 31st instant, it is suggested that the purchase of the gravel and of other materials which will be required, be postponed until the new fiscal year.\n\nThe following corrections should be made in the Lumber bill of material, namely:\n\n3 pcs. 2\"x12\"x14'0\" $4 F.B.M. @ $45 per M. (cost $3.75)\nshould be changed to\n3 pcs. 2\"x12\"x14'0\" $4 F.B.M. @ $60 per M. (cost $5.00)\n\n12 pcs. 2\"x8\"x12'0\" 192 F.B.M. @ $15 per M. (cost $8.64)\nshould be changed to\n16 pcs. 2\"x12\"x12'0\" 384 F.B.M. @ $45 per M. (cost $17.28).\n\nThe changes named would add an additional amount of $9.90 to Messrs Bailey and Green's Tender making the total price $2371.80 which it is recommended be accepted.\n\nP.N.L.

This firm promise delivery in 15 days of all the material quoted on but state that they can deliver most of it within one week.\n\nAs we desire to pay for this material from the current year's appropriation it will be necessary to have all accounts dated previous to March 31.

Laforme that the Council grant $5.00 from the funds of the Tribe for the transportation of children of the Mississaugue Day school to Ohsweken and return to take part in the school sports on the 24th of May.\n\nCarried.\n\nThe children of the New Credit School are taking part in the General School sports programme at Ohsweken on May 24th and in order to provide their transportation from New Credit to the Fair grounds at Ohsweken, the Council have voted the sum of $5.00 to pay for their transportation by bus. I would recommend the Council's decision.\n\nE.P. Randle,\nIndian Superintendent.\nDear Sir:\n\nResolution No. 3 of the meeting of the Mississauga of the Credit Council held on May 18 has just been brought to my attention.\n\nIf the children of the New Credit School were taken to Ohsweken on May 24 you may submit a voucher for $5.00 covering the cost of their transportation. This will be paid from band funds.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor E. P. Randles,\nSupt.

The roads and approaches to the School are heavy clay and in wet weather and during the thaw in the Spring, the soil clings to footwear in the worst way, but a good cement sidewalk as an immediate approach to the school would prevent much being carried into school and assist in cleanliness all round.\n\nA sidewalk 3' wide from the road entrance to boys and girls entrance would cost $60.00, so if the Department will approve this, may this office be advised at once.\n\nIt will also be necessary to erect a fence around the school yard to prevent stock getting in, and will take two rolls (40 rods each) of wove wire fencing, plus the posts and labour. The wire will cost approximately .69\u00a2 per rod, the posts about .20\u00a2 each and the labour .25\u00a2 per hour.\n\nMr. McKnight informs me the present arrangements call for the school to be painted only one colour on the outside, whereas all other schools have a green trim, which certainly gives a much more attractive appearance. Also the new office being reconstructed adjoining, is to be painted in conformity with most buildings on the Reservation, so may a green trim be arranged for the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

There are no catalogues in this office showing school furniture of this kind, but no doubt the Department have them, and it is suggested the cupboard for books be a good size as most schools seem to lack reasonable space for placing books.\n\nIt is also not the desire of this office to be unduly critical, but as Superintendent of this Reserve I assume the Department desire to know my opinion over matters of importance under my jurisdiction and it is with regret I have to state in my opinion the new school is absurdly cramped and confined in every way as far as the school room, teachers room and lobbies for the pupils clothes etc. are concerned.\n\nIn my opinion, after allowing for seating there should be comfortable space in the rear and around the walls and between the teachers desk and the front row of pupils. This is certainly not the case in this school as when everything is in place there will be little room to move freely around.\nI hope in future if schools are to be built on this Reserve some consideration will be given to this and it might be reasonable for a plan of the school to be forwarded to this office sometime prior to building operations so it would at least be possible to suggest to the Department any slight change which is considered advisable to propose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

MOORE, INDIAN AGENT, DATED JUNE 1, 1932.\n\nMiss Hammond, teacher of the Oneida No. 2 School, has not as yet signified her intention of resigning and may return after the coming summer holidays, and I would believe that she would be a much better teacher if a new teacher was resident with her instead of Miss Gast.\n\nMiss Gast resigned October 10th from June 30th.\nSir:-\n\nI would beg to advise you that Miss Elizabeth Hammond, teacher of the Oneida No 2 Indian Day School, has informed me that she will not be returning to her duties this coming September, as she has secured a position of the London city staff of teachers and will be able to reside with her parents.\n\nAs Miss Gast, teacher of the Oneida No 3 school has already resigned this will mean two teachers to be appointed for the Oneida Reserve and to occupy the Oneida Teachers residence and owing to the lack of discipline at these two schools I would consider it a good time to try two male teachers to try and improve the discipline, which has been the cause of a lot of expense in the matter of repairs at these two schools and also that the pupils are not making the progress they should.\n\nI have received a number of applications for these two vacancies, both from female and male teachers and intend to secure more before submitting them to you for your approval, as I would intend to make very careful selection of any appointee to these positions in view of past experience. I have informed applicants that the salary to be allowed would be in the vicinity of $800.00, as these are both heavy schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nMinister's Office\n\nJuly 6th, 1932.\n\nMr. Williams,\n\nMr. George A. Rumble, of Rural Route No. 1, Belton, Ontario, and Mr. G. Glen Marshman, of Rural Route No. 2, Melbourne, Ontario, have been recommended to the Minister for appointment as teachers in School Sections Nos. 3 and 2, respectively, on the Oneida Reserve.\n\nWill you be good enough to inform me if there are vacancies, and, if so, what procedure the Department proposes to follow in making appointments. Both Mr. Rumble and Mr. Marshman are recommended as being thoroughly qualified.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nJuly 13, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nI have your memorandum of the 8th instant, with reference to the vacancies at the Oneida Nos. 2 and 3 Schools. I note that Mr. George A. Rumble and Mr. G. Glen Marshman have been recommended to the Minister. The Department has several applications and the recommendation of the local Indian Agent. No church officers need be considered in making these appointments. I believe that Mr. Rumble is the best of the applicants for the Oneida No. 3 School, but I wish to recommend that Mr. Don Vail, of Elderton, Ont., be appointed to the No. 2 School. He is better qualified than Mr. Marshman for the undermentioned reasons:\n\n1. He has a First Class Professional Certificate as opposed to Mr. Marshman's Second Class.\n\n2. He is 24 years of age and Mr. Marshman is but 18. In this connection I may say that this school needs a good disciplinarian.\n\n3. He has one year's experience, whereas Mr. Marshman is inexperienced.\n\n4. Mr. Vail is a personal friend of Mr. Rumble's and, as they have to live in the same teachers' residence, which is midway between the two schools, this is a very important factor.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Moore, of Muncey, writes concerning Messrs. Rumble and Vail, as follows:\n\n\"In all my experience I have never met two more suitable applicants, both being a very fine class of young man.\"\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nSir:-\n\nI would acknowledge receipt of your letter 7-7-1 of July 13th, informing me of the appointment of Mr. George Rumble Belton, Ont., as teacher of the Oneida No 3 School of Caradoc Agency and would advise you that I notified Mr. Rumble of his appointment on July 15th.\n\nThis office has not as yet been advised of the appointment of a teacher for the Oneida No 2 School of Caradoc Agency, for which position I send forward a number of applications on July 9th, last. In view of the fact that a male teacher was appointed to Oneida No 3 school it now makes it necessary that a male teacher be appointed to Oneida No 2 school as these teachers use the same residence. In sending applications to the dept., I sent forward one from Don Vail holding a 1st class certificate; Raeford G. Horn, who recently obtained a 2nd class certificate; and Glenn Marshman, who failed at his examinations and has no certificate and has appealed his case but as yet has not had a report of his appeal.\n\nIn view of the fact that it is getting near to the time of school opening I would request that this appointment be not overlooked and that it will be made at an early date.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind. Affs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nAugust 17th, 1932.\n\nMr. Williams,\n\nYour memorandum of July 13th re the appointment of teachers to the Oneida Nos. 2 and 3 Schools, the Minister has approved of Mr. George A. Rumble, of Rural Route No. 1, Belton, Ontario, and Mr. Don Vail, of Ilderton, Ontario.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, August 22, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the services of a teacher for the No. 2 School on the Oneida Reserve, I now have to inform you that the Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. Don Vail, of Illderton, Ont., to begin duties on September first, next. Salary at the rate of $850 per academic year, less 10% for the current fiscal year, will be allowed in his case. Please inform Mr. Vail of the approval granted for his appointment and arrange with him to take up duties on the date mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMunsey, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nWith further reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Oneida No. 2, Indian Day School of Caradoc Agency and with reference to the applications that are at present at the Department, I would advise that Mr. Glenn Marshman has this morning phoned this office that he is now in possession of a 2nd class certificate.\n\nMr. Marshman at the time the London Normal School examination results were published failed to pass his exams and has since appealed and won his appeal and in this way received his certificate.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind. Affs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nAugust 24, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 17th instant, regarding the appointment of teachers to the Omida Nos. 2 and 3 Schools, I have to say that Mr. A. D. Moore, local Indian Agent, was advised of the approval granted for the appointment of Mr. George A. Rumble as teacher of the No. 3 School and Mr. Don Vail as teacher of the No. 2 School.\n\nIn a letter received from the Agent today, he states that Mr. G. Glen Marshman, who was recommended to the Minister for appointment to the No. 2 School but who failed in his examinations in June, last, informs him that, on appeal, he has been granted a Second Class Certificate from the London Normal School.\n\nIn phone conversation with Mr. Sutherland this morning, you requested the above information and also stated that the appointment of Mr. Vail was to stand.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nMackay, Ont.,\nNov. 12, 1883\n\nIndian Affairs,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing at Ouida No. 2 day school,\nCaradoc Agency, having an\nenrollment of 51 pupils.\n\nI am finding it very\nhard to get along on\nmy present salary.\n\nMrs. Rumble and\nmyself are trying hard\nTo give you satisfaction. I thought odd, but enjoy our work very much. We get much cooperation from Mrs. Moore, your agent.\n\nI do think, however, that the job, if done right, is worth more money, especially to men teachers.\n\nPersonally, I am seriously contemplating marriage. My age is twenty-five.\n\nI should like to remain with this branch of my profession for a time, at least, provided the remun-\nIn view of the facts that Indian children require more and more varied teaching methods than white children, and that our schools are so large, I should like to ask for an increase to take place the first of last September, to one thousand ($1000) Dollars per year.\n\nWe shall endeavour to prove ourselves satisfactory in every way.\n\nHoping you see fit\nTo consider my suggestions,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDon Udell.\nOttawa, November 17, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, applying for an increase in salary as teacher of the No. 2 School on the Oneida Reserve.\n\nIn reply I have to say that under the terms of the Salary Deduction Act, 1932, and Treasury Board rulings, no increase in salary can be made during the present fiscal year to any employee in the Government Service. I would point out that you accepted the position as from the first of September, last, at the salary offered, viz., $550 per academic year, less 10 percent for the current fiscal year. It will be impossible to consider an increase at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nDon Vail, Esq.,\nTeacher, Oneida No. 2 Indian Day School,\nMuncey, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nI would beg to enclose Monthly Reports on the four Indian Day Schools on the Caradoc portion of this Agency for the month of April. I did not get to the two Oneida schools during the month owing to road conditions and also on account of pressure of work at this office.\n\nA number of complaints have been lodged with me regarding the services of the two men teachers of the Oneida schools, due to their being late to the school on odd occasions during the month and after the Easter holidays I had both these teachers to my home in the evening and gave them some sound advice as to their not slacking up on their duties towards their schools and pupils and expect that no further petty complaints should be received and if so and they are proven I will at once advise the Department. The attendance of the two Oneida schools has not been satisfactory during April and is due to road conditions and a considerable amount of sickness.\n\nsecretary,\nDept of Ind. Affs.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nSir;-\n\nI would beg to enclose Quarterly Day School Return forms for the six Indian Day schools of Caradoc Agency for the quarter ending June 30th, 1933.\n\nAll the teachers of the day schools of this Agency have expressed their desire to return after the Summer vacation, with the exception of Mr. Vail teacher of the Oneida No 2, Day School, who informs me that he will know within a week or so, if he shall be returning and I would advise you as soon as I receive this information.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind. Affs.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, July 8, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant, enclosing the June quarter return from the six Indian Day Schools in the Caradoc agency. In this connection it is noted that the teachers at each of the schools have expressed their desire to return for the coming academic year, with the exception of Mr. Vail, of the No. 2 School, who has not yet decided. The Department will be pleased to approve of the re-engagement of the teachers, with salary at the same rate as paid them during the last school year.\n\nYou should advise the Department at an early date if Mr. Vail intends to resume duties. Owing to the fact that Mr. Rumble, teacher of the No. 3 School, was married last year and he and his wife live in the residence, there might be difficulty, should a new teacher be appointed - one who is not acquainted with Mr. and Mrs. Rumble. It is thought that Mr. Rumble should have consulted the Department concerning living accommodation before he took a wife into the teachers' residence which was built for the purpose of accommodating two single teachers only. Should Mr. Vail retire and a new teacher be appointed, would you consider that there would be any friction in the associations between the Rumblies and the new teacher? It is hoped, however, that Mr. Vail will decide to remain.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNuncey, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nI would beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 8th, file 7-3-1 and would advise you that I have had a letter from Mr. Vail, teacher of the Oneida No. 2 school to the effect that he has secured another position and will not return to the reserve for duty this Fall.\n\nFor your information I would state that it was Mr. Vail who got married and not Mr. Rumple and that Mrs. Vail did not reside at the teachers residence since their marriage except at an occasional week end and therefore did not interfere with the other teacher and only came then to do a little house cleaning for her husband.\n\nWith reference to securing another male teacher to replace Mr. Vail, I would advise that I have applications from four young men at the present time, all of whom hold either a 1st or 2nd class certificate and all of them are of a very good class of applicant and would be suitable for this school but will await your instructions as to sending forward their application and in making a recommendation of appointment, as when Mr. Phalen recently visited this Agency he mentioned that he knew of a good male teacher that was not engaged and it might be that you would wish to fill this vacancy from that source.\n\nUpon receiving your instructions as to what you desire done in this case, will depend whether I will send or receive applications at this office and your early reply would be appreciated.\n\nsecretary,\nDept of Ind. Affs.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, July 14, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, informing the Department that Mr. Don Vail, teacher of the Oneida No. 2 Indian Day School, has resigned. In this connection I have to say that his resignation is accepted as from June 30th, last.\n\nWith reference to obtaining the services of a teacher to succeed Mr. Vail for the coming academic year, I note you have applications from four young men who hold either First or Second Class Certificates. I would request that you forward these applications for the consideration of the Department with your recommendation regarding the applicant you consider the most suitable.

I am hereby making application for the position and am forwarding it direct to you, as advised me to do.\n\nI attended the London Normal School, to the principal of which you may refer, and I hold a first class interim certificate. Before entering the normal school I had two years and eight months experience with the Royal Bank of Canada.\n\nMy home is only three-quarters of a mile from the Indian Reserve. The Indians have always liked and respected my grandfather, my father and myself. We have helped them in many of their business affairs, have rented\nland from them and many of them have worked for us. Thus I am, in general, quite well acquainted with the Indians and their customs.\n\nI am twenty-three years of age and have had a good deal of experience with the public, having been eight months in the Prairie Provinces before entering the bank.\n\nHoping that you will consider my application favourably, I remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nArthur B.

Miss Lowry, teacher vouches that the work was done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nMuncey, Ont.\n\nJuly 13th 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI would beg to advise you of a few small repairs needed at the Oneida No 2, Indian Day School at this Agency and would request authority for the work to be done.\n\nA broken latch on the girls' closet needs replacing and a urinal for the boys' closet and the cost for such urinal should not exceed a couple of dollars. A new glass 14\" x 46\" is needed for the front of the book case in the class room. A new black board slate four feet by three feet, six inches, is needed to replace one broken in the large black board at the front of the class-room. The teacher informed me that this was broken by a small girl and was no doubt caused by the frame that holds the whole black board to the wall becoming loose and not holding it secure against the wall.\n\nThe teacher also informs me there are only one set of keys to this school which are kept by the caretaker and another set should be secured for the teacher to have in her possession. Locks should also be placed on the doors of the closets so they may be kept closed after school hours.\n\nSecretary,\n\nDept of Ind. Affs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 16th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, relative to the few minor repairs required at the Oneida No. 2 Indian Day School. You may arrange to have the broken latch on the girls' closet replaced and a urinal installed in the boys' closet. You may also have new glass installed in the bookcase in the classroom. You may arrange to have an extra set of keys provided for the teacher's use, and locks should also be placed on the doors of the closets and keys provided. The teacher or the caretaker should see that these closets are kept locked after school hours. After the above repairs have been completed, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nRelative to the repairs required to the blackboard, it would be difficult to obtain a piece of slate of the dimensions mentioned by you to replace the broken part. It is considered that asbestoslate, which has the same surface as slate blackboard, would be satisfactory, and we will place an order with the Government Stationery Office here to forward a piece of asbestoslate, 4' x 3'6\", and when this is received you should have it installed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Please arrange to have the fastenings on these doors replaced and the doors at the rear of the closets closed, forwarding an account in the usual manner covering the cost.\n\nThe Inspector also states that the stove should be jacketed and pipes to bring in the fresh air and take out the impure air should be provided.

Repair broken and missing boards on outerhouse screens.\n2. 1 pane of glass 6x8.\n3. Repairs needed to both porch steps and painted.\n4. Four door locks need repairing or replacing with new.\n5. 2 dozen coat hangers needed in the cloak-rooms.\n6. Interior walls of cloak-rooms need coat of paint or muresco, as they are dirty and badly marked up.\n7. Whole exterior of the school needs a coat of good paint, as previous paint is off in places and protection to the walls needed.\n\nThis work should be done during the Summer holidays and should not exceed in the vicinity of $100.00 in cost.\n\nConsideration should also be given to having inside closets installed in this School, which is adjacent to the Oneida Fair grounds and public hall and the present closets are being used by the public and are always in a dirty condition and are not sanitary. There is sufficient room in the cloak rooms of this school for the installation and your favorable consideration is requested.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind.

In this connection, I have to say that, as our funds for the present fiscal year are limited, it is considered that these matters can stand over until next year. You should see that the present toilets at this school are securely fastened during the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\n\nActing Asst.

Another grate could be installed near the ceiling of the east wall of the class room to allow the escape of impure airs.\n\nI do not see that much advantage could be gained by having the stove jacketed, unless such jacketing was made from the floor to the top of the stove only, as during the winter months the top of this stove is used for the heating of water for the supplying of noon-day drinks to the pupils.\n\nThe person installing the water conductors at Onieda No. 3 School could, no doubt install the air grates at this school as well, the cost of which should not exceed in the vicinity of $20.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

These supplies could be shipped freight paid to Muncey and the schools kept separate. It would be best that the sugar be in 10 lb bags.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind.

You should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost. These you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. You should show on the vouchers the expenditure for each school separately.\n\nIt is considered that the serving of this hot drink should be given the pupils as from the middle of November to the middle of April, next. It is expected that the supplies authorized will be sufficient to serve a hot drink through the winter months, and you should instruct the teachers to see that there is no waste.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nI am anxious that you should discuss the subject matter of this communication with Mr. Morris, prior to his departure for his summer holidays. I am not, of course, sufficiently familiar with local conditions to comment upon Mr. Morris' proposals. It does seem to me, however, that they are well worth careful study.

Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNunney, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI would report that the following repairs are needed at the Oneida No. 2 Indian Day School of Caradoc Agency.\n\n- Build a new boys out-house complete.\n- Repair leak in roof of school.\n- Point of the brick of chimney of school.\n- Paint the ceiling of class-room ivory colour.\n- Murocco the walls of class-room.\n- Sand and varnish tops of class-room desks.\n- Replace damaged tentest 3 foot square.\n- Replace coat hooks in ante rooms.\n- Replace one broken pane of glass.\n- Repair fence by replacing one post.\n\nThis class-room needs painting badly and should not be left any longer and the leak in the roof should be repaired before the room is painted. The boys out-house is falling to pieces and has been repaired so often it is impossible to continue repairing it and it should be replaced at a cost of about $35.00.\n\nThe total cost of repairs at this school will run in the vicinity of $110.00.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, June 29th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th instant, you may arrange for the erection of a new toilet at the Oneida No. 2 Indian Day School.\n\nYou may also have the leak in the roof repaired.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, the Department cannot authorize the other repairs mentioned in your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncy, Ont.\nR.G. Hoey, Esq.,\nSept. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSince the receipt of your circular letter of January, I have been thinking how this school (Oneida #2 School) could be improved.\n\nAs you no doubt know, the school facilities on this reserve are inadequate for the number of children. There are children here eight, nine and ten years of age who have never attended school.\n\nAt the present time over fifty percent of my pupils are in the primer classes. I thought that with some additional seats could accommodate thirty-five primer pupils, besides the senior classes. Furthermore if the primer classes attended only half a day I could, in this way, accommodate\nseventy primer pupils, (the senior classes would come a full day). By this arrangement all the children near my school could be accommodated and the attendance act enforced\u2014which it is not now.\n\nThis change would necessitate some new equipment\u2014ten new desks, two primary tables, ten primary chairs and two built-in cupboards. But this expense would be much less than an new school and another teacher, and could be carried out quite well, I believe, for several years.\n\nI should ask you to give careful consideration to this idea. If the Department considers this proposal practicable and the change can be made this summer, I would like to be consulted as to the placing of the new equipment.\n\nI trust you will give this matter your closest attention and will let me know your decision on the matter.\n\nMy address during the summer months is given below.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nVernon H. Morris,\nVictoria Harbour,\nOntario.\nDear Sir:\n\nI would acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 5th, enclosing a letter received at the department from Mr. Morris, teacher of the Oneida No. 2 Indian Day school of this Agency and which letter offers some suggestions as to increasing the attendance at his school so as to accommodate more children from the reserve.\n\nMr. Morris suggests the installation of more desks and I would advise you that the present class-room has 40 desks and the present cubic air space per child when all desks are filled is only 200 feet, whereas I am informed that the minimum is supposed to be 240 cubic feet and in view of this I would consider that no further desks be installed.\n\nIn view of the number of primer pupils attending both of the Oneida Schools, the suggestion made that primary pupils attend for half-days only should be considered, for in this way about 24 desks at each school could be reserved for senior pupils for all day attendance and the balance used for stagger classes of low or primer grades. I would consider that the small desks at present in the class-rooms would suffice, without the purchase of further equipment, for as Mr. Morris states there are pupils in the primer grades as old as ten years and all large enough to sit in desks. I would not consider the starting of kindergarten classes at the Oneida Schools in their present crowded state and therefore no need for the table and chairs.\n\nWhile the suggestions of Mr. Morris could be given a trial and may work to advantage in having nearly all the children on the reserve attending school, it is decreasing the amount of time a teacher will be able to give the individual pupil and most of the teaching done will be at the desk and not from personal direction or at the board and in view of the fact that the Indians of the\nthe\n\nOneida Reserve are very backward in learning the English language (much more so than the Chippewas or Munceys) it will mean a lot of time will have to be spent on these stagger classes of primer pupils to the detriment of the pupils of senior grades.\n\nWhen a census was taken some few years ago on the Oneida Reserve by the truant-officer of pupils of school age it was found there were 126 children and we have seating capacity for 76 only and at that time I recommended a new school be built and the truancy act enforced, but with no success on account of shortage of funds to build a school. It is also my belief that the education of the Oneida Reserve children would be much improved if there were four schools on that reserve so that each teacher would have in the vicinity of 30 pupils and all children forced to attend school, which would also eliminate the placing in Mount Elgin Residential School and other such schools of so many children from the Oneida Reserve who could attend a day school if such were available and which would be much to the advantage of the children than as at present.\n\nPending the erection of the necessary school or schools on the Oneida Reserve, the suggestions of Mr. Morris as to half-day attendance of lower grade pupils could be given a trial, without any increase in desks which would create an unsatisfactory health condition. Mr. Morris's letter is returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nDept of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, July 23, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant, the Department sees no objection to trying the suggestion made by Mr. Morris, teacher of the Omeida No. 2 Indian Day School. You should so inform him when the school re-opens on September 1st.\n\nIt is noted that it will not be necessary to supply additional desks.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

August 16th, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLower Muncey Indian Day School.\n\nPlease be advised that two new outhouses are needed for the above mentioned school to replace the present buildings at present in use which are of ancient vintage and are not fit for further repairs. The Public School Inspector did visit this office in connection with these buildings and those at Back Settlement school and no doubt made mention of them in his report of inspection at the school.\n\nMr. John Drake, Strathroy, Ont. will construct and install two new buildings at $45.00 each and it is recommended that his services be engaged for this purpose, so that these buildings will be available when school re-opens on October 1st.\n\nThe school garage which is located on the grounds of the Muncey Council hall should be removed to the grounds adjoining the school and some small repairs are needed to the fences of the school yard. The cost of these two items should not exceed $10.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.D. Moore, Indian Agent.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMuncey, Ont. August 16th, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOneida No. 3. Indian Day School.\n\nThe following repairs are needed at the above mentioned school and should be made before school re-opens October 1st,\n\n4 Cedar fence posts\n6 rods of \u00bc foot, nine strand page wire\n2 lbs staples.\n1 pane glass, double diamond 25 inches square\nputty and brads.\nMaterial and labour to construct a coal bin in the basement of the school 5 feet square by 6 feet high.\n\nThe total estimated cost of the fencing, glass and coal bin should not exceed $12.00 for materials and $8.00 for labour.\n\nThe exterior woodwork of this brick school needs painting badly and it is recommended if funds are available this year. To paint it two coats with Indian labour it should not exceed $30.00, half for materials and half for labour. This painting would include the out-buildings at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMuncey, Ont. August 16th, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOneida No. 2. Indian Day school.\n\nPlease be advised that the following repairs are needed at the above mentioned school,\n\n8 New cedar fence posts\n30 rods of 1/4 foot, nine strand, page wire fencing.\n5 lbs fence staples.\n2 new window blinds.\nrenew ropes on pulleys of windows in class-room to allow proper opening.\nRepair steps leading to boys entrance of the school.\n\nThe cost of the material listed is estimated at $24.00 and the labour to do the work, which can be done by Indians is estimated at $12.00.\n\nThis school badly needs exterior painting and before it could be painted the building should be steel brushed to remove the old paint as much as possible, to ensure a good job being done. To paint this school two coats it is estimated the cost will run in the vicinity of $60.00, half being for materials and half for labour, employing local Indians.\n\nOne new out-house is also needed to replace one of the present structures (the other having been rebuilt two years ago) but this building is not as urgent as the fence and other repairs or the painting of the school. The cost of a new out-house would be $45.00.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, August 19, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letters of the 16th instant, in which you seek departmental authority to proceed with certain repairs at the Oneida No. 2, Oneida No. 3, Lower Muncey, River Settlement and Back Settlement Indian Day Schools.\n\nYou can readily appreciate that it is exceedingly difficult, in times such as these, to secure the funds necessary to keep our Indian day and residential schools in a proper state of repair. I am anxious, however, that we should do our utmost to keep these buildings from deteriorating, throughout this period of national crisis.\n\nMr. Phelan is at this date absent from the office on holidays and I note that an amount of $450 was set apart for repairs to the schools in the Caradoc agency. I have carefully reviewed the items submitted by you and note the urgency of certain repairs that should be proceeded with at once. I am disposed to think that you should proceed with your repair program - the cost not to exceed the amount stated. This approval is given on the understanding that with the exception of the out-houses Indian labour could be employed and that you will secure the out-houses from Mr. John Drake, Strathroy, Ont.\n\nIt is important that a separate voucher, covering the cost of the repairs at each school - paint, labour, etc. - be submitted to the Department.\n\nIt is -\n\nMr. A. D. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nIt is scarcely necessary to state that the cost of these repairs should be kept down to the lowest possible figure. It is my hope also that you will be in a position to proceed with these repairs immediately. It might be well to state on your vouchers that Indian labour was employed in each case.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

McCracken\nActing Indian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. I.A. 518\nMuncy, Ontario,\nNovember 26th, 1941\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Reverend Jones, Anglican minister of Caradoc Agency, has approached this office requesting permission to use the Oneida #2 Indian Day School, in which he wishes to hold semi-weekly meetings at night in connection with Young People's church activities.\n\nMr. Jones stated that this matter was brought to the attention of Mr. Phelan some time ago. Apparently Mr. Morris, former teacher of this school, discussed the matter with Mr. Phelan, with the result that Mr. Phelan gave permission.\n\nThe meetings are, as stated, to be held twice a week, in the evenings. Mr. Jones states that he would be there to supervise, or I would designate some responsible person to act in his place. He also informed me that the Young People's organization would assume responsibility in the event of damage to school property. I am not in favour of this procedure, as past experience has shown that these Young People would in all probability damage the property unless strictly supervised, and it would be hard to prove whether the Young People or the school children had done the damage, if window panes were broken and other similar offences were committed; the organization would include young people from fifteen to twenty-five years of age who are on the Reserve who have a reputation of being more or less irresponsible and rowdy.\n\nThere would also be the matter of cleaning up the school after these meetings which the Young People would no doubt neglect, and considerable fuel would be burned if the school were to be kept open two nights a week for the meetings. Sometime ago I believe Mr. Morris, the former teacher, opened up the school for the purpose of holding these meetings, and it ended up with them holding dances in the school, and when it was discovered that dances were being held, Mr. Moore, the former Agent, prohibited the use of the school for such purposes in the future.\n\nI would wish to be advised if the Department authorize using the school for the purpose above mentioned, and your early reply would be appreciated, so that I may advise Mr. Jones as to the Departmental decision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Mr. Jones attends each meeting and is responsible for seeing that no damage is done to either the building or its contents.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. M.W.

(RG 10, Volume 6151, File 417-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAttention Col. Neary:\n\nURGENT\n\nDuring a recent visit to Oneida No. 2 School I found conditions much overcrowded and beyond the capacity of the teacher. During September forty-one pupils were on the roll and while the school was necessary to provide full seating accommodation, this was provided. In October the roll revealed an increase of eleven. A registration check revealed that the condition was created by an enrolment of beginners; in other words six year olds, caused undoubtedly by the Family Allowances regulations which is, by the way, a step forward and points to a higher interest in education and an effort to get our Indian children started at an early age.\n\nAccommodation, as you know, is not, in any of our one-room Day Schools, adequate for efficient teaching but until the condition is corrected we must provide temporary arrangements. In an effort in this particular case, to find a solution I discussed the problem at length with Mrs. Frida Johnstone and Mrs. Lillian Lockwood, both teachers of the Oneida Reserve, and I was told that a staggering of classes had been ordered. To my mind this is not a solution and both teachers agreed. It is merely an evading of the question and a failure to accept responsibility for which we could be, as in the past, severely criticized. Both teachers felt that a better plan could be arranged. The result of our discussion is as follows:\n\n\"A proposal to rent the Agricultural Fair Hall which is in close proximity to Oneida No. 2. If this can be arranged I think I have sufficient blackboards, seats and books to establish the extra classroom.\n\nIt would then remain to secure an extra teacher. In this I do not think I would have any great difficulty. If the arrangement is approved Mrs. Johnstone would assume charge of perhaps Grades 3, 4, 5 and 6 totalling 26 and the extra teacher would assume control of Grades 1 and 2 totalling 25.\"\n\nIn the meantime Mrs. Johnstone is quite willing to assume the present pupilage for a limited time; in other words until arrangements for the new set up can be made, but if it should drag on longer than expected...\nwe decided that a better plan would be to send the beginners home for perhaps a few weeks rather than have the higher grades staggered to the extent that they would only receive one-half day's schooling a day.\n\nThese are merely suggestions and are submitted for your consideration. If you approve of the renting of the Hall and the hiring of an extra teacher please advise as soon as possible. I will then do my best to correct the condition without delay.

At Oneida No. 2 School the condition was so bad that the children could not read the blackboards. I am therefore wondering whether it would be possible to install electric lights where the power is available. We have two schools on the Oneida Indian Reserve where this might be done, Oneida No. 1 and Oneida No. 2. The main line in both cases passes the doors and it is merely a matter of installation which might be for the two schools, $250.00 or $300.00.\n\nPlease consider the proposition and advise whether or not this might be undertaken in the present fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nMuncey, Ontario,\nNov. 27, 1947.\n\nRe: Your File 7-6-5 (WT1)\n\nFurther to correspondence with regard to the overcrowding condition at Oneida No. 2. The hall mentioned has been made available and a monthly rental of $20.00 has been accepted. There is, however, owing to necessary repairs, a slight delay in getting the classroom ready but I feel that we should be able to move in and prepare for classes immediately following the Christmas holidays.\n\nThere is, of course, the question of a teacher. In this connection I am happy to advise that a teacher who has given many years to Indian Day School work, and only retired last year, has decided to return to our service. Her previous record is beyond doubt satisfactory and we are indeed fortunate to have her return to the teaching staff of the Caradoc Agency. I have not yet advised her as to salary but I am presuming that it will be based on her classification equal to her qualifications... Mrs. Holdsworth holds a Second Class Permanent Certificate. I have requested her to complete the necessary application which will be forwarded within the next week.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. W.

You are advised that the classroom commenced on the 5th instant and a voucher covering the rental will be submitted at the end of the month.\n\nThe writer, in looking over the correspondence between Mr. Down and the church authorities, finds that the former has agreed to pay for the use of hydro in this building on the basis of any excess over their 1947 bills. It is understood that this will be a very small amount each quarter. It is assumed the Department will have no objections to arrange payment.\n\nWith regard to janitor service Mrs. Mary Elm, the present janitor of No. 2 School, is prepared to take over the additional duties at the same rate she is receiving now\u2014that is an additional amount of $21.00 per quarter. We, of course, have to supply our own fuel and the writer understands sufficient fuel for this purpose has already been taken there from the general school supply here.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.P.

HOLLER,\n\nOnida No. 2 Indian Day School,\nMoraviantown Indian Day School,\n\nIncluded in our 1949/50 Estimates is the sum of $14,000.00 for the erection of a one-room school and teachersage on the Onida No. 2 Reserve in the Canadian Agency and $14,000.00 for a similar school at Moraviantown in the Moravian Agency.\n\nIt has been recommended by the Regional Supervisor, Mr. Morris, and by Indian Superintendents Hall and Spence that these schools be erected by day labour with the Departmental Purchasing Agent buying all necessary materials.\n\nIt is recommended by our field officials that we employ Mr. Frank Mahler, of Dalhousie, Ontario, as foreman carpenter at the Onida No. 2 Indian Day School at the rate of $1.50 per hour. Mr. Mahler has acted as foreman-carpenter for us in the erection of the four-room Indian Day School at Mount Elgin and the one-room Indian Day School at Rock Settlement. He has trained a group of Indians on these two projects and we feel he will be entirely satisfactory for the erection of the Onida No. 2 School.\n\nFor the Moraviantown School it has been recommended that we employ an Indian as head carpenter. He is Fred Stonefish of Thamesville, Ontario, and is reported to be a first class carpenter. He would be paid at 65\u00a2 per hour.\n\nAs Mr. Mahler has had considerable experience in following departmental specifications and in the building of our schools, it has been recommended that he go to the Moraviantown\nSchool once a week to supervise and inspect the construction of the new school there. The schools are only 35 miles apart. This will give the Moravian Indians the necessary guidance in the following of the blueprints and specifications and will help Mr. Indian Superintendent Spence, who feels that his Indians can do a satisfactory job.\n\nTherefore, I would recommend to you that both these schools be erected by day labour and that you approve the hiring of Mr. Mahler and Mr. Stonefish on the terms indicated above.\n\nDirector.\n1.

(RG 10, Volume 6151, File 417-5, part 4)\nRe: Proposed new Oneida #2 School,\nCaradoc Indian Agency, Muncey, Ontario.\n\nI would recommend building this structure by day labour because of the employment provided for the Indians and the low cost to the Department, as these men may be employed for .70\u00a2 to .85\u00a2 per hour.\n\nMr. Mahler, the proposed foreman, is most co-operative and his charge is not too high. He has done an excellent job on the new Back Settlement School, which is practically completed. Moreover, he can and is willing to over-see, or supervise, the building of the proposed new School at Moraviantown.\n\nThe truck and cement mixer at the Caradoc Reserve can also be used at Moraviantown.\n\nI am asking for Plan #365 since Hydro is already installed in the other Oneida #2 Classroom. There is an adequate supply of water on the grounds and one pressure system could supply both buildings. Inside toilets could also be used by pupils of these buildings and removal of the out-buildings would provide more playground space, which is badly needed. Furthermore, the better living accommodations would attract good teachers, who are always in demand.\n\nF. L.

Both of these buildings speak for themselves. The materials are good and the workmanship has been first-class. He should satisfactorily construct the new Oneida #2 School using plan #365.\n\nI would further suggest that Mr. Mahler periodically go to the Moravian Reserve and inspect the construction of the new school there. It is my opinion that he should be able to give Superintendent Stuart Spence worth while advice and in this way guarantee that the construction of the building there will compare with the work already carried out by him.\n\nI would recommend that a requisition be sent to the Purchasing Agent requesting that all the necessary materials be purchased, and Mr. Mahler be engaged as construction foreman using Indian labour.\n\nJ.

Mr. Mahler has acted as foreman-carpenter for us in the erection of the four-room Indian Day School at Mount Elgin and the one-room Indian Day School at Back Settlement. He has trained a group of Indians on these two projects and we feel he will be entirely satisfactory for the erection of the Onside No. 2 School.\n\nFor the Moravianstown School it has been recommended that we employ an Indian as head carpenter. He is Fred Stonefish of Thamesville, Ontario, and is reported to be a first class carpenter. He would be paid at $5.00 per hour.\n\nAs Mr. Mahler has had considerable experience in following departmental specifications and in the building of our schools, it has been recommended that he go to the Moravianstown\nSchool once a week to supervise and inspect the construction of the new school there. The schools are only 35 miles apart. This will give the Moravian Indians the necessary guidance in the following of the blueprints and specifications and will help Mr. Indian Superintendent Spence, who feels that his Indians can do a satisfactory job.\n\nTherefore, I would recommend to you that both these schools be erected by day labour and that you approve the hiring of Mr. Mahler and Mr. Stonefish on the terms indicated above.\n\nDirector.\n\nBFN/EM\nOttawa, April 28, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nOneida No. 2 Indian Day School,\nMoraviantown Indian Day School.\n\nIncluded in our 1949/50 Estimates is the sum of $14,000.00 for the erection of a one-room school and teacherage on the Oneida No. 2 Reserve in the Caradoc Agency and $14,000.00 for a similar school at Moraviantown in the Moravian Agency.\n\nIt has been recommended by the Regional Supervisor, Mr. Morris, and by Indian Superintendents Hall and Spence that these schools be erected by day labour with the Departmental Purchasing Agent buying all necessary materials.\n\nIt is recommended by our field officials that we employ Mr. Frank Mahler, of Delaware, Ontario, as foreman carpenter at the Oneida No. 2 Indian Day School at the rate of $1.50 per hour.

I understand he has already had the cellar excavated. So that his job may proceed without interruption, I would recommend that he be authorized to purchase locally the lumber required to construct the forms for the cellar. The cost should not, in my opinion, exceed $100. Arrangements have been made with Superintendent F. L. Hall, of Caradoc Indian Agency, to send his cement mixer to the Moravian Indian Reserve to be used in running the cement for the foundation. It is, therefore, imperative that the cement be bought and delivered at the earliest possible date.\n\nThe work on the above school, as suggested in my memorandum of even date on file 417-9, should be supervised occasionally by Mr. Mahler, the carpenter-foreman, and if this is done, it should be possible to avoid a number of building difficulties as he, to my way of thinking, is capable and familiar with the construction of this type of school.\n\nJ.

Neary  \nIndian Affairs Branch,  \nDept' of Mines & Resources,  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Water for Oneida #2 School\n\nA thorough investigation of the water supply at the above school shows it to be inadequate. The supply thus far has been from a filter well which is not good at best.\n\nHowever, at a distance of 2600' from the school, situated on Indian land, is a spring which flows throughout the year. The supply besides being apparently sufficient would seem to be safe for human consumption. We have had a local contractor do some investigating and he estimates a cost of approximately $3000.00 to put in a system to bring the water to the school. This would include a power line to the spring, pipe line, pressure system, pump house etc.\n\nHaving discussed the matter with Mr. Morris, we decided to request the Departmental Engineer be sent to investigate and give his report.\n\nIf money could not be found for this project at once it could be included in our estimates for next year.\n\nMr. Morris has first hand information on this matter and will discuss it with you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFred Hall, Sup't.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\n**Form No. I.A. 506A**\n\n**Pay to:** Norman W.

NEARY\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept'f of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Wiring Oneida # 2 New School Building\n\nEnclosed find for your consideration a tender for wiring the above school submitted by the Delaware Plumbing and Electric. These are the people who did this work during the construction of the Mt. Elgin Day School.\n\nIt is most unfortunate that I have not more tenders to submit. Two other contractors, Wm. Janes of Southwold, Ontario, and Rac Dale of Glanworth, Ontario, came to the school, looked over the job and studied the plans and promised to submit tenders which they did not do. In discussing the matter with Janes he quoted $6.00 per opening with fixtures at Wholesale Price plus 20% which compares favourably with the tender we enclose.\n\nThe work is advancing rapidly and the contract will need to be let soon. We have found the Delaware Plumbing and Electric reliable in the past and would recommend approval of their tender.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFred Hall,\nSUPERINTENDENT.\nSTATEMENT\n\nJuly 27, 1949\n\nDelaware PLUMBING AND ELECTRIC\n\nRefrigeration, Radio, Electrical and Plumbing\nSales and Service\n\nDelaware, Ontario\n\n$5.00 an opening up to $8.00 opening\nService 1/4 = $2.00 net\nFixtures wholesale price\n+ 25%\n\nIndian Affairs.

They are not interested because the material is being supplied by another firm.\n\nThe only tender received thus far is from the Delaware Plumbing and Electric at $215.00. As near as I can estimate this price seems in order. This contractor did a small job for us when we put the addition on the Agency Office. His work at that time was satisfactory.\n\nWe are still endeavouring to secure other tenders, but as time is running short I submit this one for your consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFred Hall,\nSUPERINTENDENT.\n\nFH/JA\nDelaware PLUMBING AND ELECTRIC\n\nRefrigeration, Radio, Electrical and Plumbing Sales and Service\n\nDelaware, Ontario\n\nContract on labour\nInstalling plumbing at Indian Day School\n\n$215.00\nSeptember 20, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS & DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nRe: Water for Oneida No. 2 Indian Day School\n\nAttached for your information is a copy of a letter received from Superintendent Hall.

Limited of London, Ontario, seemed interested so we supplied them with plans, specifications and a list of the plumbing materials bought under Purchase Order No. 44660. A copy of their reply, in part, is self-explanatory.\n\n\"I have checked into the details of this and find that there is very little that we will have to supply other than the actual labour of installation. When I wrote you, I realized that some of the materials had been purchased, but I did assume that we would be able to include at least the greater part of the soil pipe and fittings, water pipe and fittings, etc.\n\nUnder these circumstances, I do not think that we can give you a quotation on this contract. At the present time, we\nwe have a considerable amount of work under way. I think that you will readily agree with me and understand our situation in that it would not be good business, not fair to our other customers to do this job, which would take a considerable amount of time as far as travelling is concerned, as well as actually doing the work, and on which we are only able sell labour. As you know doubt realize, in our business, profits on labour only, are negligible.\"\n\nIn view of these circumstances we seek approval of the tender submitted by Delaware Plumbing and Electric.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFred Hall,\nSUPERINTENDENT.\n\nFH/JA\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Oct. 3 | To payment of refund for 1 roller Koatar used at the new Oneida No. 2 Schoolp Garados Agency, as per attached receipt. | 1.39 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

I also send my certified certificate that I got from Elgin Institute when I left, and it is my first chance to apply as a school teacher since I left. I now live right here on the reserve and live so close to the school No. 3 that I could attend it regularly where others could not on account of the winter weather. I live with my parents whose residence is only one hundred yards away from this school house and live with the children on the same road so it makes it very convenient for me to encourage them to attend school which they have been sadly lacking these few years back in encouraging teachers. I could also get these little folks to go to Sunday school regularly which also has been neglected. I would like to go in for real work as I know the children would be willing to go to school as they know me so well. This school No. 3 has been set back a lot this last few years owing to the teachers not being able to get...\na place to stay or board close by\nthe school making it very\ninconvenient for those teachers that\ncome from a distance\nSchool No 2 is doing splendid\nwork on account of it having\nan Indian teacher that the\nchildren know and who come to\nhim therefore I know that I could\nbe able to do good work if I\ngot school No 3 to teach hoping\nyou will agree with me and\nfavor me with a position\nThanking you in advance I\nremain respectfully\nMrs Gladys Hill\nOnindia Reserve\nMunsey, P.O.\nOntario\nAge 23\nOttawa, July 12th, 1923.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, applying for the position as teacher of the Oneida No. 5 Indian Day School, and stating the qualifications which you possess.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that enquiry is being made regarding your application, and you will be further advised as to the Department's decision in the matter at a later date.\n\nThe certificate which you forwarded is returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Doubtless you are acquainted with this young lady, and will be in a position to state whether you would recommend that she be appointed or not.

She is writing the Junior Matriculation and...\nEntrance to Normal examination at the present time, and I think she will be successful. She wanted to go to Normal School but, as she will not be 18 until the last day of October, the authorities will not permit her to enter.\n\nShe has been an excellent pupil at Delaware Continuation School, always near the head of the class, and particularly clever at mathematics. What is of more importance in my eyes, especially in a teacher, is that she has extremely good and firm\nprinciples, and a quiet ladylike manner. I have had no occasion at all in 4 years' time to find any fault with her conduct.\n\nShe is patient and conscientious and explains clearly what she understands, so I think she would make a good teacher.\n\nIf she has any chance of obtaining one of these schools, she will make a personal application to you. Mr. Hippo, the Methodist minister, will also testify as to her character, etc.\n\nYours Truly,\nIrene Conway\nPrincipal, Zetland Continuation School\nMuncy Ont.,\nJuly 4, 1923.\n\nMr. McGoakin, Indian Agent,\nMuncy, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to apply for the position of teacher at the Onieda No. 3 School, which I understand is now vacant.

She is highly recommended by her late teacher and also by the Rev. McVitty. She is seventeen years of age, but has the appearance of being at least twenty. She is well mannered and bears a good reputation among the white population, where she has always lived. I am satisfied that if appointed, she will prove to be a very successful teacher.\n\nAs it is necessary to have a horse and rig to get to this school most of the winter, owing to the condition of the roads, it is considered that a salary of $600.00 per year should be attached to the position of teacher.\n\nAwaiting your further instructions.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The salary allowed will be at the rate of $600 per annum, supplemented by any bonus provided by law. You will be good enough to inform Miss Kapayo of her appointment, and instruct her to take up duties when the school re-opens after the present summer holidays.\n\nThe other applications forwarded by you have been placed on our file. If you desire that they be returned, you should make application therefor.\n\nWe note your report regarding the application of Miss Gladys Hill.

Thompson,\nInsp.\nOttawa, June 5th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School, states that it is impossible for Miss Kapayo, the teacher, to make any progress with the school as the attendance is only about 30 percent. The Department would like to be informed as to the reasons for the poor attendance at this school. It would appear that the truant officer is remiss in his duties, as the March quarter return showed an enrolment of 38 pupils, with an average attendance of 10.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will give this matter your serious consideration, and steps should be taken by yourself and the truant officer when the school re-opens after the coming summer holidays to see that all children of school age, who are in good health, attend regularly each day the school is in operation.\n\nThe Inspector further states that if Miss Kapayo had professional training she would make an excellent teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. McGookin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI regret to inform you that Miss Rena Kapayo, teacher at the Oreida No.5 school, lost her life while bathing in the river Thames here yesterday afternoon. Will you be good enough to authorise me to secure a teacher for this school.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI.A.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, informing the Department of the death by drowning on the 4th instant of Miss Rena Kapayoo, teacher of the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School. In reply I beg to say that the Department regrets the sudden passing of this promising young Indian woman. Please convey to the parents our sympathy.\n\nYou may make arrangements to secure a teacher having the necessary qualifications to succeed her. The application of the teacher whom you consider satisfactory should be submitted for the approval of the Department. The qualifications and experience of the applicant should also be stated. I may say that the Department received an application for a position as teacher in a school in the Caradoc Agency from Miss Ellythe Peddle, who formerly taught at the Mount Elgin Institute. She has given her address as Whitechurch, Ont. If her services are still available they would be satisfactory to the Department. However, this matter will be left in your hands to obtain a suitable teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. McCookin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nMuncy, Ont., Aug. 12th 1924.\n\nTo the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada,\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to make an application for the position, as the teacher of either No. 2 or 3 School Oneida Indian Reservation, according to various reports, the above schools are vacant.\n\nMy references and qualifications are filed with the Department of Indian Affairs. Having taught for a period of two years prior to enlistment in the year 1916 with the Canadian overseas forces.\n\nSalary expected is Seven Hundred and Fifty ($750.00) dollars per annum.\n\nI remain your obedient servant,\n\nHelbie C. Jamieson.\n\nVacancy No. 2\n\nCollection from settlement no.\nAs instructed in letter No.7-7-I, of the 8th inst., I beg to enclose applications received for the position of teacher at the Oneida No.5 day school.\n\nThe application of Miss Catherine MacDonald is recommended for your approval. Miss McDonald holds a second class certificate and has had a year at the O.A.C. and for the past year has been \"filling in\" for Inspector Taylor of St. Thomas. From the interview with Miss MacDonald I am satisfied she will give excellent service if appointed. She will accept $850.00 per year, including bonus.\n\nMiss Edythe Peddle, mentioned in above letter would be very satisfactory as a teacher for the Reserve, but she went West on a trip after summer term closed and I have been unable to get in touch with her since. Miss Peddle gave excellent service at the Mount Elgin Institute, seven of her pupils tried entrance and all passed, two with honour.\n\nIf no teacher has been appointed for the Colbourne school, I would recommend that the services of Miss Peddle be secured for this school, if she returns from the West, in time to commence duties on Sept. 2nd. I have had no advice from Dr. Manning, of the Methodist Missionary Society, in regard to a teacher for this school. There is a strong agitation on the Reserve, at present, for qualified teachers, and if these can be secured as vacancies occur in the Reserve schools, it would be a step in the direction of better education for the Indian pupils.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, August 20, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, in which you apply for a position as teacher at the No. 2 or No. 3 Oneida Indian Day Schools. In reply I regret to inform you that there is no vacancy at the No. 2 School and that we have appointed a teacher for the No. 3. There is no vacancy to which you could be appointed at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMr. Herbie C. Jamieson,\nMuncy,\nOnt.\nOttawa, August 20, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, enclosing applications for the position of teacher at the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School. Your recommendation that Miss Catherine C. MacDonald be appointed is approved and salary at the rate of $700 for the ten teaching months, plus any bonus provided by law, will be allowed in her case.

(RG 10, Volume 6151, File 418-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nThe unsatisfactory conditions and results of the day schools in the Cariboo agency necessitated an inspection and remedial measures. 164 children were enrolled during the past fiscal year and the average attendance, but 85 - a percentage of 46. The average salary we have been paying is $607. These facts are indicative of two reasons for the lack of progress, (1) bad attendance, (2) unqualified teachers.\n\nIn October I spent three days visiting the schools and the public school inspectors. The only really qualified teacher is Miss McDonald, at Oneida No. 3. Miss MacArthur, at Muncey, is very successful and worthy of another trial. The other four teachers - Miss Brown at River Settlement, Miss Graham at Bear Creek, Mr. Doxtator at Oneida No. 2 and Mr. Fisher at Back Settlement - are unqualified and should be released at the first opportunity.\n\nI returned to the reserve after a week-end at Moraviantown and Walpole Island and met the Indian parents, the chiefs and councillors, missionaries and others, at a general meeting in the Chippewa Council Hall. I explained that conditions were unsatisfactory and asked for the reasons. The parents and other Indians took quite an interest and were practically unanimous that there were but two reasons: (1) poor attendance, (2) unqualified teachers. The Chief, councillors and parents promised to do everything in their power to better the attendance and I assured them that the Department would install qualified teachers at the first opportunity. When pressed for my meaning in this connection, I explained that the teachers at the River Settlement and Bear Creek Schools could be changed practically at once, (end of the calendar year) as teachers could secure boarding accommodation in the vicinity, and that the Back Settlement and Oneida No. 2 teachers could be changed as soon as residences for qualified teachers could be provided.\n\nI am including in the Estimates for 1925-26, as Important Day School Needs, a residence for the Back Settlement School, a residence (2 teachers) for Oneida No. 3 and No. 2. I also assured them that the only classroom building which was really unsatisfactory (that at Oneida No. 2) would be replaced at the first opportunity. A new building is now in the course of erection on a day labour basis.\n\nI am arranging for better equipment in these schools and, in an effort to make them attractive, am providing some libraries and some articles for group games. At a later date it may be necessary to offer prizes for best attendance and to also organise the reserve into school districts so that a real interest will be aroused.\nExtract from Teacher's Annual Report on the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School for the year ended March 31, 1925, ONTARIO.\n\nREMARKS.\u2014\n\nThese people need a great deal of technical training. To avoid the taking of the children from the reserve some sort of consolidated school is needed in which pupils could be taught, possibly technical work and something more than entrance work. I think the results would justify the expenditure. I find myself handicapped at times by irregular attendance. A school on this plan would largely overcome this difficulty. They need a school which trains and helps them to earn a living, a practical education as well as a book or theoretical study. With regard to the entrance pupil, he is a Grade IV boy who, quite possibly, will cover the 2 years work. However I do not wish to crowd him unduly and cannot say until Easter when we hope to have completed the work on all subjects, whether his rating will be sufficiently up to standard to permit him to try the entrance or not. At present his average is fairly good but I am not at all sure that it would be in his best interests to let him stop school at this time. He is only 13 years old in December but, as the nearest High School is nine miles away, he will not be able to get any further unless the teacher at this school can handle the High School subjects here. It is for such boys that I covet a consolidated school on the reserve. Advice in this matter would be very acceptable.\n\nCatherine C. MacDonald,\n\nTeacher.\nOttawa, March 17, 1925.\n\nMadam:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your annual report on the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School relative to technical and secondary training. I note that you recommend a consolidated school on the reserve, and I have to inform you that the Mt. Elgin Institute is for the purpose of giving vocational instruction as well as academic training to the Indian pupils of the vicinity. The Department realizes the value of giving Indian children vocational activity.\n\nI note that you have a 13-year-old boy who may try his Entrance at the close of this academic year. The Department does not favour secondary training for Indian children in reserve schools. We consider that high school work should be taken in competition with white children and in the regularly constituted high schools and colleges of the province. When a bright and promising student is ready for advanced work the Department, upon the recommendation of the teacher and the Indian agent, would give favourable consideration to a small tuition grant for a year or two, to assist the parents to meet the expense attendant upon the pupil's studying in a white community.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMiss Catherine G. MacDonald,\nTeacher\nOneida No. 3 Indian Day School,\nMuncey, Ont.\nOttawa, April 22, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the salary of Miss Catherine C. MacDonald, Teacher of the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School, has been increased to $95.00 per teaching month as from the first of the calendar year. This is pursuant to the arrangement made by the Superintendent of Indian Education, when he was at Muncey last year. Please inform the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nThos. McGeekin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nMiss Catherine McDonald, teacher at the Oneida No. 3 day school, came to see me yesterday afternoon regarding an increase of salary promised to her to take effect as from the 1st of January. Miss McDonald states that an increase of $100.00 per year was promised her by Mr. Russell T. Ferrier, on condition that her services were satisfactory. I might say that this teacher is giving excellent service; she is interested in her work and very patient and painstaking with the pupils who are showing in the progress they are making, the interest and ability of the teacher. I assured Miss McDonald, who was very much disappointed that the increase was not included in her quarterly cheque, that the matter would be brought to the attention of the Department and would be given consideration, the promise having, no doubt, been overlooked.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nAttention of Russell T Ferrier, Esq.,\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that Miss Edith L. Lowry, teacher at the Oneida No. 3 Day School, is suffering from pneumonia at her home in St. Thomas. She has been ill and off duty since February 4th, and will be unable to take up her duties again for another month.\n\nMiss Lowry sent another teacher\u2014Miss Muriel Graham\u2014to supply for her. Miss Graham has a second class certificate; she took up the work on Monday, February 7th, and taught until Friday, March 4th, when she was notified that she had been appointed to the permanent staff of a public school at Welland.\n\nMiss Stanbury, who has a second class certificate, and who has been acting as a supply teacher in the St. Thomas public schools, has taken up the work at Oneida No. 3 Day School, and, if found satisfactory, will possibly remain until Miss Lowry is able to teach again.\n\nTrusting that this arrangement will meet with your approval.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Lowry, teacher of the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School, has been absent from duty since February 4th, last, and stating the arrangements made by her to provide a substitute teacher during her absence. It is noted that Miss Muriel Graham, a qualified teacher, was employed from February 7th until March 4th and since that time Miss Stanbury, who also is a qualified teacher, has taken up the work and will remain until Miss Lowry is able to teach again.\n\nThe arrangements made for the carrying on of the work during the illness of Miss Lowry are satisfactory. The return, showing attendance, days taught, etc., during the present quarter, should be signed by Miss Lowry, if possible, and it should be clearly stated thereon the number of days taught by each of the above named teachers. Miss Lowry should obtain and forward with the return a doctor's certificate covering the period of her illness.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nThos. McGookin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nPrivate correspondence between the Deputy Superintendent General and the Honourable Mr. Elliott makes it advisable to transfer Miss McDonald or Miss Lowrey at the end of the current academic year. It might be well to get Mr. McCookin's recommendation as to which one should be moved.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier\nOttawa, May 27th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, enclosing a communication from Miss Edith L. Lowry, teacher of the Onsida No. 3 Indian Day School, in which she states that she will not be able to resume duties until September 1st, next. In this connection I beg to say that Miss E. Stanbury, who is substituting during the illness of Miss Lowry, may continue as teacher until the end of the present school year, viz. June 30th, next.\n\nIf Miss Lowry recovers her health and is able to resume charge at the beginning of the next school year, the Department would approve of her re-engagement. You should ascertain from her, and inform the Department not later than the 1st of August, next, whether she will be able to take up duties when the school reopens at the beginning of the next school year, as, if not, it will be necessary to arrange for the services of another teacher. Please bear in mind this request and inform the Department definitely not later than the date mentioned above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos.

I should be grateful if you would see Miss Edith Lowry, who is to live in the same residence with the new incumbent, in an effort to secure the application of a qualified teacher who would be congenial to her.

Gast. In reply, I wish to refer you to my letter of the 7th instant, which crossed yours.\n\nI note you recommend $950 salary. It has been the general practice to appoint at $90 per teaching month at these schools and make an increase of $5 if the services of the teacher are satisfactory. If you have promised Miss Gast $950, please inform the Department, and the change will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nI would beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of August 7th, informing me of the appointment of Miss. Vesta M. Gast as teacher of the No. 3 Onside Indian Day School, in place of Miss. Evelyn Duckworth who has resigned.\n\nI informed Miss Gast of her appointment at a salary of $90.00 a teaching month and she has accepted the position and will assume her duties at the commencement of the school term in September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nEXTRACT FROM FEBRUARY REPORT OF MR AGENT MOORE ON THE ONEIDA #3 INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThe discipline of the school leaves much to be desired, single school desks installed in December last, have been pulled from the floor, no doubt by children playing in the class room. Glass windows replaced last fall and also quite recently, have again been broken and the putty removed after the work has been completed by workmen, doors have been pulled from their hinges, making necessary that they be repaired and re-adjusted. School supplies such as pencils have been disappearing with marked rapidity.\n\nThe teacher is very sincere in her work and appears to me to take the wrong measures in checking her pupils and also appears afraid to chastise the children for fear of offence to the Indian parents.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose Agents monthly reports on the schools of Caradoc Reserve for the month of February. Owing to River Settlement being closed for seven days on account of the sickness of the teacher I did not visit this School and after two trips by car and owing to the condition of the roads I was unable to get to Back settlement School.\n\nIn regard to the report on Oneida No. 7 School, I would believe it would be as well that the department address a letter to the teacher, Miss Yesta Gast, Muncey, Ont., requesting her in a kindly way, to try and secure better discipline from the pupils of her school and that better supervision must be given to the care of the class room furniture and supplies, as well as to the building proper. I have repeatedly advised the teacher not to spare the rod to these children or they will soon be beyond her control and her usefulness will be impaired, although there is no question but that the girl is very sincere in her endeavors to do well for the Indians and their children, and is well thought off by both.\n\nKindly advise when it is expected that an official of the Department will be on this Reserve to take up the question of erection of another day school for the Oneida people of this agency.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind. Affs.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 10, 1930.\n\nMadam:\n\nThe Department is informed that discipline at the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School is not all that is desired, and I write to urge you to bend every energy towards better supervision. The usefulness of classroom exercises is seriously impaired when pupils do not respond cheerfully and quickly to requests and commands of the teacher in charge. The Department believes you realize this and this letter is to assure you of our interest and cooperation. You might also give special attention to the care of classroom equipment, so that the pupils will be taught proper respect for public property and the rights of other pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMiss Vesta Gast,\nTeacher,\nOneida No. 3 Indian Day School,\nHuncey, Ont.\nOttawa, March 10, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 1 of the 5th instant, with reference to the discipline at the Oneida No. 2 Indian Day School. The Department is addressing a letter to the teacher, asking her to give special attention to the question of control of her pupils.\n\nYou will receive a separate communication concerning the proposal to reestablish the Oneida No. 1 Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMunsey, Ont.\nMr. A. D. Moore,\nMuncy.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs I am teaching special courses in music, taking Kindergarten-Primary work with the Juniors, and have a large attendance at my school, I would like a raise of one hundred ($100) dollars on my annual salary.\n\nI hope that you will consider me as deserving of this raise in pay, and that my work has been satisfactory in the past.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nVita M. East.\nSir:\n\nI would beg to enclose the application of Miss Vesta M. Gast, teacher of Oneida No 3 Indian Day School, Caradoc Reserve that she receive a raise of $100 in her salary to make the same $1000 per annum.\n\nMiss Gast commenced teaching at this school in Sept. 1928, and with the exception of a little laxity in discipline, which she has now practically overcome has been a very successful teacher and has the confidence of the Indian people who are making great advances under her directions. Miss Gast also interests herself considerably in young peoples' works and is also a talented musician and is enjoying her work among the Indian people and I would recommend that she receive an increase in salary of $50 to commence Sept. 1st, 1930.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.D. Moore, Indian Agent.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Ind. Affs.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 24, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, enclosing a communication from Miss Vesta M. Gast, teacher of the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School, in which she applies for an increase in her salary.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that the Department will approve of an increase of $5 per teaching month in the present salary allowed Miss Gast. This will make the total salary allowed her from the first instant, the beginning of the present school year, at the rate of $95 per teaching month. Please advise her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

MOORE, ESQ., INDIAN AGENT, MUNCEY, ONT., DATED MARCH 2, 1931.\n\n---\n\nI would beg to advise you that on making a recent inspection of the Oneida No. 3 Indian day school Caradoc Agency, I found a very crowded situation, there being 42 pupils present with a seating accommodation of only 36 and have been advised by the teacher that this condition has existed for some time and that owing to the fact that the majority of these pupils are in minor grades it is impossible for her to give them the attention they should get and also have the discipline necessary for Indian education.\n\nI also found five windows broken and the hot air pipe of the furnace torn down, a number of the school desks loose in the classroom, the outside doors of the school with loose hinges and broken locks and on questioning the teacher as to the discipline she has maintained with the pupils to allow such damage to be done and she informed me that she has a number of larger pupils who are attending that are not there to learn and are very disturbing factors in the discipline of the school, and also that she is unable to watch and control such a large number of pupils.\n\n---\n\nOwing to the present condition of the doors at this school, I would also recommend that two new doors be purchased and two new locks installed on these doors, also give panes of glass will have to be put in at once.\n\nI would also wish your authority to expell from this school any children 15 or 15 years of age when it is not possible for the teacher to discipline and who are not learning but are creating a bad influence in the classroom.\nEXTRACT FROM DEPARTMENTAL LETTER TO A. D. MOORE, ESQ.,\nINDIAN AGENT, MUNGEY, DATED MARCH 5, 1931.\n\nRegarding the overcrowding in the classroom,\nI have to say that it is noted the teacher is unable to\nkeep oversight and control the large number of pupils,\nalso that several of the older pupils are a very\ndisturbing factor in the discipline of the school.\nThe Department does not wish to deprive any child under\nthe age of sixteen years from attending classes, but,\nin cases where they do not conform to discipline, they\nshould not be permitted to attend. The teacher and\nyourself should discuss the matter of the attendance\nof the older pupils and give notice to those who do not\nconduct themselves properly that they are to discontinue\nattendance. The Department will leave the matter of\nrefusing permission to attend in the case of these older\npupils who are creating a bad influence in the classroom\nin the hands of yourself and the teacher. You should\ninform the teacher that it is expected she will devote her\nfull time to the teaching duties during the regular\nclassroom period, also that she should keep proper\ncontrol and discipline over the pupils.\nOttawa, March 7, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring further to your letter of the 2nd instant, regarding the discipline and large attendance at the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School, I have to say that the Department is of opinion that it would greatly help in the present situation if the services of an assistant teacher were engaged to teach the junior classes - both teachers to carry on their work in the one classroom without unduly interfering with each other's work. The senior teacher would be responsible for the management and conduct of the pupils at the school and the teaching of the higher classes. The assistant would relieve her of considerable work, and she would be able to devote more of her time to discipline, school management, etc. I may say that our funds for next year will be limited, and it is doubtful if a new school building can be erected at the Oneida No. 1 School.\n\nI should be pleased to hear from you at an early date as to whether you would recommend that a second teacher be engaged at the Oneida No. 3 Day School until such time as increased school facilities can be provided on the Oneida Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI would beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter 7-7-1 of March 7th with reference to the large attendance at the Oneida No. 3 Indian day school and your suggestion that an assistant teacher be engaged to assist at this school and would advise you although this school is large, the class-room is much too small for the number of pupils attending and from a health standpoint should not be overcrowded.\n\nI would further believe, on account of the small class-room that two teachers could not do satisfactory work in the one room.\n\nI would wish to bring to your attention a building owned by an insurance society and known as Jubilee Hall, which is situated on the South half of the West half of Lot 24, Con. B. which could be obtained either by rent of $20 a month or by purchase of $700.00. This building has a single room, 24 feet by 30 feet, has a bell and Walfry, is of frame construction and is sheathed on the inside with matched lumber and I would be of the opinion that if the Department cannot see their way clear to erect another school this year, that this building could be rented, until such time a building can be erected.\n\nThe location of this building is one concession west of where it would be my intention to have a new school erected, but the present location would be satisfactory for a year at least and in the vicinity of 20 or 25 pupils would attend at this school. There is also on hand at this agency, a number of double seats that were removed from the other schools, when single seats were installed that could be made use of, if this building was put to use.\n\nA new stove in the building would be required, the chimney needs repairing and blackboards installed and I believe that if the Department would rent, it would be to your advantage or even purchase the building and have it removed to a more suitable location when it could be turned into a real good school at a cost not exceeding $1500.00 in all.\n\nIf an official of the Department is in the vicinity of this reserve in the near future, I would wish that he look into this matter and make a definite report to the Department for I can see no advantage being obtained from the engagement of a second teacher at Oneida No. 3 school at the present time.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Ind. Affs.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, March 24, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your l-7 of the 18th instant, with reference to the situation at the Oneida No. 5 Indian Day School. Mr. Inspector McGookin is of the opinion that Jubilee Hall, the building you propose to rent, is really owned by the Band at large. In this event, there is no reason why rental should be charged at all. Please let me have your report on this phase of the question.\n\nThere is no intention of moving this building to a more central location, as it would only be a few years before a proper school would have to be built. As soon as funds can be provided, a new building will be erected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\nSir,\n\nI would beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter 7-7-1 of March 24th with reference to the situation at the Oniada No. 3 Indian Day School and dealing with the title of the hall, known as Jubilee Hall and I would advise you that at present it is recognised that the Jubilee Choir of the Oniada Reserve are the owners of this hall, as at present they have the key of the building and are maintaining the up-keep of the building and have a complete staff of officers, who have control of the building.\n\nThe list of officers of this society are,\n\nPresident Edward Cornelius\nVice-president Charles Summers\nRecording Secretary Williamson Day\nSecretary Mrs. Charles Summers\nTreasurer Abraham George\nManagement Committee\nMrs. Abraham George\nMrs. Wilson George\nJoseph Cornelius\n\nNumber of paid up members about 15\n\nFrom information given me by the officials of the society the funds with which this building was erected was from their society with the exception of about $75.00, which was given by public subscription and so far as I can see, title of the building would rest in the society.\n\nAs it is not the intention of the Department to expend any sum of money on the erection of a new building or the removal of this hall, it would then be a question of cutting expenses as low as possible until such times as a new school is erected and the suggestion contained in your letter of recent date of engaging a second teacher would perhaps be of much less expense, and would have to be more fully considered or to leave the school question as it is until such times as funds are available for the erection of a new building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.D. Moore, Indian Agent.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Ind. Affs.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 2, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the situation at the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School, and furnishing particulars regarding title to the hall known as Jubilee Hall.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the present arrangements for carrying on classroom work at this school will have to be continued until such time as funds are available for the erection of a new building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRunoey, Ont.\nOttawa, June 12th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nIn a report regarding his visit to the Oneida No. 5 Indian Day School on the 27th ultimo, Inspector Thompson writes, as follows:\n\n\"Irregularity in attendance is much in evidence. Out of an enrolment of 36 only 27 were present and of the 27, only 13 were there at 9 o'clock. The other 14 straggled in from time to time; some were over 30 minutes late. The teacher said that much of the lateness was due to the fact that the clocks in their homes were inaccurate. The Janitor should ring the school bell at 8 o'clock and 8.30 and the teacher at 8.45.\"\n\nIf the Inspector's suggestion can be put into effect it might increase the attendance and the Department would appreciate your making an endeavour to carry out this suggestion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMancey, Ont.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\nJuly 17, 1931.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nI have had a chat with Mr. Agent Moore concerning Miss Vesta Gast, teacher of the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School. Mr. Moore has had to warn her several times about the danger of becoming too familiar with the people on the reserve. Miss Gast is a very sincere person and is doing a splendid piece of work among the young people in connection with their Societies, etc., but it appears that they call her by her first name and there is considerable danger of a general breakdown in discipline. She is so well liked, however, and is doing quite good work, so there will be no steps taken to transfer her to another school at the present time.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Moore's Report for the Month of November, 1931, regarding the ONEIDA NO. 2 INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 7-7-7-.\n\nThe discipline at this school leaves much to be desired and is mainly responsible for the destructive nature of the pupils. The teacher is sincere but has used the wrong methods in so far as discipline is concerned. The pupils are making fairly good progress in their studies. The classroom is being kept much too warm for the health of the pupils and this matter was brought to the teacher's attention.\nOttawa, December 11, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your report for the month of November, last, on the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School, it is noted that the discipline at this school leaves much to be desired and is mainly responsible for the destruction caused by the pupils. You state that the teacher, Miss Vesta Gast, has used the wrong methods insofar as discipline is concerned.\n\nThe Department will be pleased to have a report from you stating as to whether or not serious consideration should be given to dispensing with Miss Gast's services. If you are of opinion that it would be in the interests of the work to make a change in teacher, you should advise when same should take effect. Please discuss the matter of discipline with Miss Gast and it may be that there will be an improvement in this regard and that her services would be satisfactory for the balance of the present school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Affs.  \nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI thought I would drop you a line with reference to the teachers of Oceida No. 2 and No. 3 schools, whose services have been far from satisfactory for some time and who I learn from rumor are both leaving at the coming summer holidays and which I hope is true as I had intended recommending the non re-engagement of Miss Gast at least at that time in view of her lack of discipline in the school.\n\nWhat I would wish to know is would it be likely that you would have applicants from teachers that would be satisfactory for Oceida No. 3, which great need is at present as a strong disciplinarian to whip the pupils into shape and I would wish you to keep this in mind should such an applicant apply to you. This teacher would have to occupy the Oceida Teachers Residence and it may be that there will be two vacancies and two such disciplinarians are required.\n\nI guess there are no prospects of a new school this year by the accounts I read in the papers which is a pity.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.D.

Moore,\nMuncy, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nTo save any further inconvenience, and after much thought I have decided to send to you my resignation as teacher of Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School. I may say that I have done my sincere best to teach this school wisely and understandingly. I feel that I have been unfairly accused and sometimes unjustly. However, I have no more heart to try. I therefore, send you my resignation and I intend to write to Mr. Ferrier and give him a true account of my experiences here.\n\nI remain\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nVita M. Scott\nOttawa, March 1st, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, relative to the services of the present teachers at the Oneida No. 2 and No. 3 Indian Day Schools.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, if Miss Gast does not hand you her resignation previous to June first, next, you should inform her by that date that her services will not be required after the end of the present school year. Further, if you consider that Miss Hammond's services would be unsatisfactory for the next school year and if she does not voluntarily resign before the first of June, next, you should notify her before that date that her services will not be required next year. After that date, you should inform the Department of the action taken, and the question of obtaining teachers to succeed them will receive consideration. The Department will keep in view the engaging of qualified teachers, and it may be that applications will be received from teachers that would be satisfactory for these schools. However, you might also keep the matter in mind, and, should you receive any applications which you consider satisfactory, you could forward them after the first of June, next, for the consideration of the Department.\n\nThe Department will have no funds to erect a new school this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Miss Gast has resigned. It appears at present, however, as if Miss Hammond, teacher of the No. 2 School, might be retained in our service. I was wondering if you know Miss Hammond and if you would be willing to accept the vacancy and live with her. Please let me know without delay. We would offer you salary of $100 per teaching month, less 10% for the current fiscal year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Ethel Sproule,\nMartintown, Ont.\nSir;-\n\nAttention Russell T. Ferrier.\n\nI would acknowledge receipt of your letter 7-7-1 of March 1st, re the teacher of Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School of Caradoc Agency and would advise you that I informed Miss Gast, quite recently that her services may be dispensed with, due to the fact that her discipline left much to be desired and that she had been pursuing the wrong methods in dealing with the pupils and also had been interesting herself too much in missionary work, which had not lent dignity to her position as teacher on the Reserve and led the Indian people both young and old to class her as one of themselves and know her by her Christian name.\n\nMiss Gast on May 31st, handed me her resignation, which I now enclose and which I would recommend be accepted to take effect at the end of the June term.\n\nMiss Hammond, teacher of Oneida No. 2 School has not as yet signified her intention of resigning and may return after the coming Summer holidays and I would believe that she would be a much better teacher if a new teacher was resident with her instead of Miss Gast.\n\nIf you have an applicant suitable to replace Miss Gast I would wish you to advise me, and such an applicant should be a good disciplinerian and if you have not an applicant kindly advise me what salary you would offer for a teacher with a 2nd class certificate, living residence provided, for this school of over 40 pupils.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind.

(That is Miss Castle's).\n\nShortly after your letter arrived I was in an auto accident, had not serve enough to write at all.\n\nAbout Miss Castle's school, I knew Miss Hammond quite well, she might be quite a congenial friend, but every week-end she would be going home I understand. She would be alone at the residence, which isn't so desirable there.\n\nSince Miss Hammond is staying on, I think\nA girl from the London district would be more desirable. I thought of taking that school when both teachers were leaving. Then two eastern Ontario girls might come together. I hope you see my viewpoint.\n\nMr. Kerr, if at any time the teacher at River Settlement resigns, could you let me know?\n\nA boy that I knew at Collegiate had been asking me about getting in the Indian work. He graduated from Ottawa Normal this June; (Douglas Barrett) so where any place you would like to place him? He is a Protestant. For reference, phone Mr. Jones.\nThanking you for your kindness and hope I can yet track in the Indian ward somewhere, pardon my tardiness in replying but it was a physical impossibility.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I'm sure in your files at present. I sent it at the end of May. But may I endeavour to explain some things to you as a means of self-satisfying the thing in me that calls for fair play?\n\nI was told that my work has never given satisfaction because of my lack of discipline, that there were repeated reports sent to you from the agent and inspector who have the authority over me; that there were reports back from your headquarters strongly criticizing my work; that I was too friendly with the Indians; and that I was at the time in the balance, and liable to lose my position. I was naturally shocked and hurt and resigned immediately after learning these\nthings from the agent himself who had helped to cause my troubles.\n\nIt seems to me that I owe it to my own self respect to explain something to you, Mr. Terrier, who for some reason, I've come to think of as a friend because you so kindly helped me out with extra cheques.\n\nMy idea of discipline is not that a school should be run on soldier-like tactics. Those days are past. The present trend of education on discipline is one where the teacher tries to understand the child and rule him wisely but as much as possible by appealing to that which is best in him, not by outward force. I know that it's a high ideal. But I undertook to learn to understand these people. I have been interested in all church and community work and I know that it has been good for the young people on the reserve here to have a teacher who took a personal interest in their welfare. It helped me and it helped them. My discipline was the kind that any educational authority would call the best.\nI know there were things broken at school. But I do not think that there was any more damage there than in any other school. Most of the things could easily have been remedied without any necessity for a report about them. And none of them were any different than the accidents that occur in any school.\n\nI came here with a desire to help the people. I have always been interested in church work. I have always intended to become a Deaconess. This place gave me glorious opportunities for doing that kind of work. I know that it did not please the man in authority over me. He did not encourage, but simply made fun of my \"missionary\" idea. I cannot help feeling that he was unfair in his reports about me.\n\nHowever, I want you to know that I did my conscientious best, and that God blessed my work and influence. The things I have done will leave a mark for good on these people because I did them for the sake of Him whom I serve.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gass and Mrs. Hammond, I would now submit for your consideration a number of applications that I have received. Owing to the lack of good discipline at the schools and the need of good ambitious teachers I have previously suggested to the department the engagement of two male teachers and I consider the present a good time to try this out.\n\nI have received applications from teachers of both sexes, which I enclose for your consideration and would advise that all these applicants with one or two exceptions have appeared personally at this office. In accordance with their appearances I would list these applicants in the following manner,\n\nOneida No 2. School.\n1. Don Vail, aged 24 years, with a 1st class certificate and one year experience, who had numerous references.\n2. Raeford G. Horn, aged 20 years, who is expecting to obtain a 2nd class certificate, being just out of Normal and without any previous experience.\n3. Glenn Marshman, aged 18 years, who is expecting to obtain a 2nd class certificate, being just out of Normal school and has had no previous experience.\n4. Lillian F. Begley, aged 21 yrs, who has a 1st class certificate and two years experience, but lacks size to manage such a heavy school, but no doubt could fill the position to advantage.\n5. Mrs Margaret Young, a married woman of Toronto, with two children who no doubt would be a good teacher, except that she has two children, which would not fit into the residence supplied for two teachers.\n\nOneida No 3. School.\n1. George A. Rumble, 21 years of age, who expects to receive a 1st class certificate, being just out of Normal School and has had no previous experience, and who has numerous references.\n2. R. Ross Vogan, 22 years of age, who has a 2nd class certificate and has had three years experience in Bruce County, and a very suitable applicant.\n3. Donald Strachan, 20 years of age, who expects to receive a 1st class certificate, being just out of Normal School and who has had no previous experience.\n4. Isabelle Sambell, 24 years of age, who holds a 1st class certificate and has had three years experience and is a very suitable female applicant.\nMary Campbell, aged 24 years who has a 2nd class certificate and has had four years experience, but whose references were not quite as good as they might have been and who apparently lacked somewhat in discipline.\n\nI have had some other applications but do not consider that they could be considered at all, as they had not the qualifications that are necessary to recommend for these schools.\n\nFrom the number of applicants that I have had the opportunity to interview at this office I would recommend the appointment of Don Vail for the Oneida No. 2 School at a salary of $800.00 and the appointment of George A. Rumble to Oneida No. 3 School at a salary of $800.00, as in all my experience I have never met two more suitable applicants as teachers, both being a very fine class of young manhood and who are well acquainted with each other and could well occupy the same teachers residence. Should Mr. Rumble fail to obtain his certificate I would then substitute Mr. Rose Vogan, who also is a very fine applicant.\n\nShould you decide not to engage male teachers I would then recommend that Miss Isabella Samble be appointed at the Oneida No. 3 School as I would consider her a very fine applicant, but would consider it best that more applications be received before filling the vacancy at Oneida No. 2, as Miss Samble might have some good friend, a teacher that she would like to live with her and I am not entirely satisfied with the other female applicants at present.\n\nFor your information I would advise that I have had a number of the parents of the Oneida reserve approach me with the suggestion that male teachers be appointed to their schools and this and many other reasons have convinced me that it should be given a trial and in view of these being heavy schools and from lack of discipline, and I would wish to be advised at an early date in regards these recommendations and approval of any appointments.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind. Affs.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nJuly 15, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BURKARD,\n\nI have your memorandum of the 8th instant, with reference to the vacancies at the Onside Nos. 2 and 3 Schools. I note that Mr. George A. Rumble and Mr. G. Glen Marshall have been recommended to the Minister. The Department has several applications and the recommendation of the local Indian Agent. No church officers need be considered in making these appointments. I believe that Mr. Rumble is the best of the applicants for the Onside No. 3 School, but I wish to recommend that Mr. Don Vail, of Elderton, Ont., be appointed to the No. 2 School. He is better qualified than Mr. Marshall for the undermentioned reasons:\n\n1. He has a First Class Professional Certificate as opposed to Mr. Marshall's Second Class.\n\n2. He is 24 years of age and Mr. Marshall is but 18. In this connection I may say that this school needs a good disciplinarian.\n\n3. He has one year's experience, whereas Mr. Marshall is inexperienced.\n\n4. Mr. Vail is a personal friend of Mr. Rumble's and, as they have to live in the same teachers' residence, which is midway between the two schools, this is a very important factor.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Moore, of Munsey, writes concerning Messrs. Rumble and Vail, as follows:\n\n\"In all my experience I have never met two more suitable applicants, both being a very fine class of young men.\"\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nSir:-\n\nI would beg to advise you that Mr. George Rumble of the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School, has notified this office that he has had considerable trouble at his school from Belva Powless, 14 yr old daughter of Fred Powless of the Oneida of the Tahmees Band and he has on my advice ordered this girl to remain at home as she is a bad influence on the school in general.\n\nDuring the time Miss. Gast was at this school I had occasions to speak to this girl on the teachers behalf and she is of an insolent disposition and refuses at times to obey the orders of the teacher and sits in her seat dumblike and is not making any progress for a girl of her age. Mr. Rumble has checked up on the discipline of this school which is crowded and it would be bad for the balance of the school to allow this girl to continue, as about three weeks ago she refused to obey his orders and was sent home and then was at the parents request given another chance and has failed to correct her habits and I have ordered her to remain at home and report the matter for your information, as Powless has been abusive to the teacher and according to the teacher has threatened to have him dismissed and appears to side with the child in her disobedience to the teacher, and little can be expected from this child who has no proper control or upbringing taught her in her home.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind. Affs.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, October 15, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, regarding the case of Selva Powless, a pupil of the Onsida No. 3 Indian Day School. It is noted that this girl is not amenable to discipline and that, as a consequence, you have instructed the teacher to order her to remain at home, as, by her conduct, she exerts a bad influence on the other pupils. If this girl will not obey the teacher and conform to the discipline of the school, she should not be permitted to resume her studies.\n\nThis appears to be a case where it would be in the girl's best interests if she could be placed in a residential school. It is understood the Mount Elgin Institute is filled to its accommodation. I would be pleased if you would discuss this girl's case with the Principal, with a view to her admission, upon the occasion of the first vacancy. In any event, you may inform the father that she is not to return to the Onsida No. 3 Day School until she gives definite assurance that she will conduct herself in a proper manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nSir;\u2014 Attention Mr. J.D. Sutherland, Schools Branch.\n\nI would advise you that in September last two men teachers were appointed to the two schools on the Oneida reserve of this agency and their appointments were made with the purpose of improving conditions at these schools, not only in book studies but also in discipline, which previously had left considerable room for improvement and I believe these teachers to have been successful in doing this for the period they have been at these schools.\n\nDuring the time I have been at this Agency I have only met Mr. Thompson, the School Inspector on one occasion and that was in 1928 and he makes his calls without my knowing the time or receiving any report as to the conditions he finds at the schools or whether he finds the teachers are efficient in their duties and I would be pleased to receive a copy of the Inspector's report on the two male teachers of the Oneida Reserve.\n\nThese teachers are having difficulty in making the pupils of the Oneida Schools speak the English language while at play and during school hours and this is the result of the parents not teaching the language to the children before they attend school and some of the older children 13 to 15 years of age have just to be obstinate, refused to discontinue the habit both on the playgrounds and in the class-room and the teachers have had to resort to the strap on this account and I would be pleased to have your opinion on this point and whether you consider the teachers justified in using the strap or would you consider some lesser punishment to be sufficient. I may add the strap is used very easily in cases of this nature, but some of the parents have resented the punishment, claiming they do not wish to give up their own language and other minor reasons. Your early reply is appreciated.\n\nSecretary,\n\nA.D. Moore, Indian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6151, File 418-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the Oneida No. 2 and No. 3 Indian Day Schools.\n\nThe Department considers that it is undesirable for the teachers to inflict corporal punishment on the children for speaking the Indian language in the classroom. If Messrs. Vail and Rumble are of the calibre which the Department considers them to be, it is thought that they should be able to devise some other method of discontinuing this practice on the part of the children.\n\nUnder no circumstances should children be punished for using the Indian language on the playground.\n\nMr. Inspector Thompson recently visited the Oneida No. 2 School on October 17th and states that conditions are improved and that there should be better progress than in the past. On the same date, Mr. Thompson visited the Oneida No. 3 School and states that there has been a marked change in the atmosphere of the school. The pupils are interested in the work and signs of good progress in the future are manifest.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncy, Ont.\n\nA. F.

In this connection I would refer you to official letter of the 29th ultimo, in which it is stated that the Department is not prepared to approve of the teacher's suggestion, that, owing to the crowded condition of the classrooms, only the pupils who come regularly be allowed to attend. This would lead to considerable complaints from other parents.\n\nThe need for at least one more day school on the Oneida reserve has been noted for some time; but, until funds to erect a building and allow for teacher's salary are provided, it will be necessary to carry on under existing conditions. As stated in previous letter, the teachers at both schools should continue their work to the best of their ability, and, if progress is not as good as might be expected, the Department will keep in mind the difficulties under which they and yourself are labouring at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The Bear Creek School was closed during January due to the serious illness of the teacher. Oneida No. 3 school was closed approximately two weeks which was due to the teacher's illness also.\n\nM. W.

You will be advised later regarding his successor.\n\nIs it the intention of Mr. V.H. Morris to continue at the Oneida No. 2 School? Would you favour transferring Mr. Morris to one of the other vacancies and this would leave the teachers' residence vacant and we might then be able to secure two female teachers for the Oneida No. 2 and Oneida No. 3 Schools?

The teacher of the latter school is also a man and apparently wishes to continue in charge of the school during the academic year 1941-42.\n\nIn view of this situation, it would be necessary to secure a male teacher for the No. 3 school, or the present teacher of the No. 2 school could be transferred to one of the other vacancies in the Caradoc agency and two female teachers employed, one for the Oneida No. 2 School and another for the Oneida No. 3 School.\n\nDirector.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nJuly 10th, 1941\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would acknowledge receipt of your letter 7-7-1 of July 2nd which concerns the intention of Mr. Vernon H.

The only answer I can give at this time is: it is rumour.\n\nYou are aware, of course, that the teachers are on summer vacation and perhaps feel that they may take their own time as to whether or not they wish to return for duty. I have not yet had an opportunity of contacting Mrs. Johnstone for verification. I did, however, speak to Mr. Alton Ryckman, our Farm Instructor, Mrs. Johnstone's father, and although he did not commit himself he said that she had been offered $1400 to teach at Komoka, approximately three miles from her home. To date this is the extent of my information. As soon as I am able to contact Mrs. Johnstone personally I will advise accordingly.\n\nMrs. Johnstone's movements evidently travel very fast, in a roundabout way, before becoming official knowledge. While we are on the subject of school\nteachers I might also mention Mrs. Thompson of Back Settlement School. It is also rumoured that she is dissatisfied with her salary and also intends leaving if satisfactory adjustment is not made. In the West Middlesex Inspectorate it is reported that there are expected to be 75 Public School vacancies and that certain officials are making every effort to \"pinch off\" qualified, successful teachers. Both Mrs. Thompson and Mrs. Johnstone are among the best we have. However, if we are unable to offer the salaries we shall be unable to retain their services. A report will follow on each case as soon as I have made personal contact.\n\nGeo. W.

You will remember that this lady was, after much correspondence, appointed teacher of Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School. In view of her late decision it may be difficult to have this school reopen on time. However, I am making personal contacts with previous applicants and hope to have the vacancy filled without too much delay.\n\nGeo. W.

We are now advised that Miss Rideout found it impossible to accept the position and consequently no payment of salary should be made to her.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nSept. 6th, 1945.\n\nI have to advise that all Indian Day Schools, with the exception of Oneida No. 3, reopened for studies on September 4th following the Summer Vacation.\n\nMrs. P. Campbell's transfer from Oneida No. 3 to Bear Creek became effective as at Sept. 4th. With regard to No. 3, Oneida, I have not yet been able to secure a teacher. In the meantime all children within travel distance of either No. 1 or No. 2 have been advised to attend their choice. Should I, in the near future, contact a teacher with the necessary qualifications, I presume that it will be in order to hire without first submitting for approval.\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept' of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nGWD/BC\nOttawa, 10th September, 1945.\n\nMr. Geo. W. Down, Indian Agent, Muncey, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 6th instant in which you advise that all Indian Day Schools on the Caradoc Reserve have re-opened with the exception of Oneida No. 3 School. If you are successful in obtaining a teacher for this school, you may appoint her immediately.\n\nI enclose the necessary forms which the teacher should complete and return in the event of you securing one.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMuncy, Ontario. Sept 27th 1945\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make an application for a position of a teacher for No. 3 Oneida Reserve Day School Caradoc Indian agency for the remaining school term of 1945-1946, or as a temporary teacher while you are securing a first class teacher for the above mentioned school.\n\nMy experience in teaching is one and one half school year as a teacher in Oneida No. 2 Day School from which I resigned at end of month of January 1916 to voluntarily enlist in the Canadian Army.\n\nMy qualification is an honor graduate of a model school held at the Mt. Elgin Institute Muncy under J.R. Littleproud and in the inspectorate of Mr. Johnson of Strathroy year 1912. Also have attended summer school for teachers at Guelph Agricultural College during time was employed as a teacher in No. 2 Day School Oneida.\n\nSalary expected is eighty five dollars per teaching month.\n\nI am yours respectfully,\n\nHerbert C. Jamieson.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nOctober 4th, 1945.\n\nI submit, herewith, for your consideration an application as received from Mr. Jamieson for Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School.\n\nMr. Jamieson is an Oneida Indian of the Caradoc Agency, not too co-operative toward the Indian Affairs Branch; and an arrested T.B. patient. He is the father of Mrs. Virginia Schuyler who, you will recall, taught school at River Settlement, Caradoc Agency, and later at Kettlepoint.\n\nPersonally, I do not approve; neither do I think the majority of the parents with children going to school would accept him favourably. All pupils formerly attending No. 3 have been taken care of either at No. 1 or No. 2 and I think, rather than upset the children, his application might be refused on the grounds that it would be unwise to disturb the pupils at this time; also, the fact that he does not possess the necessary qualifications as required by the present day Board of Education.\n\nI am not adverse to an Indian teaching in one of our Day Schools but, knowing this man and his family as I do, I am sure it would only lead to unpleasantness not only with this Office but many of the parents concerned. However, the final decision is yours.\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDep't of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nGWD/BC\nEncl\nOttawa, 11th October, 1945.\n\nMr. Geo. W. Down, Indian Agent, Muncey, Ontario.\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant enclosing letter from Mr. H.C. Jamieson requesting to be appointed teacher of No. 3 Oneida Day School.\n\nMy understanding is that all the pupils formerly attending the No. 3 Oneida School are now enrolled at either No. 1 or 2 Oneida and if the No. 3 Oneida were opened at the present time it would possibly upset them. There is the further fact that Mr. Jamieson does not possess any teaching certificates.\n\nUnder the circumstances and with the above in mind, the Department is not prepared to favourably consider appointing Mr. Jamieson.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, November 27, 1945.\n\nMr. G. W. Down, Indian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\n\nThere is a possibility of securing a teacher for the Oneida No. 3 School. Before making further arrangements with her, I would appreciate it if you would let me know where a teacher for this school could live. If I remember correctly, you told me that the former residence was now in use as a community centre. An early reply would be appreciated.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nNovember 30, 1945.\n\nYour letter of November 27th, with regard to board and lodging accommodation for a teacher, is acknowledged; and I have to advise that I know of no place in close proximity where he or she could board and lodge. The only possible place would be either Mt. Brydges or Delaware, eight miles distant. It would mean that the teacher would have to own a car, or find transportation with one of our other employees.\n\nThere is always the possibility, of course, of finding accommodation with one of the farmers on the Muncey Road which would lessen the distance; but at present I do not know of such a place.\n\nThe school residence is being used for Sewing Classes, but it could be made available. It would, however, need interior redecorating right through, and re-furnishing in every detail, as the usable furniture was removed and placed in the Lockwood Apartment for the Nurse's use. In other words, it would mean a $1,000 expenditure and not be ready until Spring.\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDep't of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nGWD/BC\nOttawa, December 4, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Dorsey:\n\nWith reference to the teacher obtaining living accommodation at the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School, I have the following letter from Indian Agent Down:\n\nYour letter of November 27th, with regard to board and lodging accommodation for a teacher, is acknowledged; and I have to advise that I know of no place in close proximity where he or she could board and lodge. The only possible place would be either Mt. Brydges or Delaware, eight miles distant. It would mean that the teacher would have to own a car, or find transportation with one of our other employees.\n\n\"There is always the possibility, of course, of finding accommodation with one of the farmers on the Muncey Road which would lessen the distance; but at present I do not know of such a place.\"\n\nWe had a residence for the teacher at this school some years ago, but recently that particular building has been used as a community centre, and it would not be possible to place a teacher there without a great deal of interior improvements. It would not be possible to have these completed before next spring.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division\n\nRev. George Dorsey, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2E, Ont.\nAttention of Mr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDecember 8th,\n1945.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI am obliged to you for your letter of December 4th about the situation at the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School, and note that it is impossible for the teacher to find accommodation. I do not suppose that anything can be done about this, and consequently Mrs. Matteson could not possibly take this work over.\n\nIn connection with the whole problem of education on the Oneida Reserve, may I point out that it seems to me very strange that there should be a school without accommodation for residence available. I know all the difficulty that the Department has, but it does not bode very well for the success of the scheme in the Caradoc Agency, which we were discussing at Muncey, when the Agent informs you that the only possible place where the teacher could live would be either Mount Brydges or Delaware, and that she would have to own a car or otherwise find transportation -- and that, when the Department seems to have a residence for the teacher, which is being put to another use.\n\nI do not want to seem critical of the Agent or of the set-up; but this is the sort of thing that will make it very difficult for the scheme which the Department has in mind in the Caradoc Agency to be very successful. I should be glad if you would discuss this with Mr. Hoey, if you think it is of sufficient importance.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Down, Indian Agent, Muncey, Ontario.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 30th ultimo with reference to obtaining board and lodging accommodation for a teacher in charge of the Oneida No. 3 School.\n\nI have discussed the contents of your letter with the Director and Inspector Arneil and we feel that this building should be placed in such a condition that accommodation can be supplied for a teacher. As you know, teachers are hard to obtain and unless we provide accommodation for a teacher at Oneida No. 3 School it will be simply impossible to secure one.\n\nPlease let me know the cost of doing the necessary interior decorating in this building and whether you can have the work done in the near future.\n\nI think we can make arrangements to transfer the furniture back to this building when it is re-decorated.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nDecember 20, 1945.\n\nReferring to your letter of December 15, re teacher accommodation for Oneida No. 3 School, I wish to advise that Mr. Down's illness necessitates a delay in the required information.\n\nHe will not be on full duty until some time next week.

Young of Chapleau, Ont., not to teach school for several months. If the position of teacher at S.S.#3 Oneida is still open at a later date, I would appreciate it if my application were kept on file.\nI trust this has not inconvenienced you in any way and wish to thank you for your consideration of my application.\n\nYours truly,\nVernon H.

You will note, in his conditions, he mentions water. There is no water at the residence and the condition, if accepted, would mean that some person would have to be hired to draw water daily.\n\nIf his application is accepted I would suggest that you write him direct explaining that the residence is not yet in livable condition, but if he could manage to find board and lodging for a few weeks he could report for duty.\n\nPlease note salary: it might cause our other teachers to ask for increases.\nOttawa, January 9, 1946.\n\nMr. George W. Down, Indian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\n\nI am in receipt of your letters of the 4th and 7th instant, with reference to Mr. W. H. Morris, who applied for a position as teacher at the Oneida No. 3 School.\n\nMr. Morris left our employ in 1941 without giving any advance notice; as a consequence we had to secure a teacher in October of that year. In view of this fact, I do not think that we should engage him at any time in the future. Consequently, I am glad to note, from your letter of the 7th instant, that his services are not available at the present time. If he applies again you may advise him that the Department is making other arrangements.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, January 18, 1946.\n\nMr. George W. Down, Indian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\n\nThe Minister's Office phoned me this afternoon with reference to the vacancy at the Oneida No. 3 School. I know you have been making every possible endeavour to secure a teacher. We might secure one by an advertisement, and I suggest that you place an advertisement in one of the London papers and also in the Toronto Globe and Mail. You could run the advertisement for three days in each paper and have the applicants apply direct to yourself. If you obtain an application that you think is suitable, please engage the teacher immediately. I presume the living quarters will be in shape shortly. You can advertise a salary of $105.00 a month plus bonus of 17%.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn regard to your recent advertisement, I wish to make reply. I graduated from college in the early spring of 1941, with my science degree, and immediately joined the R.C.A.F. Completing my navigational course, and as a young officer, I was posted on coastal patrol. Unfortunately during a night flight we met up with a flying accident which then necessitated my honorable discharge.\n\nFor the past two years I have been teaching school, and lately resigned my teacher's position. I came to Toronto and asked for education, only to find that my application was received too late. Last June, all my entrance pupils were successful, and obtained good standing. I can supply written references from my former schools, and also in respect to character and ability. I am now twenty-five, in excellent health, and with no immediate ties.\n\nHoping for a favorable reply, remain,\n\nC.M. Chen\n\nTel. No. RA 5171\nRoom No. 316.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nJanuary 25th, 1946\n\nAs there are several applications for the position of teacher at the Oneida No.3 Indian Day School and among them one local application, I would prefer that you make the decision. Personally I favour either one of the servicemen who both appear to possess the necessary qualifications. In any case, the residence is not yet ready and the furniture available for transfer as suggested in your letter of December 18th, cannot be moved until other arrangements are made for replacement. It might however, in the interim period of getting the teachers' residence fixed up, be possible to secure accommodation for the teacher in the nearby vicinity.\n\nYou will please advise as to your choice of applicant, advise when he or she will report for duty.\n\nGeo W.

Our records show that the following monthly amounts are being paid now:\n\n- Bank Settlement - $100.00\n- Bear Creek - 100.00\n- Oneida No. 1 - 100.00\n- Oneida No. 2 - 100.00\n- Oneida No. 3 - 105.00\n- River Settlement - 90.00\n\nIn each case bonus is allowed in addition and the teachers concerned were satisfied with the salary when they were appointed. You are probably in the best position to judge their capabilities and the amount of work required of them and consequently I would appreciate your advising which of them you consider should be increased to the same amount as Mr. Conron is being allowed.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nFebruary 22, 1946.\n\nAttached find Employment and Tax forms in connection with Mr. Conron's appointment as teacher of Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School.\n\nGeo.

As you know, I accepted this position. I have not as yet had the privilege of meeting you. However, I realize you are busy in your capacity.\n\nWhen I accepted this position, I was an auditor in a large firm concerned in trade, and though my position remunerated me well, I was still interested in the teaching profession. Previous to this position, I had taught at a private residential school, and also at Rockwood, where I have come under the inspection of Mr. D. Smith.\n\nIn writing to you thus, I do not write to complain in any respect, but I am simply writing in a friendly manner. Nevertheless, I must briefly touch on a point or two. Perhaps first, I should mention that my boarding quarters are entirely satisfactory, and I find that Mrs. J. Epp is both helpful and friendly; as I find most of the Indians are, even though her philosophy is different and their home incentive is low. Second, in regard to the Branta School, where I am at present teaching, there thirty-six pupils in the roll, and though I shall\ndisrupted start, with many grade one pupils straggling in, even to the present day, I feel now that I am getting day by day better organized.\n\nThough I have no teaching certificate, but I am convinced of my experience especially with grade one pupils, that if an opportunity presented itself further teaching term, that I could do a much thorough job.\n\nIn regards to next year, I would like to know, because another position presents itself.\n\nIn closing may I again state, that I enjoy the work here, and hope able to remain.\n\nThanking you, Remain\n\nSincerely,\n\nC.M. Lawson\nOttawa, April 13, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Conron:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, in connection with the Oneida No. 3 School.\n\nIf he has not already done so, the Public School Inspector will soon visit your school, and subsequently he will submit a report to this office.\n\nIf the Inspector finds that you are making reasonable progress and that you wish to stay for the academic year 1946-47, this Department will be prepared to favourably consider your re-appointment for the next academic year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. C. M. Conron,\nTeacher,\nOneida No. 3 Indian Day School,\nR. R. No. 2,\nSouthwold Station, Ontario.\nDear Mr. Ireland,\n\nI am writing on behalf of Mr. Wayne Conron, teacher of the #3 school of the Oneida Indian Reserve.\n\nMr. Conron in the short time that he has been among the people of the above reserve has made for himself many friends, the foremost being his own pupils. To teach any children an especially Indian children you must overcome their shyness and gain their confidence and cooperation; this Mr. Conron has accomplished in a few months both in the school room and on the playground. He has been so successful that many parents have told me that their children have learned more in his short period of teaching than they have learned in two years under previous teachers.\n\nIt is not only in the field of child education that Mr. Conron is of decided assistance to the Indian people. His knowledge of poultry raising and animal husbandry which he gained in his years of study in the Ontario Agriculture College is profitably imparted to his new friends.\n\nMr. Conron's clean, energetic character is a needed and valuable influence among the Indian people.\n\nIn speaking to Mr. Conron the other day, I asked him if he was going to continue for another year; he replied that he wished\nto, but as yet he had not been asked to remain. Now Mr. Conron has many other opening and I know that he is considering accepting one of them unless he receives an early invitation to remain for another year. I feel as do many of my other friend concerned in the work on this reserve that we can ill afford to lose a man of Mr. Conron's type from Indian work.\n\nI am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev) G.

Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDep't of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nGWD/JA\nMr. L.W. Down\nIndian Agent\n\nDear Mr. Down,\n\nI realize as you read this, your natural feelings will be anger, whichever I am in your position would feel. My original intentions were never to leave it so a date, without telling you know. As you realize Mr. Down I have not my Normal Certificate, and would probably eventually, even from a school on a reserve; be told that was a necessity to continue to teach. I admit that I felt somewhat conscious of the position I have given but perhaps during this week you can find a teacher. Perhaps if I tell you the circumstances you may understand better.\n\nIn the middle of July I contacted a certain person asking about the possibilities of obtaining a position after going through several interviews and presenting references, I waited impatiently to hear from them. For weeks ago I received a letter that I should hear shortly from their head office in W.S.F. Even two weeks ago I asked thought of telling you about, but then if false had not come through, I too would have been left without anything.\n\nOnce again I regret say I am very sorry everything this helps you little. However you may also realize that my school was small for the School Register, as at Mrs. St. Thomas in order. Charles Calmonson\nSCHOOL NEWS\n\nA WEEKLY NEWS SHEET FOR THE CHIPPEWA, NUNCEY AND ONEIDA RESERVES.\n\nSeptember 7\n\nOur teacher-training course has proven quite worthwhile. All of the teachers took an active part in the programme and received considerable help from the exchange of experience. In addition to this we were privileged to hear from three School Inspectors and the Director of Art for Ontario. We shall all enter upon the term's work with a greater enthusiasm and a clearer idea of our task and its opportunities.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch was represented by Mr. Doucet, a teacher of wide experience, who outlined the main objectives in Indian education. He was unable, without first consulting other members of the Department, to satisfy all our questions, some of which are very important to our plans here. Many smaller details have been attended to, but we are not yet sure how many grades or pupils we are to have in the senior school. We have been assured of Grade IX and X and have urged that at least VII and VIII be added. We are to be able to bring also any pupils who would particularly benefit by the type of work to be done here. These measures are for this year, since by next year, with the new school and the bus problem solved, a more extensive programme is expected.\n\nWe have just learned that Mr. Conron, of Oneida #3 is not coming back. This is most disappointing, especially since it has given us no opportunity to secure a teacher in time for Monday. It simply means that the pupils of that section will not be able to start school on Monday, but will wait until they hear from me. Mr. Doucet intends to do everything possible to send us a teacher immediately, but we know that teachers are scarce, it may mean some delay.\n\nThe other five schools are expected to open on Monday morning, with your former teachers in charge. For the present it would be wise for all pupils, up to and including Grade VIII, to plan on getting started at their own schools. In consultation with the parents and teachers, those who will be allowed to come to the Senior School will be selected during the coming weeks, or when definite word has been received.\n\nParents please note that no child is to be started to school who is less than 6 years old, except those who will be 6 before December 31 of this year. Until the number of pupils is known, there can be no exception to this rule.\n\nE.B.K. Joblin.\nEX'D.\nOttawa, 26 September 1946.\n\nMr. G.W. Down, Indian Agent,\nMuncey, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 17th instant enclosing letter which you received from Mr. Conron.\n\nIn connection with this school we would refer you to official letter of Sept. 12th. Please let us know if you have secured the services of Mrs. George. If not, do you know any other teacher who can be engaged?\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training\nMuncey, Ontario,\nSept. 24, 1946.\n\nReference is made to your letter of September 20, and I have to advise that I have written Mrs. Hebe George in connection with a teacher appointment for Oneida No. 3 school. To date, Mrs. George has not replied, but there is however, circumstances which are, perhaps, engaging Mrs. George's attention.\n\nIn the first place, she has two small children, second her father-in-law has been very sick and he passed away on Saturday. I may therefore expect to hear from Mrs. George within a day or two, and if she has teaching qualifications, she will be given every opportunity to commence duties at once.\n\nMrs. George, as you are aware, is a war bride, married to an Oneida Indian, and quite recently $1000.00 was set aside to build her a small dwelling. The amount is small and the material short supply question is difficult. I have therefore thought and I suggest that if Mrs. George accepts the position, that she be permitted to move into the Oneida No. 2 and 3 teacher's residence. Does this meet with your approval?\n\nShould Mrs. George be unable, through family ties, to accept the position, I shall immediately look around for another prospect.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept' of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nGWD/JA\nOttawa, 28 September 1946.\n\nMr. G.W.

However, it should be understood that the use of this particular residence would only continue for the period during which she is employed as teacher.\n\nIf Mrs. George will not accept the position, we hope you will be successful in locating someone else.\n\nBernard F.

I discussed the matter with Mr. Joblin but he did not appear to be much concerned. You will recall that some person recommended Mrs. George as a teacher, but my first interview with her revealed that she did not possess any teaching qualifications. In fact, her work along this line had been limited only as a Governess to some small children. However, it was decided that she might be given a term of probation.\n\nMr. Smith, the Public School Inspector, was in my Office today and we discussed the matter very thoroughly. He found conditions as I did, a complete lack of control with little or no teaching experience; in fact we both definitely agreed that the situation is impossible and that the only course open was to recommend that her services be dispensed with at the very earliest opportunity.

SMITH, School Inspector, following his inspection of ONEIDA NO. 3 Indian Day School, dated November 28, 1946.\n\nOriginal on 7-7-6\n\nThe classroom work is unsatisfactory and children are making very little progress. There are none of the Basic Series three primer books in the school and the children are reading the Joe and Ruth book. The teacher is not qualified, has had no experience as a teacher and is accomplishing very little. Part of the difficulty is due to the fact that there is very weak control. The teacher appears conscientious but has not had the training or experience for the work.\n\nSee letter under\nBox 434. Muncey\nOntario.\nDec. 6th 1946.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI regret that I will be unable to continue teaching. The responsibility is too much for me. The pupils are so hard to discipline and I get no cooperation from them. Apart from that, since my youngest boy has been sick I feel that they are too young to be without my care.\n\nI trust that you are still endeavoring to find a qualified teacher for this school, as I will not be able to continue teaching for very much longer.\n\nI remain\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHebe George.\nReference is made to your letter of December 5th with regard to the teacher of Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School and I agree with you that the teacher proposition is difficult, also that it is preferable to keep the school open if only for a matter of discipline and keeping the children off the roads. However, conditions at this school are beyond description and I did not wish to enlarge upon Mrs. George's inability to maintain even some semblance of order and control. I have never called that I could imagine myself entering a school; and Mrs. George cried and openly admitted that the children were entirely beyond her control. Mr. Smith and I discussed the matter at some length and I assumed that he would, in his report, go into a little more detail. However, when I received your letter I also received one from Mrs. George which is attached and is self-explanatory. I can only suggest that we accept her resignation and endeavour to secure another teacher immediately following the Christmas holidays.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. W.

(RG 10, Volume 6151, File 418-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nI am going to take a summer course beginning July 2 to August 13 this summer. This course is being held in Toronto Normal School for teachers who have taught but who have not their Normal School certificates. I expect to hold a Deferred Interim First Class Certificate when I have completed this course.\n\nAccording to your salary scale I would then be a Grade III teacher. I have only 6 months experience in teaching.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nJune 16, 1947.\n\nAttached, hereto, as received from Miss Margaret Annett is an Application for Classification on Indian School Teacher's Salary Schedule. You will note that Miss Annett does not possess a Teacher's Certificate. She has, however, given good service and maintained a discipline throughout her school during the months service she has given. Before commenting, however, on the school that she should return to following the summer vacation, I would like a little time for consideration.\n\nUnfortunately I have received too many resignations but I am in touch with various teachers in the hope that I can make satisfactory replacements and have all schools re-open without delay following the summer vacation. A further report on this matter will be submitted when final contacts and expected applications are received.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. W.

In view of your comments concerning her teaching ability, we are prepared to re-engage her if you so recommend.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nJuly 8, 1947.\n\nReference is made to your letter of June 28th, your file 7-7-1 (WT), with regard to re-engaging Miss Annett as teacher of one of our Indian Day Schools. In this connection, even with Miss Annett's meagre qualifications, I would recommend that her services be retained. What she does not possess in some things she has a decided adaptability in others and I would suggest that her classification be rated as high as possible.\n\nHowever, in view of the fact that I am endeavouring to interest two very fine teachers who have given wonderful leadership, both on the Caradoc Indian Reserve and in white school sections, I wish to hold Miss Annett's placement in abeyance until my prospects have definitely decided what they will do. If they accept, as I hope they will, I shall have all my schools supplied with teachers, that is apart from the New School and I am afraid I am not well enough acquainted with what is happening there.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo.

Neary returns. I must point out that neither Mrs. Lockwood nor Mrs. Johnstone will be interested in teaching positions on the Reserve unless they are both appointed; neither will they accept different salaries. They have already intimated these matters to me, also the fact that they live almost next door to each other in the village of Delaware and use the same car for travel.\n\nPlease give this matter urgency.\n\nGeo.

This condition no longer exists, owing to the cellar drainage having been completed by Washington Doxtator.

Thompson, Public School Inspector, in his report of inspection of the Onsada No. 3 Indian Day School, states that the water conductors are still unreplaced and that there is no water available, as the pump is still broken and the well has not been cleaned. He also states that the closets are not in good condition, there being no fasteners on the doors. There is no wood or coal. The furnace is not in good repair, and in place of using it there is a small stove in the class-room. The Inspector states that the school will have to be discontinued unless wood is provided.\n\nWith reference to the conductors from the eaves-troughs and the repairs to the pump I beg to refer you to official letter of June 7th, last, in which you were asked to report as to the repairs required. No reply seems to have been received to this latter and you will, therefore, be glad enough to take immediate steps to have the well cleaned and the pump repaired. Should a new pump be required you may purchase the same, but competitive prices should first be obtained before the purchase is made.\n\nThe closets should be cleaned out and placed in good condition and fasteners should be placed on the doors.\n\nThe repairs needed to the furnace should be attended to and it should be put in good condition for the winter.\n\nYou should take immediate steps to have the quantity of wood or coal required delivered at the school, competitive prices being obtained by you before making the purchase.\n\nYou should attend to all the above matters as soon as possible and all labour and other expenses in having the above repairs made should be performed as cheaply as possible. The Department will leave these matters in your hands to have these repairs attended to at an early date. Properly certified accounts, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred, to which should be attached a memo showing the prices obtained by you for any materials required in making the repairs and for the fuel.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The furnace will be overhauled and put into working order for next winter, when it may be possible to get coal.\n\nIn regard to the pump, I have been doing my best to get it working, but the men who were to do the work\u2014Williams & Walker\u2014have not started operations yet, I have got in touch with a well operator in St. Thomas, who is coming to give me an estimate on the job. Owing to the high wages offered to Indians this season it has been impossible to get a local man to do anything.\n\nThis work will be completed as cheaply and expeditiously as possible.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have now to request that you will furnish a report regarding the condition of the furnace, stating what repairs are required, and if you would recommend that they be carried out.

This work can be done during the coming summer holidays.\n\nThe Inspector states that there are wide cracks in the cover of the well, which allow the water to fall back into the well, carrying with it any impurities that may be on the cover. If you consider that a new cover should be placed on the well, or that the present one could be put in good repair, you may arrange to have this work done.

THOMAS, ONT.\n\nJuly 27th 1923\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAccording to instructions contained in yours of June 25th 1923 (#7-01-5), I am today returning to you, under separate cover, by concurrent mail, the copies of the plans and specifications for the proposed installation of a steam system of heating at the Mount Elgin Institute, Muncey, Ontario.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.J. Dunsmore,\n\nDEPT. OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nAUG 18 1923\nARCHITECT.\nIn reply to your letter No.7-7-5, of July 14th, in reference to repairs to furnace at the Oneida No.3 day school.\n\nI beg to say that I have had a man look over this furnace and extensive repairs will be required to put it into working order, even when repairs have been completed it is doubtful if it will be a success. This furnace is altogether too large for the purpose.\n\nI would recommend, for your approval, that a larger wood stove be provided for this school. This, I believe, would be much more satisfactory and less expensive. In the case of the furnace it would require more attention, to get satisfactory results, than a janitor can be relied upon to give. The wood stoves in the other school have proved quite satisfactory.\n\nWill you be good enough to advise me in regard to whether the repairs should be done, or stove purchased.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, August 28, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 25th instant, I beg to say that you may purchase a suitable wood stove for the Oneida No. 3 Indian day school.\n\nIn purchasing this stove competitive prices should be secured and the purchase made from the firm quoting the lowest price.\n\nWhen forwarding your account, you should attach to it a statement showing the names of the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This stove was purchased by Mr. Orr at Carleton Place and forwarded here.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter No.1-7-5, of the 17th ultimo, regarding the heating arrangement at the Oneida No.5 school.\n\nI beg to say that this school is heated by a box stove, the furnace has not been in use for some years, it was found to be not satisfactory, the janitor would neglect to attend to it after school hours, with the result that the fire would be dead in the morning and the class room quite cold when school opened. The teacher, Miss Tena Brodie, made application to have a large stove installed to be used instead of the furnace.\n\nThe furnace requires overhauling and a new cold air pipe attached, if grates suitable for burning wood were put in, the furnace could be used satisfactorily, it could be lighted each morning and the room heated much more quickly than with coal.\n\nThe approximate cost of this work would be $50.00, a workman from St. Thomas would be necessary, if the work is to be done properly.\n\nRegarding the interior decorating, this work was done about two years ago and is quite fresh still, very few white schools are in as good condition as this one, it is painted a light green color, the teacher prefers a buff shade which would be brighter, but I would not recommend the re-painting at present, it seems an unnecessary expenditure.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, April 11th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, reporting on the repairs required to place the furnace in the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School in a satisfactory condition.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that before the authorization of having this work done can be considered, I shall be pleased to have your views as to whether the large stove which has been in use is satisfactory, or whether you would recommend that the repairs mentioned by you be made to the furnace, and the use of the stove discontinued. It is thought that the stove would be more satisfactory to heat a school of this type, and would save in both fuel and labour. However, we will await your report in the matter.\n\nIt is noted that you consider there is no need at the present time for having interior decorating done, and that the schoolroom is in good condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I would recommend that two small closets be built.\n\nThe brick work at the two front entrances has broken away and if allowed to further decay, the porches will be in danger of falling down.\n\nThe inside wall between the classroom and the two cloak rooms is badly cracked; the plaster on this wall has been repaired several times but, it appears, the closing of the doors cause a vibration which loosens the plaster, part of which has fallen down. I am of the opinion that this wall should be beaver boarded.\n\nThe interior requires painting and also the outside window and door sashes. These repairs would put the school building in good condition. If the Department approve of these repairs, tenders will be asked for and submitted; the work could be done during the summer holidays.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nI.A.\nOttawa, May 14th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, relative to the repairs that you state are urgently needed at the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to request that you will obtain prices for the carrying out of the following work, including all material and labour:\n\nBuilding of two small closets,\nRepairing brickwork at two front entrances,\nRepairing of inside wall between the classroom and the two cloakrooms.\n\nYou should submit the prices received for this work to the Department, when consideration will be given to authorizing the providing of the funds necessary to have this work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I may say that at the present time this question is under consideration, and, a few days ago, Mr. Indian Agent McGookin was asked for a recommendation. You will understand that, if we provide a hot lunch for this school, four others in the same Agency will have to be considered, and it is just possible that many other schools in the Province will be affected.\n\nThere is no question of the advisability of a hot lunch for school children. However, when the parents are able to provide it, there is doubt concerning the expediency of having it done by the Department. After all, one of our chief aims is to make the Indian independent. I have found the best solution is to ask the parents to give the children a little solid food for the noon hour, which is supplemented by soup, cocoa or milk, provided by the Department and prepared by the older girls under the supervision of the teacher.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

THOMAS, February 21, 1929.\n\nMr. Thos. McGookin,\nMuncey, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn explanation of the Muncey School Furnace repairs account. These items on the account for Material are Invoice prices or more particularly what the material cost us.\n\nThe freight charges are for the freight cost including telephone and telegrams, this is estimated from a period of time as you see by the explanation that the cost of the castings and the telephones is more than is charged in your account not considering the freight charges of the other material.\n\nThe twenty per cent. item is a profit item we would think we are entitled to. The transportation charge is based on a mileage basis and in this connection includes the freightage of the combustion chamber and of the other material from St. Thomas to Muncey.\n\nThe time you will find is itemized on a separate slip. You will remember when our Mr. Stott was speaking to you in your Office of the cost of repairs that he told you it was hard to estimate a cost and this will be principally on account of not being able to estimate the labor.\n\nYou will see that the Combustion chamber and the shaker handle were two items which we did not know had to be replaced, which of course entailed more labor in connection with the replacement particularly of the Combustion Chamber.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHAMILTON & STOTT.\n\nJES/AT.\nMuncey, 25th February, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter No. 7-7-2 of the 18th instant, in connection with repairs to the furnace at the Oneida No. 5 Day School.\n\nI beg to enclose an explanatory letter from Hamilton and Stott, plumbers who made the repairs, which I think will make the matter clear.\n\nThe prices charged for parts required for furnace are the cost prices at the factory, and can be checked up by reference to the Gurney Foundry Company's price list.\n\nThe item of $4.44 is made up of freight, $3.15 as per attached receipts and two telephone calls to Toronto at 75\u00a2 each, a total of $4.65. An itemized statement showing the workmen's time is attached.\n\nWhen looking over the furnace and giving an estimate of the approximate cost of repairs, a new combustion chamber and shaker handle were not included, but when the furnace was pulled to pieces it was found that these were necessary, the cost and labour of installing the combustion chamber added additional cost to the estimate submitted.\n\nThe work was completed in a very satisfactory manner, the furnace, which had been out of use for the past ten years, is now giving excellent service and will be good for another ten years.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In reply I beg to say that you may arrange to have the following repairs and installations carried out during the summer holidays at a cost not to exceed your estimate of, approximately, $60.00:\n\n- New fire grates for Oxford coal furnace.\n- New damper for furnace.\n- 6 panes of glass installed in basement windows.\n- 2 complete window frames installed in basement windows.\n- 6 wire screens installed for protection of basement windows.\n- School pump repaired and placed in good condition.\n- Floor of west porch renewed and painted.\n- Floor and steps of south porch renewed and painted.\n- 1 pair of door knobs installed.\n- 2 door locks installed for classroom and cellar doors.\n- Lightning rods renailed.\n- 1 alarm clock supplied.\n\nAfter the above work has been completed, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter 7-7-5 of June 14, with reference to the repairs of the Onieda No. 3 school and would advise that 3 water pipe conductors are required for this school, which should be in the vicinity of 8 ft. long and made secure on tripods to throw the water away from the school wall, so it is too hard to have water conductors remain on the school in reach of children or cattle who destroy and break these as soon as installed.\n\nOn the north end of the school there are 2 hollow places which hold water in from the conductors and which should be filled and rounded up with earth. These no doubt cause the water to leak into the cellar. The school pump repairs were included in my letter to you of June 13, and I do not recommend concrete top for the well.\n\nIn view of the fact that these wells are surface wells and need cleaning at occasional periods, which could not be done if concrete tops were put on, I would recommend some new planking for the present top as well as an extension to the water trough to make it long enough to carry the water from well top so it will not soak back in.\n\nThe total cost of these repairs, along with others mentioned in my letter of June 13, should not exceed in the vicinity of $75.00 all told. I would advise you that the pile of ashes has been removed from the cellar.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa, July 3rd, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, giving an estimate of the cost of installing water conductors on the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School building in order to carry the water away from the school wall; also regarding the repairs required to the well. In this connection I have to say that you may arrange to have the three water pipe conductors installed. You may also have some new planking placed on top of the well and an extension made to the water trough. It is noted that you do not recommend that a concrete top be placed on the well. Please arrange to have the conductors installed and the repairs to the well carried out.\n\nIt is noted that the total cost of this work, along with the other repairs mentioned in your letter of the 13th ultimo, will not exceed approximately $75. If possible, all expenses in connection with the repairs authorized at this school should be kept within that amount. You should see that all work is completed during the present summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. D.

Moore, Indian Agent.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Ind.

Ltd., Waterloo, Ont., for the supplying of a teacher's desk and chair for the use of the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School. You should request this firm to supply their No. 121 teacher's desk and No. 1563 teacher's chair. You should furnish them with full shipping directions and request them to forward their account, in duplicate, to you covering the cost of the desk and chair F.O.B. nearest shipping point to the school. After this equipment has been supplied, you should certify the account in the usual manner and forward it to the Department, when payment will be made direct to the above firm. Please arrange to have the desk and chair delivered at the school before it reopens after the present summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Elliott,\nMinister of Public Works,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nThe members of the Mothers' Club of No.3 School wish to have you intercede for us in asking the Indian Department to help providing a hot mid-day lunch in the school, which will not only help the children but the teacher as well.\n\nMany of our Indian folk are not able to help and that is why we are asking for help. We would be very glad if the Department would aid us in our work, and we the mothers, will do all we can to have the children attend school regular.\n\nThe teacher has a good attendance at present but circumstances will not allow us to have our children attend regular if we do not get ahead with our new organization.\n\nThe Teacher's reports of last winter explains to us that she had fairly good attendance at beginning of the season and when cold weather settled the attendance was cut down to eight on account of hard circumstances through lack of clothing and provisions in the homes of the children.\n\nHope you will give this a fair consideration.\n\nYours,\n\nPresident of Mothers' Club\n\n\"Mrs. Ethel Abram\"\nMuncey P.O.,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If it is possible to meet their wishes, I will appreciate it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDr. D.C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nNovember 17, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Elliott:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, enclosing copy of communication from Mrs. Ethel Abram, of Muncey, in which she asks that the Department assist in providing hot lunches for the children attending the Oneida No. 5 Indian Day School. I may say that at the present time this question is under consideration, and, a few days ago, Mr. Indian Agent McCookin was asked for a recommendation. You will understand that, if we provide a hot lunch for this school, four others in the same Agency will have to be considered, and it is just possible that many other schools in the Province will be affected.\n\nThere is no question of the advisability of a hot lunch for school children. However, when the parents are able to provide it, there is doubt concerning the expediency of having it done by the Department. After all, one of our chief aims is to make the Indian independent. I have found the best solution is to ask the parents to give the children a little solid food for the noon hour, which is supplemented by soup, cocoa or milk, provided by the Department and prepared by the older girls under the supervision of the teacher.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Ind. Affs.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 24, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, informing the Department regarding the condition of the chimney and roof at the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School building.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may arrange to have the repairs absolutely necessary at the present time carried out to the chimney. Any loose bricks may be replaced, and any pointing required carried out. You may also arrange to have a few minor repairs to the roof carried out, in order to prevent leakage during the coming winter and early spring months. After the minor repairs authorized above have been carried out, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nWe have no funds available at the present time to authorize the building of a new chimney or putting on a new roof. You should draw this matter to the attention of the Department early next spring, stating in detail the work you would recommend be done and, if possible, the approximate cost of material and labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI would beg to advise you that on making a recent inspection of the Onaida No. 3 Indian day school Caradoc Agency, I found a very crowded situation, there being 42 pupils present with a seating accommodation of only 35 and have been advised by the teacher that this condition has existed for some time and that owing to the fact that the majority of these pupils are in minor grades it is impossible for her to give them the attention they should get and also have the discipline necessary for Indian education.\n\nI also found five windows broken and the hot air pipe of the furnace torn down, a number of the school desks loose in the class-room, the outside doors of the school with loose hinges and broken locks and on questioning the teacher as to the discipline she has maintained with the pupils to allow such damage to be done and she informed me that she has a number of larger pupils who are attending that are not there to learn and are very disturbing factors in the disciplining of the school, and also that she is unable to watch and control such a large number of pupils.\n\nI also found that although 8 tons of coal and about 6 cords of wood have been supplied this school this winter, it will be all gone within a week and in short this school is in a very unsatisfactory condition, and although the teacher is very diligent and sincere in her work, she has not the proper control of her pupils, which in my mind is caused by her taking too large an interest in other works and which are not her duties and that she should give her services for teaching and teaching only.\n\nDuring the coming summer, to save expenses I would consider it much better if the use of this school's furnace was eliminated and a small furnace installed in the class-room, which would cost in the vicinity of $60.00 but would be saved in the cost of fuel in one winter and I am quite sure that such a stove would give sufficient heat for the class-room of this school.\n\nOwing to the present condition of the doors, at this school, I would also recommend that two new doors be purchased and two new locks installed on these doors, also five panes of glass will have to be put in at once. I would also wish your authority to expell from this school any children 15 or 16 years of age whom it is not possible for the teacher to discipline and who are not learning but are creating a bad influence in the class-room.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Ind. Affs.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nA.D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, March 5, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, reporting on the crowded condition of the classroom at the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School and stating the damage that has been done to the windows, desks, etc.\n\nRegarding the overcrowding in the classroom, I have to say that it is noted the teacher is unable to keep oversight and control the large number of pupils, also that some of the older pupils are a very disturbing factor in the discipline of the school. The Department does not wish to deprive any child under the age of sixteen years from attending classes, but, in cases where they do not conform to discipline, they should not be permitted to attend. The teacher and yourself should discuss the matter of the attendance of the older pupils and give notice to those who do not conduct themselves properly that they are to discontinue attendance. The Department will leave the matter of refusing permission to attend in the case of those older pupils who are creating a bad influence in the classroom in the hands of yourself and the teacher. You should inform the teacher that it is expected she will devote her full time to the teaching duties during the regular classroom period, also that she should keep proper control and discipline over the pupils.\n\nRegarding the repairs, etc., required, I have to say that you may arrange to have the five broken windows repaired, the hot air pipe of the furnace replaced, and any school desks that are loose in the classroom refastened. You may also arrange to install two new doors, with a suitable type of lock on each. You may also arrange to purchase any further fuel required for the present winter's use. Accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the above authorized expenditures should be forwarded.\n\nThe matter of a change in the present furnace has been noted. Our funds for the next fiscal year will be extremely limited, and it is doubtful whether any alteration in the heating system can be made. You might, however, draw this matter to the attention of the Department next summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. D.

The wood work is at present painted grey and could be left that colour and given an additional coat of paint whereas the walls and ceiling should be given two coats of ivory paint.\n\nThe size of the classroom is 20' x 25' with 14' walls.\n\nThe ante-room is 14' x 16' and has 9' walls. Two cloak rooms are 5' x 16' and have 14' walls. Repairs must be made to the plaster in the cloak rooms before being painted.\n\nTwo dozen wire coat hangers are needed. The desk needs screwing down and repairing. One pane of glass 14\" x 18\" has to be replaced.\n\nThe cost of materials should not exceed $40.00 and could be purchased locally from merchants on the approved list.\n\nThe cost of labour will run in the vicinity of $40.00 also.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 7, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, you may arrange for the interior painting of the classroom at the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School.

(RG 10, Volume 6152, File 418-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nMay 17, 1944.\n\nMr. G.W. Down, Indian Agent, Munsey, Ont.\n\nIt has been brought to the attention of the Department that the Oneida No. 3 School is not very comfortable in the winter. I understand that this building is heated by stoves, although there is stated to be a furnace in the basement. The Department would appreciate it if you would inspect this building at once and let me know at the earliest possible date what action could be taken to make this building more comfortable for the winter.\n\nR.A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nI wish to refer to your letter of May 17th with reference to the heating of Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School, and after an inspection it would appear that your informant has been misinformed. Apparently there was a furnace installed but I am told it was dismantled some ten or fifteen years ago, for what reason nobody seems to know. Since that time a stove has been used with apparent satisfaction until last year when Mrs. Johnstone, the teacher, complained of the school being uncomfortably chilly. I therefore requested, and you approved of, a new stove at a cost of $50.00. The $50.00, however, had to be returned because a stove with increased heating capacity could not be purchased, and the merchants advised that they could not hope to replace a stove of the size and capacity required until after the War.\n\nBefore suggesting the installation of a new furnace, if available, I would want to know the reason why the previous unit was taken out; you probably have something on School files referring to this. In any case, to replace any type of heating unit at the present time, even if available, creates a problem. One of the penalties of the rural dweller today is the complete indifference to his most necessary requirements. Tinsmiths and plumbers, in fact all mechanics, are at a premium, and do not hesitate to advise that, owing to gas control, they are not interested in jobs that entail a trip of 10 or 15 miles a day. I contacted a plumber a few days ago in connection with this school and he advised that he was too busy to even think of it. Personally, I do not see what action can be taken at\nthe present time unless the services of a competent heating mechanic can be secured, and the type and size of furnace made available, although there is perhaps one alternative. The ceiling in the classroom is very high and there is a possibility that the present heating unit would work more efficiently if the ceiling were lowered. This could be done by putting in new joists and a false gyproc ceiling. I have not yet estimated the cost of such a job, neither do I claim that it would correct the condition but if the idea meets with your approval I will estimate the cost and endeavour to have the work done during the summer holidays.\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nGWD/BC\nOttawa,\nJune 15, 1944.\n\nMr. G.W. Down, Indian Agent, Muncey, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, regarding the heating of the Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School.\n\nThe use of the furnace was discontinued in 1931 as a result of a recommendation contained in a letter dated December 1, 1931, from the former Agent, Mr. A.D. Moore.\n\nPlease let me know the dimensions (length, width and height) of the classroom at the Oneida School and also the dimensions of the basement in this building. With this information we will be able to decide the size of the furnace that would be required to heat it properly. At the same time you might make an endeavour to secure a price on a pipeless furnace and, if successful in this regard, you should submit the quotation received, also the name and address of the person giving the quotation.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, July 6, 1944.\n\nMr. G. W. Down, Indian Agent, Muncey, Ontario,\n\nI desire to refer you to our letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the furnace at the Oneida No. 3 Day School, the Department would appreciate a report from you at the earliest possible date.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nJuly 26th, 1944.\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter of July 6th, and refer also to the last paragraph of your letter of July 13th. In this connection I have prepared a plan of Oneida No. 3 School, herewith attached.\n\nI have not yet been able to locate a local dealer who is prepared to give a quotation. Government restrictions, distance, location and gas rationing are factors that dealers and mechanics must take into consideration. I will, however, continue my efforts and advise, as soon as I am able to locate a dealer or service man prepared to quote and install.\n\nGeo. W.

This time a concentration was made, particularly on storm windows and basement windows. This is very unfortunate and makes it difficult to keep the school warm and comfortable; and to add to my difficulties, I am at present unable to obtain glass.\n\nThe R.C.M.P. and the local Indian Constable are working in an endeavour to learn the names of the guilty ones, but again it is very difficult. A few names have been given but, of course, they all deny any part in the destruction. I am convinced that the depredation is the work of school children and I am wondering what you would want done, should we secure definite proof of damage. Personally, I prefer to warn the parents in a manner which will leave no doubt that any further depredation on the part of their children will meet with court action.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDep't of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nGWD/JA\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF D. G. SMITH, SCHOOL INSPECTOR\non his inspection of ONEIDA NO. 3 Indian Day School - dated Nov.28/46\nOriginal on 7-7-6\n\nThe general condition of the school both with regard to accommodations and to progress is very unsatisfactory.\n\nAll the basement windows have been broken out. The grates in the stove are broken and cross pieces of iron have been put on top of them to prevent the coal from falling through. This means that the ashes cannot be shaken out and on the day of inspection the fire died out. The floor is cold on account of all the basement windows being out and in this weather the school is not fit for use, without a good fire. It was most uncomfortably cold on the day of my visit. During the past two weeks there has been considerable wanton destruction around the school. This includes the breaking of the glass in all the storm windows which were stored in the basement and the destruction of a door in the basement. I understand that this matter is being investigated. There is no knob on the classroom door and children cannot get in from the outside. The pump is not in working order.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nLetters written in this on\n7-7-5\nand\n7-7-6\nOttawa, 3 December 1946.\n\nMr. G.W.

All outside sashes and window frames need painting; also repairs to outside steps.\n\nThe ceiling of this school is too high, and the walls are badly in need of repair. In fact the entire interior should be remodelled with one of the modern types of wallboard, and three new blackboards installed.\n\nOn authority received I am endeavouring to secure estimates for the installing of a satisfactory furnace heating unit.\n\nThese are the major improvements and are submitted for your consideration.\n\nThe minor repairs, which I am endeavouring to have completed before school reopens are as follows-\n\n3 outside, complete, door lock sets\n2 inside, complete, door lock sets\n1 new outside door, 2'10\" x 6'10\"\n1 gallon paint for new woodwork\n\nand I trust my action meets with your approval.\n\nWith regard to the major jobs please do not ask for estimates. At present I cannot find any person interested enough to drive into Muncey to even look at a job. I can only suggest that whatever you approve that I be given authority to proceed, and I will do my best to have the various jobs completed as soon as possible.\n\nGeo. W.

The present oil stove used for cooking is depleted and of no use and the teachers have had to rent one for some time and a new one should be supplied. There is a mirror in this office I would turn over to these teachers as it is not in use here. An oil-cloth rug 6 feet square is needed in the kitchen, as are 8 cups and saucers and 6 knives and forks. The present curtains are worn out and the teachers have been using their own and curtains should be supplied, a good grade purchased by the yard being best. The present wire screens on use in the window have rusted through and are needing replacing and the small extending type at small cost would be sufficient. Two small panes of glass should be replaced in the storm doors to put them in shape for the future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, March 31, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, relative to the request of the teachers residing in the residence on the Oneida of the Thames Reserve to be supplied with the equipment as mentioned for the use of the residence.\n\nWith reference to the request for a sanitary closet for the bathroom, it is considered that the outside closet should be satisfactory for their use until next fall at least. You might have this outside closet thoroughly cleaned and, after this has been done, it is expected that the teachers, themselves, will see that it is kept in good condition. If there is no lock on the door, you may have a suitable lock installed, and the key should be kept in the possession of the teachers, who should see that the closet is kept locked.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of an oil stove for cooking purposes. This should be obtained as cheaply as possible, having in view the supplying of a stove of a satisfactory type.\n\nRegarding the mirror, it is noted that you can supply one from your office, which is not in use, and I would request that you hand same over to the teachers.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of an oilcloth rug, 6' square, also 6 cups and saucers and 6 knives and forks.\n\nYou may purchase the quantity of curtain material required. It is considered that the teachers could make up the curtains and have them installed. You may also arrange to have the wire screens on the windows replaced. It is noted that you consider it would be satisfactory if the small extending type of screens were supplied. You may also arrange to have any panes of glass required replaced in the storm doors.\n\nAfter the above authorized expenditures have been incurred, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The wall paper and ceiling paper in the two rooms is black and this no doubt was caused by the stove and oil stove and gives the rooms a very dirty appearance, and should be papered right away. The total cost of these repairs should not exceed $20.00.\n\nSecretary.\nDept of Ind. Affs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nA. D.

If at all possible, you should arrange to visit the residence every month or so during the next school year, and, if it is not being kept clean by the teachers, the Department should be so advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

His contention is that while they are able to fry on the oil burner, the residence does not receive any heat nor are they able to do any baking as there is no oven. A suitable small range for this residence could be secured for $25.00 and I would recommend its purchase, with the distinct understanding their fuel allowance will not exceed the $2.00 a month allowance they were given for the oil stove. It is Mr. Morris' to bring his father and mother to the residence if arrangements can be made with the other teacher, so they may have someone to take care of the buildings and grounds as well as prepare their meals and does this meet with the approval of the department.\n\nSecretary.\nDept of Ind. Affs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, October 23, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of a small range for the teachers' residence at the Oneida No. 2 School. The teachers should be informed that the Department is only prepared to allow an amount not exceeding $2 a month for the ten teaching months for the purchase of the fuel required for this range.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Morris' request to allow his father and mother to live in the residence, it has been decided to leave this matter in your hands. If Mr. Rumble has no objection, and you consider the residence large enough to allow Mr. Morris' father and mother to live there, you may grant permission, as such an arrangement would probably result in the residence being kept in better condition.\n\nIt should be understood, however, that this permission would only apply as long as both Mr. Rumble and Mr. Morris are employed. If at any time Mr. Rumble was replaced by another teacher, the new teacher's permission would have to be secured before the Department would be prepared to consent to Mr. and Mrs. Morris remaining in the residence. As you understand, the residence is intended for the use of the teacher at both the Oneida No. 2 and Oneida No. 3 Schools, and, consequently, both should be agreed before any other persons are allowed to reside in it.\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of official letter which is being forwarded to both Mr. Rumble and Mr. Morris.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nOttawa, October 23, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nAs you are aware, the Department provides a residence for the teachers of the Oneida No. 2 and Oneida No. 3 Day Schools. An officer of the Schools Branch recently visited this building and reports that it was evident no effort has been made to keep it in good condition. I realize you are not responsible for this, but my purpose in writing to you at the present time is to point out that the Department expects the occupants of this building to keep it and the surroundings in an attractive condition.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to Mr. Agent Moore, and he is being requested to report to the Department if our instructions are not carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nV. H. Morris, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nOneida No. 2 Indian Day School,\nMuncy, Ont.\nOttawa, October 23, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nAn officer of the Schools Branch recently visited the residence supplied by the Department for the teachers of the Oneida No. 2 and Oneida No. 3 Day Schools. The residence appeared very dirty and, in addition, the garbage was at the back door and the weeds in the front yard had not been cut.\n\nThe Department considers that, when we supply a building for the use of the teachers at these two schools, those occupying it should take good care of it. I trust that, in future, you and the other teacher using this residence will see that the building and its surroundings are kept clean and in an attractive condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

On their arrival they had noticed that the back door was open; one bed appeared to have been slept in and an alarm clock was set for five A.M. and was running.\n\nIt was believed that whoever was responsible for this act was making a practice of spending the night there and with this in mind a patrol was made to the residence in the early A.M. of the 9th, 10th and 11th instants and observations made without success.\n\nEnquiries made from the Agent's office disclose that certain repairs had recently been made to the building and it is thought that when the repairman completed the job he left and failed to notice that the catch on the Yale lock was not in the lock position.\n\nIt is more than likely that whoever entered the building did so to take shelter from the inclemency of the weather. This presumption is further amplified as whoever entered did not do so for gain as there are dishes, linens, coal oil lamps and other miscellaneous articles of value which have not been touched and which would be considered as valuable loot to an Indian if entry had been made with that in mind.\n\nIt may be stated that during the School vacation periods the schools and Teacher's residence is kept under observation while making general patrols of the Reserves and the doors and windows inspected periodically.\n\nThe doors and windows have been securely locked so that entry cannot be made except by force.\n\nTo - The Com'r, RCMP\nForwarded.

You are aware that if the Indian children are taught reading, writing, arithmetic and a few other subjects, together with habits of industry, obedience and cleanliness, a great deal will be accomplished towards their civilization and education. Now I maintain that these subjects have been fairly taught in the schools by the teachers appointed by the priests in the past years, though many of these teachers had not Third Class certificates. If the Department decide on raising the standard of qualification for the teachers, it will also be necessary to raise the salaries to Five Hundred and Fifty or Four Hundred Dollars; otherwise the greater number of the schools will be closed for want of teachers. I am confident the Department does not intend to deprive the Indians of the benefit of a moderate education, because Third Class teachers cannot be found willing to sacrifice the comforts of civilized society by living among Indians and teaching their children for the paltry sum of Two Hundred Dollars. Hence I insist that the appointment of the teacher shall remain with the missionary, who shall always endeavor to procure the best and most suitable, that such low salaries can secure.\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\nR.H. Connell\nBishop of Peterborough\n\nAttorney Reed Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nOne of the priests of this diocese, who has charge of the Indian missions in the Lake Superior District, has written me, with reference to the appointment of teachers for the Catholic Indian schools. Mr. Connolly, the agent of the Department at Port Arthur, informed the missionary father, that he was instructed by the Indian Department at Ottawa, not to permit anyone to teach in the schools for the Indians, without having at least a Third Class Certificate; and that the testimony of knowledge and good conduct hitherto given by the missionary, would not suffice. Now I desire to protest most strenuously against this violation, on the part of the Department, of an agreement made with my predecessor Rt. Rev. Bishop James. According to this agreement the appointment of teachers for the schools of our Catholic Indians, was left to the Bishop or his deputy, the priest in charge of the mission. The priest has in all cases selected the best teachers that could be obtained for the small salary given, viz.: Two Hundred Dollars ($200) and in some cases Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($250). How you can readily understand, that if the priest engaged only such teachers as held Third Class Certificates, most of the schools would be closed, as very few teachers with this qualification could be found willing to instruct.\n\nAugust 29th - 1895\nIndian children for so small a salary.

Because I credited the Indian Teacher who always paid when he received his cheque, but the last cheque was sent under cover to someone else. Said party, he said, kept out money from him and he did not get the handling of his cheque. Now this is virtually a board bill because old Moses Madway was boarded with Thomas Demolin. If the cheque had been sent to him in the regular way through the P.O., he would have paid said Board Bill. As he only received $250 a year, and it takes about $300 a year, half decent in this country, I would respectfully suggest the Department pay him this Board Bill and send him to Southampton for the balance of $50 as additional pay.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father LeMarche that it is probable that the Deptt will accept Miss Harrison and that she would be safe in re-opening the school without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, October 7, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 3rd inst. I beg to say that the Department approves of the temporary appointment of Miss Harrison as teacher of the Pio school at a salary of $300 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nN. McDougall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nOttawa, May 9, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to call your attention to the fact that the Pic school has been closed since August 9, last, as Miss Harrison was transferred to the Lake Helen school. As there is a large number of children of school age in this reserve the Department is of opinion that it should be re-opened with as little delay as possible, and I have to ask you to be good enough to state whether you have taken any steps with a view to securing the services of a teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. L. Dugas,\nNepigon, Ont.\nNepeigon, May the 16th 1910\n\nThe Secretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to your letter of May the 9th, No 153811/1, addressed to Rev. L. Dugas, I must say that I am in charge of the Pic Reserve school.\n\nWhen Miss Harrison was transferred to Lake Helen school Nepeigon, I wrote then to the Depart and gave the reasons which necessitated the transfer.\n\nWhen Miss Harrison arrived at Pic Nov. the 3rd 1906, all the Indians, without notifying me of their intentions, had all gone away in the woods, except two families. For three weeks she had only one little girl 8 years old to attend school and she had only three pupils until Xmas time. Few days after New Year 1907 all the Indians went away again; not a single pupil to attend school, as you may see by the returns of that period. The poor woman lived all alone on the Reserve at 3 miles from the station of Theron Bay.\n\nShe would have returned to Montreal if she could, but she had no money to do it. Then, by charity for the poor woman, I had a log building put up at Montezambert by the Indians who had come there to work (it cost me $30.00 to get windows and lumber for walls) and Miss Harrison continued to teach there with an attendance of 10 to 16 pupils.\nat summer time she returned to Pie Reserve where she had as many as 26 pupils present sometimes.\n\nI have tried my best to induce those Indians to remain on their Reserve, but they pretend that they cannot find their living on the Reserve.\n\nI had another teacher ready to come if she was wanted, but I did not intend to expose her to pass through the same troubles as Miss Harrison. Indeed after the picking berries and fishing was over, the Indians all went away again last fall, and they have not returned yet to the Reserve.\n\nIf I see any chance to reopen that Pie school, I will be most anxious to apply for a teacher.\n\nYours in Xst\n\nRev. W. Lamarche, J.F.,\nNepigon, Ont.\n\nThe Secretary Dept. of Ind.-Affs.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 25, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department agrees with you that it would be useless to reopen the Pic school until there is some prospect of the Indians remaining permanently upon the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM.

Sir,\n\nThe Indians of the Pic Reserve have requested that their school be re-opened. You will recollect that correspondence was had with Rev. Father Lamarche in regard to this matter last year when it was decided that the number of Indian children permanently located on this reserve would not warrant the engagement of a teacher. It is now represented that in the summer there would be at least twenty children that might attend and in the winter at least eight or nine. This being the case it is considered that the school should be re-opened and a teacher engaged. The Department will provide a salary for a teacher. I shall be glad to hear from you in reference to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. L. Dugas,\nNepigon, Ont.\nSept. 28th 1911\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter August 21st No. 15-38711 I beg to say that I do not think that the Pic Indians will stay on their Reserve long enough to encourage a school teacher to stay at that place. They have been away all summer pretty near and I don't think that they will be there in the winter. In the case they would stay there Mr. Michel Vincent would be willing to teach the children if the Dept. wants him to do so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.M. Rogers, Esq.\nOttawa, September 25, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department would like to have some information as to the qualifications of Mrs. Michel Wissian, who you state would be willing to teach the Pic School during the winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Brown\nPort Arthur,\nOnt.\n\nDear Mr. Brown,\n\nI was speaking to Father Belanger yesterday evening as he passed on No. 4, and he asked me when I was leaving that Chief Michano had informed you to that effect. I did tell the chief that I would leave if he did not get me wood. He said if he told you when he wrote that he refused to bring wood to the school I told him that thinking he would think enough of his school to bring me wood, and as for leaving which I intend doing so I will inform you, not an Indian.\n\nI have done my best for them that they may continue\ntheir school as Mr. Beggs and the agent may tell you. Only last week Mr. Beggs warned them that if they did not help more towards their school it would be taken from them like Robert, but nothing seems to have effect on them. I have almost begged of them to bring wood as you know we could not stay in school these cold days.\n\nIf you know of any other vacancy will you kindly inform me for if they don't want a school I have to earn my living and teach, if you can do anything towards having them get wood.\n\nYou will greatly oblige.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCelina Scottie.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose a letter from Miss Botts, teacher at the Rio Puer school. I would recommend that this school be closed at end of the term or before if there is another vacancy for the teacher.\n\nThe Indians there apparently take no interest in the school. Ordered the Chief to see that the work was handled. He claims that the only horse on the Reserve was sick. The fact of the matter is that the horse was neglected and the manure was left under him until it was impossible to back him out of the stable.\n\nThis band asked to be supplied with a team of horses this spring but I told the Chief that there should be enough wealth in the Band to buy a team of horses if they really needed one.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.R. Brown\nAgent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nArrow Bay  \nMay 18/18\n\nW.C. Brown Esq.  \nPort Arthur Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThere is no school here for about one month now because the teacher has not got any wood for the school. There have been five pupils here all this time but can not go to school because there is no wood. The chief is away just now and he was the one to look after everything. I do not want to do anything before he comes back. But if you tell me to save enough to keep the school going until he comes back let me know if I will do this.\n\nYours Truly  \nPhilip [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.
